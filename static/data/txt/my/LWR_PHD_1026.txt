Wellbore stability analysis based on a new true-triaxial failure criterion 

 

Abstract 
 
A  main  aspect  of  wellbore  stability  analysis  is  the  selection  of  an  appropriate  rock  failure 
criterion. The most commonly used criterion for brittle failure of rocks is the Mohr-Coulomb 
criterion. This criterion involves only the maximum and minimum principal stresses, σ1 and 
σ3, and therefore assumes that the intermediate stress σ2 has no influence on rock strength. 
When  the  Mohr-Coulomb  criterion  had  been  developed,  it  was  justified  by  experimental 
evidence from conventional triaxial tests (σ1 > σ2 = σ3). Based on triaxial failure mechanics, 
the  Mohr-Coulomb  criterion  has  been  extensively  used  to  represent  rock  failure  under  the 
polyaxial stress state (σ1 > σ2 > σ3).  

In  contrast  to  the  predictions  of  Mohr-Coulomb  criterion,  much  evidence  has  been 
accumulating to suggest that σ2 does indeed have a strengthening effect. In this research, I 
have shown that Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion only represents the triaxial stress state (σ2 = 
σ3  or σ2  = σ1),  which  is  a  special  case  that  will  only  occasionally  be  encountered  in  situ. 
Accordingly, I then developed a new true-triaxial failure criterion called the Mogi-Coulomb 
criterion.  This  failure  criterion  is  a  linear  failure  envelope  in  the  Mogi  domain  (τoct-σm,2 
space)  which  can  be  directly  related  to  the  Coulomb  strength  parameters,  cohesion  and 
friction angle. This linear failure criterion has been justified by experimental evidence from 
triaxial  tests  as  well  as  polyaxial  tests.  It  is  a  natural  extension  of  the  classical  Coulomb 
criterion into three dimensions. 

As the Mohr-Coulomb criterion only represents rock failure under triaxial stress states, it is 
expected to be too conservative in predicting wellbore instability. To overcome this problem, 
I have developed a new 3D analytical model to estimate the mud pressure required to avoid 
shear failure at the wall of vertical, horizontal and deviated boreholes. This has been achieved 
by  using  linear  elasticity  theory  to  calculate  the  stresses,  and  the  fully-polyaxial  Mogi-
Coulomb  criterion  to  predict  failure.  The  solution  is  achieved  in  closed-form  for  vertical 
wellbores,  for  all  stress  regimes.  For  deviated  or  horizontal  wellbores,  Mathcad  programs 
have been written to evaluate the solution. These solutions have been applied to several field 
cases available in the literature, and the new model in each case seems to be consistent with 
the field experience. 

Keywords: failure criteria, Mogi failure criterion, intermediate principal stress, polyaxial test 
data, wellbore stability.

Introduction

 

1 Introduction 

Oil  fields  are  usually  drained  from  several  platforms  that  extensively  influence  the 
development costs. The required number of platforms can be reduced by using non-vertical 
production  wells.  The  deviated  and  horizontal  wells  will  enlarge  the  drainage  area  from  a 
single point. This will increase the productivity, and may subsequently decrease the number 
of  planned  platforms.  In  some  cases,  deviated  boreholes  are  drilled  to  reach  a  substantial 
distance horizontally away from the drilling location (i.e., extended reach drilling). This is 
mainly used to access many parts of the reservoir from one location, which will also reduce 
the required number of platforms. Moreover, deviated boreholes are some times essential to 
reach  locations  that  are  not  accessible  through  vertical  boreholes.  However,  drilling  non-
vertical  boreholes  brings  out  new  problems,  such  as  cuttings  transport,  casing  setting  and 
cementing,  and  drill  string  friction.  An  increased  borehole  angle  will  also  increase  the 
potential  for  borehole  instability  during  drilling.  Therefore,  a  substantial  savings  in 
expenditure can be achieved if non-vertical wells can be drilled, while avoiding instability 
problems during drilling. 

Nevertheless,  drilling  vertical  boreholes  will  not  guarantee  the  stability  of  the  well.  In  all 
areas  of  the  world,  borehole  instability  causes  substantial  problems,  even  in  vertical 
boreholes.  For  instance,  in  the  Wanaea  field  of  the  Australian  Northwest  Shelf,  the 
development  plan  proposed  deviated  and  horizontal  wells  to  minimize  stability  problems 
(Kingsborough et al., 1991).  

Wellbore stability is dominated by the in situ stress system. When a well is drilled, the rock 
surrounding the hole must take the load that was previously taken by the removed rock. As a 
result, the in situ stresses are significantly modified near the borehole wall. This is presented 
by  a  production  of  an  increase  in  stress  around  the  wall  of  the  hole,  that  is,  a  stress 
concentration.  The  stress  concentration  can  lead  to  rock  failure  of  the  borehole  wall, 
depending up on the existing rock strength. The basic problem is to know, and to be able to 
predict, the reaction of the rock to the altered mechanical loading. This is a classical, though 
not very easy, rock mechanics problem.  

In  order  to  avoid  borehole  failure,  drilling  engineers  should  adjust  the  stress  concentration 
properly through altering the applied internal wellbore pressure (i.e., mud pressure) and the 
orientation  of  the  borehole  with  respect  to  the  in  situ  stresses.  In  general,  the  possible 
alteration  of  the  borehole  orientation  is  limited.  It  is  therefore  obvious  that  wellbore 
instability could be prevented by mainly adjusting the mud pressure. Traditionally, the mud 
pressure  is  designed  to  inhibit  flow  of  the  pore  fluid  into  the  well,  regardless  of  the  rock 
strength  and  the  field  stresses.  In  practice,  the  minimum  safe  overbalance  pressure  (well 
pressure − pore pressure) of typically 100-200 psi, or a mud density of 0.3 to 0.5 lb/gal over 
the  formation  pore  pressure,  is  maintained  (e.g.,  French  and  McLean,  1992;  Awal  et  al., 
2001).  This  may  represent  no  problem  in  competent  rocks,  but  could  result  in  mechanical 
instability in weak rocks. In general, the mud pressure required to support the borehole wall

is greater than that required to balance and contain fluids, due to the in situ stresses which are 
greater than the formation pressure. 

Stress-induced borehole failures can be grouped into the following three classes, as shown in 
Figure 1.1: 

•  Hole enlargement or collapse due to brittle rock failure of the wall. Symptoms of this 
log 
condition  are  poor  cementing,  difficulties  with 
interpretation, and poor directional control. Poor cementing of the casing could lead to 
problems  for  perforating,  sand  control,  production  and  stimulation.  Furthermore, 
when the hole starts to collapse, small pieces of the formation may settle around the 
drill string and pack off the annulus (i.e., hole pack-off), while medium to large pieces 
fall into the borehole and might jam the drill string (i.e., hole bridging). These may 
prevent  pulling  the  string  out  of  the  hole  (i.e.,  stuck  pipe),  and  so  the  planned 
operations are suspended. Stuck pipe problems due to borehole collapse is illustrated 
in Figure 1.2. 

logging  response  and 

•  Hole size reduction due to ductile rock failure presented by the plastic flow of rock 
into the borehole. This usually occurs in very weak shale, sandstone, salt and some 
chalk formations. Symptoms of this condition are repeated requirements of reaming 
and may result in stuck pipe. 

•  Tensile  splitting  of  the  rock  from  excessive  wellbore  pressures  (i.e.,  hydraulic 
fracturing). Severe loss of drilling fluid to the formation from fracturing often causes 
well control problems. The lost circulation will reduce the applied mud pressure and 
may result in inflow of pore fluid. The formation fluid will flow from high pressure 
zone  (kick  zone)  to  a  lower  pressured  zone  (loss  zone),  which  is  known  as  under 
ground blowouts 

Unplanned  operations  due  to  stress  induced  borehole  failure  resulting  in  loss  of  time  and 
occasionally equipment account for at least 10% of drilling costs (Ewy et al., 1994; Santarelli 
et al., 1996; Aadnoy and Ong, 2003). For instance, Charlez and Onaisi (1998) presented two 
examples of stuck pipes due to wellbore instability in the Dunbar field (northern part of the 
North Sea). In both examples sidetracking of the well was essential and the cost was in the 
range of $2M for each case. 

1.1  Other parameters affects borehole stability 
We have highlighted that borehole instability is governed by in situ stresses, pore pressure 
and rock strength. In addition to these dominant parameters, borehole stability may directly 
or  indirectly  be  influenced  by  the  following  parameters  or  effects:  (a)  mud  chemistry,  (b) 
temperature effects and (c) time-dependent effects. 

Most of the overburden consists of shaly formations. In highly reactive shale sections, mud 
chemistry is of extreme importance in addition to the mechanical aspects of instability. The 
mud composition changes as shales slough and disperse into the mud column, or by chemical 
interactions between the minerals in the formation and the mud. This indeed will alter the 
mud properties and rheology. Therefore, chemical additives are typically introduced in the 
mud according to the minerals in the formations. In highly reactive shales, oil-based mud is 
preferred as it is more inhibitive than water based mud. However, the disposal of oil-based

Temperature  changes  associated  with  mud  circulation  during  drilling  may  alter  the  rock 
properties (Fjaer et al., 1992, p. 254). The change in rock properties may reduce or enhance 
borehole  failure  depending  on  the  thermal  effect.  Maury  and  Sauzay  (1987)  reported  that 
temperature fluctuations may also influence the stress distribution around the borehole. As 
the  temperature  increases,  the  tangential  and  vertical  stresses  will  increase.  However, 
temperature fluctuations will not influence the stress anisotropy around the borehole as the 
thermal effect should alter the tangential and vertical stresses by an equal amount (Zhou et 
al., 1996). 

Reactive  shale  instability  is  also  time-dependent,  and  is  governed  by  two  intrinsic 
mechanisms: (a) consolidation and (b) creep. Consolidation is due to pore pressure gradients 
induced by fluid communication between the mud and pore fluid. Creep is described by a 
change of strain at a constant effective stress level. Both of these mechanisms will result in 
hole size reduction. In practice, it is difficult to distinguish between creep and consolidation 
effects.  In  general,  consolidation  will  occur  shortly  after  loading,  while  creep  will  govern 
later  deformation  (Fjaer  et  al.,  1992,  p.  253).  The  mud  pressure  and  properties,  and  the 
temperature in the rock may vary during drilling operations, which in turn enhance borehole 
instability. All these parameters make it more difficult to directly pursue the time-dependent 
effects.  The  best  approach  is  to  quickly  isolate  the  rock  with  a  casing  to  minimize  the 
potential borehole instability. 

1.2  Motivation for studying wellbore stability analysis 
Wellbore stability problems in exploration and production drilling cost the drilling industry 
certainly more than $100 million per year worldwide, and may approach one billion dollars 
annually.  “Despite  tremendous  efforts  pursued  over  the  past  years,  wellbore  stability 
problems continue to be experienced by the drilling communities. The practical consequences 
of  wellbore  instability  are  often  the  collapse  of  borehole  wall”  (Aadnoy  and  Ong,  2003). 
Borehole collapse could be predicted by adopting compressive failure analysis in conjunction 
with  a  constitutive  model  for  the  stresses  around  the  borehole.  The  selection  of  a  failure 
criterion for wellbore stability analysis is difficult and confusing (see, for example, McLean 
and Addis, 1990a). It is unclear to drilling engineers as which failure criterion should be used 
in the wellbore stability analysis. 

“Preferably a failure criterion should be based upon knowledge of the failure mechanism, but 
this is not always so. In fact, many failure hypotheses have been propounded as a result of 
theoretical reasoning only and could not be verified by experimental evidence” (Bieniawski, 
1967).  The  most  commonly  used  failure  criteria  in  wellbore  stability  analysis  are  Mohr-
Coulomb  criterion  and  Drucker-Prager  criterion.  These  failure  criteria  are  based  on  quite 
different failure hypotheses. The Drucker-Prager criterion considers the influence of all three 
principal  stresses  on  failure,  while  the  Mohr-Coulomb  criterion  implicitly  ignores  the 
influence of the intermediate principal stress on failure. Despite this difference, both of these 
failure criteria have been verified experimentally to be good in modelling rock failure, based 
on  conventional  triaxial  tests  (σ1  >  σ2  = σ3).  On  the  other  hand,  in  practice,  the  Mohr-
Coulomb  criterion  has  been  reported  to  be  very  conservative  in  predicting  wellbore 
instability, while the Drucker-Prager criterion has been found to be overly optimistic about 
wellbore stability.  

In  the  field,  the  wellbore  is  normally  under  a  polyaxial  stress  state  (σ1  >σ2  > σ3),  and  the 
conventional triaxial stress state is a special case that may only occasionally be encountered 
in  situ.  Neither  the  Mohr-Coulomb  criterion  nor  the  Drucker-Prager  criterion  are  based  on

Introduction

 

polyaxial failure mechanics. Actually, these failure criteria have been developed prior to the 
construction of the first apparatus that enabled true-triaxial tests. Hence, it is not surprising 
that these failure criteria are not very good in modelling borehole failure. 

This research will study the basic fundamentals of stress and rock failure mechanics. In this 
work, we will examine if the failure criteria can really be verified experimentally, based on 
polyaxial test data rather than triaxial test data, which is more appropriate to field scenarios. 
The main objectives of the research are to choose and, if necessary, develop the most suitable 
failure criterion in representing polyaxial failure mechanics. This true-triaxial failure criterion 
will be then utilized to develop a new three-dimensional stability model to prevent vertical, 
horizontal and deviated borehole failure. The subject of borehole failure is quite complex and 
confusing. For simplicity, therefore, we will only consider the mechanical instability of the 
wellbore in this research. The ultimate objective of the research is to improve borehole failure 
predictions,  in  order  to  minimize  wellbore  stability  problems  experienced  by  the  drilling 
communities.

Basic theory of stress

 

2 Basic theory of stress 

The  concept  of  stress  and  its  analysis  in  a  generally  loaded  solid  is  not  trivial,  yet  it  is 
thoroughly fundamental for all work on rock mechanics. Stress inside a body will in general 
be non-uniformly distributed. It is not just a single value (i.e., a scalar), but a tensor quantity 
which has six independent components that will act and be sustained at any point inside the 
body.  The  evaluation  of  stress  components  is  a  matter  of  pure  statics.  These  and  other 
relevant concepts are elaborate in the following sections. 

2.1   Stress at a point 
If a body is uniformly loaded, stress can be thought of simply as force divided by the area of 
application. For instance, if a cylindrical homogenous solid having cross-sectional area A is 
compressed  vertically  by  a  uniformly  distributed  force  F  as  shown  in  Figure  2.1(a),  the 
vertical stress σ acting on and inside the cylinder is defined as  

σ=

                                                                     (2.1) 

In rock mechanics, stress is frequently measured in N/m2, that is, Pa (Pascals). Other units 
encountered include psi = 6.895 kPa, kg/cm2 = 98.1 kPa, and bar = 100 kPa. Furthermore, 
positive stresses are considered to be compressive and negative stresses are considered to be 
tensile. This is opposite to the sign convention used in other sciences involving elasticity.

Figure 2.1. Definition of stress. 

The stress is always associated with a particular cutting plane. To illustrate this, consider the 
cross section A′ in Figure 2.1(b). Here the area A′ is greater than A, and the force is no longer 
normal  to  the  cross  section.  The  force  can  be  decomposed  into  one  component  Fn  that  is

is called the shear stress.  

Therefore, the area of the cross section and its orientation relative to the force are important 
to define the state of stress. In addition, there are two types of stresses that may act along a 
surface, and the magnitude of each depends on the orientation of the surface.

In order to mathematically define the stress at a point, divide the cross sectional area A′ into 
an infinite number of subsections ΔA′, through which an infinitely small part ΔF of the total 
force F is acting (Figure 2.3). The force ΔF is decomposed into a normal component ΔFn and 
a shear component ΔFs. These forces will vary according to the orientation of ΔA′.

This mathematical definition of the stress components is applied to indicate that stress is a 
point property. 

To give a complete description of stress state at a point, it is necessary to identify the stresses 
related to surfaces oriented in three orthogonal directions, that is, faces of infinitesimal cube. 
Each face of this cube has a normal stress and shear stress acting on it. Consider a surface 
normal  to  the  x  direction  (i.e.,  x-plane).  The  normal  stress  is  designated  by  σx,  where 
subscript x shows that the normal component acts on the x-plane. The shear stress may act in 
any  direction  in  its  plane  and  therefore  needs  to  be  further  resolved  into  two  planar 
components,  as  illustrated  in  Figure  2.4.  The  shear  stresses  are  designated  by τxy  and τxz 
where  the  first  subscript  denotes  the  plane  that  the  stress  acts  on,  and  second  subscript 
denotes the direction along which it acts.

Similarly, the stresses related to a surface normal to the y-axis are denoted σy, τyx and τyz, 
while stresses related to a surface normal to the z-axis are denoted σz, τzx and τzy (see Figure 
2.5).  Thus,  there  are  all  together  nine  stress  components  at  any  point,  which  can  be 
represented by the stress tensor:

Bearing in mind that the body is assumed at rest, there is equilibrium of forces and moments 
at all points throughout the body. Consider a small square of the x-y plane with stresses acting 
on it, as shown in Figure 2.6. While the forces associated with the normal stress components 
are clearly in equilibrium, no net rotational moment requires that

2.2   Stress analysis in two dimensions 
Consider the normal (σ) and shear (τ) stresses at an oblique plane in the infinitesimal square 
element as given in Figure 2.6. The normal of the cutting plane is oriented θ degrees from the 
x-direction, as shown in Figure 2.7. The triangle on the figure is in equilibrium, so that no net 
forces act on it. Equilibrium of forces implies that (Fjaer et al., 1992, p. 8):

These  equations  show  that  if  three  stress  components  acting  on  two  orthogonal  planes  are 
known,  the  normal  and  shear  stress  components  on  any  given  oblique  plane  can  be 
determined.

where θ is the orientation of that plane. Eq. (2.12) will give two solutions (i.e., θ1 and θ2) 
corresponding to two directions for which the shear stress τ vanishes. These two directions 
are  called  the  principle  axes  of  stress  and  the  associated  planes  are  known  as  principal 
planes.  The  normal  stresses  associated  with  these  directions,  σ1  and  σ2,  are  called  the 
principal stresses, and are found by introducing θ1 and θ2, respectively, into Eq. (2.10), this 
results in (Brady and Brown, 1999, p. 29):

The Arabic subscript notation is used to make the convention that σ1 > σ 2. Therefore, in two-
dimensional stress analysis, the maximum normal stress (σ1) exists in the direction θ1 and the 
minimum normal stress presents in the direction θ2, where the shear stresses are zero. The 
principle axes are always orthogonal to each other. 

If the co-ordinate system is oriented so that the x-axis is parallel to the maximum principle 
stress  and  the  y-axis  to  the  other  principle  stress,  then  the  stresses σ  and τ  in  a  general 
direction θ relative to the x-axis become:

By  plotting  the  corresponding  values  of σ  and τ  in  a  diagram,  a  circle  is  obtained  with  a 
radius of (σ1–σ2)/2 and center located on the σ-axis at (σ1+σ2)/2 (Figure 2.8a; Jaeger and 
Cook, 1979, p. 15). This circle is called Mohr’s circle. A point on the Mohr’s circle gives the 
magnitude  of  the  normal  and  shear  stresses  for  any  plane  oriented  at  an  angle θ  from  the 
direction of the major principle stress σ1 (Figure 2.8b).  

It is seen from Figure 2.8a that the largest value for the shear stress is (σ1–σ2)/2, and occurs 
for θ = 45° and θ = 3π/4 = 135°. A special case arises if σ1= –σ2 and the centre of the Mohr’s 
circle is located at the origin of the σ−τ co-ordinate system. In this case the maximum shear 
plane is free of normal stresses and this state of stress is known as pure shear; this condition 
provides the basis for some of the failure criteria used in metal plasticity. In general, Mohr’s 
circle is a very useful tool in the analysis of conditions for the rock failure, as will be seen in 
Chapter 4.

2.3  Stress analysis in three dimensions  
The two-dimensional analysis considers the equilibrium only in two directions, say the x and 
y directions, and thus three independent stress components (i.e., σx, σy and τxy) are required to 
specify the state of stress at a point. The general analysis is three-dimensional and involves 
six  independent  stress  components  (i.e.,  three  normal  stresses  and  three  shear  stresses)  in 
order to describe the state of stress at a point, as discussed previously. The actual values of 
these  components  depend  on  the  orientation  of  the  infinitesimal  cube.  Thus,  the  directions 
where  the  normal  stress  components  have  maximum  and  minimum  values  should  be 
considered. This takes place when the shear stress components on all the faces of the cube 
vanish. These directions, therefore, are principle stress axes, and the stress tensor at the point 
will have the following simple form:

where σ1 is the maximum principal stress, σ2 is the intermediate principle stress, and σ3 is the 
minimum principle stress (i.e., σ1 ≥ σ2 ≥ σ3). As a result, there are three principle stresses and 
their orientations that must be determined in order that the state of stress at a point is defined. 

In  three-dimensional  analysis,  a  direction  in  space  is  identified  by  the  direction  cosines 
(Figure 2.9):

where αx, αy and αz are the angles between the chosen direction and the x-, y- and z-axes, 
respectively. The vector λ = (λx,λy,λz) is a unit vector in the chosen direction, and so

The  principle  stresses  can  be  found  by  solving  the  following  determinant  equation  for σp

The  three  solutions  of  this  equation  are  the  principal  stresses  σ1,  σ2  and  σ3  (i.e.,  the

defined regardless of the choice of the co-ordinate axes. 

The direction cosines λ1x, λ1y and λ1z identifying the principle axis corresponding to σ1 are

Consequently, Eqs. (2.21-2.25) provide the principal stresses and their orientations at a point, 
which is adequate to specify the state of stress in three dimensions. If the co-ordinate system 
is oriented so that the x-axis is parallel to the first principal axis, the y-axis parallel to the 
second and the z-axis parallel to the third, the stress tensor will take the form presented in Eq. 

14 

Basic theory of stress

 

(2.17). Relative to this set of co-ordinate axes, the stresses σ and τ in a general direction λ1, 
λ2 and λ3 are determined by (Fjaer et al., 1992, p. 12):

Eq. (2.26) can then be utilized to construct the Mohr’s circle in three dimensions. Consider 
the  plane  in  the  cube  in  Figure  2.10a.  For  this  plane λ3  =  0,  and  so  the  normal  and  shear 
components (σ and τ) on the plane are not affected by σ3, but by σ1 and σ2, and σ and τ are 
located on the circle spanning from σ2 to σ1 as shown in Figure 2.10b (i.e., σ1–σ2 Mohr’s 
circle). If the plane was perpendicular to σ1, that is, λ1 = 0, then the relationship between σ 
and τ can be plotted on the σ2 –σ3  Mohr’s circle. Similarly, if λ2 = 0, σ and τ are located on 
the σ1–σ3 Mohr’s circle. For all other directions, the stress conditions lie in the shaded region 
between the circles in Figure 2.10b.

octahedral  normal  stress  (σoct)  and  the  octahedral  shear  stress  (τoct).  By  substituting  Eq.

2.3.2  Deviatoric stress 
The octahedral normal stress (σoct) defined in Eq. (2.28) is apparently the mean normal stress 
(σm)  which  remains  unaltered  during  any  change  of  co-ordinate  axes,  that  is,  the  invariant 
I1/3.  The  mean  normal  stress  is  also  known  as  the  spherical  or  hydrostatic  stress.  It 
essentially  causes  uniform  compression  or  dilatation.  In  contrast,  distortion  is  essentially 
determined  by  the  so-called  deviatoric  stress  (stress  deviator  or  stress  deviation).  The 
deviatoric  stress  (s)  estimates  the  deviation  of  stress  from  the  mean  normal  stress  by 
subtracting σm from the normal stress components:

The principal axes of the deviatoric stress will be the same as those of stress. The deviatoric 
principle  stresses  (s1,s2,s3)  can  be  established  from  the  principle  stresses  and  the  spherical 
stress, and is given by

Many failure criteria are concerned with distortion. As these criteria must be independent of 
the  choice  of  co-ordinate  axes,  the  invariants  of  the  deviatoric  stress  will  be  involved  in 
failure criteria. These will be denoted by J1, J2, and J3 and are found to be (Jaeger and Cook,

Stresses around boreholes

 

3 Stresses around boreholes 

Underground formations are subjected to a vertical compressive stress caused by the weight 
of the overlying strata, and horizontal stresses due to the confining lateral restraints. Under 
the action of these in situ stresses, prior to drilling a borehole, the rock mass is in a state of 
equilibrium  that  will  be  destroyed  by  the  excavation.  When  a  borehole  is  drilled,  the  load 
carried by the removed rock is then taken by the adjacent rock to re-establish equilibrium. As 
a  result,  a  stress  concentration  is  produced  around  the  well,  and  so  the  in  situ  stresses  are 
modified. If there is no support pressure introduced into the borehole, failure in the formation 
may  take  place.  Therefore,  maintaining  equilibrium  in  the  field  to  prevent  rock  failure 
requires the use of a support pressure which is usually provided by a pressurized fluid called 
“mud”. 

To assess the potential mechanical instability of a borehole, a constitutive model is needed in 
order  to  know  the  magnitude  of  the  stresses  around  a  borehole.  The  literature  is  rich  with 
such constitutive models. Westergaard (1940) published one of the early works contributing 
to the knowledge of stress distribution around a borehole, in which an elasto-plastic model 
was developed. After that, many works using elasto-plastic models have been published (e.g., 
Gnirk, 1972; Risnes and Bratli, 1981; Mitchell et al., 1987; Anthony and Crook, 2002). On 
the other hand, there have been other efforts to develop a linear elastic  constitutive  model 
(e.g., Paslay and Cheatham, 1963; Fairhurst, 1965b; Bradley, 1979; Aadnoy, 1989b). Out of 
the numerous published models, linear elastic analysis may be the most common approach. 
This is due to its requirement of fewer input parameters comparing to other more intricate 
models.  

For instance, Risnes and Bratli (1981), and McLean and Addis (1990a) recommended the use 
of  elasto-plastic  model  in  wellbore  stability  analysis.  Some  of  those  authors,  however,  in 
other  publications  (McLean  and  Addis,  1990b;  Svennekjaer  and  Bratli,  1998),  applied  a 
linear elastic model to carry out the stability analysis for field cases. In practice, the required 
input data for sophisticated models are rarely available (e.g., Maury and Sauzay, 1987; Fuh et 
al., 1988; Fleming et al., 1990; Woodland, 1990; Garrouch and Ebrahim, 2001).  

Consideration of anisotropic elastic behaviour will further complicate the stability analysis, 
and many more input parameters will be required. Moreover, the critical mud pressures are 
not  significantly  affected  by  elastic  anisotropy  for  commonly  encountered  oilfield  rocks 
(Aadnoy,  1988;  Aadnoy,  1989a;  Chen  et  al.,  1996;  Tan  et  al.,  1999;  Chen  et  al.,  2002). 
Therefore,  for  wellbore  stability  analysis,  we  assume  that  rocks  obey  isotropic  elastic 
behaviour.  In  this  chapter,  an  isotropic  linear  elastic  constitutive  model  is  described.  The 
model consists of a three dimensional analyses of stress concentration around an arbitrarily 
oriented borehole, due to anisotropic in situ stress combined with internal wellbore pressure.

3.1  Stresses in cylindrical co-ordinates 
A cylindrical co-ordinate system is the most convenient system for studying the state of stress 
around boreholes. Cartesian (x,y,z) and cylindrical (r,θ,z) co-ordinate systems are shown in 
Figure 3.1. The co-ordinate transformation between Cartesian and cylindrical co-ordinates is 
defined by the following equations:

where σr is called the radial stress, σθ the tangential stress, and σz the axial stress. Note that 
the same designation σ is used for all the stress components. This notation will be adopted in 
this chapter and the following ones. These stresses can be related to the Cartesian co-ordinate 
stresses by the aid of stress transformation equation, that have the general form (Harrison and

that is, in the (x′,y′,z′) co-ordinate system, and are required in the (x,y,z) co-ordinate system 
that  is  inclined  with  respect  to  the  first.  The  transformation  from  (x′,y′,z′)  to  (x,y,z)  is

described  by  the  direction  cosines  (λxx′,λxy′,λxz′),  etc.  The  term  λxx′,  for  instance,  is  the 
direction cosine of the angle between the x-axis and x′-axis.  

The first matrix on the right-hand side of the equation is called the rotation matrix, and the 
last matrix is its transpose. The transformation from (x′,y′,z′) to (r,θ,z) can be obtained by a 
rotation θ around the z′-axis, as shown in Figure 3.1. The corresponding rotation matrix is

Proceeding with the matrix multiplication on the right hand side of the stress transformation 
equation, using the above rotation matrix, and replacing the matrix on the left-hand side by 
Eq.  (3.3),  produces  the  following  formulae  for  the  stress  components  in  cylindrical  co-

3.2  Stresses around deviated boreholes 
In this section, the stresses around a deviated borehole with anisotropic horizontal stresses are 
described. Assume that the in situ principal stresses are vertical stress σv, major horizontal 
stress σH, and minor horizontal stress σh. These stresses are associated with the co-ordinate 
system (x′,y′,z′), as illustrated in Figure 3.2a. The z′-axis is parallel to σv, x′-axis is parallel to 
σH, and y′-axis is parallel to σh.  

These virgin formation stresses should be transformed to another co-ordinate system (x,y,z), 
to conveniently determine the stress distribution around a borehole. Figure 3.2b shows the 
(x,y,z)  co-ordinate  system,  where  the  z-axis  is  parallel  to  the  borehole  axis,  the  x-axis  is 
parallel to the lowermost radial direction of the borehole, and the y-axis is horizontal. This 
transformation can be obtained by a rotation α around the z′-axis, and then a rotation i around 
the y′-axis (Figure 3.3).

the above equation. The complete stress solutions, in cylindrical co-ordinate system, around 
an arbitrarily oriented wellbore are (Hiramatsu and Oka, 1968; Fairhurst, 1968):

where  “a”  is  the  radius  of  the  wellbore,  Pw  is  the  internal  wellbore  pressure,  and ν  is  a 
material constant called Poisson’s ratio. The angle θ is measured clockwise from the x-axis, 
as shown in Figure 3.3.  

Eq. (3.13) is derived under the assumption that there is no displacement along the z-axis, that 
is,  a  plain  strain  condition,  in  order  to  estimate σr, σθ, σz  and σrθ.  The  longitudinal  shear 
stresses, σθz and σrz, however, are determined assuming that all plane sections normal to the 
z-axis  undergo  the  same  deformations  as  a  result  of  longitudinal  shears.  The  equations  for 
stresses around a circular opening were first published by Kirsch (1898), where the opening 
is  assumed  to  be  parallel  to  a  principle  stress  axis  (Charlez,  1991,  p.  87).  The  stress  field 
around a circular opening in any direction was first presented by Hiramatsu and Oka (1968) 
and Fairhurst (1968).    

3.3  Stresses at borehole wall in anisotropic stress field 
In  a  linear  elastic  material,  the  largest  stress  concentration  occurs  at  the  borehole  wall. 
Therefore,  borehole  failure  is  expected  to  initiate  there.  For  wellbore  instability  analysis, 
consequently, stresses at the borehole wall are the ones that should be compared against a 
failure criterion. These stresses are determined for deviated, vertical and horizontal wellbores 
in the following sections.

which are identical to those given by the Kirsch solution (see Obert and Duvall, 1967, p. 99; 
Charlez, 1997, p. 64, for example). 

3.4  Stress variation 
According to the equations obtained in the previous section, tangential stress (σθ) and axial 
stress (σz) are functions of the angle θ. This angle indicates the orientation of the tangential 
stress  around  the  wellbore  circumference,  varies  from  0  to  360  degrees.  Consequently,  the 
tangential and axial stresses will vary sinusoidally.  

Consider  a  typical  wellbore  in  a  reservoir  which  has  wellbore  pressure  Pw  =  5000  psi, 
Poisson’s ratio ν = 0.25, and in situ stresses of σv = 12,000 psi, σH = 10,000 psi and σh = 
9,000 psi. For a vertical wellbore, both tangential and axial stresses reach a maximum value 
(i.e., σθmax = 16,000 psi and σzmax = 12,500 psi) at θ = ±π/2, and the minimum value (i.e., 
σθmin = 12,000 psi and σzmin= 11,500 psi) at θ = 0 or π, as shown in Figures 3.4 and 3.5. These 
critical positions remain the same for any values of the in situ stresses (i.e., σv, σH  and σh). 
Furthermore, if the horizontal stresses are equal, then σθ and σz are constant and independent 
of the angle θ.  

Similarly, for a horizontal wellbore, the critical positions of σθ and σz are θ  = ±π/2 and θ = 0 
or π. The largest or smallest values of σθ (or eventually σz) will occur at either of these two 
positions, depending up on the values of the in situ stresses. If σH  > σh > σv, for instance, the 
largest  and  smallest  σθ  occur  at  θ  =  0  or  π  and  θ  =  ±π/2,  respectively.  For  a  deviated 
borehole,  however,  there  is  no  particular  a  priori  angle  at  which  σθ  and  σz  reach  the 
maximum or minimum value. This results in complicating the borehole stability analysis for 
non-vertical boreholes, which will be discussed in subsequent chapters.

Rock failure criteria

 

4 Rock failure criteria 

The  rock  mechanics  literature  is  rich  with  a  number  of  failure  criteria  that  have  been 
developed. Among these criteria, Mohr-Coulomb criterion is much referred to and used in 
practice. This criterion involves only the maximum and minimum principal stresses, σ1 and 
σ3.  It  implicitly  assumes  that  σ2  has  no  influence  on  rock  strength.  In  general,  the 
independence  of  rock  failure  on σ2  is  a  common  assumption  in  failure  criteria  (Pan  and 
Hudson, 1988; Aubertin et al., 2000; Yu et al., 2002). The situation in which σ2 = σ3 is a 
special case that may be encountered in situ (Haimson, 1978; McGarr and Gay, 1978). For a 
polyaxial stress state, in which σ2 > σ3, the intermediate principal stress has a pronounced 
effect.  In  contrast  to  the  prediction  of  Mohr-Coulomb  criterion,  experimental  work  by 
Murrell (1963), Handin et al. (1967), Hoskins (1969), Mogi (1967; 1971b), Michelis (1985; 
1987a), Reik and Zacas (1978), Wawersik et al. (1997), Tiwari and Rao (2004), Haimson and 
Chang (2000; 2002; 2005), and others, has demonstrated that rock strength is higher when σ2 
> σ3.  

Numerous researchers have faced situations in which the Mohr-Coulomb criterion was found 
deficient.  Vernik  and  Zoback  (1992),  for  instance,  found  that  the  use  of  Mohr-Coulomb 
criterion in relating borehole breakout dimensions to the in situ stress conditions in crystalline 
rocks  did  not  provide  realistic  results.  Therefore,  they  recommended  the  use  of  a  failure 
criterion that accounts for the influence of σ2 on rock strength, to represent rock conditions 
more  realistically.  Song  and  Haimson  (1997)  conducted  laboratory  tests  of  borehole 
breakouts  in  Westerly  granite  and  Berea  sandstone,  and  compared  the  observed  breakouts 
with different failure criteria. They concluded that Mohr-Coulomb criterion is not applicable 
to the analysis of breakout formation, whereas criteria that include the strengthening effect of 
σ2,  such  as  the  Mogi  criterion,  were  much  more  in  agreement  with  the  experimental 
observations. Single et al. (1998) pointed out that the effect of σ2 is important in underground 
excavation, and so, they suggested a modification for Mohr-Coulomb criterion. Ewy (1998; 
2001) and Kristiansen (2004) concluded that for the purpose of calculating the critical mud 
weight required to maintain wellbore stability, Mohr-Coulomb is too conservative due to the 
ignoring  the  strengthening  effect  of  σ2.  Yi  et  al.  (2005)  reported  that  the  onset  of  sand 
production can not be properly predicted by adopting Mohr-Coulomb criterion. 

There are a number of numerical models that highlight the impact of σ2 on rock strength. For 
example,  Zhou  (1994)  developed  a  numerical  model  to  determine  the  borehole  breakout 
dimensions  based  on  various  rock  failure  criteria.  He  found  that  Mohr-Coulomb  criterion 
tends to predict larger breakouts than those predicted by other criteria that take into account 
the effect of σ2. Recently, Fjaer and Ruistuen (2002) developed a numerical model simulating 
rock failure tests for a granular material. Their simulations showed that σ2 has an impact on 
rock strength that is in agreement with several previously published experimental data.  

In order to consider the impact of σ2 on strength, several 3D rock failure criteria have been 
developed.  For  example,  Wiebols  and  Cook  (1968)  introduced  a  theoretical  model  to 

29 

 

Adel Al-Ajmi                                                                                                          TRITA-LWR PhD Thesis 1026

 

investigate the impact of σ2 on rock strength. They derived a failure criterion by calculating 
the shear strain energy associated with microcracks in the material.  The criterion requires the 
knowledge  of  the  coefficient  of  sliding  friction  between  crack  surfaces,  a  parameter  that 
cannot be determined experimentally. Therefore, numerical methods are required for practical 
use of the criterion. Desai and Salami (1987) introduced a 3D failure criterion that requires 
more  than  six  input  parameters,  and  Michelis  (1987b)  proposed  another criterion in which 
four constants are involved (see Pan and Hudson, 1988; Hudson and Harrison, 1997, p. 112). 
In  general,  the  3D  failure  criteria  are  usually  difficult  in  practice  to  apply,  particularly  for 
wellbore stability problems. In wellbore stability analysis, when the influence of σ2 on rock 
failure characteristics is considered, the Drucker-Prager failure criterion is often implemented 
(Marsden et al., 1989; McLean and Addis, 1990a). This failure criterion, however, has been 
reported  to  overestimate  the  intermediate  principal  stress  effect,  which  may  result  in 
nonsensical  stability  predictions  (McLean  and  Addis,  1990b;  Ewy,  1999).  Moreover,  the 
Drucker-Prager criterion disagrees with the Mogi failure criterion, which considers the effect 
of σ2 based on true triaxial tests (i.e., polyaxial tests). The fundamental difference between 
these two criteria is elaborated upon later in this chapter.  

The  usefulness  of  the  Mogi  failure  criterion  remains  the  subject  of  debate  (Haimson  and 
Chang, 2000; Colmenares and Zoback, 2002). In particular, the power-law form of the Mogi 
criterion  has  been  criticised  because  its  two  parameters  cannot  be  related  to  the  standard 
parameters of the Coulomb failure law, such as the cohesion and the angle of internal friction.  

In this chapter, we first review and define a number of failure criteria that are commonly used 
in rock mechanics. We then examine published data from eight rocks, and show that a linear 
form of the Mogi criterion does a good job of representing polyaxial failure data. After that, 
the possibility of estimating Mogi strength parameters from triaxial test data is examined. In 
addition, we compare the Drucker-Prager criterion with polyaxial test data for a variety of 
lithologies, in order to assess its applicability in representing failure under polyaxial stress 
states.  

4.1  Coulomb criterion 
In 1776, Coulomb introduced the simplest and most important criterion. He suggested that 
rock  failure  in  compression  takes  place  when  the  shear  stress,  τ,  that  is  developed  on  a 
specific plane (plane a-b in Figure 4.1(a), for example) reaches a value that is sufficient to 
overcome the natural cohesion of the rock, as well as the frictional force that opposes motion 
along the failure plane. The criterion can be written as 

 

cτ σ φ
tan ,

= +

n

                                                            (4.1) 

where σn is the normal stress acting on the failure plane (plane a-b in Figure 4.1(a)), c is the 
cohesion  of  the  material  and  φ  is  the  angle  of  internal  friction.  Figure  4.1(b)  shows  the 
strength envelope of shear and normal stresses. As the sign of τ only affects the direction of 
sliding,  Eq.  (4.1)  should  be  written  in  terms  of   |τ|,  but  for  simplicity  we  will  omit  the 
absolute value sign.  

As criteria (4.1) will always first be satisfied on a plane that lies in the direction of σ2, the 
value of σ2 will not influence σn or τ, and so this failure criterion implicitly assumes that σ2 
has no effect on failure. Alternatively, this criterion can be interpreted as being intended to 
apply only to situations in which σ2 = σ3. The Coulomb failure criterion, therefore, can be

represented  by  the  maximum  principal  stress,  σ1,  and  minimum  principal  stress,  σ3.  By

The  true  uniaxial  tensile  strength  takes  values,  T0true,  that  are  generally  lower  than  those 
predicted by Eq. (4.8) (Brady and Brown, 1999). Consequently, a tensile cut-off is usually 
applied at T0true, as shown in Figure 4.3. In practical rock mechanics use, it is prudent to put 
T0true = 0 (Bradley, 1979; Brady and Brown, 1999; Zhao, 2000).

                                                         (4.11) 

From this form of the Coulomb failure criterion, we can conclude that (a) the mean normal 
stress inhibits the creation of a failure plane is σm,2, and (b) there is predicted to be a linear 
relationship between the maximum shear stress and the effective mean stress at failure.

Rock failure criteria

 

4.2  Mohr criterion 
Mohr criterion suggests that at failure the normal and shear stresses across the failure plane 
are related by

)n

,                                                           (4.12) 

where f is some function that assumed to be obtained experimentally. The relation (4.12) will 
be represented by a curve in the τ−σ space, such as AB in Figure 4.4. A linear form of Mohr 
criterion is equivalent to the Coulomb criterion. From the use of σ1–σ3 Mohr’s circle (Figure 
4.4),  the  Mohr  criterion  assumes  that  the  fracture  plane  is  striking  in  the σ2  direction  (see 
section  2.3).  Mohr’s  assumption  can  be  interpreted  as  justifying  the  extension  of  a  two-
dimensional  failure  criterion  into  three  dimensions.  Consequently,  a  linear  failure  criterion 
such as (4.1) is often known as the Mohr-Coulomb criterion.

4.3  Hoek-Brown criterion 
Laboratory results of triaxial tests on rocks often show a curved strength envelope (Hoek and 
Brown, 1980; Hoek, 1983). Various researchers have therefore proposed non-linear criteria, based 
on laboratory investigations (see Sheorey, 1997). The most representative and commonly used one 
is the Hoek-Brown criterion (Bieniawski, 1996; Hoek and Brown, 1997; Sheorey, 1997). This 
criterion  was  originally  developed  for  estimating  the  strength  of  rock  masses  for  application  to 
excavation design. Hoek and Brown (1980) proposed that at failure the relationship between the 
maximum and minimum principal stresses is given by

where m and s are material constants, s takes the value 1 for intact rock, and less than unity 
for disturbed rock (Hoek and Brown, 1997). The values for m are different from rock to rock, 
with a range between about 1.4 and 40.7 (Sheorey, 1997). 

4.4  Drucker-Prager criterion 
The  extended  von  Mises  or  Drucker-Prager  criterion  was  originally  developed  for  soil 
mechanics (Drucker and Prager, 1952). It is expressed in terms of principal stresses as

and k and m are material constants. The material parameters k and m can be estimated from 
the intercept and slope of the failure envelope plotted in the τoct-σoct space. 

4.5  Mogi criterion 
Mogi (1971b) conducted the first extensive polyaxial compressive tests in rocks. He noted 
that  the  intermediate  principal  stress  does  have  an  impact  on  rock  strength,  and  the  brittle 
fracture  occurs  along  a  plane  striking  in  the  σ2  direction.  These  results  agree  with  later 
observations  of  other  researchers  (e.g.,  Spetzler  et  al.,  1981;  Takahashi  and  Koide,  1989; 
Haimson  and  Chang,  2000).  Since  the  fracture  plane  strikes  in  the  σ2  direction,  Mogi 
concluded that the mean normal stress that opposes the creation of the fracture plane is σm,2, 
rather than the octahedral normal stress, σoct. (However, Mogi verified experimentally that 
rock yield, which occurs throughout the entire volume prior to total failure, is a function of 
σoct). Consequently, Mogi suggested a new failure criterion formulated by 

 

τ

                                                          (4.17) 

,2

where  f  is  some  monotonically  increasing  function.  As  the  distortional  strain  energy  is 
proportional to the octahedral shear stress (Jaeger and Cook, 1979, p. 125), this criterion is 
equivalent  to  asserting  that  failure  will  occur  when  the  distortional  strain  energy  reaches 
some critical value that increases monotonically with σm,2. The failure envelope in τoct-σm,2 
space is not in general thought of as defined by an explicit formula, but it is assumed to be 
obtained experimentally. 

4.6  Analysis of polyaxial failure data 
Under polyaxial (also called “true triaxial”) compression, rock failure will be a function of 
three variables, the three principal stresses. Hence, it is not at all obvious a priori that the 
failure process can be described by a function in a two-dimensional space, such as (τoct,σoct) 
or  (τoct,σm,2).  In  order  to  try  to  verify  that  this  reduction  from  three  to  two  mathematical 
dimensions  is  possible,  we  have  searched  the  literature  for  polyaxial  failure  data,  and 
analysed these data in the (τoct,σoct) plane as well as in the (τoct,σm,2) plane.  

4.6.1  Drucker-Prager criterion constrained by polyaxial test data (τoct -σoct space) 
The Drucker-Prager failure criterion was developed approximately twenty years before the 
construction of the first apparatus that enabled polyaxial tests. It is based on the assumption 
that a linear failure envelope in τoct-σoct space, given by Eq. (4.14), based on triaxial test data, 
represents the failure under polyaxial stress states. In this section, we will examine how good 
a Drucker-Prager criterion, developed using triaxial test data, is in representing polyaxial test 
data.

Rock failure criteria

 

Seven  rock  types  were  analysed  to  determine  the  failure  envelope  in τoct-σoct  space.  These 
rock types were Dunham dolomite, Solenhofen limestone, Mizuho trachyte, coarse grained 
dense marble, Shirahama sandstone, KTB amphibolite and Westerly granite. The polyaxial 
data of Dunham dolomite, Solenhofen limestone and Mizuho trachyte are taken from Mogi 
(1971a; 1971b), the polyaxial data of marble is from Michelis (1985; 1987a), the polyaxial 
data  of  Shirahama  sandstone  is  from  Takahashi  and  Koide  (1989),  the  polyaxial  data  of 
Westerly granite is from Haimson and Chang (2000). The polyaxial data of KTB amphibolite 
is taken from the paper by Colmenares and Zoback (2002), from tests carried out by Chang 
and Haimson (2000). These sets of data are shown in Appendix A in Tables (A.1-A.7). 

In Figure 4.5, the triaxial test data, in which σ2 = σ3, is plotted in τoct-σoct space, together with 
their best fitting linear models. The triaxial test data are plotted as black circles, and the solid 
line is their best fitting linear model. Table 4.1 recording Drucker-Prager strength parameters,

Rock failure criteria

 

 
In order to check the representation of the linear models (Figure 4.5) for the polyaxial stress 
state, the polyaxial test data (empty circles) are superimposed in τoct-σoct space, as shown in 
Figure 4.6. Although the linear models have been determined with high r2 values (see Table 
4.1),  it  seems  that  these  models  do  not  represent  the  polyaxial  stress  states.  The  Drucker-
Prager  failure  criterion  has  generally  overestimated  the  strength  of  the  tested  rocks.  The 
criterion, however, provided a good model for the polyaxial test data of marble (see Figure 
4.6).  These  results  are  equivalent  to  those  from  field  case  studies,  where  Drucker-Prager 
criterion has been reported as a good model in some cases (e.g. Fuh et al., 1988; Fuh and 
Loose,  1989)  and  unrealistic  one  in  others  (e.g.  Aadnoy  et  al.,  1987;  McLean  and  Addis, 
1990b).  Accordingly,  a  linear  failure  criterion  in  τoct-σoct  space  (i.e.,  the  Drucker-Prager 
criterion) based on triaxial test data is not necessarily representive of the polyaxial stress state 
and, in general, it overestimates the rock strength. This statement is not true if we use a linear 
failure criterion in τoct-σm,2 space, as we will see in the next section. 

4.6.2  Analysis of polyaxial failure data in τoct-σm,2 space 
The  Mogi  failure  envelope  in  τoct-σm,2  space  was  determined  for  the  seven  rock  types 
analysed in section 4.6.1, in addition to Yuubari shale. The polyaxial data of Yuubari shale is 
from Takahashi and Koide (1989) and recorded in Table A.8 in Appendix A. We have plotted 
all data points recorded in Tables (A.1-A.8) in the (τoct,σm,2) plane, and found that they could 
all be fit well with a linear function (Figure 4.7):

,                                                        (4.18) 

where a is the intersection of the line on τoct-axis, and b is its inclination.  

In Figure 4.7, the polyaxial test data are plotted as empty circles, and the solid line is their 
best fitting linear model. The data for which σ2 =σ3, that is, the traditional triaxial test data, 
are highlighted by large black circles. This linear form provides a good fit to the data sets, 
with very high correlation coefficients, r2. Based on the polyaxial test data, the Mogi strength 
parameters, a and b, for the eight tested rocks and the corresponding correlation coefficients 
are given in Table 4.2. According to this goodness of fit, a linear model can be considered to 
be a reasonable assumption.  

Power-law and parabolic Mogi failure criteria have been also been fit to the data, with the 
results shown in Table 4.3. From the correlation coefficient values, power-law and parabolic 
failure  envelopes  have  almost  the  same  goodness  of  fit,  with  a  slight  preference  usually 
observed for the power-law model. However, the comparison of linear and power-law failure 
envelopes reveals that, in general, the linear form does as good a job as the power-law form 
in fitting the data (see Tables 4.2-4.3); the variance between the best-fitting equation and the 
data is due more to experimental scatter than to any inherent difficulty in fitting the data to a 
straight line.

If the Mogi assumption is valid, the strength parameters a and b can be approximated from a 
set of triaxial tests, as this is just a special case of a polyaxial stress state. A good test of this 
assumption would be to fit the conventional triaxial data to a linear Mogi failure criterion, 
and  then  see  whether  or  not  the  polyaxial  data  fall  on  this  line.  The  triaxial  test  data  are 
plotted in Figure 4.8 together with their best fitting linear model; Yuubari shale is excluded 
due to the shortage of triaxial test data for this rock. Table 4.4 records the strength parameters 
a and b that were obtained from the triaxial test data, along with their associated r2 values.

Rock failure criteria

 

These models are then used to calculate the predicted value of the octahedral shear stress at 
failure,  which  are  then  compared  to  the  values  determined  from  the  polyaxial  failure  data 
(i.e., the experimental τoct values). The predicted/theoretical and measured/experimental τoct 
values  are  shown  in  Tables  (A.1-A.8)  in  Appendix  A.  The  agreement  is  quite  good,  with 
correlation coefficients in the range 0.95-0.99, and the mean relative error (in absolute value) 
of  about  4%.  These  results  verify  that  a  Mogi  failure  criterion  based  on  triaxial  test  data 
correlates  well  with  the  polyaxial  strength  data.  Therefore,  failure  under  polyaxial  stresses 
can in fact be predicted from triaxial test data using the linear Mogi criterion.

Rock failure criteria

 

Applying the definition of the maximum shear stress (i.e., Eq. (4.10)) in Eq. (4.21), the linear 
Mogi criterion becomes

                                          (4.22) 

Comparison  with  the  form  of  the  Coulomb  law  given  by  Eqs.  (4.9-4.11)  shows  that  for 
triaxial data, the linear Mogi criterion coincides with the Coulomb criterion if we make the 
following identification: 

 

 

a

=

2 2 cos ,
c φ
3

                                                     (4.23)

                                                        (4.24) 

The strength parameter b essentially represents the internal friction, while the parameter a is 
related  to  the  cohesion  and  internal  friction.  Alternatively,  using  Eqs.  (4.6,4.7),  the 
parameters  of  the  linear  Mogi  criterion  can  also  be  identified  with  the  Coulomb  failure 
parameters (q,Co) as follows:

                                                         (4.26) 

Hence,  for  triaxial  stress  states  (σ2  = σ3)  the  linear  Mogi  criterion  given  by  Eq.  (4.22)  is 
exactly equivalent to the Coulomb criterion. The linear Mogi criterion can be thought of as a 
natural  extension  of  the  Coulomb  criterion  into  three  dimensions.  Accordingly,  this  linear 
failure criterion will be called the Mogi-Coulomb criterion. Furthermore, inspection of Eqs. 
(4.19-4.22) shows that the linear Mogi criterion is also equivalent to the Coulomb criterion 
for triaxial extension stress states (σ1 = σ2).  

As  another  test  of  the  equivalence  between  the  linear  Mogi  criterion  and  the  Coulomb 
criterion, we can make the following comparison (Table 4.5). First, the parameters Co and q 
are determined by fitting the triaxial test data to a Coulomb failure line. These values are then 
used to calculate the Mogi-Coulomb strength parameters, a and b, using Eqs. (4.25,4.26). If 
we compare these values of a and b with the values found directly from applying a linear 
Mogi  model  in τoct-σm,2  space  (see  Table  4.4),  we  find  extremely  close  agreement.  These 
results  verified  experimentally  that  a  linear  Mogi  criterion  is  equivalent  to  the  Coulomb 
criterion.

 The estimations of C0 and 
which is associated with the effective mean stress, 
T0  by  Eqs.  (4.32,4.33)  are  exactly  the  same  as  that  determined  from  the  Mohr-Coulomb 
criterion, using the Mogi-Coulomb strength parameters a and b rather than c and φ. If the 
Mogi-Coulomb failure envelope is extrapolated to τoct = 0, it will intersect the σm,2-axis at 
ccotφ,  at  which  the  principal  stresses  are  equal  tensile  stresses.  The  uniaxial  tensile  stress 
predicted  by  Eq.  (4.33)  takes  a  value  that  is  generally  higher  than  the  measured  one. 
Consequently, a tensile cut-off at the value of σm,2 associated with true uniaxial tensile stress 
(i.e., σm,2 = T0true/2) should be applied, as illustrated in Figure 4.10.

4.8  Extended Mogi-Coulomb criterion 
In  this  chapter  we  have  made  an  extensive  review  of  published  experimental  data  on 
polyaxial failure of rocks. Our analysis of several hundred measurements taken on eight rocks 
shows the goodness of the Mogi-Coulomb criterion in representing the polyaxial stress state 
at failure. For the purpose of more accurate results, we have highlighted the possibility of 
using parabolic or power-law Mogi criteria. In order to maintain the correlation between the 
Mogi criterion and Coulomb criterion, we recommend the use of a parabolic Mogi criterion, 
if there is a need for a nonlinear failure criterion. In general, if the studied case is over a high 
range of effective mean stress (σm,2) values, the data may need a model that is slightly curved. 
In this case, a non-linear Mogi criterion may be more appropriate, which can be formulated 
as

where a, b and c are material constants. The parameters a and b represent the cohesion and 
angle of internal friction. The parameter c is a curve fitting parameter that represents the non-
linear behaviour at high effective mean stresses. Nevertheless, if we fit data to the parabolic 
law,  the  Mogi-Coulomb  strength  parameters  (a,b)  that  we  find  are  not  the  same  as  those 
obtained  when  using  the  linear  model  (see  Tables  4.2,  4.3).  Therefore,  the  relationship 
between (a,b) and (c,φ) may be not so straightforward for the parabolic form. Further study 
should  be  carried  out  to  investigate  these  relationships,  which  is  beyond  the  scope  of  this 
thesis.  This  parabolic  Mogi  criterion,  which  might  be  related  to  the  Coulomb  strength 
parameters, can be considered as an extension of the Mogi-Coulomb criterion. 

The  requirement  for  nonlinear  failure  criterion  will  arise  particularly  for  weak  rocks.  For 
example,  Elliott  and  Brown  (1986)  suggested  a  theoretical  yield  criterion  which  has  been 
found  to  be  good  at  describing  the  peak  strength  behaviour  of  a  variety  of  weak  rocks 
(Marsden et al., 1989). This criterion is almost identical to a parabolic failure envelope in p-q 
space, where p = (σ1+2σ3)/3 and q = (σ1-σ3). Therefore, Wu and Hudson (1988) proposed a 
non-linear failure criterion formulated as 

 

q A Bp Cp

                                                       (4.35) 

where A, B and C are material constants. For the sake of simplicity, and also due to the lack 
of experimental evidence, the p-q criterion given by Eq. (4.35) assumes that the peak strength 
is independent of the intermediate principal stress (Wu, 1991). 

Independently, Khan and co-workers {Khan, 1991 113 /id /d} suggested a parabolic failure 
envelope for  Berea sandstone. Their criterion has the form

Rock failure criteria

 

This parabolic failure criterion has been utilized later by a number of researchers (e.g. Wong 
et al., 1997; Klein et al., 2001). Using the relationship between J2 and τoct given by Eq. (2.35), 
that is, 

 

τ =

                                                        (4.38) 

and the definition of the octahedral normal stress as the invariant I1/3, we have rewritten the 
criterion as

                                              (4.39) 

where A, B and C are material constants. As per Eq. (4.39), therefore, this failure criterion is 
an extension of the Drucker-Prager criterion. Moreover, for triaxial stress states, when σ2 = 
σ3, the criterion is equivalent to the p-q criterion. 

The  extended  Drucker-Prager  criterion,  defined  by  Eq.  (4.39),  differs  than  the  extended 
Mogi-Coulomb criterion, Eq. (4.34), by the use of σoct rather than σm,2 as the effective mean 
stress. In order to compare between the two criteria, three weak rock types were analysed to 
determine the failure envelopes in τoct-σoct space and τoct-σm,2 space for triaxial test data. The 
rock types investigated were Berea sandstone taken from Khan and co-workers {Khan, 1991 
113 /id /d}, Vosges sandstone obtained from Besuelle and co-workers (2000), and Indiana 
limestone given by Amadei and Robinson (1986). These sets of data are shown in Appendix 
A, in Tables (A.9-A.11) 

Figure  4.11  show  the  triaxial  test  data  together  with  the  extended  Drucker-Prager  and  the 
extended Mogi-Coulomb failure envelopes. It can be seen that the extended Drucker-Prager 
criterion  is  good  in  describing  the  strength  of  the  tested  weak  rocks.  However,  a  slightly 
better fit to the test results for the proposed extended Mogi-Coulomb criterion can be noticed 
through the higher correlation coefficient values. Moreover, the strength parameters A and B 
is  higher  than  a  and  b,  and  together  with  the  use  of σoct  as  the  effective  mean  stress,  the 
extended  Drucker-Prager  criterion  predicting  higher  rock  strength  (τoct)  than  the  extended 
Mogi-Coulomb criterion. This is consistent with the failure envelopes determined based on 
the  triaxial  test  data  of  the  previously  analysed  seven  rocks  (see  Figures  4.5  and  4.8,  and 
Tables 4.1 and 4.4). The Drucker-Prager criterion, therefore, generally overestimate the rock 
strength (τoct) relative to the Mogi-Coulomb criterion.  

Linear and parabolic yield surfaces in τoct-σoct space are actually different forms of the Mogi 
yield criterion, which formulated by

                                                              (4.40) 

where f is a monotonically increasing function. As per Mogi’s hypothesis, a yield criterion 
(e.g., Eqs. (4.14,4.39)) should not be used as a fracture criterion. This could be supported by 
the fact that yield stress and peak strength rarely coincide in rock materials. In addition, there 
is a possibility that the failure envelopes determined in τoct-σoct space are not representing the 
polyaxial stress state, as we have seen earlier. In contrast, failure envelopes estimated in τoct-
σm,2 space are very good in modelling the rock strength for triaxial and polyaxial stress states.

Rock failure criteria

 

4.9  Summary and conclusions 
We  have  shown  that  when σ2  = σ3,  the  linear  version  of  Mogi’s  triaxial  failure  criterion 
reduces exactly to the Coulomb criterion. Hence, the linear Mogi criterion can be thought of 
as a natural extension of the Coulomb criterion into three dimensions. As Mohr’s extension 
of  the  Coulomb  criterion  into  three  dimensions  is  often  referred  to  as  the  Mohr-Coulomb 
criterion, we propose that the linear version of the Mogi criterion be known as the “Mogi-
Coulomb” failure criterion. The Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion, therefore, only represents 
the  triaxial  stress  state  (σ2  =  σ3),  which  is  a  special  case  that  will  only  occasionally  be 
encountered in situ.  

We  have  revealed  that  Mogi-Coulomb  criterion  is  good  in  representing  rock  failure  in 
polyaxial stress state. Furthermore, we found that the numerical values of the parameters that 
appear in the Mogi-Coulomb criterion can be estimated from conventional σ2 = σ3 triaxial 
test data. Therefore, this polyaxial failure criterion can be used even in the absence of true 
triaxial data. 

We have pointed out that Mogi-Coulomb strength parameters can be unambiguously related 
to  the  traditional  parameters  appearing  in  the  Coulomb  failure  law.  The  lack  of  such  a 
relationship for the parameters appearing in the power-law Mogi criterion has been cited by 
Colmenares and Zoback (2002) as a major drawback to the use of that model.  

We have shown that the Drucker-Prager criterion generally overestimates rock strength. This 
criterion, therefore, should not be used to model brittle fracture. On the other hand, the Mohr-
Coulomb  criterion  underestimates  rock  strength  by  ignoring  the  effect  of  σ2.  The  Mogi-
Coulomb criterion, however, seems to give a proper accounting of the strengthening effect of 
the intermediate principal stress. This criterion neither ignores the strengthening effect of σ2, 
as is done by the Mohr-Coulomb criterion nor does it predict strengths as high as does the 
Drucker-Prager  criterion.  Hence,  we  recommend  the  use  of  the  Mogi-Coulomb  law  for 
wellbore stability analysis, as it has been experimentally verified for describing rock failure.

Vertical borehole failure analysis

 

5 Vertical borehole failure analysis 

The  mud  pressure  should  be  designed  accurately  to  prevent  the  onset  of  borehole  shear 
failure,  manifested  by  the  collapse  of  the  borehole  wall,  and  borehole  tensile  failure, 
represented by hydraulic fracturing. These stability problems can lead to stuck pipe, fishing, 
reaming  operations,  poor  cementations,  sidetracking  and  lost  circulation.  The  precursor  of 
such drilling problems can be often eliminated by a proper determination of the critical mud 
pressure required to maintain wellbore stability.  

The  stability  analysis  predominantly  requires  the  following  input  data:  orientation  and 
magnitude  of  the  in  situ  stresses,  pore  pressure  and  the  failure  criterion  of  the  rock.  The 
determination of in situ stresses is probably the most important input parameter. However, 
these  are  usually  insufficiently  known.  In  particular  the  horizontal  stress  magnitude  and 
orientation are not frequently measured. This will definitely increase the uncertainty in the 
results. The pore pressure is vital as it determines the effective stresses, which control rock 
failure.  

In order to establish the failure criterion of a rock formation, the availability of core samples 
is essential, which is often limited. It is crucial, however, to ascertain the strength parameters 
within an appropriate stress range. This again reveals the significance of estimating the in situ 
stresses. In most field cases, the confining pressure is unlikely to exceed 2000 psi (14 MPa) 
(McLean and Addis, 1990a).  

In this chapter an overview of in situ stresses assessment is presented. Furthermore, we will 
drive the equations necessary to calculate the critical mud pressures that provide sufficient 
wellbore support to neutralize the redistribution of stresses resulting from the creation of the 
wellbore.  This  will  be  achieved  by  implementing  rock  failure  criteria,  namely,  Mohr-
Coulomb and Mogi-Coulomb, and the isotropic linear elastic constitutive model for stresses 
around a borehole described in Chapter 3. For a vertical borehole, the stresses at the borehole 
wall are determined by Eq. (3.15) and should be then compared with a failure criterion in 
order to estimate the lower and upper limit of the mud pressure to avoid borehole failure. 

5.1  In situ stresses 
The in situ principal stresses are usually anisotropic and assumed to be aligned vertically and 
horizontally (see section 3.2). For typical depths of oil reservoirs, the ratio of the minimum 
horizontal stress to the vertical stress (σh/σv) ranges from 0.3 to 1.5, and σH/σh ranges from 1 
to  2  (Herget,  1988;  Tan  et  al.,  1993;  Chen  et  al.,  2002).  Anderson  (1951)  proposed  a 
description for the in situ stress regimes based on the relative magnitude between the vertical 
and  horizontal  field  stresses.  He  suggested  that  normal  or  extensional  faulting  (NF)  stress 
regimes are associated with σv ≥ σH ≥ σh, compressional, reverse or thrust faulting (RF) stress 
regimes are associated with σH ≥ σh ≥ σv, and strike-slip (SS) stress regimes are associated 
with σH  ≥ σv  ≥ σh.  Therefore,  when  σ1  is  vertical,  normal  faulting  will  occur,  when  σ3  is

vertical  reverse  faulting  will  occur,  and  strike-slip  faulting  occurs  when  σ2  is  vertical  (see 
Figure 5.1).

5.1.1  Vertical principal stress 
Estimation  or  measurement  of  the  in  situ  stresses  is  essential,  since  there  are  no  known 
natural  phenomena  that  record  current  subsurface  stresses  with  the  necessary  levels  of 
precision  (Bell,  2003).  The  vertical  principal  in  situ  stress,  σv,  is  usually  assumed  to  be 
equivalent to the weight of the overburden, that is, 

 

σ ρ=

gh

v

,                                                               (5.1) 

where ρ  is  the  average  mass  density  of  the  overlaying  rock,  g  is  the  acceleration  due  to 
gravity, and h is the depth (e.g., Fairhurst, 2003). If the density varies with depth, the vertical 
stress  is  determined  by  integrating  the  densities  of  the  overlaying  rocks.  At  the  depths  of 
interest  in  petroleum  exploration,  the  vertical  stress  has  a  gradient  in  the  range  18.1-22.6 
kPa/m (0.8-1.0 psi/ft) (Fjaer et al., 1992, p. 90).  

5.1.2  Horizontal principal stresses 
The most common in situ stress measurement technique in boreholes is hydraulic fracturing 
(Amadei and Stephansson, 1997). From this method, the horizontal in situ stresses, σh and 
σH,  are  often  estimated  (e.g.,  Zoback  et  al.,  1977;  Haimson,  1993;  Hayashi  et  al.,  1997). 
Hydraulic  fracturing  was  originally  developed  as  a  technique  of  stimulating  production  in 
petroleum  reservoirs,  and  was  first  used  as  a  stress  measurement  method  in  the  1960s 
(Fairhurst,  1965a;  Haimson  and  Fairhurst,  1967;  Haimson  and  Fairhurst,  1969).  In  this 
technique, typically a meter-long sealed-off section of a borehole is pressurized by water at a 
constant flow rate until a fracture develops in the rock, that is, the breakdown pressure (Pb) is 
reached.  Following  the  development  of  the  fracture,  the  pump  is  shut-off  and  the  pressure 
will decay first at a fast rate (the fracture is still open and growing), and then at slower rate, 
after the fracture has closed. The pressure at which the fracture closes, or that is required to 
hold the fracture open, is termed the shut-in pressure (Ps) (see Figure 5.2).  

Hydraulic fracturing stress measurement method is usually applied in vertical boreholes. If 
we assume that the borehole is drilled vertically along a principal stress direction, from the

As  has  been  shown  in  section  (3.4),  the  tangential  and  axial  stresses  attain  the  smallest

stresses are

.

Theoretically, from Eq. (5.3), σθ  or σz may be tensile, and so, a hydraulic fracture can occur 
in the vertical or the horizontal plane (Ljunggren et al., 1988; Ljunggren and Amadei, 1989; 
Amadei and Stephansson, 1997, p. 156). However, if we consider the practical range of the in 
situ stresses encountered in oil fields, σz is usually compressive. For example, the minimum 
possible value of σz will occur when σH/σh and σh/σv are equal to 2 and 1.5 respectively. In 
this case, the axial stress will be

For the Poisson’s ratio, a value of 0.2-0.3 can be assumed (e.g., Bell, 2003). Therefore, under 
practical  field  conditions,  the  axial  stress  is  typically  a  compressive  stress  at  the  borehole 
wall,  and  the  tangential  stress  is  the  only  tensile  stress  that  leads  to  a  vertical  hydraulic 
fracture.  This  conclusion  is  consistent  with  most  laboratory  and  field  results  in  which  the

initial hydraulic fracture is normally vertical (Haimson, 1968; Haimson, 1978; Cheung and 
Haimson, 1989; Haimson et al., 1996; Haimson et al., 2003). 

 

Hubbert  and  Willis  (1957)  stated  that  vertical  hydraulic  fractures  will  always  propagate 
perpendicular to the orientation of the least horizontal principal stress. Hence, σh is assumed 
equal to the shut-in pressure and has a direction perpendicular to the hydraulic fracture plane. 
The direction of σH is then parallel to the hydraulic fracture strike (i.e., orthogonal to σh). At 
P
the  breakdown  pressure, w
,  and  by  implementing  the  maximum  tensile  strength 
criterion, that is, 

θσ = − , the maximum horizontal stress is given by

If  we  consider  the  application  of  Terzaghi’s  effective  stress  concept,  where  the  effective 
stress  is  defined  as  the  total  stress  minus  the  pore  pressure  (P0),  the  maximum  horizontal 
principal stress is then determined by

For a normally pressured formation, the pore pressure gradient is typically in the range 1.03-
1.07 g/cm3 (0.447-0.465 psi/ft) (Fjaer et al., 1992, p. 100).  

Furthermore,  the  tensile  strength  (T)  can  only  be  directly  measured  on  core  samples 
(Haimson and Cornet, 2003). Alternatively, Bredehoeft and co-workers (1976) first proposed 
that the tensile strength is equal to the difference between the first breakdown pressure and 
the reopening pressure (Pr) obtained in the subsequent pressurization cycles, that is, 

 

T P P

− .                                                                 (5.8) 

The  reopening  pressure  is  assumed  to  be  the  pressure  required  to  reopen  the  existing 
hydraulic fracture, which has closed completely after each cycle of pressurization. The value 
of  Pr  is  not  necessary  the  breakdown  pressure  during  the  second  and  subsequent 
pressurization  cycles,  but  rather  is  found  from  the  point  where  a  sudden  slowdown  in 
pressure increases with time (Amadei and Stephansson, 1997, p. 114; Rutqvist et al., 2000). 
The estimation of Pr is illustrated in Figure 5.2. 

It  should  be  noted  her  that  the  estimation  of  the  horizontal  in  situ  principal  stresses  as 
described  above  is  only  valid  for  hydraulic  fracture  tests  that  yield  vertical  fractures, 
regardless of in situ stress state. In addition, it has been assumed that the borehole wall is 
impermeable and the formation is continuous, homogenous, isotropic and linearly elastic. 

In deep wells, when hydraulic fracture tests are not available, or are impossible due to drilling 
conditions, leak-off tests (LOTs) are commonly conducted (Zoback et al., 2003). LOTs are 
performed after the casing is placed and drilling a few meters below the casing shoe. In this 
open hole, the mud pressure is raised slowly and the build-up pressure will increase linearly 
with time. When the pressure reaches a value at which a small volume of the mud is believed

to begun to leak-off into the formation, at the leak-off point (LOP), the increase of wellbore 
pressure with time ceases to be linear. After attaining the LOP, the test is normally stopped 
abruptly. Figure 5.3 illustrates a typical leak-off test curve. The LOP is approximately equal 
to the least principal stress, which is normally taken as the minimum horizontal stress, σh. In 
the oil industry, generally leak-off tests are not performed to determine the in situ stresses, 
but to determine the upper limit of the mud pressure required to prevent fracturing (Gjonnes 
et al., 1998). This means that the maximum allowable mud pressure is usually designed to be 
approximately equal to the minimum principal in situ stress.

Drilling a borehole will redistribute the field stresses and produce local stress concentration 
that may lead to the formation of a zone of yielded rock or breakout (Maloney and Kaiser, 
1989).  The  shape  of  the  breakout  can  be  used  to  estimate  the  direction  of  the  horizontal 
stresses (Gough and Bell, 1982; Zoback et al., 1985). Rock failure at the borehole wall will 
initiate  in  the  direction  of  greatest  stress  concentration.  From  Eq.  (5.2),  the  tangential  and 
axial  stresses  attain  the  largest  magnitudes  at θ  =  ±π/2  (i.e.,  cos2θ  = −1),  as  illustrated  in 
section  (3.4).  Therefore,  shear  failure  will  occur  in  the  direction  of  σh,  which  leads  to  the 
breakout formation with the long axis parallel to σh (for example, see Figure 5.4).  

5.2  Principal stresses at borehole collapse and fracturing 
The tangential and radial stresses, σθ and σr, in Eq. (5.2) are functions of the mud pressure, 
Pw.  Hence,  any  change  in  the  mud  pressure  will  only  affect  these  stresses.  As  has  been 
highlighted previously, at the borehole wall, there are mainly two stability problems during 
drilling:  shear  failure  in  the  form  of  borehole  collapse  or  breakout  formation,  and  tensile 
failure represented by hydraulic fracturing. Since we are concerned about the change in σθ 
and σr with respect to Pw, there are two possible cases: either σθ ≥ σr, or σθ ≤ σr, which are 
associated with breakout or fracturing, respectively. When Pw increases (or eventually σr), σθ 
decreases towards the tensile strength. Therefore, the upper limit of the mud pressure, Pwf, is 
associated with fracturing, where σθ should be less than σr. Considering this constraint, and 
the relative magnitude of the axial stress, there are three permutations of the three principal 
stresses (σr,σθ,σz) that need to be investigated in order to determine the maximum allowable 
mud pressure: (1) σr ≥ σθ ≥ σz, (2) σr ≥ σz ≥ σθ and (3) σz ≥ σr ≥ σθ. The tensile strength of the

rock will first be exceeded at θ = 0 or π, where the tangential stress will have the smallest 
value (see Eqs. (5.2) and (5.3)). This means that the hydraulic fracture will develop along the 
direction of σH, and the corresponding three principal stresses at the borehole wall are given 
by

On the other hand, when Pw decreases, σθ  increases towards the compressive strength. Thus, 
the lower limit of the mud pressure, Pwb, is associated with borehole collapse, in which σθ 
should  be  greater  than  σr.  Bearing  in  mind  this  constraint,  there  are  another  three 
permutations of the three principal stresses need to be investigated in order to determine the 
minimum allowable mud pressure: (1) σz ≥ σθ  ≥ σr, (2) σθ  ≥ σ z≥ σr and (3) σθ  ≥ σr ≥ σz. The 
compressive  strength  of  the  rock  will  first  be  exceeded  at  the  position  associated  with  the 
maximum value of σθ or σz (i.e., θ = ±π/2), and so, the corresponding principal stresses at the 
borehole wall become

5.3  Mohr-Coulomb borehole failure criterion 
A “borehole failure criterion” refers to specifying the stress conditions under which borehole 
collapse  (compressive  failure)  and  fracturing  (tensile  failure)  occurs.  In  this  section,  a 

56 

Vertical borehole failure analysis

 

borehole  failure  criterion  will  be  developed  using  the  Mohr-Coulomb  criterion,  Eq.  (4.5). 
(Although Mohr-Coulomb has of course been used frequently for borehole stability analysis, 
the  results  are  usually  not  expressed  in  explicit  algebraic  form;  hence,  it  is  worthwhile  to 
develop this model in some detail.) If we consider the conventional effective stress concept, 
the Mohr-Coulomb criterion becomes

Consider the first case of borehole collapse where σz ≥ σθ ≥ σr, and for the general case of σ1 
≥  σ2  ≥  σ3,  here  σ1  =  σz  and  σ3  =  σr.  Applying  the  Mohr-Coulomb  failure  criterion  as 
expressed by Eq. (5.14), and introducing Eq. (5.11), gives

where Pwb1 is the lower limit of the mud pressure, corresponding to case 1. By rearranging

If  the  well  pressure  falls  below  Pwb1  (i.e.,  Pw  ≤  Pwb1),  and  the  relative  magnitude  of  the 
principal  stresses  are  as  per  case  1,  borehole collapse  will  take  place.  Following  the  same 
procedure,  the  minimum  allowable  mud  pressure  corresponding  to  the  other  two  cases  are 
determined and recorded in Table 5.1.

As has been stated, there are three situations where borehole fracturing may occur. The upper 
limit of the mud pressure should be calculated for each case. Regarding the first case, where 
σr ≥ σθ  ≥ σz, σ1 = σr and σ3 = σz. By applying the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion, Eq. (5.14)

becomes

Borehole fracturing will occur if the well pressure rises above Pwf1 (i.e., Pw ≥ Pwf1), and the 
relative  magnitude  of  the  principal  stresses  are  as  per  case  1.  Likewise,  the  maximum 
allowable mud pressure corresponding to the other cases are estimated and given in Table 
5.2.

As the mud pressure decreases, the principal stresses will alternate from one case to another. 
Borehole  collapse  will  only  occur  at  the  case  that  fulfils  the  Mohr-Coulomb  criterion. 
Therefore, the collapse pressures Pwb1, Pwb2, Pwb3, as given in Table 5.1, should be used to 
recalculate the principal stresses σr, σθ, σz by applying Eq. (5.11) where Pw = Pwb. For each 
case, the principal stresses are then substituted into Eq. (5.14). The lower limit of the mud 
pressure is associated with the case in which the principal stresses has first satisfied Mohr-
Coulomb  criterion.  Similarly,  for  a  given  field  conditions,  one  should  determine  which 
fracture pressure will fulfil the failure criterion. 

In the field, generally, borehole collapse corresponds to case 1 and case 2, where the radial 
stress is the minimum principal stress. It would be advantageous if the mud pressure related 
to these two common cases could be determined from one single equation. The stress state in 
these cases could be expressed as σ1 ≥ σ2 ≥ σr, where

corresponding to these cases becomes

Furthermore, it is well know that Mohr-Coulomb criterion overestimates the tensile strength. 
In order to study tensile failure, therefore, the Mohr-Coulomb criterion should be used with a 
tensile cut-off (see also section 4.7). The tensile cut-off is given by

where T0 is the uniaxial tensile strength (tensile is negative). In vertical boreholes, we have 
assumed  that  the  tangential  principal  stress  is  the  only  tensile  stress  at  the  borehole  wall. 
Therefore, Introducing Eq. (5.9) into Eq. (5.22) and rearranging, the upper limit of the mud 
pressure as per the tensile cut-off is given by

This mud pressure should be then compared with Pwf  as calculated from the equations given 
in Table 5.2, and the lesser of these two values gives the maximum allowable mud pressure. 

5.4  Mogi-Coulomb borehole failure criterion 
The strengthen effect of the intermediate principal stress can be considered by implementing 
the  Mogi-Coulomb  law.  Taking  into  account  the  effective  stress  concept,  Mogi-Coulomb 
criterion given by Eq. (4.29) becomes

We have previously pointed out that there are six permutations of the three principal stresses 
(σr,σθ,σz) that need to be investigated to develop a borehole failure criterion. Since the first 
and  second  stress  invariants,  I1  and  I2,  have  the  same  form  in  all  the  cases,  only  the 
intermediate  principal  stress  will  vary  from  one  case  to  another,  as  per  Eq.  (5.24). 
Consequently,  the  six  permutations  of  the  principal  stresses  could  be  represented  in  three 
scenarios in which σ2 could be σθ, σz, or σr. In each scenario there will be two roots of the 
mud pressure related to borehole collapse and fracturing. 

The principal stresses at the borehole wall given by Eq. (5.11) represent the highest stress 
concentration  that  may  result  in  compressive  failure.  By  introducing  Eq.  (5.11)  into  Eq. 
(4.28), the first and second stress invariants are then given by

Implementing  the  Mogi-Coulomb  failure  criterion  as  expressed  by  Eq.  (5.24),  and 
introducing Eq. (5.26), gives

Solving  this  equation  for  Pwb1  will  give  two  roots.  Since  we  are  concerned  with  borehole

At  the  borehole  wall,  the  highest  stress  concentration  that  may  result  in  tensile  failure  is 
consequent to the principal stresses defined by Eq. (5.9). By inspection of this equation and 
Eq. (5.11), the constants A and B in Eq. (5.11) have been replaced by D and E respectively in 
Eq. (5.9). Therefore, the upper limit of the mud pressure, Pwf, is the larger roots in the three 
scenarios of borehole collapse with the use of D and E as constants instead of A and B. The 
maximum allowable mud pressure at different stress state and the corresponding constants are

For each collapse and fracture pressures, it is essential to recalculate the principal stresses, 
Eqs. (5.9) and (5.11), and then substitute the stresses into Eq. (5.24). This will allow us to 
know which stress state has occurred and, at the same time, fulfil the failure criterion. The 
critical  mud  pressures  are  then  those  for  which  the  Mogi-Coulomb  criterion  has  been 
satisfied. 

However, borehole collapse will usually be related to case 1 and case 2, as highlighted in the 
previous section. For case 1 to occur, we must have

Considering the practical range of Poisson’s ratio (0–0.5), and the facts that the ratio of the 
maximum horizontal stress to the minimum horizontal stress (σH /σh) ranges from 1 to 2, and 
the collapse pressure will not exceed the minimum in situ stress in Eq. (5.37), it follows that 
the vertical stress must be greater than the maximum horizontal stress for case 1 to develop. 
Therefore, case 1 is only associated with the normal faulting stress regime (i.e., σv ≥ σH ≥ σh). 
Moreover, case 2 may develop in any stress regime. In the field, consequently, case 2 (i.e., σθ 
≥ σz  ≥ σr)  will  be  the  most  commonly  encountered  stress  state  corresponding  to  borehole 
collapse for all in situ stress regimes. For instance, Woodland (1988) reported that for deep 
boreholes  drilled  in  western  Canada  with  low  mud  densities,  the  stress  state  at  borehole 
collapse is as per case 2. 

Furthermore, the unixial tensile strength estimated by Mogi-Coulomb is exactly the same as 
that  determined  by  the  Mohr-Coulomb  criterion,  since  both  criteria  are  equivalent  under 

62 

Vertical borehole failure analysis

 

uniaxial  tensile  stress  states  (see  section  4.7).  Therefore,  a  tensile  cut-off  should  be  also 
introduced  in  the  Mogi-Coulomb  failure  criterion.  We  have  assumed  that  the  same  tensile 
cut-off which is conventionally used with Mohr-Coulomb criterion can be applied in Mogi 
domain, τoct-σm,2  space.  Consequently,  the  upper  limit  of  the  mud  pressure  defined  by  Eq. 
(5.23) should be introduced into the borehole failure criterion. 

5.5  Example calculations of collapse pressure 
The main process in wellbore stability analysis is the selection of a rock failure criterion. In 
Chapter  4  we  concluded  that  a  linear  Mohr  criterion  is  a  2D  Coulomb  failure  criterion, 
whereas a linear Mogi criterion is a 3D Coulomb failure criterion. By applying these failure 
criteria, we have presented two different mathematical models to estimate the critical mud 
pressure.  In  this  section  we  will  highlight  the  difference  in  results  between  the  Mohr-
Coulomb and Mogi-Coulomb borehole failure criteria.  

Assume a vertical wellbore is drilled in a rock such as limestone, with a cohesion of 1400 psi 
and a friction angle of 35°. The in situ stresses and pore pressure are as follows: σv = 1.0 
psi/ft,  σH  =  σh=  0.85  psi/ft,  P0  =  0.45  psi/ft.  Since  the  horizontal  stress  is  isotropic,  the 
Poisson’s ratio (ν) will disappear from both borehole failure criteria. At the depth of 10,000 
ft, for instance, using Mohr-Coulomb borehole failure criterion, Table 5.1 or Eq. (5.20), gives 
Pwb  =  Pwb2  =  5059  psi.  Hence,  the  minimum  overbalance  pressure  (well  pressure-pore 
pressure) is 559 psi. At the same depth, the Mogi-Coulomb borehole failure criterion (Table 
5.3) gives Pwb= Pwb2 = 4622 psi, and the minimum overbalance pressure becomes 122 psi. 
The two borehole failure criteria, therefore, result in quite different collapse pressures. This is 
mainly  due  to  the  existence  of  an  intermediate  principal  stress  that  is  not  equal  to  the 
minimum principal stress at the wellbore wall.  

At  the  same  field  conditions,  if  the  rock  has  a  lower  cohesion  of,  say,  700  psi  (e.g., 
sandstone),  using 
the  Mohr-Coulomb  and  Mogi-Coulomb  criteria  gives  minimum 
overbalance  pressures  of  1132  and  804  psi,  respectively.  Therefore,  for  a  weaker  rock,  a 
higher collapse pressure is required to maintain the stability of the wellbore. Moreover, the 
difference  in  results  between  both  criteria  is  minimized.  In  both  examples,  however,  the 
Mohr-Coulomb criterion is significantly conservative. This is illustrated in Figure 5.5, where 
the  minimum  overbalance  pressure  versus  depth  and  borehole  failure  criteria  is  plotted. 
Figure 5.5 also shows that the collapse pressure increases with depth.

We  have  shown  in  Chapter  4  that  the  Drucker-Prager  failure  envelope  developed  using 
conventional  triaxial  test  data  may  not  represent  rock  failure  under  polyaxial  stress  states. 
Furthermore, this failure criterion gives a higher rock strength than does the Mogi-Coulomb 
criterion.  Accordingly,  if  the  Drucker-Prager  criterion  is  introduced  into  wellbore  stability 
analysis,  it  will  definitely  provide  a  lower  collapse  pressure  than  will  the  Mogi-Coulomb 
borehole failure criterion. For example, assume that a vertical wellbore is drilled in poorly 
cemented sand with cohesion equal to 200 psi and a friction angle of 35°. At a depth of 4,000 
ft, the in situ stresses and pore pressure, as suggested by Ewy (1999), are as follows: σv = 
0.891 psi/ft, σH = σh= 0.64 psi/ft, and P0 = 0.425 psi/ft. Based on the Drucker-Prager failure 
criterion,  Ewy  calculated  the  collapse  pressure  to  be  about  1493  psi,  which  is  below  the 
formation pressure. Applying the Mohr-Coulomb and Mogi-Coulomb criteria, the minimum 
overbalance  pressures  are  297  and  205  psi,  respectively.  As  expected,  Drucker-Prager 
criterion  underestimated  the  collapse  pressure,  whereas  the  Mohr-Coulomb  criterion 
predicted a conservative collapse pressure.  

64 

Vertical borehole failure analysis

 

5.6  Example calculations of fracture pressure 
Assume the following rock properties and stresses: c = 1400 psi, φ = 35°, σv = 0.95 psi/ft, σH 
= σh = 0.80 psi/ft, and P0 = 0.45 psi/ft. Since there are commonly existing cracks or fractures 
in the wellbore wall, the uniaxial tensile strength of the rock is taken to be zero. At a depth of 
10,000 ft, the Mohr-Coulomb borehole failure criterion gives Pwf = Pwf2 = 11,154 psi, whereas 
the Mogi-Coulomb criterion gives Pwf = Pwf2 = 11,538 psi. If we consider the tensile cut-off, 
the  fracture  pressure  becomes  Pwcutoff  =  11,500  psi.  As  per  the  Mohr-Coulomb  and  Mogi-
Coulomb criteria, therefore, the maximum allowable mud pressures are 11,154 and 11,500 
psi,  respectively.  Figure  5.6  shows  the  fracture  pressure  as  a  function  of  depth  and  failure 
criterion. In general, the Mogi-Coulomb criterion predicted higher fracture pressures than did 
the  Mohr-Coulomb  criterion.  This  is  mainly  due  to  the  strengthening  effect  of  the 
intermediate principal stress. Furthermore, the fracture pressure increases with depth. 

The fracture pressure estimated by both borehole failure criteria is about 40% more than σh, 
which is far from what is usually applied in practice. When the well pressure is greater than 
the minimum in situ principal stress, there is a possibility of lost circulation (e.g., Hubbert 
and Willis, 1957; McLean and Addis, 1990b; Ewy et al., 1994; Ewy, 1999; Bradford et al., 
2000). Therefore, the fracture pressure is typically set equal to the minimum principal stress 
or the LOT pressure. This problem of estimating high fracture pressure in both models is not 
related  to  the  applied  failure  criteria;  rather,  it  is  mainly  due  to  the  sensitivity  of  fracture 
pressure  to  the  magnitude  of  the  pore  pressure.  For  instance,  assume  that  wellbore  wall  is 
permeable, so that at the wall P0 = Pw, and assume that there is no contribution of fluid flow 
to the stresses. For the same rock properties and stresses, applying the tensile failure criterion 
given by Eq (5.22), gives a fracture pressure that is equal to σh. Thus, considering the pore 
pressure alteration has significantly changed the estimation of the fracture pressure. In order 
to avoid the possibility of lost circulation, and to map the region of mechanical stability in a 
vertical wellbore, the upper limit of the well pressure should be set equal to the minimum 
principal stress, which is usually σh.

Non-vertical borehole failure analysis

 

6 Non-vertical borehole failure analysis 

With recent advances in drilling technology, wells are drilled in more difficult environments 
and are becoming more complex. Despite the existing technical challenge, the drilling non-
vertical boreholes is routinely carried out in oilfields. This is mainly applied to enlarge the 
drainage area from a production platform, which may also reduce the number of platforms 
required to produce the field. There is consequently a large potential to minimize the costs of 
the production wells by developing non-vertical boreholes. However, the present of wellbore 
instability will significantly increase the already high well costs. Unplanned operations due to 
wellbore instability consume at least 10% of the average well budget. It is therefore essential 
to perform non-vertical borehole failure analysis, in order to drill cost-effective wells.  

Wellbore stability can be ensured by a proper design of the mud pressure. From the borehole 
stability analysis presented in the previous chapter, we have concluded that the upper limit of 
the mud pressure (i.e., the fracture pressure) should be set equal to the minimum in situ stress 
or the LOT pressure. Following this finding, in this chapter, we will develop an analytical 
model  to  estimate  the  mud  pressure  required  to  only  avoid  shear  failure  at  the  wall  of 
horizontal and deviated boreholes (i.e., collapse pressure). This will be attained by employing 
a  suitable  failure  criterion  and  the  isotropic  linear  elastic  constitutive  model  for  stresses 
around a borehole, as we pursued in Chapter 5.  

We have shown that Mohr-Coulomb criterion underestimates the rock strength by ignoring 
σ2,  while  the  Drucker-Prager  criterion  generally  overestimates  the  rock  strength  through 
conceptually  misusing  the  effective  mean  stress.  These  failure  criteria  will  result  in 
misleading rock strength predictions. For instance, in Figure 6.1 the failure criteria for KTB 
amphibolite are determined based on triaxial test data, where the polyaxial test data are then 
superimposed. It is obvious that Mohr-Coulomb and Drucker-Prager criteria predict the lower 
and the upper limit of the rock strength, respectively. The true rock strength can be predicted 
by applying the Mogi-Coulomb criterion; see Chapter 4 for experimental verification on other 
rock  types.  In  this  chapter,  therefore,  an  analytical  model  for  non-vertical  borehole  failure 
analysis will be developed using a true triaxial failure criterion, that is, the Mogi-Coulomb 
criterion. For comparison, another analytical model will be also developed, using the Mohr-
Coulomb criterion. These models will be then utilized to study some field cases in Chapter 7, 
in  order  to  verify  the  applicability  of  the  suggested  Mogi-Coulomb  criterion  in  field 
situations.  

6.1  Principal stresses at the collapse of horizontal borehole 
With the drilling of the wellbore, the in situ stresses are modified and stress concentration is 
generated around the wellbore. The determination of stresses around a horizontal wellbore 
depends mainly on the in situ stress magnitudes and orientations, the pore pressure, and the 
constitutive  behaviour  of  the  rock.  For  a  rock  obeying  linear  elastic  behaviour,  the  largest 
stress  concentration  occurs  at  the  borehole  wall.  Therefore,  borehole  failure  is  expected  to 
initiate there. For wellbore instability analysis, consequently, stresses at the borehole wall are

the ones that must be compared against a failure criterion. A cylindrical (r,θ,z) co-ordinate 
system is the most convenient system for studying the state of stress around boreholes (see 
Chapter 3). For isotropic and linear elastic material, the stresses at horizontal borehole wall 
(i.e., Eq. (3.17)), are given by

Non-vertical borehole failure analysis

 

The  tangential  and  axial  stresses  are  functions  of  the  angle  θ  and  will  vary  sinusoidally. 
Borehole collapse will initiate at the value of θ where the tangential and the axial stresses, or 
eventually the principal stresses in θ-z plane, are maximum. Inspection of Eq. (6.1) reveals 
that both tangential and axial stresses will reach their maximum values at θ = ±π/2 or θ = 0 or 
π,  depending  mainly  on  the  in  situ  stress  regime.  In  order  to  simplify  borehole  collapse 
analysis,  it  is  useful  then  to  relate  the  critical  positions  of  the  angle θ  to  the  in  situ  stress 
regimes. At θ equal to 0 and 90 degrees, the tangential stresses become

stress (i.e., 
) in order for it to be possible for the maximum tangential stress to occur 
at θ = 0. Hence, the critical position θ = 0 or π is associated with RF and SS stress regimes

Applying the practical values of the horizontal stress and the angle α, in Eq. (6.6), reveals 
that the vertical stress must be greater than the minimum horizontal stress (i.e., 
) so 
that  the  maximum  tangential  stress  could  occur  at  this  critical  position.  The  compressive 
strength of the rock, consequently, will first be exceeded at the angle θ = ±π/2 only in NF and 
SS stress regimes.

In  general,  there  are  three  possible  permutations  of  the  principal  stresses  in  (r,θ,z)  co-
ordinates that need to be investigated in order to determine the collapse pressure: (1) σz ≥ σθ  
≥ σr, (2) σθ  ≥ σz ≥ σr, and (3) σθ  ≥ σr ≥ σz. However, these alternatives are not essentially 
associated with all stress regimes. For simplicity, assume that we have isotropic horizontal

Applying  a  value  of  0-0.5  for  the  Poisson’s  ratio,  and  bearing  in  mind  that  the  collapse 
pressure will not exceed the minimum in situ stress in Eq. (6.9), it follows that the vertical 
stress must be less than the horizontal stress for case 1 to develop. In other words, case 1 is 
not associated with NF stress regimes. This conclusion also holds for anisotropic horizontal 
stresses.  

Moreover, cases 2 and 3 are not limited to a specific stress regime. Furthermore, we already 
knew that in RF stress regimes the maximum tangential stress will never occur at θ = ±π/2. 
Consequently, for NF stress regime, there are only two possible permutations of the principal 
stresses,  that  is,  case  2  (σθ    ≥ σz  ≥ σr)  and  case  3  (σθ    ≥ σr  ≥ σz).  As  the  radial  stress  is 
commonly the minimum principal stress, case 2 is perhaps the most encountered stress state 
in NF stress regimes.  

6.1.2  Reverse faulting stress regime with isotropic horizontal stress 
In  RF  stress  regimes,  borehole  collapse  will  initiate  at θ  =  0  or π.  If  we  assume  isotropic 
horizontal stress, using Eq. (6.1), the principal stresses that may cause borehole failure are 
given by

In this situation, in order for case 1 (σz ≥ σθ  ≥ σr) to occur, the axial stress must be greater 
than  the  tangential  stress,  as  presented  by  Eq.  (6.8),  whereas  case  3  (σθ    ≥ σr  ≥ σz)  will

(6.13) 

Considering the practical values of the Poisson’s ratio and the mud pressure in Eqs. (6.12) 
and  (6.13),  it  follows  that  the  vertical  stress  must  be  greater  than  the  horizontal  stress  for 
cases  1  or  3  to  develop.  Therefore,  these  two  cases  are  only  associated  with  NF  stress 
regimes.  In  addition,  case  2  may  develop  in  any  stress  regime.  However,  in  NF  stress 
regimes, borehole collapse will never take place at θ = 0 or π, since the compressive strength 
of  the  rock  will  first  be  exceeded  at  the  angle θ  =  ±π/2.  Consequently,  there  is  only  one 
possible permutation of the principal stresses, that is, case 2 (σθ ≥σz ≥σr).  

If  the  horizontal  stress  is  anisotropic,  a  shear  stress  in  the θ-z  plane, σθz,  will  exist.  As  a 
result, the principal stresses in that plane should be first determined before implementing any 
failure criterion. In this case, Eqs. (2.13) and (2.14) can be utilized to estimate the tangential 
and  axial  principal  stresses.  However,  this  will  complicate  the  analysis,  and  no  easy 
expression for the mud pressure can be then obtained, particularly if a 3D failure criterion 
such as Mogi-Coulomb is employed. In other words, the existence of shear stress in the θ-z 
plane will make the analytical solution cumbersome. In such a scenario, a numerical model 
may be more convenient to apply.   

6.1.3  Strike-slip stress regime 
In strike-slip stress regimes, borehole collapse could develop at both critical positions around 
the  borehole  (i.e., θ  =  ±π/2  and θ  =  0  or π).  The  alternation  between  these  two  positions 
depends  on  the  magnitude  of  the  in  situ  stresses  and  the  horizontal  orientation  of  the 
borehole.  This  can  be  easily  concluded  by  the  inspection  of  Eqs.  (6.4)  and  (6.6).  If  the 
maximum  tangential  stress  occurs  at θ  =  ±π/2,  then  the  stresses  around  the  borehole  are 
similar to those exist in the NF stress regime, that is, Eq. (6.7). Unlike the NF stress regime, 
no simplification in the instability analysis can be taken in SS stress regimes, as all the three 
permutations  of  the  principal  stresses,  σθ,  σz  and  σr,  could  occur.  When  the  maximum 
tangential stress occurs at θ = 0 or π, there will be shear stress in θ-z plane and, as mentioned 
previously, any analytical result is going to be unwieldy. Accordingly, for instability analysis 
of horizontal boreholes in SS stress regimes, a general solution for the collapse pressure may 
be better obtained using a numerical model rather than an incomplete or onerous analytical 
model.   

6.2  Horizontal borehole failure criteria 
From  the  previous  section,  it  has  been  revealed  that  the  stress  state  at  the  borehole  wall 
corresponds  to  case  2  is  normally  the  one  that  has  to  be  considered  when  discussing  the 
collapse  pressure  in  horizontal  boreholes.  This  stress  state,  therefore,  should  be  used  in 
conjunction  with  a  failure  criterion  to  determine  the  lower  limit  of  the  mud  pressure.  The 
upper limit of the mud pressure should be set equal to the minimum in situ stress (σh or σv) as 
highlighted in Chapter 5. 

In  NF  stress  regimes  with  anisotropic  horizontal  stresses,  and  RF  stress  regimes  with 
isotropic  horizontal  stresses,  no  shear  stress  exists  in  the θ-z  plane  (i.e., σθz  =  0).  In  these 
situations, σθ, σz  and σr  are  principal  stresses,  which  can  be  directly  implemented  in  the

failure criterion. For the general case of σ1 ≥ σ2 ≥ σ3, here σ1 = σθ, σ2 = σz and σ3 = σr. The 
principal stresses at the borehole wall given by Eq. (6.1), where θ equal to 0 or π/2 depending 
on  the  stress  regime,  represent  the  highest  stress  concentrations  that  may  result  in 
compressive  failure.  Applying  Mohr-Coulomb  failure  criterion,  i.e.,  Eq.  (5.14),  and 
introducing Eq. (6.1), gives

If  the  well  pressure  falls  below  the  collapse  pressure  estimated  by  Eq.  (6.14),  borehole 
collapse will occur. 

In the above analytical solution for the collapse pressure, the intermediate principal stress, σz, 
has  no  role  in  borehole  failure.  The  effect  of  the  intermediate  principal  stress  on  borehole 
failure can be easily regarded by employing the Mogi-Coulomb criterion. This requires first 
the identification of the stress invariants. By introducing Eq. (6.1) into Eq. (4.28), the stress 
invariants are given by

Solving this equation for Pw will give two roots. The larger root is associated with hydraulic 
fracturing,  while  the  smaller  root  corresponds  to  borehole  collapse.  The  lower  limit  of  the 
mud pressure, therefore, is the smaller root of Pw, that is,

When the intermediate principal stress, σz, is equal to the minimum or maximum principal 
stresses, σθ or σr, the collapse pressure determined using the Mogi-Coulomb criterion, Eq. 
(6.18), is exactly the same as the one estimated using the Mohr-Coulomb criterion (i.e., Eq. 
(6.14)). For instance, if σz = σr = Pw in Eq. (6.18), the collapse pressure becomes

and Eq. (6.20) can be substituted in Eq. (6.19). After some manipulation, it is found that Eq. 
(6.19)  is  exactly  equivalent  to  Eq.  (6.14).  Therefore,  the  Mogi-Coulomb  borehole  failure 
criterion, i.e., Eq. (6.18), will give a weight to the intermediate principal stress; otherwise the 
result is equivalent to the Mohr-Coulomb borehole failure criterion, i.e., Eq. (6.14). This is 
one  of  the  main  advantages  of  employing  the  Mogi-Coloumb  criterion,  as  the  developed 
model will naturally reduce to the Mohr-Coulomb borehole failure criterion when we have a 
2D stress state. 

In SS stress regimes, there is no shear stress in the θ-z plane when borehole collapse will take 
place at θ = ±π/2. At this critical position, borehole failure will develop only if Eq. (6.6) is 
valid.  In  this  particular  situation,  the  Mohr-Coulomb  and  Mogi-Coulomb  borehole  failure 
criteria,  expressed  by  Eqs.  (6.14)  and  (6.18)  respectively,  can  be  applied  to  determine  the 
critical mud pressure in a horizontal borehole. 

6.2.1  Sample calculations of collapse pressure in horizontal borehole 
Assume a horizontal borehole has to be drilled in a sandstone formation with cohesion equal 
to 600 psi, a friction angle of 30° and a Poisson’s ratio of 0.3. The sandstone formation is at a 
depth of 4000 ft, where the in situ stresses and pore pressure are as recorded in Table 6.1. In 
this  case  study,  we  have  a  horizontal  borehole  in  an  NF  stress  regime  with  anisotropic 
horizontal  stress.  Therefore,  the  highest  stress  concentration  around  the  borehole  is  at θ  = 
±π/2. The collapse pressure can be directly calculated using Eqs. (6.14) and (6.18).

The minimum overbalance pressure, consequently, has been determined at different borehole 
orientations α (i.e., azimuths) applying both the Mohr-Coulomb and Mogi-Coulomb criteria. 
This is illustrated in Figure 6.2(a), where the spread among the results is very obvious. The 
lack  of  involving  all  the  three  principal  stresses  at  rock  failure,  by  implementing  Mohr-
Coulomb criterion, has produced conservative results. The difference in results depends up on 
the stress state at the borehole wall. Normally, the stress state is not a triaxial stress state with 
σ2  = σ3  or σ2  = σ1;  rather,  it  is  a  polyaxial  stress  state  in  which σ2  is  a  true  intermediate 
principal stress.

Non-vertical borehole failure analysis

 

Another example is a horizontal borehole assumed to be drilled in a sandstone formation with 
higher cohesion and friction angle, at a depth of 6000 ft. The rock properties, in situ stresses 
and  pore  pressure  are  listed  in  Table  6.1.  In  this  situation,  both  criteria  predicted  quite 
different collapse pressures (see Figure 6.2(b)). Again, the Mohr-Coulomb criterion predicted 
a  conservative  collapse  pressure.  Moreover,  in  this  case,  the  difference  between  the 
maximum and the minimum horizontal stresses is small compared to the first example (i.e., 
lesser  horizontal  stress  anisotropy).  Thus,  the  variation  of  the  critical  mud  pressure  at 
different  orientations  is  lower  than  that  in  the  first  example.  When  the  horizontal  stress  is 
isotropic, the collapse pressure will be constant, and so, borehole orientation has no influence 
on  the  collapse  pressure  in  this  situation.  This  means  that  the  variation  of  the  collapse 
pressure  at  different  borehole  orientations  depends  on  the  degree  of  anisotropy  of  the 
horizontal stress.  

In both examples, the variation of the collapse pressure at various azimuths using the Mohr-
Coulomb criterion is approximately twice that obtained using the Mogi-Coulomb criterion. 
Hence, there is an effect of horizontal stress anisotropy, but not as pronounced as predicted 
by the Mohr-Coulomb criterion. 

As a third example, assume that a horizontal borehole is drilled in sandstone formation, at a 
depth  of  4000  ft,  with  rock  prosperities  and  stresses  as  follows:  c  =  620  psi, φ  =  31.4°, 
ν = 0.3, σv = 0.89 psi/ft, σH = σh= 0.95 psi/ft, and P0 = 0.45 psi/ft. Since we have a RF stress 
regime  with  isotropic  horizontal  stresses,  Eqs.  (6.14)  and  (6.18)  can  be  directly  applied  to 
determine  the  collapse  pressure,  where θ  =0°.  The  Mohr-Coulomb  criterion  estimated  the 
minimum overbalance pressure to be equal to 486 psi, whereas the Mogi-Coulomb criterion 
predicted that 234 psi is just sufficient to maintain the stability of the borehole. 

The  developed  Mohr-Coulomb  and  Mogi-Coulomb  borehole  failure  criteria  can  also  be 
applied to the SS stress regime. This requires that the field conditions satisfy Eq. (6.6). For 
instance, in the second example, if the maximum horizontal stress is equal to 0.95 psi/ft, then 
the sandstone formation is under a SS stress regime at a depth of 6000 ft (see Table 6.1). In 
this  case,  Eq.  (6.6)  has  been  satisfied  for  borehole  orientation  α  =  0°-54.73°,  where  the 
maximum  tangential  stress  will  develop  at  θ  =  ±π/2.  At  any  other  borehole  orientation, 
borehole  collapse  will  initiate  at  θ  =  0  or  π,  and  the  collapse  pressure  should  be  then 
determined using a numerical model. Figure 6.3 shows the calculated minimum overbalance 
pressure for the two borehole failure criteria at α = 0°-50°. It is apparent that Mohr-Coulomb 
criterion is significantly conservative in this situation. 

6.3  Analytical model for deviated borehole failure analysis 
In  deviated  borehole,  the  stresses  at  the  borehole  wall  can  be  calculated  using  Eq.  (3.14). 
These  stresses  should  be  compared  with  a  failure  criterion,  in  order  to  determine  the 
minimum mud pressure required to prevent borehole collapse. In principal, the calculations of 
the  collapse  pressure  in  deviated  boreholes  are  similar  to  those  in  vertical  and  horizontal 
boreholes. However, the tangential and axial stresses are not essentially principal stresses, as 
the shear stress, σθz, may be non-zero. The tangential and axial principal stresses should be 
determined using Eqs. (2.13) and (2.14), before introducing the stresses into a suitable failure 
criterion.  If  the  principal  stresses  are  introduced  into  the  Mogi-Coulomb  criterion,  a  4th-
degree  equation  needs  to  be  solved  for  the  collapse  pressure.  In  this  case,  the  collapse 
pressure  can  be  easily  determined  numerically  by  applying  iterative  loops  in  a  computer 
program, rather than dealing with burdensome analytical expression. However, if the Mohr-

There  are  three  possible  permutations  of  the  principal  stresses  in  the  radial,  tangential  and 
axial directions. In general, borehole collapse corresponds to case 1 and case 2, where the 
radial  stress  is  the  minimum  principal  stress.  The  stress  state  in  these  cases  could  be 
expressed as σ1 ≥ σ2 ≥ σr. By introducing Eq. (3.14) into Eqs. (2.13) and (2.14), the principal 
stresses become

It is obvious that the maximum and intermediate principal stresses are function of the angle θ. 
This angle indicates the orientation of the principal stresses around the wellbore circumference. 

76 

Non-vertical borehole failure analysis

 

In vertical and horizontal borehole stability analysis, the angle θ corresponding to the highest 
stress concentration had been first specified. Similarly, in deviated borehole stability analysis, 
the  location  of  the  maximum  stress  concentration  (θmax)  should  be  estimated  before 
introducing the principal stresses into a failure criterion. 

The stress concentration around the wellbore circumference is dominated by the tangential 
stress (e.g., Aadnoy, 1988; Aadnoy, 1990; Hossain et al., 2000; Kårstad and Aadnoy, 2005). 
Actually both normal stresses, the tangential and axial stresses, will reach their maximum and 
minimum values at the same points. On the other hand, the shear stresses are usually an order 
of  magnitude  smaller  than  the  normal  stresses,  and  so,  the  influence  of  the  squared  shear 
stress on the orientation of the maximum stress concentration is negligible. By taking the first 
derivative  of  σθ, σθd  or σz  with  respect  to θ,  the  locations  of  the  maximum  and  minimum 
stress concentrations become

These two angles should be then used to calculate σθd or σz, in order to identify the one that is 
associated with the maximum stress concentration, that is, θmax = θ1 or θ2. This simplified 
analytical method for determining θmax may be more convenient than employing an iterative 
loop to carry out the estimation numerically. 

In the general case θ1 is given by (Djurhuus and Aadnoy, 2003):

The squared shear stress component in the above equation has a small magnitude which, if 
neglected, will reduce Eq. (6.25) to Eq. (6.24) (Djurhuus and Aadnoy, 2003). In other words, 
the shear stress component may only deviate the tangential stress slightly from the principal 
direction (Aadnoy, 1988). For simplicity, therefore, Eq. (6.24) will be used to determine the 
location of the maximum stress concentration. 

By introducing Eqs. (6.22) into Eq. (5.14), for θ = θmax, the collapse pressure is defined by

The Mohr-Coulomb borehole failure criterion, therefore, could be simplified into one single 
equation.  However,  we  should  keep  in  mind  that  the  criterion  requires  us  first  to  evaluate 
θmax. It would be advantageous if the estimation of θmax could be simplified further.

Introducing  Eq.  (6.29)  into  Eq.  (6.30)  reveals  that  the  vertical  stress  must  be  less  than  or 
equal  to  the  horizontal  stress  for  the  maximum  stress  concentration  to  occur  at  θ  =  0°. 
Borehole collapse, therefore, will develop at θmax = 0° only in RF stress regimes.

By substituting Eq. (6.29) in Eq. (6.31), the vertical stress must be greater than or equal to the 
horizontal  stress  for  the  highest  tangential  stress  to  develop  at  θ    =  90°.  Consequently, 
borehole collapse will initiate at θmax = 90° only in NF stress regime. 

As  a  result,  when  the  studied  field  case  is  under  isotropic  horizontal  stress,  the  borehole 
failure  criterion  expressed  by  Eq.  (6.26)  can  be  directly  applied.  Otherwise,  the  suggested 
analytical method to evaluate θmax must be carried out first. 

6.3.1  Numerical evaluation of collapse pressure 
The  analytical  method  developed  here  for  estimating  the  collapse  pressure  resulted  in  a 
manageable  framework  what  would  otherwise require  a  complicated numerical  method.  In 
the  development  of  an  oil  field,  the  suggested  analytical  method  can  be  used  as  a  quick 
approach  for  assessing  drilling  alternatives.  However,  the  recommended  closed-form 
analytical expressions do not cover all field scenarios. This deficiency can be eliminated by 
estimating  the  collapse  pressure  numerically.  For  this  purpose,  a  computer  program  in 
Mathcad has been written to evaluate the collapse pressure (see Appendix B).  

Mathcad is a technical calculation tool that is as versatile and powerful as a programming 
language. In Mathcad, the equations are displayed in the same fashion you would write them 
on  paper,  and  the  problems  are  solved  much  the  same  way  people  do,  rather  than  making 
your solution process fit the program’s way of doing things (Larsen, 2001). This makes the 
worksheets easy to read and follow. In addition, Mathcad updates results and redraws graphs 
as soon as you make a change anywhere in your worksheet. This makes it easy to keep track 
of  the  most  complex  equations.  As  a  result,  it  has  been  decided  to  utilize  Mathcad  for 
wellbore stability analysis.

Non-vertical borehole failure analysis

 

The developed analytical model requires us first to define the following input parameters: (a) 
the depth of the studied formation, (b) the gradients of the in situ stresses and pore pressure, 
(c) the cohesion, friction angle and Poisson’s ratio, and (d) the borehole trajectory (azimuth 
and deviation). These parameters should be introduced in US units, which is the typical unit 
system used in the petroleum industry. 

After having the field stresses at the depth of interest, the in situ stresses in the vicinity of the 
borehole,  expressed  in  the  (x,y,z)  co-ordinate  system,  are  estimated  using  Eq.(3.12)  (see 
Appendix B). Then, the location of the maximum stress concentration (θmax) is evaluated by 
utilizing Eqs. (6.23) and (6.24), as explained previously. At this critical location, the local 
field stresses is transformed from a Cartesian co-ordinate system to a cylindrical (r,θ,z) co-
ordinate  system,  using  Eq.  (3.14).  The  axial  and  shear  stresses  in  the  θ-z  plane  are 
independent of the applied mud pressure, and so they can be estimated directly at θ = θmax. 
The  radial  and  tangential  stresses,  however,  are  functions  of  the  mud  pressure.  In  this 
situation,  an  iterative  loop  is  essential  to  evaluate  the  collapse  pressure  for  each  failure 
criterion.  

To avoid under balanced drilling and the collapse pressure exceeding the fracture pressure, 
the program loop will carry out the iterative solution process for the mud pressure range from 
the  pore  pressure  to  the  minimum  in  situ  stress.  Furthermore,  the  principal  stresses  in  the 
axial  and  tangential  directions  must  be  determined  before  introducing  the  stresses  into  a 
failure criterion. In this case, the three principal stresses are as defined by Eq. (6.22) where θ 
= θmax,  but,  without  prior  knowledge  of  there  actual  order.  After  identifying  the  principal 
stresses, a failure function, F, is applied to determine the collapse pressure. According to the 
Mogi-Coulomb criterion, the failure function is

For instance, the failure functions vs. the mud pressure are plotted in Figure 6.4 for conditions 
as in Table 6.2. The failure functions are negative at Pw = P0 = 4500 psi and until the mud 
pressure  reached  the  collapse  pressure,  which  indicates  an  unstable  borehole.  It  should  be 
noted that applying the Mohr-Coulomb criterion has increased the unstable range of the mud 
pressure,  due  to  its  conservative  nature.  When  the  mud  pressure  exceeds  the  collapse 
pressure,  the  borehole  is  going  to  be  stable,  and  this  is  represented  by  a  positive  failure 
function.  

In the developed program, consequently, the mud pressure increases from the pore pressure 
until the stable region is attained (i.e., F > 0), after which the program will stop immediately. 
Moreover, the evaluation of the collapse pressure is performed for a sequence of borehole 
trajectories  by  writing  the  variables  as  vectors  in  which  the  subscripts  are  the  borehole 
deviation  and  azimuth  (see  Appendix  B).  This  will  assist  identifying  the  optimum  drilling 
direction with respect to the mechanical wellbore stability, if necessary.

6.4  Published analytical solutions for collapse pressure 
The  suggested  closed-form  analytical  expressions  for  collapse  pressure  using  the  Mohr-
Coulomb  and  the  Mogi-Coulomb  failure  criteria  are  presented  here  for  the  first  time. 
Although  the  Mohr-Coulomb  criterion  is  a  classical  failure  criterion,  in  the  literature  the 
evaluation of collapse pressure is usually carried out numerically due to the complexity of the 
equations involved in the analysis. Recently, Ewy (1998; 1999) introduced the only closed-
form  general  solution  for  the  collapse  pressure,  which  is  applicable  to  all  wellbore 
orientations and in situ stress states. This was achieved by modifying the Lade criterion so 
that  the  strengthening  effect  of  the  intermediate  principal  stress,  together  with  Coulomb 
strength parameters (c and φ), are considered.  

The  Lade  criterion  is  a  non-linear  polyaxial  criterion  developed  for  soils  that  does  not 
consider the effective cohesion of the materials. This failure criterion is given by

where pa is the atmospheric pressure, and m′ and η1 are material constants. By assuming m′ 
equal to zero, the criterion will predict a linear shear strength increase with increasing I1. This 
form  is  similar  to  that  initially  introduced  by  Lade  and  Duncan  for  cohesionless  soils.  To 
maintain  a  linear  failure  envelope  and  consider  materials  with  cohesion,  Ewy  (1998) 
proposed  that  the  stress  axes  be  shifted  into  the  tensile  region  by  a  constant  with  units  of 
cohesion.  The  material  constants  were  redefined  so  that  the  criterion  is  equivalent  to  the 
Mohr-Coulomb criterion for triaxial compression stress state (σ1 > σ2 = σ3). The “modified 
Lade” criterion developed by Ewy (1998) is given by

It should be noted that the above equations will calculate the mud pressure for a specified 
position around the wellbore circumference. The calculations should be repeated at different 
θ values, and the collapse pressure will be equal to the lowest mud pressure. Alternatively, 
the location of the maximum stress concentration (θmax) can be initially identified following 
the suggested method in section 6.3. Then, the collapse pressure can be evaluated using Eqs.

7 Applications of the borehole stability model 

We have developed a new stability model for borehole failure analysis by implementing the 
Mogi-Coulomb law. This model leads to a closed-form analytical expression for calculating 
the  critical  mud  pressure  required  to  maintain  wellbore  stability  in  a  variety  of  field 
situations. Utilizing the new Mathcad program in Appendix B to study wellbore stability, we 
can evaluate the model numerically for all field scenarios. In this chapter, wellbore stability 
calculations using different failure criteria will be presented. This is mainly to highlight the 
difference  in  predictions  of  wellbore  instability  with  respect  to  the  failure  criterion.  The 
developed model will be then used to study the behaviour of the collapse pressure at different 
in situ stress regimes for arbitrarily oriented boreholes. It will be also applied to determine the 
critical  mud  pressure  using  field  data  from  different  geological  environments.  This  indeed 
will  appraise  the  applicability  of  Mogi-Coulomb  criterion  in  field  scale.  Furthermore,  the 
model will be utilized to evaluate the optimum drilling trajectory. 

7.1  Predictions of deviated wellbore instability and the selection of a failure criterion 
The  selection  of  a  failure  criterion  can  make  a  pronounced  effect  on  wellbore  instability 
predictions.  This  has  been  confirmed  for  vertical  and  horizontal  wellbore  stability 
calculations  in  Chapter  5  and  6.  In  this  section,  for  deviated  wellbores,  the  difference  in 
calculations  of  the  collapse  pressure  using  Mogi-Coulomb  criterion,  Mohr-Coulomb 
criterion, modified Lade criterion and Drucker-Prager criterion are revealed. For this purpose, 
borehole  stability  studies  are  conducted  on  three  typical  rock  formations  at  different  field 
conditions. The rock properties, in situ stresses and pore pressure are taken from Ewy (1999) 
and listed in Table 7.1.

In the presented formations, the collapse pressure will be the same at any drilling direction or 
borehole  azimuth  (α)  since  the  horizontal  stress  is  isotropic.  Therefore,  the  critical  mud 
pressure required to prevent instability is only a function of borehole deviation from vertical 
and  the  failure  criterion.  The  minimum  overbalance  pressure  (collapse  pressure  −  pore 
pressure) is calculated using the Mogi-Coulomb criterion, the Mohr-Coulomb criterion and 
the  modified  Lade  criterion  at  various  borehole  inclinations,  by  utilizing  the  developed 

84 

Applications of the borehole stability model

 

program  (see  Appendix  B).  The  estimated  overbalance  pressure  using  the  Drucker-Prager 
criterion  is  reproduced  from  Ewy  (1999).  Figure  7.1  illustrates  the  evaluation  of  the 
overbalance pressure by employing different failure criteria. It should be emphasized that the 
calculations  are  performed  so  that  the  well  pressure  is  not  less  than  the  pore  pressure  or 
greater than the minimum in situ stress, as explained in the previous chapter.  

Despite the variety of rock properties and field conditions in the three examples, it is obvious 
that  the  Mohr-Coulomb  criterion  results  in  a  significantly  conservative  prediction  of  the 
collapse pressure. This is mainly due to its neglect of the effect of the intermediate principal 
stress, since in the field σ2 is not necessarily equal to σ1 or σ3.  

In triaxial stress states (σ2 = σ3 or σ2 = σ1), we have shown that the Mogi-Coulomb criterion 
is  equivalent  to  the  Mohr-Coulomb  criterion.  Nevertheless,  the  Mogi-Coulomb  criterion 
predicts  a  lower  collapse  pressure  for  almost  all  borehole  inclinations.  This  indicates  the 
presence of a polyaxial stress state around the wellbore circumference, which is commonly 
encountered  in  situ.  On  the  other  hand,  for  vertical  boreholes  in  sandstone  and  shale 
formations, Mogi-Coulomb and Mohr-Coulomb predict similar collapse pressures (see Figure 
7.1(a)-(b)). In these examples, the intermediate principal stress at the wall of the wellbore is 
very  close  to  the  maximum  principal  stress.  This  reveals  that  the  Mogi-Coulomb  criterion 
will automatically reduce to the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion if two of the in situ principal 
stresses are nearly equal (i.e., if σ2 is close to σ1 or σ3).  

By  comparison,  the  Drucker-Prager  criterion  always  underestimates  the  mud  pressure 
required to prevent instability. This is due to the (incorrect) strengthening effect that arises 
from the use of the octahedral normal stress, σoct, instead of the effective mean stress, σm,2.   

In the studied examples, the Mogi-Coulomb criterion and the modified Lade criterion give 
similar values for the collapse pressure. Both of these criteria, in general, predict a collapse 
pressure that lies between the values predicted by the Mohr-Coulomb and the Drucker-Prager 
criteria. The biggest difference in predicted collapse pressure between these criteria was for 
vertical  boreholes  in  sandstone  and  shale  formations.  This  spread  among  the  results  is 
generated from the application of different weightings of σ2. The modified Lade criterion is 
equivalent  to  the  Mohr-Coulomb  criterion  only  when σ2  = σ3  (Ewy,  1999),  while  in  these 
examined  cases σ2  is  close  to σ1.  As  a  result,  the  modified  Lade  criterion  gives  collapse 
pressures  which  re  lower  than  those  predicted  by  the  approximately  equivalent  Mogi-
Coulomb  and  Mohr-Coulomb  criteria.  Accordingly,  the  Mogi-Coulomb  criterion  gives 
predictions of the collapse pressure that are similar to those of the modified Lade criterion in 
polyaxial stress states, and similar to those of the Mohr-Coulomb criterion in triaxial stress 
states.  

7.2  Simulations for the collapse pressure in various stress regimes 
The estimation of collapse pressure depends basically on the various applied stresses around 
the borehole, in addition to the rock failure criterion. The magnitudes, directions and mutual 
relationships of the in situ stresses are of paramount importance. Drillers generally have the 
notion that vertical boreholes are more stable than deviated and horizontal boreholes. This 
concept  will  be  examined  using  the  developed  stability  model  in  different  in  situ  stress 
regimes.

Applications of the borehole stability model

 

Simulations of collapse pressures are conducted for a rock formation with cohesion equal to 
740 psi, a friction angle of 33° and a Poisson’s ratio of 0.25, such as would be typical for 
sandstone.  The  formation  is  assumed  to  exist  at  a  depth  of  8000  ft,  with  pore  pressure 
gradient  of  0.45  psi/ft,  in  different  in  situ  stress  regimes  that  are  listed  in  Table  7.2.  The 
minimum overbalance pressures at different borehole inclinations (i) and directions/azimuths 
(α) are shown in Figures 7.2-7.7. The calculations have been carried out using both the Mogi-
Coulomb and the Mohr-Coulomb criteria. 

In NF stress regimes, it is apparent that a vertical borehole is more stable than a horizontal 
borehole, and almost all deviated boreholes in all directions (see Figure 7.2). However, the 
optimum  drilling  trajectory  is  not  necessarily  vertical.  In  this  case,  the  lowest  overbalance 
pressure  that  is  required  to  prevent  borehole  instability  is  for  a  40°-deviated  borehole  in  a 
direction parallel to the minimum in situ stress (i.e., σh). The stability model has been also 
applied in an NF stress regime for three different formations in the previous section, where 
the  horizontal  stress  is  isotropic.  In  these  cases  the  optimized  trajectories  are  vertical  and 
nearly vertical, that is, around i = 0°-10° (see Figure 7.1 for the collapse densities predicted 
by the Mogi-Coulomb criterion). 

At  the  boundary  between  normal  faulting  and  strike-slip  stress  regimes  (i.e.,  NF-SS  stress 
regime),  a  horizontal  borehole  is  more  stable  than  a  vertical  or  a  deviated  borehole  (see 
Figure 7.3). The optimum drilling direction is still parallel to the minimum horizontal stress. 
Accordingly, when the horizontal stress is isotropic, the optimum drilling inclination is zero, 
which progressively increases towards 90° as the intermediate principal in situ stress (i.e., σH)

In SS stress regimes the maximum horizontal stress is greater than the vertical stress. As a 
result,  horizontal  boreholes  are  more  stable  than  vertical  and  deviated  boreholes  in  all 
directions.  In  this  case,  the  optimum  drilling  direction  is  30°  from  the  direction  of  the 
maximum in situ stress (see Figure 7.4).  

88 

Applications of the borehole stability model

 

In  the  boundary  between  strike-slip  and  reverse  faulting  stress  regimes  (i.e.,  SS-RF  stress 
regime), the optimum well path is for horizontal borehole drilled parallel to the maximum in 
situ  stress  (see  Figure  7.5).  Consequently,  when  the  intermediate  principal in  situ  stress  is 
equal  to  the  maximum  principal  stress  (i.e., σv  = σH,  NF-SS  stress  regime)  the  optimum 
drilling direction is 90°, and gradually decreases to zero as the intermediate principal in situ 
stress reaches the minimum principal stress (i.e., σv = σh, SS-RF stress regime). 

In  an  RF  stress  regime  with  anisotropic  horizontal  stress,  the  optimum  drilling  inclination 
fluctuates between horizontal and vertical, depending up on the applied drilling direction (see 
Figure  7.6).  In  a  direction  close  to  σh,  vertical  boreholes  are  the  most  stable  boreholes, 
whereas in the direction close to σH, horizontal boreholes are the most stable ones. In this 
situation, the optimum drilling direction is parallel to the maximum principal in situ stress 
(i.e.,  σH),  and  the  lowest  collapse  pressure  is  associated  with  50°-deviated  borehole. 
However, if the horizontal stress is isotropic, the most stable borehole is vertical (see Figure 
7.7). 

In all the stress regimes, changing the orientation of the borehole in a plane perpendicular to 
the maximum principal in situ stress (i.e., the σ2-σ3 plane) will not significantly influence the 
collapse  pressure  that  is  predicted  by  Mohr-Coulomb  criterion.  The  rate  of  change  of  the 
collapse  pressure  with  respect  to  the  well  orientation  in  the σ2-σ3  plane,  using  the  Mohr-
Coulomb criterion, is at least twice that predicted by applying the Mogi-Coulomb criterion. 
For instance, in an NF stress regime where the σ2-σ3 plane is horizontal, the collapse pressure 
varies with direction (α) when the horizontal stresses are unequal (i.e., σ2 ≠ σ3). In this case, 
the spread among the results in different directions is not as great as would be estimated by 
the Mohr-Coulomb criterion (see Figures 7.2 and 7.3). In particular, wellbore stability is not 
sensitive to the horizontal well orientation, according to Mogi-Coulomb criterion. As a result, 
the  Mohr-Coulomb  criterion  has  conservatively  extrapolated  the  effect  of  horizontal  stress 
anisotropy  on  collapse  pressure.  This  conclusion  was  also  reached  previously  in  our 
horizontal borehole stability analysis (see section 6.2.1).  

Recently, Morita (2004) derived an empirical correlation using laboratory and field borehole 
stability data to numerically evaluate the influence of well orientation on borehole stability. 
He concluded that the effect of horizontal well orientation on borehole stability is trivial in 
NF  stress  regime,  which  is  consistent  with  Mogi-Coulomb  predictions.  Accordingly,  the 
utilization  of  the  Mohr-Coulomb  criterion  in  horizontal  stress  evaluation  may  result  in 
misleading predictions, particularly in NF stress regimes. To further support our conclusion, a 
field case study in the UK continental shelf will be presented later in this chapter. 

We  have  seen  that  the  choice  of  a  failure  criterion  can  make  a  profound  difference  in  the 
results  of  wellbore  stability  modelling.  At  all  borehole  trajectories,  the  Mohr-Coulomb 
criterion predicts a required minimum overbalance pressure that is always greater than that 
which is estimated by the Mogi-Coulomb criterion (see Figures 7.2 through 7.7). Therefore, a 
borehole  stability  analysis  carried  out  by  implementing  Mohr-Coulomb  criterion  will  give 
conservative results in all in situ stress regimes, which can be improved by employing the 
Mogi-Coulomb criterion instead.

In summary, drilling vertical boreholes will minimize the potential borehole instability only 
when the horizontal in situ stress is isotropic. Having anisotropic horizontal stress, which is 
the  common  case,  will  divert  the  optimum  well  path  from  the  vertical  direction.  In  this 
situation,  deviated  and  horizontal  boreholes  are  potentially  more  stable  than  vertical 
boreholes.  Non-vertical  boreholes  should  be  drilled  in  the  direction  of  σh  in  NF  stress 
regimes, and in the direction of σH in RF stress regime, with respect to mechanical wellbore 
stability. Furthermore, horizontal boreholes are essential to optimize borehole stability in SS 
stress  regimes.  Generally,  a  direction  parallel  or  close  to  the  maximum  in  situ  stress  is  a 
favourable  drilling  direction  with  respect  to  borehole  stability  in  any  stress  regime.  This 
drilling trajectory, however, is not necessary associated with the lowest required mud density 
to prevent instability. The divergence of the optimal drilling trajectory from the direction of 
the maximum in situ stress is mainly a result of the mutual relationships of the in situ stresses. 

7.3  Well path optimization 
In  all  the  presented  examples  in  this  chapter,  the  optimal  well  path  is  almost  the  same 
regardless  of  the  applied  failure  criterion.  It  seems  that  the  failure  criterion  does  not 
significantly  influence  the  optimal  drilling  trajectory.  Therefore,  well  path  optimization  is 
mainly controlled by the relative magnitude of the in situ stresses. This conclusion has been 
also reported in a number of publications (e.g., Chen et al., 1996; Zhou et al., 1996; Moos et 
al., 1998; Djurhuus and Aadnoy, 2003; Kårstad and Aadnoy, 2005). Furthermore, we have 
shown  that  the  optimum  drilling  inclination  progressively  changes  as  the  intermediate 
principal  in situ  stress  increases  from  the  minimum  to  maximum  principal  in  situ  stresses. 
This gives rise to the existence of a potentially explicit correlation of the optimum drilling 
inclination and the anisotropic field stresses.  

From the inspection of Figures 7.1 through 7.7, it has been found that the lowest collapse 
pressure  is  always  associated  with  boreholes  drilled  in  the σ1-σ3  plane.  In  each  case,  the 
optimal well path is deviated from the maximum principal in situ stress by a specific angle, 
say  γ.  It  would  be  advantageous  if  the  optimum  well  path  could  be  directly  and  simply 
correlated to the principal in situ stresses (i.e., σv, σH and σh). In this section we will try to 
derive the relationship between the optimum drilling inclination γ and the field stresses. 

Shear failure of the borehole wall will take place when the stress concentration around the 
borehole exceeds the compressive strength of the rock. The maximum principal stress at the 
borehole  wall  is  a  function  of  the  tangential  and  axial  stresses.  Both  of  these  stresses  will 
reach  their  maximum  and  minimum  values  at  the  same  position  around  the  wellbore 
circumference (see section 6.3). The position of the optimum well path can be estimated by 
searching for the lowest critical stress concentration around a borehole in σ1-σ3 plane. 

First of all, the virgin formation stresses expressed in the (x,y,z) co-ordinate system should be 
generalized by replacing σv, σH and σh by σ1, σ2 and σ3, respectively (see Figures 3.2a and 
7.8). The virgin formation stresses are then defined by

In this form, the angle α corresponds to the deviation of the borehole from σ2, and the angle i

where γ is the deviation angle of the borehole from the maximum principal in situ stress in

The stress function represents the overall anisotropic level of the field stress. It has a value of 
zero when σ2 = σ3 that increases up to 1 when σ2 = σ1. The stress function n = 0 in NF stress 
regimes  with  isotropic  horizontal  stress,  and  in  SS-RF  stress  regimes.  In  these  field  stress 
systems, the optimum well path is parallel to the maximum principal in situ stress. When the 
stress function reaches a value of 1, the optimum well path will be parallel to the minimum 
principal  in  situ  stress.  This  will  take  place  in  RF  stress  regimes  with  isotropic  horizontal 
stress, and in NF-SS stress regimes. 

In NF stress regimes, the optimum drilling trajectory is deviated from vertical by i =γ in a 
direction parallel to the minimum horizontal stress (α = 90). In SS stress regimes, the most 
stable borehole is horizontal with a drilling direction α =γ. In RF stress regimes, the wellbore 
should be drilled in the direction of the maximum horizontal stress (α = 0) with a drilling 
inclination i = (90o - γ) to minimize borehole instability. 

The  analytical  solution  has  been  used  to  optimize  wellbore  profiles  for  the  representative 
field  examples  studied  in  section  7.2.  The  calculated  stress  function,  n,  and  the  angle  of 
deviation from the maximum principal in situ stress at different stress regimes are listed in 
Table 7.3. The previous evaluation of the collapse pressure using the stability model has been 
carried out at certain incremental orientations. Even so, it is apparent that the evaluation of 
the optimal drilling trajectory using Eq. (7.6) is similar to the stability model (see Table 7.3 
and Figures 7.2 through 7.7). 

According to Eq. (6.24), the angle θ is a function of the normal and shear stresses in the x-y 
plane. In the σ1-σ3 plane there is no shear stress (i.e., 
xyσ = ), and so θmax = 0 or π/2. The

exact orientation of the maximum stress concentration, θmax, will alternate between 0 and π/2 
as  the  borehole  orientations  moves  from  the  maximum  principal  stress  direction  to  the 
minimum principal stress direction. At the optimum well path, by comparing Eq. (7.2) with 
Eq.  (7.5),  the  normal  stresses  are  equal  (i.e., 
),  which  result  in  no  stress  variation 
around the borehole. This alternation of stress state around the optimum drilling trajectory 
may cause a dramatic alteration of collapse pressure. For instance, in Figure 7.2 the rate of 
change of collapse pressure has significantly increased after the optimum drilling inclination. 
This  special  behaviour  of  collapse  pressure  around  the  optimum  well  path  has  been  also 
reported by Garrouch and Ebrahim (2001).

In these examples, borehole failure at the optimum well path occurred under polyaxial stress 
states. If the studied case is under a stress state where the intermediate principal stress is close 
to the maximum or minimum principal stress at borehole failure, γ may be slightly altered. 
This statement is only true when applying Mogi-Coulomb failure criterion (see Figure 7.1). 
At such stress states, the Mogi-Coulomb criterion is reduced from a polyaxial failure criterion 
to  the  Mohr-Coulomb  failure  criterion,  which  causes  a  variation  in  the  weighting  of  σ2. 
Otherwise, the failure criterion has a trivial influence on the optimal drilling trajectory (see 
Figure 7.2 through 7.7). In general, Eq. (7.6) should be used as a quick, rough guideline to 
design the most favourable drilling trajectory with regards to wellbore stability.

7.4  Field case studies 
In  this  section,  we  will  apply  the  developed  analytical  model  to  analyze  the  instability 
problems for various wells worldwide.  

7.4.1  Cyrus reservoir in the UK Continental Shelf 
The first case study is conducted on a sandstone formation from the Cyrus reservoir in the 
UK Continental Shelf (McLean and Addis, 1990b). From triaxial tests, the sandstone has a 
cohesion of 860 psi, a friction angle of 43.8°, and a Poisson’s ratio of 0.2. At a depth of about

8530 ft, the vertical stress is equivalent to the overburden pressure, equal to 1 psi/ft, and the 
pore pressure is taken at 0.45 psi/ft. Since no horizontal stress measurements were available 
at this depth, McLean and Addis (1990b) arbitrarily assumed σH = σh= 0.75 psi/ft. 

In this reservoir, vertical and horizontal wells drilled successfully with an oil-based mud of 
density of 9.6 lb/gal (0.5 psi/ft). Since no instability problems were reported, it is possible 
that even lower mud densities could have been used. This mud density is actually somewhere 
between  the  collapse  and  fracture  densities.  Therefore,  a  mud  density  of  9.6  lb/gal  can  be 
taken as an upper bound for the collapse density, and a lower bound for the fracture density 
or  the  minimum  in  situ  stress  gradient  (i.e.,  σh).  As  seen  in  Figure  7.9(a),  the  collapse 
densities  predicted  by  the  Mohr-Coulomb  criterion  have  exceeded  the  actually  used  mud 
density  for  horizontal  and  most  deviated  boreholes.  This  may  be  because  of  an  improper 
assumption regarding the in situ horizontal stress, or an inappropriate failure criterion.

Applications of the borehole stability model

 

The ratio of the minimum horizontal stress to the vertical stress (σh/σv) ranges from 0.3 to 
1.5, as mentioned in Section 5.1. In this field, the horizontal stress is hence potentially in the 
range  of  around  0.5-1.5  psi/ft.  Simulations  for  collapse  densities  using  the  Mohr-Coulomb 
criterion over the practical range of the horizontal stress show that no horizontal well can be 
drilled  at  or  below  9.6  lb/gal.  Consequently,  applying  the  Mohr-Coulomb  law  to  predict 
borehole instability in this sandstone formation gives unrealistic results. 

The  Mogi-Coulomb  criterion  has  also  predicted  higher  collapse  densities  than  the  one 
actually used, for horizontal and some deviated boreholes (see Figure 7.9(a)). Nevertheless, 
simulations  for  collapse  densities  using  the  Mogi-Coulomb  criterion  reveal  that  horizontal 
wells can be drilled in this field even below the actually used mud density, if the horizontal 
stress is assumed to be in the range of 0.86-1.07 psi/ft. For instance, Figure 7.9(b) shows the 
predicted collapse densities assuming a horizontal stress equal to 0.86 psi/ft. In this situation, 
it is apparent that the Mogi-Coulomb criterion represents field conditions more realistically 
than does the Mohr-Coulomb criterion. Furthermore, the evaluation of the horizontal stress 
can be improved by utilizing the Mogi-Coulomb law. 

7.4.2  Gas reservoir in offshore Indonesia 
The second case study is performed on a shale formation from Pagerungan Island Gas field, 
north  of  Bali,  Indonesia  (Ramos  et  al.,  1998).  From  compressive  strength  tests,  the  intact 
shale has a cohesion of 1800 psi, a friction angle of 35°, and a Poisson’s ratio of 0.3. This 
hard brittle shale is located at a depth of 4800 ft to 6200 ft. In this formation, well PGA-2 has 
been drilled successfully with a mud density of 10.5 lb/gal. This mud density can be taken as 
an upper bound for the collapse density, since no instability problems reported.  

In well PGA-2, the vertical stress is estimated to be about 1 psi/ft. From leak-off tests, the 
minimum  and  maximum  horizontal  stresses  are  equal  to  0.87  psi/ft  and  1.22  psi/ft 
respectively.  The  direction  of  the  maximum  horizontal  stress  is  in  the  region  of  N10E  to 
N35E  based  on  the  orientations  of  borehole  breakouts.  The  well  is  drilled  at  25-degrees 
deviation in a direction of N47E. Therefore, the well has a drilling direction (α) in the range 
of around 10-40 degrees from the maximum horizontal stress.  

In this case study, the collapse densities have been calculated at a depth of 6000 ft, where 
pore  pressure  is  assumed  equal  to  0.45  psi/ft.  Simulations  for  collapse  densities  using  the 
Mohr-Coulomb criterion predict that the well will not be stable at the actually applied mud 
density  (see  Figure  7.10(a)).  The  Mohr-Coulomb  criterion  predicted  that  the  mud  density 
should  be  greater  than  11.35-11.45  lb/gal  to  ensure  the  stability  of  25-degrees  deviated 
borehole, that is, about 0.9 lb/gal above the actually used mud density. Otherwise, a stable 
borehole can be drilled in this formation at the applied mud density only by increasing the 
borehole inclination to 50-degrees and above. 

On the other hand, the Mogi-Coulomb criterion has predicted that the borehole will be stable 
at  any  inclination,  and  even  lower  collapse  densities  than  the  actual  used  one  can  be 
implemented  (see  Figure  7.10(b)).  In  this  situation,  the  collapse  density  for  a  25-degree 
deviated borehole is estimated to be 9.15-9.26 lb/gal, which is about 2.2 lb/gal lower than that 
estimated  using  the  Mohr-Coulomb  criterion.  This  significant  difference  in  evaluation  of 
collapse density is clearly pointing to the dependency of the studied field on the intermediate 
principal stress (i.e., the field is σ2-dependent).

Applications of the borehole stability model

 

7.4.3  Wanaea oilfield in the Northwest Shelf of Australia 
The  developed  stability  model  has  been  applied  to  the  Wanaea  field  of  the  Australian 
Northwest Shelf. In this field, drilling vertical boreholes required mud densities close to the 
fracture gradient, which results in a development plan that proposed deviated and horizontal 
wells  (Kingsborough  et  al.,  1991).  The  most  stable  drilling  direction  in  Wanaea  field  has 
been found to be horizontal in the azimuth of the minimum horizontal stress (Zhou et al., 
1994). 

In Wanaea 3, a vertical borehole drilled through a shale formation at a depth of about 7028 ft 
where pore pressure is equal to 0.49 psi/ft. The shale has cohesion of 435 psi and a friction 
angle of 31°. The plausible in situ stresses have been determined by Kingsborough and co-
workers (1991) as follows: σv = 0.92 psi/ft, σh = 0.69-0.75 psi/ft and σH = 0.85-0.92 psi/ft. 
Evaluation  of  collapse  densities  using  the  stability  model  reveals  that  the  maximum 
horizontal stress must be equal to or greater than the vertical stress for the horizontal borehole 
to be the most stable one (see section 7.2). Accordingly, the maximum horizontal stress is 
expected to be equal to 0.92 psi/ft. In this situation, the stress regime in Wanaea field is on 
the boundary between NF and SS, which is consistent with the conclusions drawn by Hillis 
and Williams (1993).   

The  shale  formation  was  drilled  with  a  mud  density  of  11.85  lb/gal,  which  resulted  in 
significant breakouts. Taking the minimum horizontal stress to be 0.72 psi/ft, and assuming 
that  the  shale  has  a  Poisson’s  ratio  of  0.25,  the  collapse  densities  are  estimated  using  the 
stability  model  at  different  borehole  orientations  (see  Figure  7.11).  It  is  apparent  that  the 
actually-used  mud  density  is  not  appropriate  at  any  borehole  orientation,  regardless  of  the 
applied failure criterion. As per the Mogi-Coulomb criterion, the minimum mud density that 
should  be  used  to  ensure  borehole  stability  is  equal  to  around  12  lb/gal  for  horizontal 
borehole drilled parallel to the azimuth of the minimum horizontal stress.  

Applying  the  Mohr-Coulomb  criterion  in  this  field  will  give  significantly  conservative 
collapse densities (Figure 7.11(a)). For instance, the Mohr-Coulomb criterion predicted that 
13.4  lb/gal  is  required  to  prevent  breakout  formation  in  a  vertical  borehole,  whereas  12.4 
lb/gal is just adequate according to the Mogi-Coulomb criterion. Therefore, borehole stability 
in Wanaea oilfield is considerably dependent up on the status of the intermediate principal 
stress, which consequently should not be ignored. In addition, the Mohr-Coulomb criterion 
predicted that borehole stability is very sensitive to the horizontal borehole orientations, in 
contrast  to  predictions  of  the  Mogi-Coulomb  criterion.  In  this  field,  therefore,  the  Mohr-
Coulomb criterion has overestimated the influence of horizontal stress anisotropy on borehole 
instability.  These  points  justify  the  use  of  the  Mogi-Coulomb  law  instead  of  the  classical 
Mohr-Coulomb law in borehole stability analysis. 

7.4.4  ABK field in offshore Abu-Dhabi 
In  the  ABK  field,  severe  wellbore  stability  problems  and  two  irremediable  stuck  pipes 
occurred while drilling horizontal drains in the Hamalah-Gulailah oil reservoirs (Onaisi et al., 
2000). At a depth of about 9705 ft, Onaisi et al. (2000) estimated the field stress system is at 
the frontier between strike-slip and reverse faulting, where σv = 1.0 psi/ft, σh = 1.08 psi/ft and 
σH = 1.52 psi/ft. In order to estimate the maximum horizontal stress, the uniaxial compressive 
strength and friction angle are taken to be 798 psi and 50.2° from laboratory test data.

Applications of the borehole stability model

 

The Hamalah-Gulailah formation was drilled with a mud density of 10 lb/gal, which resulted 
in significant wellbore stability problems. Since the field stress system is an RF stress regime 
with σv close to σh, the lowest collapse density can be adopted by drilling a highly deviated 
borehole in the direction of the maximum horizontal in situ stress (see sections 7.2 and 7.3). 
Using  Eq.  (7.6)  or  the  stability  model,  the  optimum  drilling  inclination  is  estimated  to  be 
about  66.9°  (see  Figure  7.12).  The  evaluations  of  collapse  densities  have  been  carried  out 
assuming  a  pore  pressure  gradient  equal  to  0.45  psi/ft  and  a  Poisson’s  ratio  of  0.3.  In  the 
optimal  drilling  trajectory,  a  mud  density  of  10.17  lb/gal  is  just  adequate  to  ensure  the 
stability of the borehole, according to the Mogi-Coulomb criterion. At the same well path, the 
Mohr-Coulomb criterion is very conservative, and predicts that a mud density of at least 11.3 
lb/gal  must  be  used  to  avoid  borehole  collapse.  Accordingly,  the  selection  of  a  failure 
criterion  has  a  profound  effect  on  the  wellbore  stability  analysis.  After  this  critical  well 
orientation,  the  intermediate  principal  stress  at  the  wall  of  the  wellbore  is  close  to  the 
maximum principal stress. As a result, the predictions of collapse pressure using the Mogi-
Coulomb  and  the  Mohr-Coulomb  criterion  are  getting  closer.  In  this  field  stress  system, 
therefore, a slight deviation of the borehole from horizontal could make a great impact on the 
stability of the wellbore. 

Nevertheless,  a  horizontal  borehole  has  been  drilled  in  this  formation.  The  simulations  for 
collapse densities at different horizontal borehole orientations using the stability model are 
shown  in  Figure  7.13.  Regardless  of  the  applied  failure  criterion,  borehole  collapse  will 
certainly  initiate  at  the  actual  used  mud  density.  According  to  Mogi-Coulomb  criterion, 
drilling a borehole at about 20° from the direction of σH will minimize the potential borehole 
instability. In this situation, the minimum mud density that should be applied is 10.3 lb/gal. In 
contrast, the Mohr-Coulomb criterion predicted that the borehole should be drilled parallel to 
σH  with  a  minimum  mud  density  of  about  11.5  lb/gal  to  optimize  the  drilling  operation. 
Although  both  failure  criteria  are  equivalent  in  triaxial  stress  states,  there  is  a  significant 
difference in the evaluation of borehole instability, which cannot be neglected. Therefore, in 
this field stress system, the intermediate principal stress plays a major role in stabilizing the 
horizontal wells, as can be seen by employing the Mogi-Coulomb criterion. 

7.4.5  Offshore wells in the Arabian Gulf 
Two wells have been drilled in an offshore field in the Arabian Gulf as horizontal producers, 
and  severe  wellbore  instability  was  encountered  (Awal  et  al.,  2001).  In  Well-A,  borehole 
collapse has been reported while drilling in a shale section at a depth of 6800 ft. The well has 
been drilled at a drilling direction of 30° from the maximum horizontal in situ stress, with a 
deviation angle of 62°. The rock properties, in situ stresses and pore pressure are listed in 
Table 7.4. In the same shale section, Well-B has been drilled successfully in the direction of 
the minimum horizontal stress (i.e., α = 90°).

The offshore field is under an NF stress regime with anisotropic horizontal stresses. In this 
field stress system, the lowest acceptable mud densities are associated with a well drilled in a 
direction parallel to σh, that is, the Well-B direction. As the drilling direction gets closer to 
σH,  such  as  Well-A,  higher  mud  densities  are  essential  to  prevent  borehole  collapse  (see 
section 7.2). Figure 7.14 illustrates the evaluation of collapse densities at different borehole 
trajectories  using  the  stability  model.  It  is  revealed  that  the  lowest  collapse  densities  are 
associated with Well-B (α = 90°), where the optimum drilling inclination is 45°. The same 
solution can also be obtained using Eq. (7.6).  

As expected, the Mohr-Coulomb criterion is significantly conservative in predicting borehole 
instability in all well paths. Due to horizontal stress anisotropy, the criterion also predicted 
that  wellbore  stability  is  very  sensitive  to  horizontal  well  orientation.  This  conservative 
nature of the wellbore stability analysis can be minimized by employing the Mogi-Coulomb 
criterion. 

The successfully applied mud density in Well-B could be considered as a lower bound of the 
collapse density (see Figure 7.14). Thus, the applied mud densities in Well-A must not be 
designed equal to or less than that used in Well-B. Using the stability model, the collapse 
density in Well-B at 62° inclination is 11.6 lb/gal, according to the Mogi-Coulomb criterion. 
At  this  mud  density,  borehole  collapse  will  certainly  take  place  in  Well-A.  To  ensure  the 
stability of Well-A, the minimum allowable mud density is 11.84 lb/gal. Alternatively, Well-
A should be drilled through the shale section with inclination angle lower than 49° instead of 
62°  to  maintain  the  same  applied  mud  density  in  Well-B.  Consequently,  Well-A  can  be 
successfully drilled without borehole stability problems by adopting a drilling operation that 
takes into account the developed stability model.

Rock failure in a general stress state has been studied to understand the fundaments of shear 
failure mechanics in three dimensions. The rock mechanics literature is rich with a number of 
shear failure criteria that have been developed. In particular, we have studied the commonly 
applied  failure  criteria,  namely,  the  Mohr-Coulomb  criterion  (σ2-independent)  and  the 
Drucker-Prager criterion (σ2-dependent). These conventional failure criteria, however, were 
developed before the construction of the first experimental apparatus that enabled polyaxial 
tests. They are based on the assumption that a linear failure envelope, based on triaxial test 
data,  represents  the  failure  under  polyaxial  stress  states.  The  first  extensive  polyaxial 
compressive tests in rocks have been performed by Mogi (1971b). Thus, we have also studied 
shear failure as per Mogi’s hypothesis.  

We  have  pointed  out  that,  from  the  use  of  the σ1–σ3  Mohr’s  circle  to  estimate  the  failure 
envelope, that Mohr’s assumption implies that the fracture plane strikes in the σ2 direction. 
This assumption has been verified experimentally by Mogi and many other researchers, and 
can be interpreted as justifying the extension of a two-dimensional failure criterion into three 
dimensions. In addition, from the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion, we can conclude that the 
mean normal stress that opposes the creation of the fracture plane is σm,2, which is consistent 
with  Mogi’s  hypothesis.  Furthermore,  the  Mohr-Coulomb  criterion  assumes  a  linear 
relationship between the maximum shear stress and the effective mean stress (σm,2) at failure, 
where σ2 has no influence on rock strength. 

According  to  the  linear  version  of  Mogi’s  polyaxial  failure  criterion,  there  is  a  linear 
relationship between the octahedral shear stress and the effective mean stress at failure. This 
form  of  the  Mogi  failure  criterion  differs  from  the  linear  Mohr  criterion  by  the  use  of 
octahedral shear stress instead of the maximum shear stress to account for the influence of σ2 
on rock strength. We have shown that in triaxial stress states, where σ2 = σ3 or σ2 = σ1, the 
linear Mogi failure criterion reduces exactly to the classical Coulomb criterion. Hence, the 
linear Mogi criterion can be thought of as a natural extension of the Coulomb criterion into 
three  dimensions.  As  Mohr’s  extension  of  the  Coulomb  criterion  into  three  dimensions  is 
often referred to as the Mohr-Coulomb criterion, we propose that the linear version of the 
Mogi  criterion  be  known  as  the  “Mogi-Coulomb”  failure  criterion.  The  Mohr-Coulomb 
failure criterion, therefore, only represents the triaxial stress state, which is a special case that 
will only occasionally be encountered in situ. In other words, a linear Mohr criterion is only a 
2D Coulomb failure criterion, whereas a linear Mogi criterion is a fully 3D Coulomb failure 
criterion. Furthermore, we have pointed out that Mogi-Coulomb strength parameters can be 
explicitly related to the traditional parameters appearing in the Coulomb failure law.  

The new true-triaxial failure criterion, that is, Mogi-Coulomb criterion, is defined by

This failure criterion is also based on the assumption that a linear failure envelope, based on 
triaxial test data, represents failure under polyaxial stress states. 

8.1  Mogi-Coulomb validation in lab scale 
In  order  to  verify  the  validation  of  Mogi-Coulomb  criterion  on  representing  the  failure  of 
rock specimens, polyaxial test data of eight rock types were analysed. For comparison, the 
Drucker-Prager criterion has been also examined. First of all, we have revealed that σ2 does 
have a strengthen effect as reported in the literature, and all rock types are σ2-dependent. The 
degree of influence of σ2 on rock strength depends on the applied stress state. 

From  this  study,  we  have  proven  that  the  Mogi-Coulomb  criterion  is  good  in  representing 
rock  failure  in  polyaxial  stress  state.  Moreover,  we  found  that  the  numerical  values  of  the 
parameters that appear in the Mogi-Coulomb criterion can be estimated from conventional σ2 
=  σ3  triaxial  test  data.  This  polyaxial  failure  criterion  therefore  can  be  used  even  in  the 
absence of true triaxial data.  

We have shown that the Drucker-Prager criterion generally overestimates rock strength under 
polyaxial  stress  conditions,  due  to  conceptually  misusing  the  effective  mean  stress.  This 
criterion, therefore, should not be used to model brittle fracture. On the other hand, the Mohr-
Coulomb criterion underestimates rock strength by ignoring the effect of σ2. In general, the 
Mohr-Coulomb criterion predicts only the lower limit of the rock strength, while the Drucker-
Prager criterion predicts the upper limit of the rock strength. The true rock strength can be 
inferred  through  modelling  using  the  suggested  Mogi-Coulomb  criterion.  This  criterion 
neither ignores the strengthening effect of σ2, as is done by the Mohr-Coulomb criterion nor 
does it predict strengths as high as does the Drucker-Prager criterion. 

8.2  Mogi-Coulomb validation in field scale 
After we experimentally verified the validation of Mogi-Coulomb criterion in describing rock 
failure,  the  criterion  was  utilized  to  develop  a  new  wellbore  stability  model.  The  stability 
model was applied in typical field conditions as well as real field cases to prove the validity 
of  the  Mogi-Coulomb  criterion  on  the  field  scale.  For  this  purpose,  a  linear  elastic 
constitutive  model  for  the  stresses  around  the  borehole  was  employed.  For  comparison, 
another analytical model was developed using the Mohr-Coulomb criterion.  

We have shown that borehole stability analysis that accounts for the effect of the intermediate 
principal  stress  can  be  carried  out  in  a  manageable  analytical  framework.  The  newly 
developed  stability  model  realistically  represents  field  conditions  by  considering  stresses 
around  the  borehole,  and  by  using  the  polyaxial  Mogi-Coulomb  failure  criterion.  In 
particular, we have introduced closed-form analytical expressions for the collapse pressure in 
vertical and horizontal boreholes.  

We have pointed out that using linear elasticity theory, where the contribution of fluid flow to 
the stresses is ignored, in conjunction with any failure criterion, will always overestimate the 
fracture pressure. In order to avoid the possibility of lost circulation and map out the region

Conclusions and recommendations

 

of mechanical stability in a wellbore, the upper limit of the well pressure should be set equal 
to the minimum principal stress, which is usually σh. To avoid under balanced drilling, the 
lower limit of the well pressure should be designed not less than the pore pressure. Therefore, 
the applied stable mud pressure is range from the pore pressure to the minimum in situ stress. 

Using  the  developed  stability  model,  the  evaluations  of  collapse  pressure  in  vertical, 
horizontal  and  deviated  wellbores  have  been  carried  out.  From  the  applications  of  the 
analytical model in typical field conditions, we have the following conclusions: 

(i) 

(ii) 

(iii) 

In polyaxial stress states, where σ2 is a true intermediate principal stress, the Mogi-
Coulomb  criterion  leads  to  evaluations  of  the  collapse  pressure  that  are  similar  to 
those obtained from Ewy’s modified Lade criterion. In triaxial stress states, where σ2 
=  σ3  or  σ2  =  σ1,  the  calculations  of  collapse  pressure  using  the  Mogi-Coulomb 
criterion  and  the  Mohr-Coulomb  criterion  coincide.  This  is  because  the  Mogi-
Coulomb criterion will automatically reduce to the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion if 
two of the in situ principal stresses are nearly equal. 

The Mohr-Coulomb criterion only represents rock failure under triaxial stress states. 
Because of this limitation, the use of the Mohr-Coulomb criterion generally decreases 
the stable range of the mud weight. Incorporating the Mogi-Coulomb  criterion  into 
our  wellbore  stability  model  has  minimized  the  conservative  nature  of  the  mud 
pressure predictions. In contrast, the Drucker-Prager criterion always underestimates 
the required mud weight, due to the incorrect strengthening effect that arises from the 
use  of  the  octahedral  normal  stress  instead  of  the  effective  mean  stress, σm,2.  This 
significant difference in evaluation of borehole instability has certainly great impact 
on drilling cost and time. 

In  all  the  stress  regimes,  changing  the  orientation  of  the  borehole  in  a  plane 
perpendicular to the maximum principal in situ stress (i.e., the σ2-σ3 plane) will not 
significantly  influence  the  collapse  pressure  that  is  predicted  by  Mohr-Coulomb 
criterion.  The  rate  of  change  of  the  collapse  pressure  with  respect  to  the  well 
orientation in the σ2-σ3 plane, using the Mohr-Coulomb criterion, is at least twice that 
predicted  by  applying  the  Mogi-Coulomb  criterion.  For  instance,  in  NF  stress 
regimes,  the  effect  of  horizontal  well  orientation  on  borehole  stability  is  trivial, 
according  to  the  Mogi-Coulomb  criterion.  Consequently,  utilization  of  the  Mohr-
Coulomb  criterion  in  horizontal  stress  evaluation  may  result  in  misleading 
predictions, particularly in NF stress regimes. 

In addition, the stability model has been applied to five different field case studies worldwide, 
with the results in each case supporting the above conclusions. Applying the Mohr-Coulomb 
law to predict borehole instability in these fields gives unrealistic results. On the other hand, 
the  Mogi-Coulomb  criterion  represents  field  conditions  more  realistically  than  does  the 
Mohr-Coulomb  criterion.  In  general,  the  stability  analysis  reveals  that  borehole  stability  is 
considerably dependent on the intermediate principal stress, which consequently should not 
be ignored in oil and gas fields. Implementation of the Mogi-Coulomb law will allow drilling 
engineers to correctly account for the actual field stress conditions.

8.3  Optimum well path 
Well path optimization is mainly controlled by the relative magnitude of the in situ stresses, 
and  the  failure  criterion  generally  has  no  significant  influence.  During  borehole  stability 
analysis,  we  observed  that  drilling  vertical  boreholes  will  minimize  the  potential  borehole 
instability only when the horizontal in situ stress is isotropic. Having anisotropic horizontal 
stresses,  which  is  the  common  case,  will  divert  the  optimum  well  path  from  the  vertical 
direction. In this situation, deviated and horizontal boreholes are potentially more stable than 
vertical boreholes. It has been found that the lowest collapse pressure is always associated 
with boreholes drilled in the σ1-σ3 plane. In this plane, the optimal well path is deviated from 
the maximum principal in situ stress by a specific angle γ  that is defined by

.                                                          (8.3) 

Therefore,  the  optimum  well  path  is  directly  and  simply  related  to  the  principal  in  situ 
stresses. This relationship, in general, should be used as a quick, rough guideline to design 
the optimum drilling trajectory with regards to wellbore stability. 

8.4  Recommendations   
If the studied case is over a high range of effective mean stress (σm,2) values, the data may 
need  a  model  that  is  slightly  curved.  In  this  situation,  we  recommend  the  use  of  extended 
Mogi-Coulomb criterion, which formulated by

The parameters a and b represent the cohesion and angle of internal friction. The parameter c 
is a curve fitting parameter that represents the non-linear behaviour at high effective mean 
stresses.  The  relationship  between  (a,b)  and  (c,φ)  may  be  not  so  straightforward  for  the 
parabolic form. Therefore, further study is needed to investigate these relationships. 

The new true-triaxial failure criterion has been used to develop an analytical model to ensure 
the stability of wellbores during drilling. The failure criterion can also be applied in the well 
production stage. For instance, a new analytical model to predict sand production could be 
developed by implementing Mogi-Coulomb criterion. As a suggestion, one may adopt Ewy’s 
model for sand predictions (Ewy et al., 2001), so that the modified Lade criterion is replaced 
by the Mogi-Coulomb criterion. 

One of the main advantages of the stability model is its requirement of few input parameters. 
In practice, even these parameters are often unavailable and difficult to accurately acquire, 
which  has  precluded  wellbore  stability  analysis  from  being  applied  in  routine  field 
applications.  Nevertheless,  there  is  a  theoretical  potential  to  develop  more  complicated 
models.  The  mechanical,  porous,  chemical  and  thermal  phenomena  could  be  coupled  in 
stability models. Such stability models that also incorporate the Mogi-Coulomb law require 
indeed detailed studies and substantial support from the petroleum industry.   

There is scope to improve the existing stress measurement methods using the Mogi-Coulomb 
criterion, particularly in horizontal stress evaluation. For example, there are some theoretical 
limitations  in  hydraulic  fracturing  stress  measurement  technique  (Haimson  and  Cornet, 

108 

Conclusions and recommendations

 

2003). We suggest carrying out a detailed study to extend the hydraulic fracturing method to 
considering the Mogi-Coulomb law, with the following points: 

a)  Include tests that yield inclined fractures in vertical borehole. 

b)  Make the method applicable to deviated boreholes. 

In the rock mechanics literature, there are several models describing rock deformation aspects 
such as compaction and dilatancy. A detailed study should be carried out to correlate between 
the Mogi-Coulomb criterion and three-dimensional rock deformations. In addition, the failure 
criterion could be useful in predicting fracture orientation and breakout dimensions. 

We believe that Mogi-Coulomb law describes the brittle failure mechanics more accurately 
than  does  the  traditional  Mohr-Coulomb  model.  As  we  have  shown,  the  Mogi-Coulomb 
criterion  is  always  applicable,  regardless  of  the  dependency  of  the  studied  case  on  the 
intermediate  principal  stress.  In  all  rock  engineering  applications,  therefore,  it  would  be 
advantageous  to  employ  this  rock  failure  law  instead  of  the  classical  Mohr-Coulomb 
criterion.
