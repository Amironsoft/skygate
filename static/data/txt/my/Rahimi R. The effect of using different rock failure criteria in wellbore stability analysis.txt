ABSTRACT 

iii 
 

Determination of the appropriate drilling fluid density by rock failure analysis is an 

essential step to control wellbore instability. To determine wellbore failure stresses, the rock 

strength has to be known, an appropriate constitutive model has to be selected, and finally an 

accurate  rock  failure  criterion  must  be  chosen.  Linear-poro  elastic  modeling  of  the 

mechanical wellbore failure is the most common approach to investigate wellbore instability. 

Numerous failure criteria have been used for the rock failure analysis but there is not any 

commonly accepted agreement of which failure criteria to use.. Quantitative comparisons 

have been previously studied on some of the failure criteria but  few  evaluations for the 

selection of the failure criteria are based on  typical petroleum related situations.  In this 

thesis, the thirteen most common rock failure criteria are compared and analyzed. The rock 

failure criteria were evaluated for three lithologies. A statistical analysis was performed to 

determine the similarities and differences among the failure criteria. Field case evaluation of 

failure criteria was conducted for three different offshore wells. According to the results of 

the  statistical  analysis,  the  Tresca,  the  Von  Mises,  and  the  Inscribed  Drucker-Prager 

represent the higher bounds of results for the minimum required mud weight for all cases. 

Although  the  Circumscribed  Drucker-Prager  usually  predicts  the  lower  bound  for  the 

minimum required mud weight, its results are in the middle range for hard formations. The 

Modified Lade, the Modified Wiebols-Cook and the Mogi-Coulomb give similar results for 

the three cases studied so these failure criteria may be used interchangeably without altering 

the results. The results of field cases show that the Mogi-Coulomb, the Modified Lade, and 

the Modified Wiebols-Cook criteria mainly predict minimum required mud weight which is 

close to the field mud weight used to successfully drill the borehole.

Here is the end of the journey. Let’s look over the past and remember all who have 

helped and supported me along this unique and adventurous experience. 

 

First and foremost, I would like to thank my advisor, Dr. Runar Nygaard. He has 

been supportive since the first day I started in the Petroleum Engineering department. Dr. 

Nygaard  has  supported  me  not  only  by  providing  a  research  assistantship  and  technical 

advice, but also emotionally through the rough road to finish this thesis and complete my 

graduate study. He gave me the freedom and confidence I needed to move on.  

 

Besides my advisor, I would like to thank the rest of my thesis committee: Dr. Ralph 

Flori and Dr. Andreas Eckert for their encouragement and insightful comments.  

 

I would like to acknowledge my fellows in drilling research group: Mohamed Al-

Dushaishi, Mortadha Al-Saba, Benjamin Weideman, Yilin Mao and Yurong Li for their 

supportive idea and technical assistance and also all the wonderful moments we had together.  

 

I finish with Iran, where the most source of my life’s energy resides: my family. I 

have an amazing family, unique in many ways, and the stereotype of a perfect family in 

many others. Their support has been unconditional all these years; they have given up many 

things for me to be here; they have cherished with me every great moment and supported me 

whenever I needed it.

1.  INTRODUCTION 

 
 

Costly consequences of wellbore instability problems are one of the major challenges 

in drilling operation. Instability is caused when the stresses locally around the wellbore is 

exceeding the strength of the rock.  Drilling fluid pressure can prevent failure to occur if the 

pressure is kept within the bounds of collapse and fracture gradients around the wellbore. 

Wellbore stability and pore pressure analysis are  the main factors in designing borehole 

pressure  profile  for  selecting  mud  density  which  provides  mechanical  stability  of  the 

borehole wall and decrease Non-Productive Time (NPT). The wellbore stability model must 

include rock strength properties which governs the behavior of the rock when it is subjected 

to the in-situ stresses. A rock failure criterion specifies stress condition at failure. Therefore 

to determine wellbore failure stresses, the rock strength has to be known, an appropriate 

constitutive model has to be selected, and finally an accurate rock failure criterion must be 

chosen. Linear-poro elastic modeling of the mechanical wellbore failure is the most common 

approach to investigate wellbore instability. For safe well construction, in-situ stresses must 

be used to predict minimum required mud weight which cause break outs of the wellbore 

wall. 

 

1.1. OVERVIEW ON WELLBORE STABILITY ANALYSIS 

Over  the  last  30  years  there  have  been  numerous  investigations  into  developing 

analytical models for mechanical wellbore stability (Bradley, 1979, Aadnoy, 1987, McLean 

and Addis, 1990). All models have in common that they consider the wellbore as a circular 

hole  in  a  rigid  infinite  body  subjected  to  far  field  principal  compressive  stresses.  The 

common form is to consider the wellbore constitutive model as a linear poro-elastic material 

with isotropic rock deformation and strength properties in a 3D principal stress field. The 

minimum drilling fluid pressure is determined to prevent the differential stresses around the 

wellbore to be less than the shear strength of the rock. Different rock failure criteria were 

used  for  wellbore  stability  analysis  to  predict  onset  of  wellbore  failure  but  there  is  no 

agreement on which failure criterion to be used for wellbore stability analysis. Based on the 

different characteristics of the rock failure criteria, their result for the minimum drilling fluid 

density might be significantly different. It is mainly due to how rock failure criteria include

2 
 

the effect of in-situ principal stresses. The estimation of minimum drilling fluid density by 

different  criteria  may  lead  to  unsafe  or  conservative  approach  in  the  result  of  wellbore 

stability analysis.  

 

1.2. MOTIVATION FOR EVALUATION OF ROCK FAILURE CRITERIA 

Previous studies on the evaluation of rock failure criteria is mainly focused on the 

quantitative comparison or determination of the best fitting parameters for the different rock 

failure criteria based on triaxial test results data.  Reviewing previous studies reveals that 

some failure criteria, including Stassi d’Alia, have not been considered (Mclean and Addis, 

1990, Song and Haimson, 1997, Ewy, 1999, Colmenares and Zoback, 2002, Yi et al., 2005, 

Al-Ajmi and Zimmerman, 2006, Simangunsong et al., 2006, Nawrocki, 2010, Zhang et al., 

2010). Also in some of the previous studies, hypothetical data set have been used for the 

stress data, rock mechanical properties, and well depth which caused results to be unrealistic 

in some cases. For instance, true vertical well depth in the range of 12,000 m to 28,000 m has 

been chosen for analysis which caused the results not to be directly applicable to the stability 

of  wells  for  petroleum  exploitation  (Zhang  et  al.,  2010).    Furthermore,  quantitative 

comparisons have been previously studied on some of failure criteria but few evaluations of 

the failure criteria are based on typical petroleum related situations.   

 

1.3. RESEARCH OBJECTIVES  

The overall objective of this study is to perform a statistical comparison to investigate 

similarities and differences of various rock failure criteria for prediction of the minimum 

drilling fluid density under different rock lithology and stress data. Thirteen of the most 

common  rock  failure  criteria  which  are  used  for  wellbore  stability  analysis  have  been 

statistically evaluated for three rock lithologies including shale, sandstone, and siltstone. 

Rock  mechanical  and  stress  data  from  the  Rulison  field  in  western  Colorado  was  used 

(Higgins, 2006). Results of the statistical analysis are presented using percentage difference 

method and table of contradictions. The field case evaluation of failure criteria was done for 

three different offshore wells in North Sea and Indonesia. Estimated minimum required mud 

weight by different criteria compared to the actual mud weight used to successfully drill the

mud pressure is higher than the in-situ formation fluid pressure).

In-situ  stresses  and  rock  mechanical  properties  are  key  input  data  for  wellbore 

stability analysis. In-situ stresses can be defined by three principal stresses that determine the 

loading level on the rock. To determine in-situ stresses on borehole wall, an appropriate 

constitutive model should be chosen. The linear elasticity theory for solid material does not 

give accurate description of rock under loading due to the effect of pore pressure, so linear 

poro-elasticity theory is the common approach in petroleum related geomechanics (Fjaer et 

al., 2008).  The rock failure condition should be known to find the minimum required mud 

weight for keeping the mechanical stability of wellbore wall. Failure criteria were developed 

to estimate stress concentration at which rock fails.  Prediction of accurate stress condition at 

which  rock  breakouts  occurs  is  one  of  the  main  challenges  which  standout  in  wellbore 

stability analysis.  

 

2.1.  ROCK FAILURE CRITERIA 

A failure criterion specifies at which stress condition failure occurs. The application 

of failure criteria would be limited to the soil, rock, or metal based on their features.  In 

wellbore stability analysis, the rock failure criterion is used to determine borehole breakout 

pressure  due  to  tensile,  shear  or  compressive  failure.  Numerous  rock  failure  criteria  are 

proposed  with  different  characteristics.    Earlier  developed  rock  failure  criteria  are  two 

dimensional since the effect of intermediate principal stresses was not known. Since the 

effect  of  intermediate  principal  stress  is  relatively  low  compared  to  the  minimum  and 

maximum principal stresses, still two dimensional failure criteria will be applicable. Some of 

the failure criteria were included intermediate principal stress by using rotational symmetry 

in  three  dimensional  stress  space  but  there  was  not  any  experimental  evidence  for  that 

inclusion. Based on the original true triaxial test results by Mogi (1971) and the experimental 

analysis done later, the influence of intermediate principal stress on the rock strength has 

been verified (Takahashi and Koide, 1989, Al-Ajmi and Zimmerman, 2005).  As the stress 

state  around  the  borehole  wall  is  true  triaxial,  failure  criteria  which  accounts  for  the 

intermediate principal stress possibly give the accurate stress condition of failure. Linearity 

is the second characteristic which failure criteria will be categorized based on. Non-linear 

5 
 

form of failure criteria have been developed to give better curve fitting with polyaxial test 

results data. In the principal stresses space, rock failure criteria will be identified by cross 

sectional shape of failure surface. In the following section each individual failure criteria will 

be  evaluated.  Since  failure  criteria  are  mainly  derived  based  on  the  development  or 

modification of previous failure criteria, the failure criteria are presented in this section in the 

order when they first appeared in the literature.  

 

2.1.1. Mohr-Coulomb.  The  Mohr-Coulomb  is  the  most  commonly  used  failure 

criterion in geomechanics and has a simple linear form. Mohr-Coulomb criterion is based on 

the two dimensional Mohr’s stress circle which is useful theory in analyzing rock failure. 

Coulomb concluded rock failure will occur alongside a plane due to acting shear stress on 

that plane. Failure of a plane will be resisted by frictional force which is function of internal 

friction of rock, the normal stress components and also internal cohesion of rock. According 

to Coulomb’s failure theory, required compressive stress for failure will be increase linearly 

by increasing the confining stress. Rock failure will occur when following condition is met 

(Derivation of equation 2.1 is shown in appendix A):  

 

                                                                                 (2.1) 

The parameter c is known as cohesion and parameter μ is the coefficient of internal 

angle of friction ( ). The tangential point of Mohr circle of principal in-situ stresses and 

Mohr-Coulomb failure envelope in       space represents state of stress which rock will fail 

in shear. The coefficient of internal angle of friction will be defined with following relation: 

 

                                                                                  (2.2) 

The  Mohr-Coulomb  failure  criterion  can  be  expressed  in  term  of  maximum  and 

minimum principal stresses (Derivation of equation 2.3 is shown in appendix A).  

 

 

                                      (2.3) 
 

The    is uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) which is related to cohesion of rock 

and internal angle of friction. The parameter   is the flow factor which is function of the 

6 
 

internal angle of friction.

These two major rock mechanical properties (   ,  ) have been considered as basic 

input data for the evaluation of material parameters for different failure criteria considered. 

Mohr-Coulomb’s failure criterion does not consider the effect of intermediate principal stress 

on the rock strength which is in contrast to the true triaxial state of stress in rock.  

 

2.1.2. Mogi-Coulomb. Mogi (1971) conducted true-triaxial experiments on different 

rock  types  and  interpreted  the  results.    Based  on  the  test  results,  Mogi  concluded  the 

intermediate principal stress (  ) influences the rock strength for several rock lithologies and 

the fracture occurs along a plane in the direction of intermediate principal stress. Based on 

the polyaxial test results, Mogi pointed out that mean normal stress which opposes creation 

of fracture is     , rather than the octahedral normal stress,     . His observations from the 

laboratory  tests  lead  to  a  rock  failure  criterion  which  takes  into  account  the  effect  of 

intermediate principal stress. Mogi formulated the assumption that, distortional strain energy 

as a frictional force is proportional to the octahedral shear stress,      and will be increased 

by increasing       until a critical level where failure occur. Based on this result, Al-Ajmi 

and Zimmerman (2005) found a linear relation that could fit well with polyaxial tests data in 

    -     space: 

                                 (2.6) 
 
The parameter   is the intersection of line on the τoct axis and   is the inclination of 

the  line.    Al-Ajmi  and  Zimmerman  (2005)  tested  the  developed  linear  function  for  the 

polyaxial test data from eight different rock types and the results show that Mogi-Coulomb 

criterion gives a good fit to polyaxial tests data. They also found out this polyaxial criterion 

                                                                                          

correlates  well  with  conventional  triaxial  test  data.  Al-Ajmi  and  Zimmerman  (2005) 

presented the relation between the linear Mogi-Coulomb failure criterion parameters   and   

based on the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion parameters,   and    :

Since  linear  Mogi-Coulomb  failure  criterion  is  equivalent  to  Mohr-Coulomb  in 

conventional triaxial stress state, it can be seen as an extension of Mohr-Coulomb in true 

triaxial space. 

  

2.1.3. Tresca. Shear failure occurs when shear stress along some plane reaches a 

critical level. Tresca is the simplest possible criterion for shear failure based on the Mohr’s 

stress circle. Tresca (1864) assumed that failure would occur if maximum shear failure inside 

any  planes  of  rock  reaches  a  critical  value  which  is  equal  to  cohesion  or intrinsic  shear 

strength of rock.

Where  the  parameter     is  cohesion  of  rock  and      is  the  uniaxial  compressive 

strength (UCS). Maximum shear stress is derived from Mohr’s stress circle.  In the three 

dimensional principal stresses space, cross section of Tresca criterion is like regular hexagon. 

Tresca can be considered as especial case of Mohr-Coulomb failure criteria when internal 

angle of friction is equal to zero. Recall equations 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5, if the internal angle of 

friction set as zero, Mohr-Coulomb criterion reduced to following form which is  Tresca 

criterion:

2.1.4. Von Mises. Before development of true triaxial experiment, couple of scientists 

tried  to  include  the  effect  of  intermediate  principal  stress  in  failure  criterion.    Although 

without any experimental evidence, Von Mises (1913) proposed his failure criterion in an 

interesting way by using rotational symmetry of   –plane which leads to a circular cross 

sectional shape of failure surface in three dimensional stress space. He assumed that rock 

fails when square root of the second invariant of deviatoric stress (  ) reaches a critical level. 

Based on the different form of (  ), Von Mises failure criterion can be written in following 

forms: 

 

                                                                        √    

  
 

                                               (2.12) 

                               √       √ 

 

  (       )      (       )      (       )    

 

  
 

         (2.13) 

 

The Von Mises criterion was developed for metals and it has very limited application 

for rocks since it defines failure mechanism which is independent of stress magnitude of 

material  and  it  is  in  contrast  with  experimental  observation  since  yield  of  many  rocks 

increases with increasing mean normal stress. This idea was used later for the development 

of a failure criterion that includes the mean normal stress component.  

 

2.1.5. Drucker-Prager. Drucker and Prager proposed their failure criterion in the 

sense to extend application of Von-Mises failure criterion to the rock mechanics (Drucker 

and Prager, 1952). As it has been mentioned, Von Mises failure criterion developed without 

experimental  foundation  and  just  by  using  the  rotational  symmetry  of   -plane  in  three 

dimensional stress spaces. The yield stress in most rock types will increase by increasing 

9 
 

mean  normal  stress  but  Von  Mises  did  not  include  mean  normal  stress  component. 

Therefore, Von Mises failure criterion does not fit experimental observation.  Originally 

developed for soil mechanic and as an extension of Von Mises criterion, Drucker and Prager 

proposed new failure criterion by including the mean normal stress component,    (Drucker 

and Prager, 1952). The yield surface of the modified Von Mises criterion in principal stresses 

space is a right circular cone equally inclined to the principal-stress axes. The intersection of 

the π−plane with this yield surface is a circle. 

 

                     √                                (2.14) 

The parameter   and   are material constants and    is the mean effective confining 

 

stress: 

 

           

 

 

 (            )                  (2.15) 

 

The material parameters    and   can be identified from the slope and the intercept of 

the failure line which has been plotted in the    and √   space. Since the parameter   is 

related to the internal friction of the rock and   is related to the cohesion of rock. Mohr-

Coulomb criterion parameters could be used to determine Drucker-Prager failure criterion 

parameters. Based on the fitting triaxial test data and comparison with the Mohr-Coulomb 

criterion in three dimensional stress spaces, the Drucker-Prager criterion can be divided into 

Circumscribed Drucker-Prager and Inscribed Drucker-Prager. The outer Drucker Prager or 

circumscribed coincides with the outer apices of the Mohr-Coulomb hexagon in the cross 

sectional view of π-plane while the inscribed Drucker-Prager touches the inside of Mohr-

Coulomb  hexagon.  It  should  be  noted  that  inscribed  Drucker  Prager  is  the  result  of 

trigonometric fitting between Mohr-Coulomb and Drucker-Prager criteria and actually does 

not fit the triaxial test data (Mclean and Addis, 1990). For the Inscribed Drucker-Prager, 

material parameters would be (Vekeens and Walters, 1989): 

 

   

       

√                            (2.16)                                                                           

10 
 

           

         

 √ √                         (2.17) 

 

For the Circumscribed Drucker-Prager, following solution has been presented using 

Mohr-Coulomb criterion parameters (Zhou 1994):  

 

                            √ (   )
(   )

                   (2.18) 

    √   
   

                   (2.19) 

 

Main shortcoming of Drucker-Prager criterion is giving same weight to intermediate 

principal  stress  as  minimum  and  maximum  principal  stresses  while  we  know  the 

intermediate principal stress does effect on the rock strength but it is not significant as other 

two principal stresses. That is the main reason why circumscribed Drucker-Prager typically 

represents the lowest bound of results for the minimum required mud weight.  

 

2.1.6. Modified Wiebols-Cook. Wiebols and Cook (1968) proposed a model which 

describes  the  impact  of  the  intermediate  principal  stress  (  )  on  rock  strength.  By 

considering shear strain energy of microcracks in the rock, they gave physical description of 

sliding microcracks surfaces which cause failure when the stress condition meet frictional 

criterion. In better words, by micromechanical analysis of sliding cracks, Wiebols and Cook 

concluded the rock will fail when shear strain energy which is enclosed with microcracks 

reaches a critical level. A model which presented later on (Zhou, 1994) as an extension of 

circumscribed Drucker Prager is a nonlinear criterion which is called Modified Wiebols-

Cook due to similarities to the original model by Wiebols and Cook (Zhou, 1994). Here is 

the criterion presented by Zhou: 

              √                   

 

               (2.20) 

                                                                        

11 
 

Where     is  the mean effective confining stress  and    is the second invariant of 

deviatoric stress related to octahedral shear stress. The mean normal stress component in 

Modified Wiebols-Cook has quadratic form while in the Drucker-Prager criterion has linear 

form. The parameters A, B, and C can be determined from result of conventional triaxial test 

under  different  conditions.  The  Mohr-Coulomb  criterion  parameters  including  uniaxial 

compressive strength (  ) and flow factor ( ) can be used as input for determination of A, B, 

and C parameters as shown here:

2.1.7. Hoek-Brown. Hoek and Brown (1980) developed an empirical model for the 

failure of fractured rock. To investigate the failure of fracture rocks, both fracture properties 

and rock properties should be taken into account. As result of existing fractures and lower 

resistance for the shear failure, the fractured rock is weaker than intact rock. Failure criterion 

which has been proposed by Hoek and Brown included both rock and fracture properties: 

 

12 
 

                                                                 √           

                                   (2.25) 

 

Where the uniaxial compressive strength,    is function of rock properties while   

and   are constant depending on the both rock properties and fracture characteristics.  For the 

intact rock, material constant,   is equal to 1 and the fractured rock will be categorized based 

on “1-  ” relation. Although there is a relation between material constant   and internal 

angle of friction but still no mathematical relation has been presented for that (Fjaer et al., 

2008). This could  be count  as a disadvantage of Hoek-Brown  failure  criterion since the 

material constant   could not be evaluated based on the experimental data or well logging 

data  .  Therefore  in  same  practical  situation,  Mohr-Coulomb  will  be  preferred  since  the 

criterion’ constants can be identified by basic rock mechanical data from triaxial tests results. 

Range of the material constant   is in interval of 5 to 30 depends on the rock types (Zoback, 

2007). Since empirical Hoek and Brown failure criterion follow the Mohr’s stress circle, it 

does not consider the effect of intermediate principal stress. Predicted ratio of compressive to 

tensile strength by Hoek-Brown criterion is larger than what the Mohr-Coulomb criterion 

does, in this sense Hoek-Brown gives closer agreement to experimental observation (Jaeger 

et al., 2007). Empirical Hoek-Brown failure criterion has nonlinear form in contrast to the 

linear Mohr-Coulomb criterion.  

 

2.1.8. Modified  Lade.  According  to  experimental  observations,  Lade  (1977) 

concluded  that  for  cohesionless  soil,  the  frictional  angle  decreases  with  increasing  the 

magnitude of mean normal stress. An original relation which was developed by Lade in term 

of  first  and  third  stress  invariants  includes  material  constant  and  atmospheric  pressure 

parameters. The stress invariant parameters,     and    in Lade criterion did not determine 

based on the effective stresses concept. The Modified Lade criterion was developed by Ewy 

(1999). In Ewy’s version of Lade criterion, material constant,   has been considered as zero 

in order to modify the original lade criterion in the sense that linear shear strength increases 

with  increasing  the  first  stress  invariant,     or  mean  normal  stress  invariant         . 

Furthermore, since original  Lade  criterion  is  defined for  the cohesionless material, Ewy 

proposed  new  way  with  effective  stresses  and  also  introduction  of  the  parameter     as  a 

function of cohesion which changed the Lade criterion to following form: 

13 
 

 

 

      

   
  
                         (2.26) 
  
 
 

Where the appropriate stress invariants   
 
 

  and   

  express as: 

                                                  

      (      )   (      )   (      )          (2.27)  

                                                 

    (      )(      )(      )             (2.28) 
 
 
 The Modified  Lade criterion has two main advantages. First, it does  include the 

   

effect of intermediate principal stress on the rock strength. The second advantage is that 

parameters    and   can be determined by Mohr-Coulomb criterion parameters including 

cohesion and internal angle of friction which can be evaluated based on the triaxial test data 

or well logging data: 

   

 

     

              (2.29) 

                                                                                   

 
                                                            

           

        (         )

(       )

                 (2.30) 

 
 
By introducing the parameter   in the stress invariant components, the application of 

Modified  Lade  criterion  can  be  extended  to  rock  mechanical  applications.    In  the  three 

dimensional stress space, Modified Lade criterion has an triangular cone shape or convex 

which will slightly change depends on the value of  .  The Modified Lade criterion estimates 

that shear strength will be increased by increasing mean effective stress as a frictional force. 

Since Modified Lade has no tension cut off component, it is not accurate in presence of 

tensile stress. This is not a concern in a wellbore stability analysis because the interest points 

on the borehole wall which required mud weight for state of balance are not subjected to 

tension (Ewy, 1999).

2.1.9. Griffith.  The  analysis  of  microcracks  in  a  two  dimensional  model  was 

Griffith’s starting point for developing a failure criterion which can be applied under both 

tensile  and  compressive  conditions  (Griffith,  1921,  Jaeger  et  al.,  2007).  Expansion  of 

microcracks is a function of the tensile stress at the tip of the crack if it exceeds a critical 

level. Compressive stress may cause expansion of microcracks if in an anisotropic stress 

state. The stress condition at tip of crack becomes tensile due to the orientation of stresses at 

skew  angle  related  to  maximum  principal  stress  (Fjaer  et  al.,  2008).  Based  on  this 

assumption, Griffith applied his failure theory to general stress state and original Griffith 

criterion was developed in a nonlinear form in Mohr’s space and in terms of uniaxial tensile 

strength,    and two dimensional stress state components:

                 if               

      

  
 

                     (2.32) 

 

 

In σ-τ plane, Griffith criterion can be expressed in the following form:      

 

                                (      )                  (2.33) 

 

The Griffith criterion has a parabola curve in two dimensional principal stress space 

which is steeper in low confining stress and close to straight line in high confining stress. 

The constant ratio of uniaxial compressive strength to uniaxial tensile strength which was 

presented by Griffith seems to be practical since it is lower, but close to typical experimental 

observation for the range of this ratio, 10 to 15 (Fjaer et al., 2008).  One of the disadvantages 

of this failure criterion is its dependence on a single variable which makes it harder to fit 

both conventional triaxial and polyaxial test data.  The second shortcoming of the Griffith 

criterion is lack of considering the effect which intermediate principal stress has on the rock 

strength. However, the shape of Griffith criterion on the three dimensional stress space can 

be described using the symmetry same as Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion. As matter of 

15 
 

mentioned fact, Griffith criterion will end up with a regular hexagonal shape of cross section 

of failure surface in three dimensional stress space.  

 

2.1.10. Modified Griffith. Griffith criterion has parabola curve in two dimensional 

principal stress spaces which is steeper in low confining stress and close to straight line in 

high confining stress. Based on the experimental observation, Griffith criterion may give a 

fairly good description of failure at low confining stresses, while Mohr–Coulomb criterion 

gives  a  better  description  of  failure  at  higher  confining  stresses  by  straight  line.  Under 

compression, shear failure due to the closure of crack can occur before tensile stress reaches 

a critical level at the tip of crack to initiate fracture; therefore, criterion should be developed 

in a way to include shear mechanism and frictional behavior (Brace, 1960). McClintock and 

Walsh (1962) included the effect of friction between crack faces and Modified Griffith was 

presented. Ratio of uniaxial compressive strength to uniaxial tensile strength is a function of 

coefficient of internal angle of friction:  

 

  
  

 

 

√      

                    (2.34) 

 

It should be noted that the required compressive stress to close the crack has been 

considered  to  be  small.  By  neglecting  the  stress  required  to  close  cracks,  the  Modified 

Griffith criterion can be reduced to the following form: 

 

                                           [√          ]     [√          ]                           (2.35) 

 

Modified Griffith criterion is similar to the Mohr-Coulomb criterion if we consider 

the intrinsic shear strength can be evaluated by setting normal stress component as zero in 

relation 2.33 which results in            . Modified Griffith does not consider influence of 

intermediated  principal  stress  and  has  been  modeled  in  two  dimensional  stress  space. 

Although, investigation of the rock failure mechanism with expansion of single crack is 

qualitatively a great way for understanding of failure as function of the stress state but at the 

same  time  it  is  the  oversimplification  of  complicated  processes  in  rock  failure  and 

16 
 

deformation (Jaeger et al., 2007).  Computational methods like finite element analysis have 

been used lately to give more realistic explanation of failure based on the micromechanical 

analysis of rock (Jaeger et al., 2007).  

 

2.1.11.  Murrel. Extended Griffith criterion was introduced by Murrel (1963) and 

includes  intermediate  principal  stress  as  contributing  factor  in  the  rock  strength.  Murrel 

extended Griffith to three dimensional stress spaces: 

 

         (       )     (       )     (       )        (            )     (2.36)  

 

The ratio of uniaxial compressive strength to uniaxial tensile strength which was 

presented by Murrel is close to the typical range of experimental observation (Fjaer et al., 

2008): 

                                                                                               

    

  
  

                     (2.37) 

 
 

In term of octahedral stresses, the Murrel criterion can be written in the following form: 

 

  

                              (2.38) 
 

 

As mentioned for the Griffith and the Modified Griffith criterion, investigation of the 

rock  failure  mechanism  as  an  expanding  single  crack  is  qualitatively  a  good  way  to 

understand failure as function of stress state it oversimplifies the complicated processes of 

rock failure and deformation (Jaeger et al., 2007). The cross section of the predicted failure 

surface by the Murrel criterion has a circular shape in the three dimensional stress domain.  

 

2.1.12.  Stassi  D’Alia.  By  modifying  the  plastification  condition,  Stassi  d’Alia 

(1967) developed a non-linear failure criterion in terms of principal stresses and uniaxial 

tensile strength:   

17 
 

(       )     (       )     (       )     (       )(            )           (2.39) 

 

Since the increasing tensile component might have a peculiar effect on the results of 

the  minimum  required  mud  weight  by  the  Stassi  d’Alia  criterion,  commonly  the  tensile 

component is set equal to zero (Stjern et al., 2000). Here in this study, the McClintock and 

Walsh  (1962)  assumption  were  used.  McClintock  and  Walsh  assumed  that  the  tensile 

component in Eq. 39 could be determined by the Modified Griffith criterion ratio of uniaxial 

compressive strength to uniaxial tensile strength (Eq. 2.34). 

 

 

2.2.  BOREHOLE STRESS TRANSFORMATION 

The excavation of the underground formation causes redistribution of the stress state 

and the drilling fluid should have sufficient density to provide the mechanical stability of the 

borehole  wall.  In-situ  principal  stresses  have  to  be  known  to  determine  the  appropriate 

drilling fluid density to keep borehole stable. Therefore, stress determination around the 

borehole is a key step in wellbore stability analysis. A linear poro-elasticity model is the 

most  common  approach  for  wellbore  stability  analysis.  The  stress  components  of  the 

wellbore wall in a linear poro-elasticity model are given as (Bradley, 1979, Aadnoy and 

Chenevert, 1987): 

 

                                                                                                                               (2.40)

                                              (    

             

       )                                      (2.44) 

 

                                                                                                                               (2.45)

   and    

  are stress components of 

original coordinate system. Since the shear stress component are non-zero,   ,   , and    are 

not principal stresses. Principal stresses can be determined by following formula: 

 

                                                             

                                                               (2.46)

The maximum and minimum tangential stresses which are perpendicular to each other are

denoted by        and        . The effective radial stress is one of the other principal stress 
 . This procedure should be repeated for different orientation in 

component denoted by   

cylindrical coordinate system around the wellbore in order to find maximum differential 

stress at the wellbore wall. 

 

 

2.3.  NUMERICAL SOLUTION FOR DETERMINATION OF MINIMUM            

REQUIRED MUD WEIGHT 

Determination of borehole principal stress components is the first step in identifying 

the minimum required mud weight. The linear poro-elasticity model as the most common 

approach for a wellbore stability analysis was chosen to determine in-situ principal stresses. 

The  borehole  in-situ  principal  stresses  which  have  been  determined  by  the  linear  poro-

elasticity model are used to calculate the minimum drilling fluid density by the rock failure 

criterion. Iterations are required to determine breakout pressure (Fjaer et al., 2008).  

 

2.4.  LITERATURE  REVIEW ON THE EVALUATION OF ROCK FAILURE        

CRITERIA 

One of the first evaluations of rock failure criteria was done by Mclean and Addis 

(1990).  They  compared  Mohr-Coulomb  and  different  forms  of  Drucker-Prager  for  the 

19 
 

prediction of the minimum mud weight. The linear elasticity borehole stability model was 

used in their analysis. Failure criteria were evaluated for a sandstone formation in North Sea. 

Based  on  the  results,  they  concluded  that  the  Inscribed  Drucker-Prager  conservatively 

predicts the stresses condition  at  failure  which results in  higher minimum required mud 

weight compared to the Mohr-Coulomb and the Circumscribed Drucker-Prager criteria. The 

Inscribed Drucker-Prager and the Mohr-Coulomb estimated similar results for the vertical 

borehole but by increasing borehole deviation the Inscribed Drucker-Prager predicts much 

higher minimum required mud weight than the Mohr-Coulomb criterion. Minimum mud 

weight  predicted  by  the  Circumscribed  Drucker-Prager  was  lower  than  the  result  of  the 

Mohr-Coulomb and the Inscribed Drucker-Prager criteria. This difference was significant for 

the vertical borehole compared to the horizontal borehole where this difference is lower. In 

their reported field case a horizontal well was drilled successfully with a mud weight close to 

the Circumscribed Drucker-Prager mud weight predictions rather than the Mohr-Coulomb 

and  the  Inscribed  Drucker-Prager.  In  other  case,  they  analyzed  the  results  of  required 

overbalance for drilling a vertical well in the weak sand formation by those three failure 

criteria. Although overbalance was required for drilling the weak sand formation and should 

be increased by depth, the Circumscribed Drucker-Prager estimated that no overbalance was 

required  for  drilling  the  weak  sand  formation  regardless  of  depth.  Due  to  the  major 

difference  of  mud  weight  predictions  by  the  Circumscribed  Drucker-Prager  in  two  case 

studies,  Mclean  and  Addiss  concluded  that  a  criterion  can  predict  realistic  result  in  one 

situation  but  give  unrealistic  results  for  other  conditions.  The  Mohr-Coulomb  failure 

criterion  was  recommended  for  wellbore  stability  analysis  because  of  the  more  realistic 

results compared to  the  results from  the  different  forms  of Drucker-Prager (Mclean and 

Addis, 1990). 

 

Song  and  Haimson  (1997)  did  laboratory  simulations  of  borehole  breakouts  and 

triaxial tests on Westerly granite and Berea sandstone to determine an appropriate criterion 

for  estimating  breakout  failure  for  each  rock.  They  concluded  that  the  polyaxial  Mogi 

criterion, which includes the intermediate principal stress, can estimate the stress condition 

for breakout failure in a close agreement with breakout boundaries found in the laboratory 

tests for both rock types. The Mohr-Coulomb criterion did not accurately predict breakout in 

20 
 

these two types of rocks compared to the polyaxial Mogi criterion. They found the laboratory 

experiment of breakout failure as good method to determine appropriate failure criteria for a 

given rock type.  

 

The Modified Lade criterion was developed by Ewy (1999) as a polyaxial failure 

criterion which is compatible with the triaxial stress state in the rock.  The results of the 

predicted minimum required mud weight by the Modified Lade have been compared with 

two  common  rock  failure  criteria,  the  Mohr-Coulomb  and  the  Circumscribed  Drucker-

Prager. Ewy used linear elasticity model to determine in-situ principal stress components on 

the  borehole  wall.    The  rock  failure  criteria  were  evaluated  on  three  rock  lithologies 

including sandstone, shale and poorly cemented sand. The typical range of rock mechanical 

properties used for these three lithologies and a hypothetical data set was considered for in-

situ stresses. According to the results, there was a major difference between the results of 

Modified Lade and the other two criteria, Mohr-Coulomb and Drucker-Prager. The predicted 

minimum required mud weight by the Modified Lade is not that high as the Mohr-Coulomb 

and it is not low same as once predicted by the Drucker-Prager. Furthermore, difference 

between  the  results  of  minimum  required  mud  weight  from  the  vertical  to  horizontal 

borehole for Modified Lade is not significant as the Mohr-Coulomb and the Drucker-Prager. 

Ewy concluded this might be the results of including intermediate principal stress in a right 

way.   

 

Colmenares and Zoback (2002) evaluated seven different rock failure criteria based 

on the fitting of polyaxial test data for five different rock types. They concluded that the 

Modified Wiebols-Cook and the Modified Lade failure criteria had best fit with polyaxial 

test data, especially for those rocks which their failure behavior are significantly depend on 

the  intermediate  principal  stress.  According  to  their  results,  for  rocks  which  are  not 

dependent on the intermediate principal stress, the Mohr-Coulomb and the Hoek-Brown 

criteria had good fit with the polyaxial test data even better than the complicated polyaxial 

criteria. None of the Inscribed or the Circumscribed Drucker-Prager gave a close fit with the 

polyaxial test data for the five different rock types. They also found out that the polyaxial 

failure  criteria  might  give  a  close  fit  to  the  conventional  triaxial  test  data  and  also 

21 
 

incorporates the effect of the intermediate principal stress.  It was concluded that the Mohr-

Coulomb  criterion  underestimates  rock  strength  and  the  Drucker-Prager  criterion 

overestimates rock strength. Using of the Modified Wiebols-Cook and the Modified Lade 

failure criteria was recommended.  

 

Yi et al. (2005) compared three common rock failure criteria based on the minimum 

mud weight estimation by using polyaxial test data for Yuubari shale and Dunham dolomite. 

The linear poro-elasticity model was used to determine borehole in-situ stresses. The Mohr-

Coulomb, the Drucker-Prager and the Modified Lade were the three failure criteria evaluated 

in their study. A hypothetical data set for in-situ stress and pore pressure was used for the 

evaluation  of  rock  failure  criteria.  They  concluded  that  failure  criterion  which  fits  the 

polyaxial test data best describes the rock failure better, and therefore gives more reliable 

results  for  the  minimum  required  mud  weight  predictions.  Based  on  their  results,  no 

particular failure criterion estimates higher or lower minimum mud weight for all the cases 

studied. For Dunham dolomite, the Modified Lade criterion has good fit with polyaxial test 

data and therefore, predicted results of minimum required mud weight by the Modified Lade 

supposed to be reliable. In case of Yuubari shale, the Mohr-Coulomb criterion has good fit 

with  polyaxial  test  data  and  estimated  results  of  minimum  required  mud  by  the  Mohr-

Coulomb criterion are considered to be reliable. 

 

Al-Ajmi and Zimmerman (2006) developed the linear form of Mogi-Coulomb and 

compared that with the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion. They proposed the use of the Mogi-

Coulomb  over  the  Mohr-Coulomb  regarding  both  fitting  polyaxial  test  data  and  also 

prediction of the borehole breakout pressure. Since the Mogi-Coulomb can properly account 

strengthening  effect  of  intermediate  principal  stress,  it  can  be  reliable  criterion  for  the 

estimation of borehole breakout pressure compare to the Mohr-Coulomb criterion.  The field 

case evaluation of failure criteria was done on four offshore wells. The results of field case 

studies verified that the Mogi-Coulomb estimates more realistic results for the minimum 

required  mud  weight  than  the  Mohr-Coulomb  criterion.  They  found  out  that  borehole 

stability is remarkably dependent on the intermediate principal stress and using polyaxial 

failure criteria such as the Mogi-Coulomb is an advantage in wellbore stability analysis.  

22 
 

 Simangunsong et al. (2006) compared minimum mud weight prediction of three 

common rock failure criteria.  By using linear elasticity borehole stability model, the Mohr-

Coulomb, the Drucker-Prager, and the Modified Lade criteria were evaluated based on rock 

mechanical and stress data from North Sea fields (McLean and Addis, 1990, Wong et al., 

1994). The three failure criteria was used to estimate the minimum required mud weigh 

required to drill the reservoir section in Cyrus field and a North Sea oil field. The results 

were compared with the actual mud weight used to successfully drill the borehole. According 

to the results, the Circumscribed Drucker-Prager underestimated the minimum required mud 

weight  to  prevent  breakouts  from  occurring,  while  the  Mohr-Coulomb  criterion 

overestimates the required minimum required mud weight to prevent borehole breakouts. 

The estimated results of minimum required mud weight by the Modified Lade criterion is not 

as conservative as the Mohr-Coulomb and not as unsafe as the Drucker-Prager and therefore, 

the Modified Lade criterion predicts more realistic results than the other two failure criteria.  

 

Benz  and  Schwab  (2008)  optimized  the  material  parameters  for  six  rock  failure 

criteria to obtain the least misfit with polyaxial test data of eight different types of rock. They 

concluded that non-linearity and including the effects of intermediate principal stress are two 

features of failure criteria which possibly enhance better fitting of polyaxial test data. Non-

linear polyaxial HBMN criterion (Matsuoka and Nakai, 1982) which is an extension of the 

Hoek-Brown gave a good fit with polyaxial test data compared to other failure criteria.  

 

Nawrocki (2010) predicted borehole breakout pressure based on the evaluation of 

four rock failure criteria including the Mohr-Coulomb, the Modified Lade, the Inscribed and 

Circumscribed Drucker-Prager.  Laboratory measured rock mechanical properties for two 

different types of sandstone were used in his analysis. He recommended the Modified Lade 

as  a  reliable  failure  criterion  for  wellbore  stability  analysis.    Vertical  stress  gradient 

determined from rock density and horizontal stresses were calculated according to typical 

range  of  effective  horizontal  to  vertical  stress  ratio.  Based  on  his  results,  the  Inscribed 

Drucker-Prager  and  the  Mohr-Coulomb  predict  higher  minimum  required  mud  weight 

compared to other two failure criteria since they underestimate the strength of rock. The 

Circumscribed Drucker-Prager estimates the lowest range of borehole breakout pressure by 

23 
 

overestimation of rock strength. The Modified lade predicts the borehole breakout pressure 

in  the  middle  range  of  results  between  upper  and  lower  boundaries  by  other  criteria. 

Furthermore,  the  Modified  Lade  has  minimum  difference  of  results  from  the  vertical  to 

horizontal borehole compared to other three failure criteria. Therefore, Nawrocki concluded 

that the Modified Lade criterion can be a reliable failure criterion for the practical purposes.  

 

Zhang, Kao, and Radha (2010) compared minimum mud weight prediction of five 

common failure criteria including the Mohr-Coulomb, the Mogi-Coulomb, the Modified 

Lade, the Hoek-Brown and the Drucker-Prager. The results of triaxial tests were used to 

determine material parameters of failure criteria for different lithology. The hypothetical data 

set for in-situ stresses and also well depth (28000m for Dunham Dolomite and 12000m for 

Mizhou Trachyte) was considered. The Mohr-Coulomb and the Drucker-Prager criteria give 

upper and lower bound of results for the minimum required mud weight respectively. The 

Modified Lade criterion was considered as unsafe criterion for wellbore stability analysis due 

to overestimation of rock strength which might be significant. The Mogi-Coulomb and the 

Hoek-Brown  criteria  were  recommended  for  wellbore  stability  analysis  since  the 

overestimation and underestimation of rock strength by these two failure criteria are small 

and can be neglected.  

 

Reviewing previous studies reveals that some failure criteria, including Stassi d’Alia, 

have not been considered. Also in some of the previous studies, hypothetical data set have 

been  used  for  the  stress  data,  rock  mechanical  properties,  and  well  depth  which  caused 

results to be unrealistic in some cases. For instance, true vertical well depth in the range of 

12,000  m  to  28,000  m  has  been  chosen  for  analysis  which  caused  the  results  not  to  be 

directly applicable to the stability of wells for petroleum exploitation (Zhang et al., 2010).  

Furthermore,  quantitative  comparisons  have  been  previously  studied  on  some  of  failure 

criteria but few evaluations of the failure criteria are based on typical petroleum related 

situations. 

 

 

 

3.  METHODOLOGY 

24 
 

Statistical analysis of rock failure criteria is the primary objective of this study. The 

thirteen  of  most  common  failure  criteria  have  been  described  and  the  solution  for  the 

required material parameters was obtained based on the rock mechanical data from Rulison 

field in western Colorado (Higgings, 2006). A linear poro-elasticity model was chosen for 

determination of the borehole principal in-situ stresses. Variables for the statistical analysis 

can be divided in three groups including rock mechanical parameters, stress data, and well 

path parameters. Internal angle of friction and uniaxial compressive strength are the rock 

mechanical variables. Overburden, horizontal stresses and pore pressure are the effective 

stress variables for different depths. Different borehole inclination and azimuth was selected 

for the statistical analysis. Three different rock lithology; shale, sandstone, and siltstone were 

investigated. Similarities and differences of results for minimum required mud weight by 

different rock failure statistically investigated using percentage difference method and results 

presented through the table of contradiction. Different range of percentage difference has 

been specified by color code to highlight similarities and differences.  

 

3.1. ROCK FAILURE CRITERIA 

In the literature part of thesis (Section 2.2), selected failure criteria for this study 

comprehensively described and desired characteristics and disadvantages of each failure 

criterion has been discussed. Two main concerns which stand out for the evaluation of rock 

failure criteria are how to determine material constant parameters for failure criteria and also 

how to define numerical solution for determination of borehole breakout pressure with each 

different rock failure criterion.  This section will explain method has been used in this study 

to determine material parameters for different criteria.  

 

3.1.1. Failure Criteria Parameters. One of the major challenges in studying rock 

failure criteria is the determination of material parameters for each criterion to have good fit 

with  polyaxial  test  results.  Previous  studies  have  investigated  mentioned  problem  and 

solution for determination of material parameters provided using the basic rock mechanical 

properties including uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) and frictional angle which are 

25 
 

basic parameters of Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion (Vekeens and Walters, 1989, Zhou, 

1994,  Ewy,  1999,  Al-Ajmi  and  Zimmerman,  2005).  In  this  study,  frictional  angle  and 

uniaxial compressive strength from triaxial tests results have been used as basic input data 

for the determination of material parameters for failure criteria. For some of failure criteria, 

flow factor ( ) is one of the input for the solution of material parameters which is function of 

internal angle of friction. For those failure criteria with tensile strength component, uniaxial 

compressive strength data is used to estimate tensile strength. Hoek-Brown failure criterion 

is  an  exception  since  there  is  no  published  solution  for  the  relation  between  material 

constant, m and rock mechanical properties. Different rock mechanical references provided 

range of material constant, m for different rock lithology (Jaeger et al., 2007, Zoback, 2007).   

 

3.2. ROCK MECHANICAL & STRESS DATA 

Rock mechanical and stress data from the Rulison field in western Colorado have 

been used in this study because the complete set of triaxial test results and stress data for 

different lithologies and effective stress state was reported (Higgins, 2006). The Rulison field 

is a tight gas play of interbedded sandstone, shale and siltstone.  Rock mechanical data from 

triaxial tests  on core samples of shale, sandstone and siltstone was reported. Stress  data 

determined by a one dimensional geomechanical model (Figure 3.1 and 3.2). Based on the 

results of mechanical properties from triaxial tests, each rock lithology has been categorized 

into three groups of weak, medium and hard strength. One of the main reasons of using the 

data set from the Rulison field is its earth stress field. Horizontal compression of the Rocky 

Mountains causes the maximum horizontal stress gradient to be the largest stress component 

for the deeper sections. Stress data for well RWF 323-21 is shown in Table 3.2 where the 

well is in a normal faulting regime but for the pressurized zone at 2500 m depth, magnitude 

of maximum horizontal stress gradient is approaching the vertical stress gradient (Table 3.2 

& Figure 3.1).  Stress data for well RMV 60-17 shows a strike slip faulting regime (Table 3.3 

& Figure 3.2).

3.3. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PROCEDURE 

Based on the combination of the variables, different scenarios were defined for the 

statistical analysis.  Rock properties of each different lithology (Table 3.1) were analyzed for 

the stress data in the Table 3.2 and Table 3.3 to determine the minimum drilling fluid density 

by rock failure criteria.  All scenarios have been evaluated for a different well inclination and 

azimuth. Results of minimum required mud weight by different rock failure criteria for each 

specific scenario have been presented in a typical plot of minimum mud weight vs wellbore 

inclination. In order to statistically compare the results for different rock failure criteria, 

percentage difference method has been used and the results have been presented through the 

table  of  contradiction.  The  horizontal  axis  of  contradiction  table  shows  results  of  the 

minimum drilling fluid density for the horizontal borehole and the vertical axis represents the 

results  for  the  vertical  borehole.  A  color  code  has  been  specified  for  each  interval  of 

percentage difference. Percentage difference interval of 0 to 5 which highlighted with orange 

color shows the high level similarity in the results. The part of contradiction table which is 

highlighted by red color shows the high level of difference. Lower level of difference is 

shown by blue color and yellow color represents the lower range of similarity (Table 3.4).

4.  RESULTS 

29 
 

The  results  of  minimum  required  mud  weight  by  different  failure  criteria  are 

presented for three lithologies, shale, sandstone, and siltstone. The plot of minimum mud 

weight versus borehole inclination shows the results by different criteria for each scenario. 

Statistical  comparison  was  done  using  percentage  difference  method  and  the  results 

presented through the table of contradiction. Similarities and differences between the results 

of different rock failure criteria are investigated by interpretation of color mapping in tables 

of contradiction which represents the distribution of results. The effect of variation in rock 

mechanical properties on the results of different failure criteria for the minimum required 

mud weight was analyzed. The failure criteria on the boundaries of results, failure criteria 

with highest degree of similarity in results, and criterion with lowest difference between the 

results for the vertical and horizontal borehole are specified for different scenario. Also, the 

effect  of  strike-slip  stress  faulting  regime  on  the  distribution  of  results  is  interpreted. 

Furthermore, difference between the distribution of results for the normally pressurized zone 

and over pressurized zone is analyzed. 

4.1. SHALE 

For the weak shale which has the lowest UCS value in the series of rock mechanical 

data,  the  Tresca  and  the  Von  Mises  give  the  upper  high  range  of  results  and  the 

Circumscribed  Drucker-Prager  predicts  the  lowest  range  of  results.  The  Circumscribed 

Drucker-Prager approached the middle range of results by increasing inclination and show 

similar results as the Modified Lade for the horizontal borehole. The Mohr-Coulomb has 

minimum difference of results from vertical borehole to horizontal borehole and the Von 

Mises has maximum difference (Fig 4.1 and Table 4.1). The Modified Wiebols-Cook and the 

Mogi-Coulomb show closest match. For the wellbore case with 30 degree azimuth, there is 

difference in the distribution of results. In this condition, the Hoek-Brown and the Inscribed 

Drucker-Prager  estimated  the  highest  and  lowest  boundary  of  results  for  the  vertical 

borehole. The Modified Wiebols-Cook and the Mogi-Coulomb predicted very similar results 

for a case with 30 degree azimuth. The Circumscribed Drucker-Prager predicts same results 

as the Modified Lade for the horizontal borehole (Table 4.2).

The failure criteria show different trends of results for horizontal wells oriented with 

a 90 degree from North. The differences between highest and lowest boundary of results for 

vertical borehole is higher than other cases (Tables 4.3 and 4.5). Distribution of results is less 

than  other  cases  except  the  higher  boundary  of  results  for  the  vertical  borehole.  Failure 

criteria in the high range estimated the same results for the horizontal borehole (Tables 4.3 

and 4.5).  The Modified Wiebols-Cook and the Mogi-Coulomb predicted very similar results 

in  all  cases  studied  for  the  weak  shale.  Although,  the  Circumscribed  Drucker-Prager 

predicted the lowest range of results but its difference with failure criteria in the middle 

range of results is relatively small especially for the horizontal borehole (Tables 4.1, 4.2 and 

4.4).  Distribution of results for the deeper depth in over pressurized zone is lower than 

normally pressurized zone in shallower depth (Tables 4.1, 4.4, and 4.7). For over pressurized 

zone at 2000 m depth, the Tresca and the Circumscribed Drucker-Prager predicted the higher 

and lower bound of results respectively (Figure 4.3 and Tables 4.4 and 4.5). In all cases 

studied for the weak shale, the results of the Tresca and the Von Mises as higher bound have 

major difference with the results of other failure criteria (Figures 4.1 and 4.2)

When the rock mechanical properties of weak shale has been analyzed with the stress 

data of a strike slip faulting regime, the results show the same distribution as the normal 

faulting scenario but the difference is in a decreasing trend toward the horizontal borehole. 

The Mogi-Coulomb and the Modified Wiebols-Cook criteria show very close results in all 

cases have been studied for strike slip faulting regime in the weak shale (Figure 4.3, Tables 

4.6 and 4.7). The Tresca and the Von Mises represented the highest bound of results with 

significant differences with the results of other failure criteria. The Mohr-Coulomb has the 

minimum  difference  between  results  for  the  vertical  and  horizontal  borehole.  The 

Circumscribed Drucker-Prager predicts same result as the Modified Lade for the vertical 

borehole (Figure 4.3). For a case with 90 degree azimuth, group of failure criteria estimated 

the same results for the horizontal borehole in the higher bound of results (Table 4.7). By 

increasing  azimuth,  distribution  of  results  for  the  horizontal  borehole  tends  to  be  lower 

(Table 4.7).

For the medium strength and hard shale, higher UCS caused different failure criteria 

to be in the lower boundaries of results. The differences between failure criteria for the lower 

boundary and middle range of results are more significant in hard shale compare to medium 

strength shale. Greater magnitude of tensile component due to higher UCS is the main reason 

why  the  Murrel,  the  Stassi  d’Alia,  and  the  Modified  Griffith  criteria  are  in  the  lower 

boundary of results (Figures 4.4 and 4.5, Tables 4.8 and 4.9). The Tresca criterion represents 

the highest boundary of results and the Murrel predicts the lowest boundary of results.  The 

Inscribed  Drucker-Prager  and  the  Modified  Griffith  replaced  the  Tresca  and  the  Murrel 

respectively as the highest and lowest boundary of results by increasing inclination toward 

horizontal borehole and this is more dominant for the high azimuth cases (Table 4.9). In all 

cases studied for the hard shale, the Modified Lade, the Mogi-Coulomb, and the Modified 

Wiebols-Cook estimated very similar results (Figures 4.4 and 4.5, Tables 4.8 and 4.9). In this 

situation,  the  results  of  the  Circumscribed  Drucker-Prager  is  different  than  weak  shale 

(Figure 4.1) and are very close to the results of the Modified Lade, the Mogi-Coulomb, and 

the Modified Wiebols-Cook criteria in the upper medium range of results (Figures 4.4 and 

4.5, Tables 4.8 and 4.9).

4.2. SANDSTONE 

In the case of sandstone, the table of contradiction is dominated with red for  the 

normally pressurized zone which shows a major difference in distribution of results (Figure 

4.6, Tables 4.10). This is the same for the different level of strength in sandstone (Table 

4.11).  Higher  internal  angle  of  friction  in  the  weak  sandstone  caused  the  results  of  the 

Circumscribed Drucker-Prager remarkably decrease and distribution of results be higher. 

This situation is different for the over pressurized zone (deeper depth) and distribution of 

results  is  lower  than  the  normally  pressurized  zone  (Tables  4.11).  The  Tresca  and  the 

Circumscribed Drucker-Prager criteria represent the highest and lowest boundaries of results 

respectively.  The  Modified  Lade  shows  lowest  difference  of  results  from  vertical  to 

horizontal  borehole  (Figures  4.6).  The  Modified  Lade  and  the  Mogi-Coulomb  criteria 

predicted  very  similar  results  in  all  cases  for  the  weak  sandstone.  Failure  criteria  in  the 

middle range of results show significant difference with the higher and lower boundaries of 

results (Figures 4.6 and 4.7).

Increasing UCS caused the Murrel and the Stassi d’Alia approach the middle range of 

results in medium strength sandstone and lower boundary of results for the vertical borehole 

in  the  hard  sandstone  (Figures  4.8,  4.9,  and  4.10).  The  Tresca  and  the  Circumscribed 

Drucker-Prager represent the highest and lowest boundaries of results respectively (Figures 

4.8, 4.9, Tables 4.12). The results of the Inscribed Drucker-Prager moved toward the higher 

bound of results (Figures 4.8, 4.9, and 4.10). The Hoek-Brown replaced the Circumscribed 

Drucker-Prager  as  the  lowest  boundary  of  the  results  for  the  horizontal  borehole  by 

increasing the azimuth to 90 degree. In this situation, the Inscribed Drucker-Prager criterion 

estimated same result as the Tresca for the highest boundary of results (Figure 4.10 and 

Table  4.13).  By  increasing  azimuth,  the  results  of  the  Circumscribed  Drucker-Prager 

approached the middle range of result with similarity to the results of the Modified Lade 

criterion for the horizontal borehole (Figure 4.10 and Table 4.13). The Hoek-Brown criterion 

has lowest difference of results from vertical to the horizontal borehole (Figures 4.8, 4.9, and 

4.10, Tables 4.12 and 4.13). Distribution of the results is going to be lower by increasing 

wellbore azimuth (Tables 4.12 and 4.13).

4.3. SILTSTONE 

The weak siltstone has an average UCS but had the highest internal angle of friction 

between  all  cases  of  rock  mechanical  properties.  In  this  condition,  the  Circumscribed 

Drucker-Prager as the lowest boundary of results has significant differences with the results 

of other failure criteria especially in normally pressurized zone (Figure 4.11 and Table 4.14). 

Higher frictional angle in the weak siltstone is the main reason for this distribution. The 

results of the Mogi-Coulomb and the Modified Lade criteria show close similarity in all 

cases studied weak siltstone (Figures 4.11 & 4.12, Tables 4.14 & 4.15). The results of the 

Tresca  and  the  Circumscribed  Drucker-Prager  criteria  show  the  highest  difference. 

Difference  between  results  of  failure  criteria  for  the  vertical  and  horizontal  borehole  is 

smaller than other cases. For this situation, the Modified Lade criterion represents the lowest 

difference between results for the vertical and horizontal borehole (Figures 4.11 & 4.12). The 

failure criteria analysis for the weak siltstone for a normally pressurized zone show largest 

distribution between all different statistical analysis cases (Tables 4.14).

The hard siltstone has the highest UCS and lowest frictional angle among all cases of 

rock mechanical properties. The Inscribed Drucker-Prager and the Murrel represented the 

highest  and lowest  boundaries of results respectively  (Figure 4.13 and Table 4.16).   By 

increasing azimuth, the Modified Griffith replaced the Murrel as the lowest boundary of the 

results for the horizontal borehole (Figures 4.14 & 4.15, Tables 4.17 & 4.18). The results of 

the Circumscribed Drucker-Prager criterion represented the middle range of results with 

close similarity to the results of the Modified Wiebols-Cook. The Modified Wiebols-Cook, 

the Circumscribed Drucker-Prager, the Mogi-Coulomb and the Modified Lade give very 

similar  results  for  all  cases  studied  for  the  hard  siltstone.  The  Hoek-Brown  criterion 

represented the lowest difference between results for the vertical and horizontal borehole 

(Figures 4.13, 4.14 and 4.15). Distribution of results for the horizontal borehole is lower for 

those cases with  higher  azimuth  (Tables 4.17 & 4.18). Although  the Von Mises usually 

predicted the higher bound of results for the minimum required mud weight, its results are in 

the middle range for the hard siltstone.

5.  FIELD CASE STUDIES 

50 
 

Failure criteria were evaluated on three field cases in order to compare the predicted 

results of minimum required mud weight by field mud weight. A North Sea oil field (Wong 

et al., 1994), UK continental shelf (Mclean and Addis, 1990), and Pagerungan gas field 

(Ramos et al., 1998) are three fields which have been chosen for the evaluation of failure 

criteria since the complete set of rock mechanical properties, stress data and also information 

about drilling history (well trajectory and field mud weight) were provided.  The percentage 

difference method was used to compare the results of minimum required mud weight by 

different failure criteria and field mud weight. The result of comparison is presented using 

the conventional column chart.  

 

5.1. NORTH SEA OIL FIELD 

Field data from the first extended-reach horizontal well drilled in North Sea oil field 

was used for the evaluation of failure criteria. Rock mechanical properties were determined 

based on the triaxial and thick walled cylinder strength (TWC) test results on core samples 

from three intervals, the Middle Ness (Sandstone with shale streaks), Etive (Sandstone), 

Rannoch  (Sandstone)  (Table  5.1).  The  deviated  well  plan  is  shown  on  figure  5.1.  The 

extended-reach horizontal well was drilled successfully using the mud weight of 1.3 g/cc 

(0.57 psi/ft) for all three formations, Middle Ness, Etive and Rannoch.

5.3. PAGERUNGAN GAS FIELD, NORTH OF BALI ISLAND, INDONESIA 

Wellbore instabilities associated with drilling of hard and brittle Ngimbang Shale was 

the major challenge of developing the Pagerungan gas field in Bali Island. By determining 

the accurate stress field (Strike Slip faulting regime), optimization of mud weight was done 

which resulted in improving of drilling efficiency. Laboratory measured rock mechanical 

properties and stress data for Well PGA-2 are presented in table 5.6. The development PGA-

2 well was drilled successfully through Ngimbang Shale with 25 degree inclination, azimuth 

of N47E, and mud weight of 10.6 ppg.

6.  DISCUSSION 

59 
 

According to the results of the statistical analysis, rock mechanical properties as a 

main  category  of  variables  can  significantly  change  the  distribution  of  results  for  the 

minimum required mud weight by different rock failure criteria. Major difference in the 

frictional angle and UCS may cause different rock failure criteria to be in the higher and 

lower boundaries of the results. The Mohr-Coulomb criterion always estimates the higher 

minimum required mud weight than actual polyaxial failure criteria because of neglecting the 

effect of intermediate principal stress. For the high strength formation, the results of Mohr-

Coulomb criterion approach upper bounds of results which show it might not be an accurate 

criterion  for  failure  analysis  of  hard  lithology.  The  Mohr-Coulomb  criterion  is  mainly 

represents the middle range of results. The results of the polyaxial Mogi-Coulomb criterion 

do not show a major difference when varying rock mechanical properties and are always 

between middle range to lower range of the results.  

The Tresca criterion is mainly representing the highest boundary of the results. Since 

linear the Tresca criterion is only dependent on a single variable (UCS) and also does not 

include the effect of intermediate principal stress, it cannot give an accurate description of 

stress condition at breakout failure around a wellbore. The results of the Inscribed Drucker-

Prager replaced the Tresca as the highest boundary for high strength formations. The Von 

Mises  criterion  predicts  high  values  for  the  minimum  required  mud  weight  since  this 

criterion does not change results with changing differential stress around the borehole due to 

its symmetrical properties of failure. Although intermediate principal stress does effect rock 

strength, it is not significant as the other principal stresses. Dependency on a single variable 

is other shortcoming of this criterion for accurate description of stress condition at failure 

and estimation of the minimum required mud weight. The results of Von Mises criterion 

approached the middle range of results for the high strength formations. 

 

The Inscribed Drucker-Prager criterion estimates the high range of minimum required 

mud  weight  compared  to  other  rock  failure  criteria  because  of  underestimation  of  rock 

strength. The results of the Inscribed Drucker-Prager are higher than the Tresca and the Von 

60 
 

Mises  for  the  high  strength  formation.  The  Circumscribed  Drucker-Prager  is  mainly 

estimating the lower minimum required mud weight than other rock failure criteria because 

of overestimation of rock strength. The results of the Circumscribed Drucker-Prager are 

significantly lower than other failure criteria for the weaker formation with high internal 

angle of friction. For the hard formation, the results of the Circumscribed Drucker-Prager 

show close similarity to the Midfield Lade, the Mogi-Coulomb, and the Modified Wiebols-

Cook results especially for the horizontal borehole. In this situation, the results of the Murrel 

criterion replaced the Circumscribed Drucker-Prager as the  lowest boundary of results. The 

results of the Hoek-Brown criterion mainly have minimum difference between the vertical 

and  horizontal  borehole.    Range  of  results  for  the  Hoek-Brown  criterion  is  remarkably 

depends on the magnitude of material constant,   for different lithology.  

 

The results of the Modified Lade and the Modified Wiebols-Cook show very close 

similarity to the results of the Mogi-Coulomb criterion for all cases of statistical analysis. 

These three polyaxial failure criteria typically  have small difference between results for 

vertical  and horizontal borehole.  Also, variation  of rock mechanical properties does not 

change the range of results by these three criteria. These three criteria potentially can give 

more accurate description of rock at failure because of considering the effect of intermediate 

principal stress on rock strength and good fitting of polyaxial test data for different types of 

rock. 

 

Range of results for the Griffith criterion is changing by variation in compressive 

strength  of  rock  (UCS)  since  the  tensile  component  in  this  criterion  determines  from  a 

constant ratio with UCS. For the Modified Griffith criterion, variation of rock mechanical 

properties has more influence on the range of results for minimum required mud weight 

because  the  tensile  component  in  the  Modified  Griffith  is  a  function  of  both  UCS  and 

internal angle of friction. For the hard formations with low internal angle of friction, the 

Modified Griffith criterion represents the lower range of the results. For weak formations 

with high internal angle of friction, the Modified Griffith criterion predicts the higher range 

of results for the minimum required mud weight.  

 

61 
 

Variation of rock mechanical  properties affects  the results of  the Murrel  and  the 

Stassi d’Alia more than other criteria. The Murrel criterion estimates the lowest boundary of 

results for hard formations with low internal angle of friction since the tensile component in 

this criterion only depends on uniaxial compressive strength (UCS).  In general, increasing 

UCS caused the results of both the Murrel and the Stassi d’Alia approach the lower range of 

results for the minimum required mud weight. For medium strength and weak formations, 

the results of the Murrel and the Stassi d’Alia criteria represent the middle range of results.  

 

In general, distribution of the result in normally pressurized zone (lower depth) is 

higher  than  over  pressurized  zone  (deeper  depth).  Furthermore,  differences  between  the 

results for the vertical and horizontal boreholes by different  failure criteria are typically 

higher in normally pressurized zone rather than over pressurized zone of deeper depth. Based 

on the results of all cases, increasing azimuth usually caused that distribution of results  to be 

lower for the horizontal borehole.   

 

According to the results of field cases, the Mogi-Coulomb, the Modified Lade, and 

the  Modified  Wiebols-Cook  predict  minimum  required  mud  weight  which  has  close 

similarity to the field mud weight used to successfully drill the borehole. For some cases, the 

lower mud weight can be potentially used because the lower mud weight estimated by those 

polyaxial failure criteria which give better description of stress condition at failure. Other 

than those three criteria, the Hoek-Brown criterion mainly estimates close results to the field 

mud  weight.  Results  of  field  cases  verified  the  results  of  statistical  analysis  about  the 

different  distribution  and  boundaries  of  results  due  to  variation  of  rock  mechanical 

properties. There was a different distribution of results for the Rannoch formation of the 

North Sea Oil Field. Since the Rannoch formation has the highest UCS between all cases in 

statistical analysis and field cases, different failure criteria represent the lower boundaries of 

results. In this situation, Modified Wiebols-Cook and Von Mises criteria predict the lower 

bound of results.  

 

 

 

7.  CONCLUSIONS 

62 
 

Based on the results of statistical  analysis, rock  mechanical  properties should be 

considered as key factor in the process of selecting appropriate rock failure criterion for 

wellbore  stability  analysis.  A  failure  criterion  might  give  comparable  results  with  other 

criteria  in  one  condition  but  estimates  very  high  or  very  low  results  for  the  minimum 

required mud weight in other situation due to variation of rock mechanical properties. The 

results  of  the  Murrel,  the  Stassi  d’Alia,  the  Modified  Griffith,  and  the  Circumscribed 

Drucker-Prager criteria show high sensitivity to variation of rock mechanical properties.  

The Tresca, the Von Mises, and the Inscribed Drucker-Prager estimate the higher 

bounds for the minimum required mud weight for all cases. Although the Circumscribed 

Drucker-Prager usually predicts the lower bound for the minimum required mud weight, its 

results are in the middle range for the hard formations with low internal angle of friction. 

The Modified Lade, the Modified Wiebols-Cook and the Mogi-Coulomb give similar results 

for three lithology studied so these failure criteria may be used interchangeably without 

altering the results.  

 

The results of field case studies show that the Mogi-Coulomb, the Modified Lade, 

and the Modified Wiebols-Cook criteria predict close results to the field mud weight used to 

successfully drill the borehole. For some field cases, lower mud weight can be potentially 

used because the lower results estimated by those three polyaxial failure criteria which give 

more accurate description of stress condition at failure. The Hoek-Brown criterion mainly 

estimates close but higher results to the field mud weight for the studied cases. Since the 

results  of  this  criterion  are  mainly  dependent  to  material  parameter,     it  might  give 

unrealistic results in other situation. The results of field case study are comparable with the 

results of statistical analysis about the different distribution and boundaries of results for the 

minimum required mud weight due to variation of rock mechanical properties.  

 

 

 

APPENDIX  

63 
 

DERIVATION OF ROCK FAILURE CRITERIA 

This appendix explains and derives the failure criteria investigated in chapter 2.1: 

 
 
 

1.  MOHR-COULOMB 

                            Figure A-1. Mohr-Coulomb failure envelope in       
 
 

 

Governing equation for Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion is function of normal stress 

components and rock mechanical properties (Eq A.1). Based on the Mohr-Coulomb theory, 

failure in compression will happen at point P where shear stress on specific planes reaches 

value that is sufficient to overcome both the natural cohesion of rock and frictional force that 

oppose along the failure plane: 

 

                                                                                   (A.1) 

                                       

The parameter c is known as cohesion and parameter μ is the coefficient of internal 

angle of friction. The point P which is tangential point of Mohr circle and failure envelope 

represents state of stress on the plane of failure. By using basic trigonometric, the relation 

between angle of internal friction and angle β which is orientation of failure plane in to 

direction of σ1 could be derived as shown here: 

 

                                                             (A.2)   
 
 
                                                              (A.3)           
 
As P is tangential point of the circle and the failure line, line BP is perpendicular to failure line 
(AL): 

64 
 

                                   (A.4) 
 

                                                         

                                                                           

            (A.5)   

 

Finally, following relation derived based on (A.2), (A.3), and (A.4): 
 
 
                                                                                  
 
                                               
The Mohr-Coulomb can also be expressed in term of principal stresses which is presented 
here: 
 
                                                         |  |   (|  |     |  |)                   (A.6) 
                                                         
 
This above relation can be written in following form: 
 
                      

(       )               (A.7) 

(       )              

 

 

 

 
                                              
The mean normal stress (σm )  and maximum shear stress (τm)   on the figure is: 
 
                                         

(       )                        

 

 

(       )           (A.8)  

 

 

 

 

Then Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion can be presented in following way: 
 
                                                                                                (A.9) 

 
                             

By changing order of (A.7), we will have Mohr-Coulomb failure criteria in form of 

                                                 
  

principal stresses: 

                                                                         

       

     

       

      

       

       

           (A.10)  

                                   

65 
 

This can be simplified to following form: 
 
 

                                                                                            (A.11)  

                                            

The    is uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) and   is the flow factor which is 

function of internal angle of friction. The    and   parameters can be found from the results 

of triaxial tests.  

 
 
                                    
 

     

       

                          (A.12)     

                            

 
 
                

2.  MOGI-COULOMB 

       

       

                   (A.13)  

Mogi (1971) verified the effects of the intermediate principal stress on the strength of 

couple of different rock types based on the results of the true triaxial test. Mogi found out 

that mean normal  stress  that opposes creation of  fracture is     , rather than  octahedral 

normal stress,       . 

                       (    )                    (A.14)   

    
                                                                 

                                                                          

Based on Mogi’s assumption and the polyaxial test data provided by Takahashi and 

Koide (1989), Al-Ajmi and Zimmerman (2005) found linear relation that could give a good 

fit with test results in             space: 

 

                                                                                              (A.15) 

 
                                                                

The parameter   is intersection of line on the       axis and    is the inclination of the 

envelope  in               space.    Al-Ajmi  and  Zimmerman  tested  new  developed  linear 

criterion for polyaxial test data from eight different rock types and the results verified the 

Mogi failure based on triaxial test data correlates well with the polyaxial test data. Therefore 

the Mogi Coulomb failure parameters   and   can be evaluated based on the triaxial test 

result.

Figure A-2. Principal Stresses 

 

 
 
 
 

The direction which plane will be equally inclined to principal axes is: 

                                                                            

              

 

√ 

                   (A.16)  

                                                     

The plane is called octahedral plane because it is parallel to face of an octahedron 

with vertices on the principal axes. The normal and shear stress acting on this plane called 

the octahedral shear stress (    ) and octahedral normal stress (    ). The stresses σ and τ in a 

general direction λ1, λ2, and λ3 will be determined by following relation (Fjaer et al., 2008): 

 

                                       

          

          

                                                (A.17) 

                  

   

        

   

 
 
        
 
 

   

                         (A.18) 

By substituting (A.16) into (A.17) and (A.18), octahedral normal and shear stress will be: 
 
 

                                          

 

 

(              )                (A.19)  

                         

 

 

 √(       )      (       )      (       )         (A.20)  

67 
 

Considering conventional triaxial test (σ2=σ3), octahedral shear stress will reduce to:  
 

 
                           

                                   

      

 

 

√(       )      (       )      (       )      √ 

 

 (       )    (A.21) 

                     
 

The substituting of (A.21) into (A.15) will result in:  
 

   √ 
 

(       )                       (A.22)                                 

                                                              

 
 

Rearranging (A.22) will change the linear Mogi criterion to a new form: 
 
 
                          

 (       )   ( 

)   ( 

 

 

 

 √ 

 

 √ 

)              (A.23)   

 
                               

Considering maximum shear stress definition in A.8, the relation A.23 can be written 

in following form: 

 

                                  ( 

 

)   ( 

 

)                  (A.24)  

 √ 

 √ 
 
                                          

If we compare the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion given in A.9 with A.24, the linear 

Mogi-Coulomb criterion parameters   and   can be determined by following relations: 

 

                                                                  

                           (A.25) 

 √ 

 
 

                    

 √ 

 

                         (A.26)                                             

                                                             

The parameter   represents the internal friction, while the parameter   is related to 

the both cohesion and internal friction of rock. Using relation A.12 and A.13, the linear 

Mogi-Coulomb failure criterion parameters   and   can be identified based on the Mohr-

Coulomb criteria parameters (q, C0):
