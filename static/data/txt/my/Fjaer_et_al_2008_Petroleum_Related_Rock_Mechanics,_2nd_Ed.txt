Rasmus Risnes in Memoriam

It is with great regret that we announce the passing of Professor Rasmus Risnes who died
on the 3rd of December 2004 after a prolonged struggle against ill health. He was active in
the ﬁeld of rock mechanics right up to the end and made a signiﬁcant contribution to this
second edition which, regretfully, he will never see. Rasmus was a very pleasant individual
whose vast knowledge and pedagogical expertise was a continual source of inspiration to
us all.

He was recognized as one of the pioneers in petroleum-related rock mechanics, both
nationally and internationally, and his early work on sand failure is still regarded as a
classic. In later years he turned his attention to the Chalk and established a highly reputable
research and teaching laboratory at the University of Stavanger (Norway).

Rasmus will be sorely missed by his many colleagues and friends in the rock mechanics

community.

Preface to the second edition

During the years that have passed since the ﬁrst edition of this book, petroleum related rock
mechanics has been well established as a signiﬁcant supplier of premises and boundary
conditions for the petroleum industry. More than ever, it is now recognised that engineers
and geologists in the petroleum industry should possess a certain level of knowledge within
rock mechanics. The need for a textbook like this is therefore even larger now than it was
15 years ago.

Although there are still a lot of uncovered areas within petroleum related rock mechan-
ics, the topic has in many ways developed signiﬁcantly over the later years. This is a natural
consequence of the increased focus this area has gained. We are also proud to admit that
the general knowledge of petroleum related rock mechanics among the authors of this book
has increased since the ﬁrst edition was prepared. Consequently, when the need for a new
printing of the book appeared, we felt the need to revise the manuscript in order to account
for this development.

The revision has been quite extensive for some parts of the manuscript. The basic struc-
ture of the book is however kept as it was, and parts of the text have only been subject to
minor revisions. The major guideline for the work has been to update and add information
where we felt it was relevant, while maintaining the concept of the book as an introduction
to petroleum related rock mechanics as an engineering science. A consequence of this dual
objective has been the introduction of a couple of new appendices, where more advanced
mathematics and heavy formulas are presented in a compact form. This way, we hope that
the main text shall remain easily accessible even for newcomers in the ﬁeld, while at the
same time the more complete formulas shall be available to the readers who need them.

The revision has been made by the same team of authors that wrote the ﬁrst edition. In
addition, several friends and colleagues have generously provided suggestions, advice and
encouragement for the work. This support is greatly appreciated.

Foreword to the 1992 edition

About 10 years ago, petroleum related rock mechanics was mostly conﬁned to a few spe-
ciﬁc topics like hydraulic fracturing or drilling bit performance. Although a few precursors
had already established the basics of what is now spreading out.

In fact, since that time, the whole petroleum industry has progressively realised that
the state of underground stresses and its modiﬁcation due to petroleum related operations,
could have a signiﬁcant impact on performances, in many different aspects of exploration
and production. Therefore all those concepts need now to be presented in a simple but
comprehensive way.

An engineering science, “Petroleum related rock mechanics” is also dependent on the
variable and uncertain character of natural geological materials at depth. The limited avail-
ability of relevant data is also part of the problem. For that reason, it is essential that any
potential user is aware of the high potential of the technique, together with the actual limi-
tations.

This book should totally fulﬁll these needs. The reader will be provided with fundamen-
tals and basics, but also with the techniques used in data acquisition, and eventually with a
series of typical applications like wellbore stability, sand production or subsidence.

The book is mostly for students, geologists or engineers who want to know more about
rock mechanics, and speciﬁcally rock mechanics applied to petroleum industry. It is well
suited for instance, for drilling or mud engineers wanting to know more on the mechanical
aspect of wellbore stability problems, for reservoir engineers who have to deal with stress
related problems in their ﬁeld, like compaction, stress dependent permeability or fracture
injectivity. Operation geologists dealing with drilling in abnormal pressure zones will also
beneﬁt from this book.

Elf Aquitaine Norge, together with other Norwegian oil companies, has been supporting
IKU for several years in their effort to build a strong group in rock mechanics. IKU has
now a well-established team, whose competence is recognised on the international level.
They have mostly been contributing in the ﬁeld of acoustic wave propagation in rocks and
sand production appraisal. They are also very active in research and consulting activities
in the different ﬁelds of petroleum related rock mechanics.

Preface to the 1992 edition

Systematic application of rock mechanics is quite new to the petroleum industry. Accord-
ingly, the need for an introductory textbook for petroleum engineers and scientists has
recently emerged. This need was felt by the authors when we started our research in this
area, and it inspired us to develop the ﬁrst version of this book as a manuscript for a two
weeks continuing education course for petroleum engineers.

The ﬁrst 6 chapters deal with the fundamentals of rock mechanics. This includes theories
of elasticity and failure mechanics, borehole stresses, and acoustic wave propagation. In
addition, sedimentary rocks are viewed from the geological side as well as from the side
of idealised mathematical modelling based on microstructure. For readers who wants to
further extend their knowledge on rock mechanics, we suggest the book “Fundamentals of
rock mechanics” by Jaeger and Cook as a continuation. Deeper insight into acoustic wave
propagation in rocks can be achieved from e.g. the book “Acoustics of porous media” by
Bourbie, Coussy and Zinszner or “Underground Sound” by White.

Chapters 7 and 8 are dedicated to the extremely important task of obtaining parame-
ters that are relevant for rock mechanics ﬁeld application, be it from laboratory tests or
from analysis of ﬁeld data like borehole logs. The last 4 chapters discuss applications of
rock mechanics in borehole stability, sand production, hydraulic fracturing and reservoir
compaction/surface subsidence analyses.

It has also been our intention to make each chapter more or less selfcontained, especially
the chapters dealing with applications. Hopefully, this will make the book useful also to
those who are interested only in one particular topic. The other chapters can then be used
as support depending on the reader’s previous knowledge. Notice, however, that the book
is intended to be an introduction to petroleum related rock mechanics as an engineering
science, rather than a “tool-box” for petroleum engineers.

We wish to thank Elf Aquitaine Norge and Fina Exploration Norway for the ﬁnancial
contributions which made it possible for us to write this book. In particular, we appreciate
the positive feedback and encouragement provided by Alain Guenot of Elf. The skilful
and patient support from Siri Lyng at IKU in preparing the manuscript for camera-ready
quality is greatly appreciated. We also thank Eamonn F. Doyle for advice on our use of the
English language.

Elasticity

1

Most materials have an ability to resist and recover from deformations produced by forces.
This ability is called elasticity. It is the foundation for all aspects of rock mechanics. The
simplest type of response is one where there is a linear relation between the external forces
and the corresponding deformations. When changes in the forces are sufﬁciently small, the
response is (nearly) always linear. Thus the theory of linear elasticity is fundamental for
all discussions on elasticity.

The theory of elasticity rests on the two concepts stress and strain. These are deﬁned
in Sections 1.1 and 1.2. The linear equations relating stresses and strains are discussed
in Section 1.3 for isotropic materials, and in Section 1.7 for anisotropic materials. Linear
thermoelasticity is discussed in Section 1.5.

The region of validity for linear elasticity is often exceeded in practical situations. Some

general features of nonlinear behaviour of rocks are described in Section 1.8.

In petroleum related rock mechanics, much of the interest is furthermore focused on
rocks with a signiﬁcant porosity as well as permeability. The elastic theory for solid ma-
terials is not able to fully describe the behaviour of such materials, and the concept of
poroelasticity has therefore to be taken into account. The elastic response of a rock mater-
ial may also be time dependent, so that the deformation of the material changes with time,
even when the external conditions are constant. The elastic properties of porous materials
and time-dependent effects are described in Sections 1.6 and 1.9, respectively.

1.1. Stress

Consider the situation shown in Fig. 1.1. A weight is resting on the top of a pillar. Due to
the weight, a force is acting on the pillar, while the pillar reacts with an equal, but reversely
directed force. The pillar itself is supported by the ground. Hence the force acting at the
top of the pillar must be acting through any cross-section of the pillar.

The area of the cross-section at a) is A. If the force acting through the cross-section is

denoted F , then the stress σ at the cross-section is deﬁned as:

σ = F

(1.1)
The SI unit for stress is Pa (= Pascal = N/m2). In the petroleum industry, “oilﬁeld”
units like psi (pounds per square inch) are still extensively used, such that one needs to be
familiar with them. See Appendix B for an overview of some conversion factors.

A

The sign of the stress σ is not uniquely deﬁned by the physics of the situation, and has
therefore to be deﬁned by convention. In rock mechanics the sign convention states that
compressive stresses are positive. The historical reason for this is that the stresses dealt with
in rock mechanics are mostly compressive. The sign convention causes no problems when

2

consistently used, but it is important to remember that the opposite sign convention is the
preferred choice in some other sciences involving elasticity, and that it is also occasionally
used in rock mechanics.

As Eq. (1.1) shows, the stress is deﬁned by a force and a cross-section (or more generally,
a surface), through which the force is acting. Consider the cross-section at b). The force
acting through this cross-section is equal to the force acting through the cross-section at a)
(cid:2)
(neglecting the weight of the pillar). The area A
of the cross-section at b) is, however,
smaller than A. Hence the stress σ = F /A
(cid:2)
at b) is larger than the stress at a), i.e. the stress
depends on the position within the stressed sample. Going even further, we may divide the
cross-section at a) into an inﬁnite number of subsections A, through which an inﬁnitely
small part F of the total force F is acting (Fig. 1.2). The force F may vary from one
subsection to another. Consider a subsection i which contains a point P. The stress at the
point P is deﬁned as the limit value of Fi /Ai when Ai goes to zero, i.e.:

σ = lim
Ai→0

Fi
Ai

(1.2)

Eq. (1.2) deﬁnes the local stress at the point P within the cross-section at a), while Eq. (1.1)
describes the average stress at the cross-section. When talking about the stress state at a
point, we implicitly mean local stresses.

The orientation of the cross-section relative to the direction of the force is also important.

Consider the cross-section at c) in Fig. 1.1, with area A
to the cross-section. We may then decompose the force into one component Fn that is
normal to the cross-section, and one component Fp that is parallel to the section (Fig. 1.3).
The quantity

is called the normal stress, while the quantity

(cid:2)(cid:2)
A

(1.4)

is called the shear stress. Thus, there are two types of stresses which may act through a
surface, and the magnitude of each depends on the orientation of the surface.

1.1.1. The stress tensor

To give a complete description of the stress state at a point P within a sample, it is necessary
to identify the stresses related to surfaces oriented in three orthogonal directions.

The stresses related to a surface normal to the x-axis may be denoted σx, τxy and τxz,
representing the normal stress, the shear stress related to a force in y-direction, and the

4

ELASTICITY

shear stress related to a force in the z-direction, respectively. Physically, there will be only
one shear stress associated with this surface. However, the orientation of the shear stress has
to be identiﬁed, and this is most conveniently done by identifying its y- and z-components:
τxy and τxz. Similarly, the stresses related to a surface normal to the y-axis are denoted σy,
τyx and τyz, while the stresses related to a surface normal to the z-axis are denoted σz, τzx
and τzy. Thus there are all together nine stress components related to the point P:

(cid:2)

(cid:3)

σx
τyx
τzx

τxy
σy
τzy

τxz
τyz
σz

(1.5)

Expression (1.5) is called the stress tensor. It gives a complete description of the stress

state at the point P.

Associating the ﬁrst index with the face normal and the second with the force direction,
is a matter of choice, similar to the sign convention. As a result, one will see the opposite
convention used in a number of works, e.g. Landau and Lifshitz (1986). Further, due to the
symmetry of the stress tensor (see below), the convention is of no practical importance.

It is sometimes convenient to denote the stress tensor by a single symbol, for instance (cid:6)(cid:7)
σ .
Thus (cid:6)(cid:7)
σ implicitly means the collection of stress components given by (1.5). The stress
tensor also has a deﬁnite physical meaning: if ˆr is a unit vector, the expression |(cid:6)(cid:7)
σ · ˆr|,
represents the total stress (normal and shear) in the direction of ˆr.
Not all the nine components of the stress tensor are independent, however. Consider a
small square of the xy-plane, as shown in Fig. 1.4. The stresses acting on the square are
shown on the ﬁgure. The square is at rest, hence no net translational or rotational force can

act on it. While no translational force is already ensured, no rotational force requires that

τxy = τyx

Similarly, it may be shown that

and

τxz = τzx

τyz = τzy

(1.6)

(1.7)

(1.8)

(1.9)

The relations (1.6) to (1.8) are general, and they reduce the number of independent com-
ponents of the stress tensor (1.5) to six.

Although being practical for many purposes, the notation used in (1.5) is not very con-
venient for theoretical calculations. For such purposes the following notation is frequently
used: both types of stresses (normal and shear) are denoted σij . The subscripts i and j may
be any of the numbers 1, 2, 3, which represent the x-, y- and z-axis, respectively. The ﬁrst
subscript (i) identiﬁes the axis normal to the actual surface, while the second subscript (j )
identiﬁes the direction of the force. Thus, from Fig. 1.4, we see that σ11 = σx, σ13 = τxz,
etc. In this notation the stress tensor (1.5) becomes

(cid:2)

(cid:3)

σ =

(cid:6)(cid:7)

σ11 σ12 σ13
σ12 σ22 σ23
σ13 σ23 σ33

where we have explicitly used the symmetry of the stress tensor. See Appendices C.4–C.7
for a discussion of how the tensor components change as a result of a change of coordinates.

1.1.2. Equations of equilibrium

Apart from forces acting on a surface of a body, there may also be forces acting on every
part of the body itself. Such forces are called body forces. An example of a body force is
gravity. We shall denote by fx, fy, and fz the components of the body forces per unit mass
acting at the point x, y, z of a body. According to the sign convention, fx is positive if it acts
in the negative x-direction, and similarly for fy and fz. As an example, consider a small
part of volume V of a material with density ρ. Ifz is the vertical axis, the body force due
to gravity acting on this small volume is ρfzV = ρgV , where g is the acceleration of
gravity.

Body forces generally give rise to stress gradients. For instance, an element in a forma-
tion is not only subject to the gravity force, it also has to carry the weight of the formation
above. Thus the total stress increases with increasing depth.

For a stressed body to remain at rest, it is required that all forces acting on the body
cancel. This requirement produced a set of symmetry requirements for the stress tensor
(Eqs. (1.6) to (1.8)). In addition, it produces a set of equations for the stress gradients.
These equations are called the equations of equilibrium.

Consider the parallelepiped shown in Fig. 1.5. The forces acting on this body in the

x-direction are

1.1.3. Principal stresses in two dimensions

For special orientations of the coordinate system, the stress tensor has a particularly simple
form. To reveal this form, we shall initially study stresses in two dimensions. This is more
than just an academic exercise; many problems of practical interest are effectively two-
dimensional.

Consider the normal (σ ) and shear (τ ) stresses at a surface oriented normal to a general
direction θ in the xy-plane, as shown in Fig. 1.6. The triangle on the ﬁgure is at rest, such
that no net forces act on it. Cancellation of forces implies that:

σ = σx cos2 θ + σy sin2 θ + 2τxy sin θ cos θ

= 1
2

(σx − σy ) cos 2θ + τxy sin 2θ

(σy − σx ) sin 2θ + τxy cos 2θ

(1.21)
By proper choice of θ, it is possible to obtain τ = 0. From Eq. (1.21) we see that this
happens when:

tan 2θ = 2τxy
σx − σy

Eq. (1.22) has two solutions, θ1 and θ2. The two solutions correspond to two directions
for which the shear stress τ vanishes. These two directions are called the principal axes of
stress.

The corresponding normal stresses, σ1 and σ2, are called the principal stresses, and are

found by introducing Eq. (1.22) into Eq. (1.19):

(1.24)
It is convenient to choose the notation such that σ1 (cid:2) σ2. Thus, in the direction θ1,
which identiﬁes a principal axis, the normal stress is σ1 and the shear stress is zero. In the
direction θ2, which identiﬁes the other principal axis, the normal stress is σ2 and the shear
stress is zero. The principal axes are orthogonal.

1.1.4. Mohr’s stress circle

It is often convenient to reorient the coordinate system such that the x-axis is parallel to
the ﬁrst principal axis and the y-axis parallel to the other. Then the stresses σ and τ in a
general direction θ relative to the x-axis become, from Eqs. (1.19) and (1.21):

(σ1 − σ2) cos 2θ

σ = 1
2
τ = − 1
2

(σ1 + σ2) + 1
2
(σ1 − σ2) sin 2θ

(1.25)

(1.26)

Plotting corresponding values of σ and τ in a diagram (Fig. 1.7a), we obtain a circle called
the Mohr’s circle. The radius of the circle is (σ1 − σ2)/2 and the centre is at the point
(σ1 + σ2)/2 on theσ -axis.
The stresses σ and τ in any direction θ (Fig. 1.7b) correspond to a point on the Mohr’s
circle. It is seen from Fig. 1.7a that the largest absolute value for the shear stress is (σ1 −
σ2)/2 and occurs for θ = π/4 (= 45°) and θ = 3π/4 (= 135°). The Mohr’s circle is a
very useful tool in the analysis of conditions for rock failure, as will be seen in Chapter 2.

1.1.5. Principal stresses in three dimensions

Now moving to three dimensions, we ﬁrst have to decide how to identify a direction in
space. This can be done by the direction cosines (see also Appendix C.6):

lx = cos αx
ly = cos αy
lz = cos αz

The angles αx, αy, and αz are the angles between our chosen direction and the x-, y- and
z-axes, respectively (Fig. 1.8). The vector ˆr = (lx , ly , lz) is a unit vector in the chosen
direction. Note that we always have

The principal stresses can be found by solving for σ the determinant equation (see
Appendix C, in particular Appendix C.2.12 on page 449):

The three solutions of this equation are the principal stresses σ1, σ2 and σ3. The solutions
are conventionally organized such that σ1 (cid:2) σ2 (cid:2) σ3. The direction cosines l1x, l1y and l1z
identifying the principal axis corresponding to σ1 are found by solving the equations:

The principal axes corresponding to σ2 and σ3 are found similarly by substituting sub-

script 1 by 2 and 3, respectively, in Eqs. (1.32)–(1.34).

If the coordinate system is oriented such that the x-axis is parallel to the ﬁrst, the y-axis
parallel to the second, and the z-axis parallel to the third principal axis, the stress tensor
has the particularly simple form:

l1x (σx − σ1) + l1y τxy + l1zτxz = 0
l1x τxy + l1y (σy − σ1) + l1zτyz = 0
l1x τxz + l1y τyz + l1z(σz − σ1) = 0

1.1.6. Mohr’s stress circles in three dimensions

Mohr’s construction is, naturally, more complicated in three dimensions than in two di-
mensions, and will not be treated in detail here. The basic features of the construction are
shown in Fig. 1.9. Ifl x = 0 (direction in the yz-plane), the stresses σ and τ are located

on the small circle spanning from σ3 to σ2. Ifl z = 0 (direction in the xy-plane), σ and
τ are located on the circle spanning from σ2 to σ1 and, ﬁnally, if ly = 0 (direction in the
xz-plane), σ and τ are located on the large circle spanning from σ3 to σ1. For all other
directions, σ and τ are located within the shaded areas.

1.1.7. Stress invariants

The stress tensor is a second order tensor. When changing to a rotated set of coordinate
axes, the components of the stress tensor change. However, as discussed in Appendix C,
some properties of the stress tensor remain unchanged. The simplest of these is the mean
normal stress

¯σ = (σx + σy + σz)/3

which equals 1/3 of the trace of the matrix (see page 447). The mean normal stress is thus
an invariant of stress.

There also exist other stress combinations that are independent of the coordinate axes.
Any combination of stress invariants will of course be a stress invariant as well. The com-
monly used stress invariants are:

I1 = σx + σy + σz
I2 = −(σx σy + σy σz + σzσx ) + τ 2

1.1.8. Deviatoric stresses
The mean normal stress ¯σ , deﬁned in Eq. (1.38), essentially causes uniform compression
or extension. Distortions, on the other hand, are essentially caused by the so-called devi-
atoric stresses. The deviatoric stress (also called stress deviator or stress deviation—the
terminology is not consistent in the literature) is obtained by subtracting the mean normal
stress from the normal stress components:

ELASTICITY

The invariants J1, J2, J3, and combinations of them, are independent of the choice of
coordinate axes. Invariants of stress deviation appear e.g. in failure criteria, since these
must be independent of the choice of coordinate axes (for isotropic materials).

There are many different ways of writing the invariants of stress deviation. See page 463

for some useful expressions.

One will often encounter various variants of the stress invariants, in particular the para-

meters q and r, which are related to the basic invariants as

For a stress state in which two of the principal stresses are equal (σ2 = σ3) the expres-
sions simplify to

q = |σ1 − σ3|

and

r = σ1 − σ3

q will be used extensively in Chapter 2.

Geometric interpretation of the deviatoric stress invariants

The deviatoric stress invariants have a straightforward geometrical interpretation in prin-
cipal stress space, as illustrated in Fig. 1.10. Eq.(1.46) is the equation of a circle centred
on ¯σ , with the normal pointing along the hydrostatic axis σ1 = σ2 = σ3. Thus the distance
from a point (σ1, σ2, σ3) in principal stress space to the hydrostatic axis is

are the projections of the principal stress axes onto a deviatoric plane (i.e. a plane normal to the hydrostatic axis

σ1 = σ2 = σ3, also called the π-plane) passing through the point (σ1, σ2, σ3). The angle ϑ is called the Lode

angle.

It can further be shown that the angle ϑ, called the Lode angle, indicated in Fig. 1.10, is

(Note that since arccos is a multi-valued function, the Lode angle computed from Eq. (1.51)
is not unique. If one chooses the principal branch of arccos, the result will be in the range
0° to 60° even if the actual stress state corresponds to another value.)

1.1.9. The octahedral stresses

A plane normal to the (1, 1, 1) direction in principal stress space is called an octahedral
plane, a π-plane or a deviatoric plane.

The normal stress on and shear stress in this plane are sometimes called the octahedral

normal stress and the octahedral shear stress, and are given by
(σ1 + σ2 + σ3) = ¯σ = 1

(σ2 − σ3)2 + (σ3 − σ1)2 + (σ1 − σ2)2 =

Note that the normal stress in the direction equally inclined to the principal stress axes is
thus equal to the mean stress.

1.2. Strain

Consider a sample as shown in Fig. 1.11. The position of a speciﬁc particle within the
sample is initially x, y, z. After the action of an external force, the position of this particle
is shifted. We shall denote the shift in x-direction by u, the shift in y-direction by v, and

Fig. 1.11. Sample deformation.

14

ELASTICITY

the shift in z-direction by w. The quantities u, v and w are called the displacements of the
particle. In order to make the signs of the displacements compatible with the signs of the
stresses, as deﬁned in Section 1.1, the displacements are taken to be positive when they
are directed in the negative direction of the axes. Hence, the new position of the particle
initially at x, y, z becomes

(cid:2) = x − u
(cid:2) = y − v
(cid:2) = z − w

x

y

z

(1.54)
(1.55)
(1.56)

If the displacements u, v and w are constants, i.e. they are the same for every particle
within the sample, then the displacement is simply a translation of a rigid body. Another
simple form of displacements is the rotation of a rigid body. For a small rotation speciﬁed
by (cid:5)ω, where the magnitude |(cid:5)ω| gives the angle of rotation while the direction of (cid:5)ω gives
the axis of rotation, the new position of the particle becomes:

where (cid:5)r = (x, y, z), (cid:5)r
the centre of rotation, through which the axis of rotation goes.

(cid:2) = (x

(cid:2)

(cid:2) = (cid:5)r + (cid:5)ω × ((cid:5)r − (cid:5)r0)
(cid:5)r
(1.57)
), and × denotes the vector product. The vector (cid:5)r0 is
(cid:2)

, z

(cid:2)

If the relative position of the particles within the sample are changed, so that the new
positions cannot be obtained simply by a rigid translation and/or rotation of the sample,
the sample is said to be strained. Fig. 1.12 shows an example of a strained sample. The
displacements related to the positions O and P are not equal. The quantity deﬁned as

ε = L − L
(cid:2)

L

= − L

L

(1.58)

is called the elongation corresponding to the point O and the direction OP . To comply with
the sign convention for stresses, we require that the elongation is positive for a contraction.

Fig. 1.12. Deformation

STRAIN

15

Fig. 1.13. Shear deformation.

The elongation is a speciﬁc type of quantities known as strains. The other type of strain that
may occur can be expressed by the change Ψ of the angle between two initially orthogonal
directions (Fig. 1.13). The quantity

Γ = 1
2

tan Ψ

(1.59)

is called the shear strain corresponding to the point O and the direction OP .

For many applications one will only be dealing with inﬁnitesimal strains, which implies
that the strains ε and Γ are so small that their products and squares can be ignored, and we
will make this approximation in the following. See Section 1.8 for a discussion of nonlinear
effects.

Now consider for a while the strains in two dimensions as shown in Fig. 1.14. The

elongation at x, in the x-direction, is given as

εx = (x + x) − x − [(x + x − u(x + x)) − (x − u(x))]
= u(x + x) − u(x)
In the limit when x → 0, we have

1.2.1. The strain tensor and the strain invariants

Similar to Eq. (1.5), we may organize the strains (1.64)–(1.69) in a strain tensor:

ε =

(cid:6)(cid:7)

εx
Γxy Γxz
Γyz

The trace of the strain tensor

εvol = εx + εy + εz

is identical to the volumetric strain, i.e. the relative decrease in volume. The volumetric
strain is independent on the choice of coordinate axes, and is thus an invariant of strain.

Similar to the stress invariants of Eqs. (1.40)–(1.41), it can be shown that the quantities

all strains are deﬁned by

z-axis, respectively. Thus, u1 = u, u2 = v, and u3 = w, while x1 = x, x2 = y, and
x3 = z. We then have ε11 = εx, ε13 = Γxz etc.
In this notation the strain tensor (1.70) becomes

1.2.2. Compatibility conditions

We note from the general deﬁnition of strain (Eq. (1.74)) that all strains are derivatives
(in various combinations) of the components of the displacement vector (cid:5)u = (u1, u2, u3).
Some useful expressions may be derived from this fact. For instance, we observe from
Eqs. (1.71) and (1.74) that the volumetric strain εvol equals the divergence of (cid:5)u, i.e.

εvol = ∇ · (cid:5)u = − dV

V

(1.76)

The minus sign is due to our sign convention for strains. Other relations can be obtained
by comparing some of the second derivatives of the strains. We ﬁnd e.g.:

These three differential relations, together with three others that express ∂2εx /(∂y∂z),
∂2εy /(∂x∂z) and ∂2εz/(∂x∂y) in terms of second derivatives of the shear strains, are
known as the compatibility conditions for strain.

1.2.3. Principal strains

In Section 1.1 we saw that for some speciﬁc directions the shear stress vanishes, so that for
a speciﬁc orientation of the coordinate system (with axis parallel to the principal axes of
stress) the stress tensor becomes particularly simple. The situation is similar for strains.

In two dimensions, it can be shown that the shear strain vanishes in the directions θ

relative to the x-axis, which fulﬁl the equation:

tan 2θ = 2Γxy
εx − εy

(1.80)

Thus, in two dimensions, there are two orthogonal directions for which the shear strain
vanishes. These directions are called the principal axes of strain. The elongations in the
directions of the principal axes of strain, are called the principal strains.

In three dimensions there are three principal axes of strain. The principal strains are

found by solution of the determinant equation

(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8) = 0

The solutions are denoted ε1, ε2, ε3. The direction cosines l1x, l1y, l1z identifying the
principal axis corresponding to ε1 are found by solution of the equations

l1x (εx − ε1) + l1y Γxy + l1zΓxz = 0
l1x Γxy + l1y (εy − ε1) + l1zΓyz = 0
l1x Γxz + l1y Γyz + l1z(εz − ε1) = 0

(1.82)

(1.83)

(1.84)

The principal axes corresponding to ε2 and ε3 are found similarly by substituting sub-
script 1 by 2 and 3, respectively. Eqs. (1.81) and (1.82)–(1.84) are seen to be equivalents
of Eqs. (1.31) and (1.32)–(1.34) identifying the principal stresses and the principal axes of
stress.

1.2.4. Plane strain and plane stress

In several practical applications it is a good approximation to assume that all cross-sections
along a given axis are in the same condition, and that there is no displacement along the
axis. This state of strain is called plane strain.

In the following we shall assume the unique axis to be the z-axis. The strain tensor for

plane strain is then

where all strain components are independent of z. The term plane of course refers to the
fact that the strain is conﬁned to a plane.

If we only have displacement along z, and this displacement is independent of z, the

strain state is referred to as antiplane strain. The strain tensor is then

Γxz(x, y) Γyz(x, y)
where again all components are independent of z.

A general situation in which the displacement along the z-axis is independent of z can be
decomposed into a sum of plane strain and antiplane strain. This state of strain is referred
to as generalized plane strain. The strain tensor is

Note, however, that the concept of generalized plane strain is not uniquely deﬁned in
the literature. Sometimes the term is used when εz rather than the displacement along z is
independent if z. This leads to the strain tensor

Analogously, if all stress components are independent of z, and σz = τxz = τyz = 0
(still taking z to be the unique axis), we call the situation plane stress. The stress tensor is
then

Generalized plane stress is used when all stress components are independent z, leading

1.3. Elastic moduli

ELASTICITY

The theory of linear elasticity deals with situations where there are linear relationships be-
tween applied stresses and resulting strains. While most rocks do behave nonlinearly when
subject to large stresses, their behaviour may normally be described by linear relations
for sufﬁciently small changes in stress. Consider a sample of length L and cross-sectional
area A = D2 (Fig. 1.15). When the force F is applied on its end surfaces, the length of
. The applied stress is then σx = F /A and the corresponding
(cid:2)
the sample is reduced to L
elongation is εx = (L − L
(cid:2)
)/L, according to Eqs. (1.1) and (1.58). If the sample behaves
linearly, there is a linear relation between σx and εz, which we may write

εx = 1

E

σx

(1.91)

Eq. (1.91) is known as Hooke’s law, while the coefﬁcient E is called Young’s modulus or
simply the E-modulus. Young’s modulus belongs to a group of coefﬁcients called elastic
moduli. It is a measure of the stiffness of the sample, i.e. the sample’s resistance against
being compressed by a uniaxial stress.
Another consequence of the applied stress σx (Fig. 1.15) is an increase in the width D
of the sample. The lateral elongation is εy = εz = (D − D
> D, thus
εy and εz become negative. The ratio deﬁned as
ν = − εy

)/D. In general D

(1.92)

(cid:2)

(cid:2)

εx

is another elastic parameter, known as Poisson’s ratio. It is a measure of lateral expansion
relative to longitudinal contraction.
Eqs. (1.91) and (1.92), which relates one component of stress or strain to another, are
deﬁned by a speciﬁc state of stress, namely σx (cid:8)= 0, σy = σz = 0. In general, each
component of strain is a linear function of all components of stress.

Isotropic materials are materials whose response is independent of the orientation of the
applied stress. For such materials the principal axes of stress and the principal axes of strain

Fig. 1.15. Deformation induced by uniaxial stress.

ELASTIC MODULI

21

always coincide. For isotropic materials the general relations between stresses and strains
may be written

σx = (λ + 2G)εx + λεy + λεz
σy = λεx + (λ + 2G)εy + λεz
σz = λεx + λεy + (λ + 2G)εz
τyz = 2GΓyz
τxz = 2GΓxz
τxy = 2GΓxy

(1.101)

The coefﬁcients λ and G are elastic moduli, known as Lamé’s parameters. G is also known
as the modulus of rigidity, or the shear modulus. G is a measure of the sample’s resistance
against shear deformation.

Another important elastic modulus is the bulk modulus K. It is deﬁned as the ratio of
hydrostatic stress σp relative to the volumetric strain εvol (Eq. (1.71)). For a hydrostatic
stress state we have σp = σx = σy = σz while τxy = τyz = τxz = 0. From Eqs. (1.93)–
(1.95) we then ﬁnd

K = σp

εvol

= λ + 2
3

G

(1.99)

K is a measure of the sample’s resistance against hydrostatic compression. The inverse

of K, i.e. 1/K, is known as the compressibility.
In the experiment (Fig. 1.15) deﬁning Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio, the stress is
uniaxial, i.e. σy = σz = τxy = τxz = τyz = 0. From Eqs. (1.93)–(1.95) we then ﬁnd

E = σx
ν = − εy

From the relations (1.99) to (1.101), it may be seen that when any two of the moduli E,
ν, λ, G and K are deﬁned, the remaining ones are ﬁxed by these relations. Depending on
which two of the moduli that are known, special combinations of Eqs. (1.99)–(1.101) may
be needed. Some of the most useful combinations are listed in Table 1.1.
Table 1.1 also includes some relations involving H = λ + 2G, theuniaxial compaction
modulus or oedometer modulus, which is repeatedly used in later Chapters. In the context
of acoustics, H is referred to as the plane wave modulus or the P-wave modulus.

For rocks, Poisson’s ratio is typically 0.15–0.25. For weak, porous rocks ν may ap-
proach zero or even become negative. For ﬂuids, the rigidity G vanishes, which according
to Eq. (1.101) implies that ν approaches 1/2. Also for unconsolidated sand, ν is close
to 1/2. Some physical limits for the elastic moduli are discussed towards the end of Sec-
tion 1.4.

The elastic moduli E, λ, G, H and K are measured in the same units as stress, e.g. Pa,
psi or bar. This follows from Eqs. (1.91), (1.93) and (1.99), and from Eq. (1.58) which
shows that strain is dimensionless.

Typical values for the elastic moduli of some rocks are given in Appendix A. Note

Section 1.8.

The stress–strain relations (1.93)–(1.98) are the fundamental equations for description
of isotropic, linear elastic materials. In many cases, however, it is convenient to have these
equations on an alternative form, expressing the strains as functions of the stresses. Intro-
ducing the expressions (1.100) and (1.101) for E and ν, this alternative form becomes:

σij = λεvolδij + 2Gεij

(1.108)

where δij is the Kronecker symbol (see page 460). See Appendix D.1.4 on page 464 for
some other useful ways of writing the formulas.

The concept of plane strain was introduced in Section 1.2.4. Consider again the situation
in Fig. 1.15, but let us now assume that the body is constrained such that there is no strain

1.4. Strain energy

A strained body possesses a potential energy which may be released during unloading.
Consider a small cube of a material, with sides a, loaded uniaxially with the stress σ . The
resulting elongation is ε = σ/E. The work done by increasing the stress from 0 to σ1 is:

terms will add to the expression for the work. The work per unit volume (= the potential
energy per unit volume) then becomes:
W = 1

(σ1ε1 + σ2ε2 + σ3ε3)

(1.111)

W is called the strain energy.

A variety of expressions for the strain energy can be obtained by suitable substitutions
for the principal stresses and/or the principal strains. Using Eqs. (1.93)–(1.95) to express
the stresses in terms of the strains, we ﬁnd that the strain energy (1.111) is equal to:

(1.112)
Comparing with Eqs. (1.71), (1.72) and (1.73) for the strain invariants, we ﬁnd that the

Useful relations can be established by analysis of the strain energy. Taking the derivative

of Eq. (1.113) with respect to εx, and using Eq. (1.93), we ﬁnd that:

2(λ + 2G)εx + 2λ(εy + εz)

(1.114)

(cid:11) = σx

24

ELASTICITY

Similar expressions connecting σy to εy, etc. can also be established in the same way. We
now observe, by taking the derivative of Eq. (1.114) with respect to εy, that it is possible
to establish a set of expressions of the type:

∂σx
∂εy

= ∂2W
∂εy ∂εx

= ∂σy
∂εx

(1.115)

This equation gives rise to a general symmetry restriction on the elastic moduli, which will
be discussed later. (See page 39.)
Going back to Eq. (1.110), we observe that the Young’s modulus E must be nonnegative,
otherwise the system will be unstable (E < 0 implies that ε1 → ∞ will be energetically
favourable). By considering other stress geometries, we may similarly show that also the
shear modulus G and the bulk modulus K must be nonnegative. It follows from Table 1.1
that the Poisson’s ratio ν is then restricted to be in the region −1 < ν <1/2. (Note that
these restrictions are derived assuming that the material is isotropic and linearly elastic.)

1.5. Thermoelasticity

1.5.1. Thermal strain

It is well known that (most) materials expand or contract under a temperature change. Let
us consider an elastic rod, which is free to expand. The initial temperature is T0, and the
temperature is changed to some other value T . The axial thermal strain resulting from the
temperature change is then given by

εa = −αT (T − T0)

(1.116)

where αT is the coefﬁcient of linear thermal expansion. The minus sign ensures that αT is
positive (for the normal cases where a temperature increase gives expansion). Some exam-
ples of the numerical values for thermal properties of rocks may be found in Appendix A.
When comparing the thermal expansion for rocks with that of ﬂuids, it is important to
be aware that for ﬂuids one often speciﬁes the coefﬁcient of volumetric thermal expansion,
αT ,V = 3αT .

1.5.2. Thermal stress

If the rod is constrained at the ends, such that it can not change it’s length, a thermal stress
will build up when the temperature increases. The magnitude of the thermal stress may
be inferred by requiring that the thermal stress should give a strain of opposite sign and
equal magnitude to the thermal strain computed from Eq. (1.116). From Eq. (1.91) we see
that the thermal stress resulting from a temperature change T − T0 for a rod which is fully
constrained in one direction is

σa = −Eεa = EαT (T − T0)

(1.117)

THERMOELASTICITY

25

1.5.3. Stress strain relation for linear thermoelasticity

In order to take thermal effects into consideration, the stress strain relations must be mod-
iﬁed to take the thermal stress and strain into account.

Using the compact notation employed in Eq. (1.108) we may write
σij = λεvolδij + 2Gεij + 3αT K(T − T0)δij

In terms of K and ν, this becomes

σij = 3Kν
1 + ν

εvolδij + 3K

1 − 2ν
1 + ν

εij + 3αT K(T − T0)δij

while in terms of E and ν we have
(1 + ν)(1 − 2ν)

σij =

Eν

εvolδij + E
1 + ν

εij + E
1 − 2ν

αT (T − T0)δij

(1.118)

(1.119)

(1.120)

Eqs. (1.118)–(1.120) may be derived from each other using the relations in Table 1.1. It is
further straightforward to show that Eq. (1.120) is consistent with Eqs. (1.116) and (1.117)
by specifying the appropriate strain and stress conditions. To get Eq. (1.116) one should
assume all stresses to be zero, while for Eq. (1.117) one assumes zero strain and non-zero
stress in one direction, and zero stress and non-zero strains in the other two directions.

1.5.4. Isothermal and adiabatic moduli

It is well known that to compute the sound velocity in a gas it is important to use the
adiabatic rather than the isothermal compressibility of the gas. The difference in velocity
is typically several tens of percent.

In principle there is a similar difference between the adiabatic and the isothermal elastic
moduli in solids, but the magnitude of the difference is so small that it may always be
safely neglected. We shall therefore not discuss this further here, but refer the interested
reader to e.g. Landau and Lifshitz (1986).

1.5.5. Example: Thermal stresses in a constrained square plate

We consider a square plate, rigidly constrained in the x and y directions, but free to expand
in the z direction. We write the stress–strain relation, Eq. (1.118) on differential form, using
the constraints εx = εy = σz = 0. The result is

σx = σy = λεz + 3αT KT
0 = (λ + 2G)εz + 3αT KT

which may be solved to give

This shows that thermal stresses may be quite signiﬁcant, and we shall see in later chapters
that there are several aspects of petroleum rock mechanics where temperature effects play
an important role.

1.6. Poroelasticity

So far, we have treated rocks as if they were homogeneous, solid materials. However, rocks
are generally composite materials, and hence inhomogeneous on a microscopic scale. The
way rocks behave, their elastic response, their failure stresses etc., depend, to a large ex-
tent, on the non-solid part of the materials. In this section we will take into account the void
space, which not only is essential for oil to be produced from a reservoir, but also plays
an important role in rock mechanical behaviour. We will ﬁrst consider a macroscopic de-
scription of porous and permeable media, which allows us to study both static and dynamic
mechanical properties. This approach is based on the theory of Maurice A. Biot.

In this section we will give a brief and practical introduction the theory. We will limit
ourselves to a description of an idealized porous material which is microscopically homo-
geneous and isotropic. This approximation is sometimes referred to as the Gassmann limit
of the Biot theory.

For those desiring a more thorough exposition, we refer to the book by Wang (2000), the
papers by Detournay and Cheng (1993), Rice and Cleary (1976) and the book by Coussy
(2004). Zimmerman’s (1991) book is also a very useful introduction to the mechanical
properties of porous media.

1.6.1. Suspension of solid particles in a ﬂuid

Let us ﬁrst take a look at a very simple porous medium; namely one in which the solid
and ﬂuid parts are deformed independently of each other. In practice, we may think of
this medium as a suspension of solid particles in a ﬂuid, or for instance, a water-saturated,
completely unconsolidated sand. If we place this mixture in a container, the volumetric
strain due to an external pressure σp is:

εvol = σp

Keff

(1.127)

POROELASTICITY

27

where Keff is the bulk modulus of the mixture. The total deformation must, however, equal
the sum of the deformations of each component, weighted by the volume portion of each
component.

εvol = Vs

Vtot

εvol,s + Vf

Vtot

εvol,f

(1.128)

where subscripts s and f denote solid and ﬂuid, respectively, and Vtot is the total volume.
Now, we deﬁne porosity φ as the volume occupied by the ﬂuid relative to the total volume,
i.e.:

φ = Vf

Vtot

= 1 − φ

Vs
Vtot

(1.129)

(1.130)

The strains εvol,s and εvol,f are given by the bulk moduli of the solid (Ks) and the ﬂuid
(Kf), respectively, according to Eq. (1.99). Then Eq. (1.128) may be written as:

εvol = (1 − φ)

σp
Ks

+ φ

σp
Kf

(1.131)

By combining Eqs. (1.127) and (1.131) we now ﬁnd that the effective modulus of the
suspension is given by

= 1 − φ

Ks

1
Keff

+ φ
Kf

(1.132)

This is an example of a particularly simple porous material. We shall now generalize by
taking into account the fact that rocks consist of a solid framework and a pore ﬂuid which
can not be treated independently.

1.6.2. Biot’s poroelastic theory for static properties

We will now consider an isotropic, porous and permeable medium, consisting of two com-
ponents: a solid and a ﬂuid part. The displacement of the solid is denoted (cid:5)us while that of
the ﬂuid is denoted (cid:5)uf. For a volume element attached to the solid, the strains are given as
the derivatives of the components of (cid:5)us. Using Eq. (1.76) we have for the volumetric strain:
(1.133)

εvol = ∇ · (cid:5)us

For the ﬂuid part, we will deﬁne a strain parameter ζ , which describes the volumetric
deformation of the ﬂuid relative to that of the solid:

ζ = φ∇ · ((cid:5)us − (cid:5)uf)

(1.134)

The stress tensor (cid:6)(cid:7)

σ represents the total external stress on a volume element attached
to the solid framework. The volume element balances this stress partly by stresses in the

28

ELASTICITY

solid framework, and partly by a hydrostatic pressure1 in the ﬂuid, the pore pressure pf.
In accordance with the sign convention, all stresses—including the pore pressure—are
positive in compression.

The change in the mass of ﬂuid in a volume element attached to the solid can be divided
into two parts: the change of the pore volume (due to change in the external stresses and/or
the pore pressure), and the compression/decompression of the ﬂuid as the pore pressure
changes. This means that we may write
ζ = −φ

(1.135)

(cid:5)

(cid:4)

Vp
Vp

+ pf
Kf

where Vp is the pore volume, i.e. the volume occupied by the ﬂuid, and Kf is the bulk
modulus of the pore ﬂuid. We see that ζ is positive when the amount of ﬂuid in the volume
element is decreasing.

The presence of the pore ﬂuid adds extra terms to the strain energy of the material. Hence
the stress–strain relations (Eqs. (1.93)–(1.98)) will also be modiﬁed. Biot (1962) showed
how the linear stress–strain relations for this two-phase system can be expressed in terms
of the strain parameters εvol and ζ , the stress tensor elements and the pore pressure pf:

Written on the abbreviated form as Eq. (1.108), Eqs.(1.136)–(1.141) become

σij = λεvolδij + 2Gεij − Cζ δij

λ and G are the Lamé parameters of the porous material, while C and M are additional
elastic moduli required to describe a two-phase medium. Note that C appears both in the
stress and the pore pressure equations. Biot (1941) showed that this is a consequence of
thermodynamic principles.
By letting ζ = 0 in Eq. (1.143) we get Eq. (1.108). ζ = 0 means that there is no ﬂuid
movement in the material, i.e. the material is undrained. Thus the λ in Eq. (1.143) is not
the λ of the dry porous medium, but the λ of the ﬂuid-ﬁlled medium when the ﬂuid is not
allowed to move. This is discussed further below.

1 The term “hydrostatic pressure” is sometimes used in a restricted sense, meaning the ﬂuid pressure resulting
from an overlying column of water. In this book we use the term in a broader (and probably more widely used)
sense, meaning the pressure in a static ﬂuid irrespective of the source of the pressure. Further, we also use hydro-
static for the stress state in a solid when all the principal stresses are equal, i.e. no shear stresses are present (see
page 21).

σx = λεvol + 2Gεx − Cζ
σy = λεvol + 2Gεy − Cζ

POROELASTICITY

29

To get some understanding of the physical meaning of M, we may let εvol = 0 in
Eq. (1.142). Inserting Eq. (1.134) we then ﬁnd

pf = Mφ∇ · (cid:5)uf

(1.144)

which shows that Mφ is a measure of how much the pore pressure increases as the amount
of ﬂuid in a volume element is increased. If the solid was completely rigid, we would thus
have Mφ = Kf.
Explicit expressions for C and M in terms of the solid and ﬂuid moduli are given later.
Summation of Eqs. (1.136)–(1.138) gives:

¯σ = Kεvol − Cζ

(1.145)
where ¯σ is deﬁned by Eq. (1.38). K = λ + 2G/3 is the bulk modulus of the porous rock
in undrained condition, i.e. in a condition where the pore ﬂuid is not allowed to escape.
We shall now investigate how the elastic moduli K, C and M relate to the moduli of the
constituents of the rock. First, imagine that we perform a “jacketed” test (see Fig. 1.16a):
a porous medium is conﬁned within an impermeable jacket, and subjected to an external
hydrostatic pressure σp.

The pore ﬂuid is allowed to escape during loading, so that the pore pressure is kept
constant, and hence the stress is entirely carried by the solid framework. From Eqs. (1.142)
and (1.145), we then obtain

σp
εvol

= K − C2

M

def= Kfr

(1.146)

Since this test characterizes the stiffness of the solid part of the rock, Kfr is called the bulk
modulus of the framework or the frame modulus. Since there are no shear forces associated
with the ﬂuid, we can directly identify the shear modulus of the porous system as the shear

30

modulus of the framework, i.e.

G = Gfr

ELASTICITY

(1.147)

Next, we proceed to an “unjacketed” test, as illustrated in Fig. 1.16b. The rock sample
under investigation is here embedded in a ﬂuid in such a way that the hydrostatic pres-
sure on the sample is balanced by the pressure in the pores, i.e. pf = σp. Combining
Eqs. (1.142) and (1.145) we now ﬁnd:

σp
εvol

= pf
εvol

= Kfr
1 − C

(1.148)
The loading pf = σp means that there is a uniform stress within the sample, which
means that the rock framework deforms uniformly. Thus, the volumetric strain of the total
sample, the pore volume and the solid (grain) volume must be equal:

M

Vtot
Vtot

Vp

(1.149)
From pf = σp = −Ks(Vs/Vs) where Ks is the bulk modulus of the solid grains (1/Ks

(1.150)

The stress–strain response is therefore entirely given by the intrinsic elastic properties of
the solid material. Comparing Eq. (1.150) to Eq. (1.148) we infer that

From Eqs. (1.135) and (1.150) it follows that

On the other hand, the combination of Eqs. (1.142) and (1.145) with pf = σp gives

Although this equation was derived for a speciﬁc loading (“unjacketed test”), it is generally
valid.

Eqs. (1.151) and (1.154), combined with the deﬁnition of Kfr (Eq. (1.146)), allow us to
express the elastic constants K, C and M in terms of the elastic moduli of the constituents
of the rock (Ks and Kf), plus the porosity φ and the framework modulus Kfr. The results

(1.158)

The relations (1.155)–(1.157) do not give a clear physical meaning to each parameter.
Better insight may be achieved by looking at a couple of limit cases, where the relations
become simpler.
One case is a “hard” rock, where the frame is incompressible compared to the ﬂuid. As
Ks (cid:10) Kf in general, we have for this “stiff frame” case:
Kfr, Gfr, Ks (cid:10) Kf
⎧⎨
⎩ K ≈ Kfr
C ≈ Kf
M ≈ Kf

For porosities that are not too small (speciﬁcally φ (cid:10) (Kf/K2
(1.157) then reduce to:

s )(Ks−Kfr)), Eqs. (1.155)–

φ (1 − Kfr

(1.159)

(1.160)

)

φ

We see that the bulk modulus K is here identiﬁed as the bulk modulus of the rock frame-
work, while the constant M is entirely given by the properties of the pore ﬂuid and the pore
system.

The opposite limit is that of a “weak frame”. For this case we assume

Kfr, Gfr, Kf (cid:11) Ks

For porosities φ (cid:10) Kf/Ks, Eqs. (1.155)–(1.157) reduce to:
K ≈ Kfr + Kf
C ≈ M ≈ Kf

“Weak

φ

(cid:18)

φ

(1.161)

(1.162)

In this case, the bulk modulus K is inﬂuenced not only by the rock stiffness, but also by the
ﬂuid bulk modulus Kf. In the limiting case when Kfr → 0 (suspension), K = C = M ≈
Kf/φ are all given mainly by ﬂuid properties. Disregarding the condition Ks (cid:10) Kf would
in this case reproduce Eq. (1.132), which was obtained by simple physical arguments.

Note that the “stiff frame” and the “weak frame” limits are rather extreme cases that
are mainly suited for illustrative purposes. For practical calculations the complete expres-
sions (1.155)–(1.157) should be used.

32

ELASTICITY

The theory outlined above contains two “unknown” parameters, which are not identiﬁed
in terms of the properties of the rock’s constituents. These are the two elastic moduli of the
framework, Kfr, and Gfr. We shall in Chapter 6 see how microscopic theories can be used
to estimate these moduli when further information about the rock structure is available.
Empirically, the frame bulk modulus Kfr is found to be signiﬁcantly smaller than Ks, and
to decrease sharply with the porosity.

1.6.3. The effective stress concept

In Section 1.6.2, we discussed an experiment where a rock sample was “jacketed” with
the pore ﬂuid free to escape, so that the pore pressure was kept constant during loading
(Fig. 1.16a). Such a test is also called a drained test. The stress–strain response of this test
was given by Eq. (1.146), i.e.

Imagine now a similar test, but with the pore ﬂuid shut in, so that no ﬂuid ﬂow occurs in or
out of the rock sample. This situation is called undrained. Compression of the sample—
including the pore space—due to an external hydrostatic load, will in this case cause an
increase in the pore pressure. The sample compression and the pore pressure can be calcu-
lated by requiring ζ = 0 in Eqs.(1.142) and (1.145) , i.e. no relative displacement between
pore ﬂuid and solid during the test. The pore pressure is given by Eq. (1.142):

while the stress–strain characteristics is given by Eq. (1.145):

σp = Kεvol

Using Eqs. (1.146) and (1.164), we can write
K = Kfr + C2

= Kfr + C

M

pf
εvol

M

By introducing this expression for K into Eq. (1.165) and reorganizing the equation, we
obtain:

σp − C

M

pf = Kfrεvol

Eq. (1.167) tells us that the deformation is proportional to the effective stress σ
as

(cid:2)

p

σ

= σp − αpf

(1.167)

(cid:2)
p, deﬁned

(1.168)

rather than the total stress σp, and the corresponding modulus is Kfr, i.e. the same as for
the drained test (Eq. (1.163)). Physically, this means that the solid framework carries the
(cid:2)
part σ
p of the total external stress σp, while the remaining part, αpf, is carried by the ﬂuid.
The remaining pore pressure, (1 − α)pf, is counteracted by internal stresses in the solid.

σp = Kfrεvol

pf = Cεvol

(1.163)

(1.164)

(1.165)

(1.166)

POROELASTICITY

The parameter α is called the Biot coefﬁcient:

α = C

M

= 1 − Kfr

Ks

33

(1.169)

with the latter identity from Eq. (1.151). As mentioned above, Kfr is always smaller than
Ks. Theoretically, the upper limit for Kfr is (1 − φ)Ks. (See Section 6.2 for more infor-
mation on bounds on elastic moduli of composite materials.) The lower limit for Kfr is, of
course, zero. Thus, α is restricted to the region φ < α (cid:3) 1. In unconsolidated or weak
rocks, α is close to 1.

In general, the effective stress is deﬁned by

(cid:2)

ij

σ

= σij − δij αpf

(1.170)

where δij is the Kronecker symbol, see Appendix C.11.2. Observe that only the normal
effective stresses depend on the pore pressure.
One may note that for pf = 0, Eqs. (1.142) and (1.169) give α = ζ /εvol. Then from
Eq. (1.135) (with pf = 0), and the deﬁnition of εvol we obtain

α = φ

Vp/Vp
Vtot/Vtot

(1.171)

which shows that α is a measure of the change in pore volume relative to the change in
bulk volume at constant pore pressure.

In addition to the bulk compressibility with respect to conﬁning pressure at constant
pore pressure, 1/Kfr, we may deﬁne the bulk compressibility with respect to pore pressure
at constant conﬁning pressure, 1/Kbp. By letting σp = 0 in Eq. (1.167) we may write

and thus we have

Kbp = − pf

(1.173)

which shows that Biot coefﬁcient α is the ratio of the bulk modulus at constant pore pres-
sure to the bulk modulus at constant conﬁning pressure.

which may be the simplest form to express the equations.

The effective stress concept was originally introduced in soil mechanics by Terzaghi in

1923 on an empirical basis. Terzaghi argued that

1. increasing the external hydrostatic pressure produces the same volume change of the

material as reducing the pore pressure with the same amount,

2. the shear strength depends only on the difference between the normal stress σ and

the pore pressure pf.

34

ELASTICITY

These arguments lead to an effective stress law similar to Eq. (1.168), with α = 1. For
soils, this is a reasonable assumption. For rocks, however, the deviation of α from 1 should
be taken into account.

Terzaghi’s statement ii) above implies that the effective stress, rather than the total stress,
is determining whether the rock fails or not due to the external load. This is further dis-
cussed in Section 2.6.1.

1.6.4. Pore volume compressibility and related topics

The change of the pore volume as a result of the change in the pore pressure or the conﬁning
stress is of obvious interest in petroleum related rock mechanics.

By eliminating εvol from Eqs. (1.142) and (1.145), inserting the resulting expression for
ζ in Eq. (1.135), and inserting for C, M and K from Eqs. (1.155)–(1.157), we ﬁnd, after

Zimmerman (1991) points out that an expression sometimes given for the pore com-
pressibility, based on the weighted average 1/Kfr = φ/Kp + (1 − φ)/Ks, is incorrect.
We may ﬁnd a related expression for the porosity by differentiating the deﬁnition Vp =

Note that the grains expand if we increase the pore pressure while the conﬁning stress
is constant. Increasing the pore pressure means that the ﬂuid carries more of the exter-
nal loading, which means that the grains carry correspondingly less, and hence the grains
expand.

Eq. (1.182) shows that the mean stress in the grains is

¯σs = σp − φpf
1 − φ

(1.183)

See Zimmerman (1991) for a simple sketch giving a geometrical justiﬁcation of this result.
It is worth emphasizing that Eqs. (1.176), (1.180) and (1.182) all give an effective stress
coefﬁcient different from Biot’s α deﬁned in Eq. (1.169). This underlines that the effective
stress law will differ depending upon which physical quantity we are studying. There is
thus no a priori reason to expect that for example the effective stress law for rock mechani-
cal failure or permeability should be the same as that derived for basic elastic deformation,
Eq. (1.168).

1.6.5. The Skempton coefﬁcients

An important characteristic of a porous medium is how the pore pressure responds to a
change in the mean stress under undrained conditions.
For the elastic case the response can be computed from the poroelastic equations. We
add Eqs. (1.136)–(1.138), set ζ = 0, and eliminate εvol using Eq. (1.142). The result is

pf = C

where the right hand expression is found by introducing K and C from Eqs. (1.155) and

Originally, Skempton (1954) deﬁned the parameters A and B according to

(1.186)

The form of this equation was chosen to be appropriate for triaxial tests (see Chapter 2).
For a triaxial compression test, the change in mean stress may be written
(σ1 − σ3)

(σ1 + 2σ3) = σ3 + 1
3

¯σ = 1

(1.187)

which shows that B in Eq. (1.186) is the same as in Eq. (1.185).

(“water”) and the dashed lines to Kf = 1 GPa (“oil”). In all cases Ks = 37.5 GPa.

Neglecting Kf relative to Ks in Eq. (1.185), and introducing Biot’s α, we have

B =

In the weak frame limit, where Kfr can be neglected relative to Ks, we have

Some examples of the variation of B (as computed from Eq. (1.185)) are shown in
Fig. 1.17. Note how B decreases with increasing porosity and decreasing ﬂuid bulk modu-
lus. Gas as the pore ﬂuid will clearly give a low B except for very unconsolidated rocks.

1.6.6. The correspondence to thermoelasticity

The equations governing poroelasticity are to some extent similar to the equations govern-
ing thermoelasticity. This implies that speciﬁc solutions to problems in one ﬁeld may be
used to solve corresponding problems in the other.

By eliminating ζ between Eqs. (1.142) and (1.143) we get

(1.191)

(1.192)

Eq. (1.192) should be compared to the corresponding equation from thermoelasticity,
Eq. (1.118)

σij = λδij εvol + 2Gεij + 3αT K(T − T0)δij

This means that by making the obvious identiﬁcations
pf ↔ T − T0
α ↔ 3KαT = E
1 − 2ν

(1.193)

(1.194)

solutions of problems in thermoelasticity (where a wide range of problems have been
solved) may be directly applied to poroelasticity. The method is used e.g. by Haimson
and Fairhurst (1967) in a classic paper on hydraulic fracturing.

There is one important point to note. Since stress or strain do not induce signiﬁcant tem-
perature changes, the temperature ﬁeld is governed by the (decoupled) diffusion equation.
Pore pressure, on the other hand is of course directly coupled to stress (Eq. (1.142)), leading
to coupled equations. There are however, some important cases where decoupling occurs.
These include all steady state problems, the consolidation problem leading to Eq. (1.241),
and the borehole problem for axisymmetric loading (see e.g. Detournay and Cheng (1988,
1993), Wang (2000)).

1.6.7. Other notation conventions

We have seen that isotropic poroelasticity requires 4 independent moduli. In the initial
Eqs. (1.136)–(1.142) we used λ, G = Gfr, M and C. We also showed how these are related
to the more physically understandable set consisting of the undrained bulk modulus K, the
drained or frame bulk modulus Kfr, the solid grain bulk modulus Ks and the shear modulus
G = Gfr.
There are clearly many other possibilities—we refer to Detournay and Cheng (1993) for

a thorough discussion.

We mention in particular the alternative used by Rice and Cleary (1976), Detournay
and Cheng (1993) and others. They use the shear modulus, the drained and undrained
Poisson’s ratio, which in the notation used in this book will be denoted νfr and ν. The
fourth parameter is Skempton’s B parameter, or alternatively the Biot parameter α.

Finally, we point out that sometimes the undrained parameters are given the subscript u,

while there is no subscript on the drained parameters (where we have used fr).

1.7. Anisotropy

If the elastic response of a material is not independent of the material’s orientation for a
given stress conﬁguration, the material is said to be anisotropic. Thus the elastic moduli of
an anisotropic material are different for different directions in the material.

Most rocks are anisotropic to some extent. The origin of the anisotropy is always het-
erogeneities on a smaller scale than the volume under investigation, ranging from layered

38

ELASTICITY

sequences of different rock types down to molecular conﬁgurations. Sedimentary rocks
are created during a deposition process where the grains normally are not deposited ran-
domly. For instance, in a river environment, there is a preferred direction (the direction
of the streaming water) along which elongated or plane grains will have a tendency to be
oriented. Seasonal variations in the ﬂuid ﬂow rates may result in alternating microlayers
of ﬁne and coarser grain size distributions. The elastic moduli of rocks created under such
conditions will be dependent on the orientation of the material, i.e. they are anisotropic.
Due to its origin, anisotropy of this type is said to be lithological or intrinsic.

Another important type is anisotropy induced by external stresses. The anisotropy is
then normally caused by microcracks, generated by a deviatoric stress and predominantly
oriented normal to the lowest principal stress. The microstructure causing the two types of
anisotropy is illustrated in Fig. 1.18.

In calculations on rock elasticity, anisotropy is often ignored. This simpliﬁcation may
be necessary rather than just comfortable, because—as we shall see—an anisotropic de-
scription requires much more information about the material—information that may not
be available. However, by ignoring anisotropy, one may in some cases introduce large er-
rors that invalidate the calculations.

For a general anisotropic material, each stress component is linearly related to every
strain component by independent coefﬁcients. In the mathematical notation used in
Eqs. (1.9) and (1.75) this may be expressed as

(cid:6)

σij =

Cij klεkl

k,l

(1.195)

where Cij kl are elastic constants. Since the indices i, j, k and l may each take the values 1,
2 or 3, there are all together 81 of the constants Cij kl. Some of these vanish and others are
equal by symmetry, however, so that the number of independent constants is considerably
less. From Eqs. (1.6)–(1.8), (1.74) and (1.195) it may be deduced that

Cij kl = Cj ikl = Cij lk = Cj ilk

(1.196)

i.e. interchanging the ﬁrst index with the second one, or the third with the fourth, does
not change the value of the constant. Furthermore, fulﬁlment of the equations of the type

ANISOTROPY

Eq. (1.115), which were derived from energy considerations, requires that:

Cij kl = Cklij

39

(1.197)

The relations (1.196) and (1.197) reduce the number of independent constants to 21.

1.7.1. Orthorhombic symmetry

Rocks can normally be described reasonably well by assuming that the material has three
mutually perpendicular planes of symmetry. This is one of the orthorhombic symmetries.
Let us assume that the planes of symmetry are perpendicular to the coordinate axes x,

y, z. From Eqs. (1.195) and (1.196) we have for the normal stress in x-direction:

σ11 = C1111ε11 + C1122ε22 + C1133ε33 + 2C1112ε12

+ 2C1113ε13 + 2C1123ε23

(1.198)

Due to the orthorhombic symmetry, Eq. (1.198) should look exactly the same when
(cid:2) = −z. However, in this new
described in a coordinate system deﬁned by x
coordinate system two of the strain components have changed sign (see page 455), namely
= −ε23. This implies that
(cid:2)
ε
13

= −ε13 and ε

(cid:2) = x, y

(cid:2) = y, z

(cid:2)
23

C1113 = C1123 = 0

(1.199)

By applying the same arguments on the remaining stress components, and on other ori-
entations of the primed coordinate system, the number of independent constants Cij kl is
reduced to 9. These are C1111, C2222, C3333, C1122, C1133, C2233, C2323, C1313, C1212.

In the compact notation, where σx is used instead of σ11 etc., the constants Cij kl have
only two indices, I and J . In this so-called Voigt notation the indices ij are related to I as
follows: 11 → 1, 22 → 2, 33 → 3, 23 → 4, 13 → 5 and 12 → 6. The Voigt notation is
discussed in more detail in Appendix C, on page 457.

The constants may then be written as

The zeros represent the constants that vanish by the symmetry arguments of type (1.199).
They are included in order to emphasize the matrix nature of the constants, and also as a
reminder that they do exist: for a material with orthorhombic symmetry they only vanish
when the planes of symmetry are perpendicular to the coordinate axes.

the equations of type (1.195) can be written as the matrix product

(1.202)

Eq. (1.202) is in reality six equations. Written in an explicit form in the Voigt notation,

these equations look as:

σx = C11εx + C12εy + C13εz
σy = C12εx + C22εy + C23εz
σz = C13εx + C23εy + C33εz

(1.203)
(1.204)
(1.205)
(1.206)
(1.207)
(1.208)

These stress–strain relations generally describe most types of rocks.
The matrix C is called the stiffness matrix and its components CIJ are called elastic
constants. The inverse of the stiffness matrix, S = C
−1, is called the compliance matrix.
It follows from Eq. (1.202) that the compliance matrix relate strains to stresses in the

following way:

ε = S · σ

(1.209)

The constants (1.200) describe the elastic properties of any linear elastic material with or-
thorhombic or higher symmetry. Thus they may also describe an isotropic rock. Comparing
Eqs. (1.93)–(1.98) to (1.203)–(1.208) we ﬁnd that for an isotropic material:

C11 = C22 = C33 = λ + 2G

C12 = C13 = C23 = λ
C44 = C55 = C66 = G

(1.210)
(1.211)
(1.212)

For an isotropic material, the linear elastic properties are completely described when any
two of the elastic moduli λ, G, ν, E or K are identiﬁed. To give a complete description of
an anisotropic rock, all the nine constants of (1.200) must be identiﬁed. This is not easily
achieved in practical situations.

The elastic moduli do no longer have unique values for anisotropic materials. Since the
elastic properties are different in different directions, the values for E (Eq. (1.100)) and
ν (Eq. (1.101)) may obviously vary according to the direction of the applied stress. The

ANISOTROPY

41

bulk modulus K is an exception, however: as both the hydrostatic pressure σp and the
volumetric strain εvol are invariant to the orientation of the material, the bulk modulus is
also invariant.
As an example, consider the uniaxial stress state deﬁning Young’s modulus and Pois-
son’s ratio (Fig. 1.15). In this example, σy = σz = 0 and τxy = τxz = τyz = 0. The
stress–strain relations (1.203)–(1.208) then become:

σx = C11εx + C12εy + C13εz
0 = C12εx + C22εy + C23εz
0 = C13εx + C23εy + C33εz
0 = 2C44Γyz
0 = 2C55Γxz
0 = 2C66Γxy

Solving Eqs. (1.214) and (1.215) for ν = −εy /εx, we ﬁnd
= C12C33 − C13C23
C22C33 − C2
= C13C22 − C12C23
C22C33 − C2

while for ν = −εz/εx we ﬁnd (by interchanging indices 2 and 3):

ν = − εz

ν = − εy

(1.220)

(1.221)

Thus the value of Poisson’s ratio depends not only on the direction of the applied stress,
but also on the direction in which lateral expansion is measured.

1.7.2. Transverse isotropy

A special type of symmetry, which is relevant for many types of rocks, is full rotational
symmetry around one axis. Rocks possessing such symmetry are said to be transversely
isotropic. It implies that the elastic properties are equal for all directions within a plane,
but different in the other directions. This extra element of symmetry reduces the number
of independent elastic constants to 5.

Assuming that the x- and y-directions are equivalent while the z-direction is the different
one, we may rotate the coordinate system any angle around the z-axis without altering
the elastic constants. For this to be possible it is required that C11 = C22, C13 = C23,
C12 = C11 − 2C66, and C44 = C55. The stiffness matrix for a transversely isotropic
material having the z-axis as the unique axis is then

ELASTICITY

Transverse isotropy is normally considered to be a representative symmetry for horizon-
tally layered sedimentary rocks. Stress induced anisotropy may often be described by
transverse isotropy as well. Thus, for geophysicists, transverse isotropy is probably the
most important type of symmetry next to isotropy.

1.8. Nonlinear elasticity

1.8.1. Stress–strain relations

For a linear elastic material, there is always a constant relationship between the applied
stress and the resulting strain, regardless the magnitude of the stress and the strain. The
stress–strain relation (Eq. (1.91)) for such a material is therefore a straight line, as shown
in Fig. 1.19a. The elastic modulus corresponding to this stress–strain pair is the slope of
the curve.

Any material not obeying a linear stress–strain relation is said to behave nonlinearly. For

a nonlinear elastic material, the stress–strain relation may be written as

σ = E1ε + E2ε2 + E3ε3 + ···

(1.222)

Remembering that σ and ε generally are tensors, it is clear that nonlinear elasticity may be
very complicated mathematically.

Further, we can not ignore the higher order terms in the strain tensor, which were ne-
glected in the derivation on page 15. The full expression for the strain tensor, replacing

Nonlinear behaviour may have various causes, and appear in many different ways.
Fig. 1.19b shows one example. This material has a nonlinear stress–strain relation, since
the ratio of stress to strain is not the same for all stresses. The relation is, however, identical
for the loading and unloading process. Such materials are said to be perfectly elastic.

For nonlinear stress–strain relations the elastic modulus is no longer uniquely deﬁned,
not even for a speciﬁc stress level. As shown in Fig. 1.19b, the modulus related to the
point P on the curve may either be identiﬁed as the slope of the line OP (secant modulus),
or it may be identiﬁed as the slope of the tangent PT (tangent modulus).

If the correct deﬁnition for the moduli is used, the linear form of the stress strain relations
may be used far beyond the initial linear region. For example, Hooke’s law (Eq. (1.91)) may
be written in its original form:

(1.224)
where Esec(ε) is the secant value of the Young’s modulus. Alternatively, the relation may
be written in a differential form:

σ = Esec(ε)ε

σ = Etan(ε)ε

(1.225)

where σ and ε represent differential increments in stress and strain, respectively.
Etan(ε) is the tangent value of the Young’s modulus. Note, however, that both Etan(ε) and
Esec(ε) depend on the strain ε. This complicates the use of the equations. By comparing
Eqs. (1.224) and (1.225), we observe that the relation between the secant modulus and the
tangent modulus is:

ε

(cid:2)

(cid:2)

) dε

Etan(ε

(1.226)

(cid:12)

Esec(ε) = 1

ε

The stress–strain relation shown in Fig. 1.19c is commonly observed in rocks. The unload-
ing path is different from the loading path. This effect is called hysteresis. For materials
behaving like this, the work done during loading is not entirely released during unload-
ing, i.e. a part of the strain energy dissipates in the material. Elastic moduli related to the
unloading path are called unloading moduli.

If, as in Fig. 1.19c, the strain vanishes when the stress returns to zero, the material is
said to be elastic. If not, as in Fig. 1.19d, the material has suffered a permanent deformation
during the loading/unloading cycle. For sufﬁciently large stresses, many rocks enter a phase
where permanent deformation occurs, yet the material is still able to resist loading (i.e. the
slope of the stress–strain curve is still positive). The material is then said to be ductile. The
point where the transition from elastic to ductile behaviour occurs is called the yield point.
In Eqs. (1.224)–(1.226) the elastic modulus has been expressed as a function of strain.
Since there is a relation between the applied stress and the resulting strain, we might have
expressed the modulus as a function of stress rather than strain. In general, the elastic
moduli depend on all components of stress (or all components of strain). For example,
Young’s modulus may depend on the conﬁning pressure, as shown in Fig. 2.3.

1.8.2. The impact of cracks

ELASTICITY

Cracks occur in all types of rocks, and they generally have a large impact on the elastic
properties of the material. For some materials, like poorly consolidated sedimentary rocks,
it may be difﬁcult to imagine the presence of cracks. However, weak or failing grain con-
tacts have much of the same impact on elastic parameters as cracks have, and may for
modelling purposes often be considered as such.

The occurrence of cracks in rocks produce various types of nonlinear behaviour. We
shall here look at a couple of examples. Consider ﬁrst the situation shown in Fig. 1.20a.
The stressed sample contains a crack oriented with its face normal to the stress σx. Since
no stress can be transferred across the crack itself, the effective Young’s modulus Eeff of
the sample will be reduced:

= Eeff = E(1 − ξ Q)

σx
εx

(1.227)

Here E is the Young’s modulus of the material without cracks, ξ is called the crack density
and is a function of the size and number of cracks, and Q is a coefﬁcient depending on
the shape and orientation of the crack. (Micromechanical models for calculation of Q and
equivalent parameters are described in Section 6.4.) As the stress is increased, the strain
εx also increases. A part of the strain increase is due to closure of the crack. At a certain
x the crack is closed. At stresses above this point ξ will vanish, and Eeff → E
stress level σ c
according to Eq. (1.227). The stress strain relation for this sample is then as shown in
Fig. 1.20b.

For a material containing many cracks of different sizes and closure stresses, the stress–
strain relation may look as Fig. 1.19b. Such closure of cracks as stress increases may
explain the typical feature that elastic constants of rocks normally increase with increasing
hydrostatic pressure.

b) Stress–strain relation for the material.

Now consider a material containing a closed crack with its face oriented at an angle
relative to the stress σx (Fig. 1.21a). Due to friction, the closed crack will be able to transfer
shear stress τ up to a certain level τc, given by

τc = S0 + μσ

(1.228)

Here σ is the stress normal to the crack face, S0 is the inherentshear strength of the closed
crack and μ is thecoefﬁcient of friction. When the shear stress τ across the crack exceeds
τc the crack surfaces slip and slide relative to each other. Then τ is reduced, and may either
vanish (local damage), or the crack surfaces may again stick to each other and τ increases
from a lower level (point A on Fig. 1.22a). The sliding of the crack surfaces will result in
an additional strain ε (point A on Fig. 1.22b).

46

ELASTICITY

Upon unloading, τ is reduced and may eventually become equal to −τc. A reverse slid-
ing will then take place (point B on Figs. 1.22a and 1.22b). The stress–strain relation for
the entire sample (Fig. 1.22b) is seen to have a hysteresis. Also, the sample is seen to have
suffered a permanent deformation, since the strain does not go to zero when the stress
vanishes.

Real rocks normally contain cracks or crack-like defects of many sizes and different

orientations. The resulting stress–strain relation is typically as shown in Fig. 1.19d.

In Fig. 1.21b the sliding of the crack surfaces is accompanied with the opening of two
other cracks oriented with their faces normal to the direction of the compression stress σ .
Opening of cracks with this orientation relative to applied uniaxial stress is a typical fea-
ture occurring at high shear stresses. A consequence of such crack opening is an inelastic
increase in the volume of the stressed material. This phenomenon is known as dilatancy.
Another consequence is a stress induced mechanical anisotropy, as described in the pre-
vious section. The anisotropy may for instance be observed by acoustical techniques (see
Section 5.5).

1.9. Time-dependent effects

So far, we have assumed that any change in applied stress is followed instantaneously by
the corresponding deformation. Quite often, however, it is observed that the deformation
of rocks continues for a long time after a change in the applied stress. The time-dependent
effects can be divided into two groups: consolidation and creep. Consolidation is due to
pore pressure gradients induced by a change in the stress state, and the fact that it takes
time to re-establish pore pressure equilibrium. Creep is related to visco-elastic behaviour
of the solid framework. In the following, consolidation and creep are discussed separately.
In practice, however, it is sometimes difﬁcult to distinguish between genuine creep and
consolidation effects.

1.9.1. Consolidation

Consolidation theory describes the transient process, where pore pressure equilibrium is re-
established after a change in the stress state. This process involves a ﬂow of the pore ﬂuid
through the porous rock. Viscous ﬂow in porous rocks is described by Darcy’s law, which
states that the ﬂuid ﬂow rate (cid:5)Q (ﬂuid volume per unit time ﬂowing through a surface), is
proportional to the pore pressure gradient ∇pf:
(cid:5)Q = −A

(1.229)

∇pf

k

ηf

Here A is the surface through which the ﬂuid ﬂows, and ηf is the dynamic viscosity of the
ﬂuid. k is the permeability of the rock. Normally, k is measured in the unit Darcy, deﬁned
as the permeability which gives a ﬂowrate of one centimetre per second of a ﬂuid with
viscosity one centipoise for a pressure gradient of one atmosphere per cm. This means that

−12 m2 since 1 atmosphere is equal to 101325 Pa.2 Permeabilities

Eq. (1.229) basically describes stationary ﬂow of ﬂuid, in a homogeneous pore pressure
gradient ﬁeld. However, the equation may be further evaluated to make it applicable for

description of transient processes. The ﬂow rate (cid:5)Q expresses the difference between the

solid and ﬂuid displacement rates, i.e.

(cid:5)Q = Aφ

(1.230)

By comparing Eq. (1.230) with the deﬁnition (Eq. (1.134)) of the strain parameter ζ , we

ﬁnd that the divergence of (cid:5)Q is proportional to the time derivative of ζ , i.e.

homogeneous pore pressure gradient ﬁelds.

It is clear that the equations in general involve a coupling between the pore pressure and
the strain or stress of the solid material. Only in special cases will the pore pressure obey
an uncoupled equation. For a thorough discussion, see e.g. Wang (2000) or Detournay and
Cheng (1993).
We shall now consider an example of decoupled consolidation by considering a simple
experiment: a porous material is conﬁned with no lateral movement (ux = uy = 0) in a
vertical column with an impermeable bottom (at z = 0) and a highly permeable piston on
the top (at z = h). The bottom of the sample is ﬁxed, i.e. uz (z = 0) = 0. Initially, at t = 0,

2 In some sciences, including soil mechanics and ground water research, an alternative deﬁnition for permeabil-
ity with unit m/s is used. The relation to our deﬁnition is

k(hydrosciences) = k(petroleum sciences)γw/ηw

where γw and ηw are the speciﬁc weight and viscosity of water, respectively.

48

ELASTICITY

a vertical stress σz = σ0 is applied by the piston. The pore pressure is now a function of
both time t and height z, i.e. pf = pf(t, z). The boundary conditions are

pf = 0 at z = h
= 0 at z = 0

∂pf
∂z

The ﬁrst condition is a result of the piston permeability causing the same pore pressure
on the inside as on the outside. The second condition is due to the requirement of no ﬂow
through the bottom (∂(cid:5)us/∂t = ∂(cid:5)uf/∂t, see Eq.(1.230) ).
Remembering that ux = uy = 0, and writing λ + 2G = H , we ﬁnd that Eq. (1.138)
now becomes:

σ0 = H εz − Cζ

while Eq. (1.142) becomes:

pf = Cεz − Mζ

(1.235)

(1.236)

(1.237)

(1.238)

Using Eqs. (1.237) and (1.238) to eliminate ζ , we obtain an expression for the vertical
strain εz:

= σ0 − C
M pf
H − C2

εz = Mσ0 − Cpf
H M − C2

= σ0 − αpf
where Hfr = H − C2/M is deﬁned in analogy with Eq. (1.146).
Eq. (1.239) shows that the vertical strain depends on the pore pressure, hence it will
change during the time it takes for the pore pressure to reach equilibrium. It is straight-
forward to ﬁnd the initial and ﬁnal deformation of the column. At the instant the load is
applied, before the pore ﬂuid has time to move, we observe the undrained stiffness of the
material. Letting ζ = 0 in Eq. (1.237), we see that the immediate strain is εz = σ0/H .
At late times, when the pore pressure has dissipated to zero, we observe the drained stiff-
ness, which from Eq. (1.239) gives εz = σ0/Hfr. The difference, and hence the magnitude
of the consolidation or time dependent strain is

The time dependence of the pore pressure is governed by Eqs. (1.232)–(1.234). Dif-

Eq. (1.241) and the boundary conditions (1.235) and (1.236) fully determine the pore
pressure pf(t, z). Biot (1941) discussed the solution of the problem, and found that the
settlement uz can be written in terms of an inﬁnite series. He also provided an approximate
solution, which applies to the settlement of an inﬁnitely high column (h → ∞), or to the

Physically, CD is a measure of how far (lD) a pore pressure disturbance can propagate
during a given time (τD). The length lD is called the diffusion length and relates to τD and
CD as

ELASTICITY

It is an important result that the characteristics of the ﬂuid ﬂow—here represented by the
diffusion constant CD and the diffusion length lD—generally depend not only on the ﬂuid
parameters, but also on the elastic properties of the rock itself. This is particularly signiﬁ-
cant for weak rocks, as Eq. (1.246) shows.

The consolidation discussed above is based on an elastic theory, which means that the
behaviour is reversible. This is often not the case in a practical situation, in particular not
in sedimentary rocks at high pressure. In such cases, inelasticity of the rock framework
should be taken into account.

1.9.2. Creep

Creep is a time-dependent deformation that may occur in materials under constant stress.
Creep originates from visco-elastic effects in the solid framework, thus creep may—unlike
consolidation—occur in both dry and saturated rocks.

There are three stages of creep following a change in the stress state. First, there is a
region where the rate of the time-dependent deformation decreases with time (Fig. 1.24).
This is called transient (or primary) creep. The process may be associated with a minor
spreading—at a decaying rate—of “stable” microfractures. If the applied stress is reduced
to zero during the primary creep stage, the deformation will eventually decrease to zero
too.

In the next stage, the deformation rate is constant. This is called steady state (or sec-
ondary) creep. If the applied stress is reduced to zero during this stage, the deformation
will not vanish completely. Steady state creep thus implies a permanent deformation of the
material.

Finally, the deformation rate may increase with time. This is called accelerating (or
tertiary) creep. This stage leads rapidly to failure. The process may be associated with a
rapid spreading of “unstable” fractures.

The actual creep behaviour of a rock depends on the magnitude of the applied stress.
For low or moderate stresses, the material may virtually stabilize after a period of transient
creep. For high stresses, the material may rapidly run through all three stages of creep and
ﬁnally fail.

The intermediate stress regime, where the material fully develops each stage of creep,
may be small and hard to ﬁnd in practice (Fig. 1.25). The time scale of a creep stage may
vary over a wide range—in some cases it lasts for minutes, in other cases for years. Creep
is a molecular process, and the time scale depends on temperature; the process generally
speeds up with increasing temperature.

The fact that even steady state creep eventually leads to failure, means that a rock which
is loaded to a level somewhat below its ultimate strength, may fail after some time, if the
load is maintained. This effectively reduces the long-term uniaxial strength to typically
50–70% of the ultimate strength (Farmer, 1983).

There are various mathematical models, with varying degree of sophistication, that are
being used to describe creep. One type of models uses combinations of linear elements
obeying Hooke’s law (Eq. (1.91))

Here κ is the spring constant, while χ is called the coefﬁcient of viscosity.

One of these models (the “Burgers substance”) is shown in Fig. 1.27. This model takes
into account both instantaneous strain, transient creep, and steady state creep. Consider
for instance a stress path as shown in Fig. 1.28a. For t < 0 the system is unstrained. At
t = 0 the stress is increased to Σ, while at t = tc the stress is released. The resulting strain
(shown in Fig. 1.28b) is found to be

Here t1 = χ1/κ1 is the time constant of the transient creep.
The instantaneous strain is seen to be: Σ/κ2, the steady state creep velocity: Σ/χ2 and
the permanent strain resulting from the stress path: Σ tc/χ2. Thus the permanent strain is
seen to arise from the steady state creep. Due to this term, the system has a “memory” of
its stress history.

It is generally assumed that creep is proportional to the deviatoric stresses in a material,
while hydrostatic stresses alone will not produce creep effects. Thus creep effectively re-
duces the shear modulus and the Young’s modulus of a material, while the bulk modulus is
not affected by it. It follows from Table 1.1 that Poisson’s ratio increases due to creep. Note
however, that there may be local shear stresses in a sample subject to external hydrostatic
loading, due to inhomogeneities in the material. In that case the material may creep under
hydrostatic external loads. Such creep has been observed in sandstones.

Chapter 2

Failure mechanics

2.1. Basic concepts

When a piece of rock is subject to sufﬁciently large stresses, a failure of some kind will
occur. This implies that the rock changes its shape permanently, and possibly also falls
apart. The condition is accompanied with a reduced ability to carry loads. Rock failure is
an important phenomenon also for petroleum related rock mechanics, as it is the origin of
severe problems such as borehole instability and solids production. It is therefore useful to
be able to predict under which conditions a rock is likely to fail.

This chapter discusses the most elementary and well known models for rock failure. One
should keep in mind however, that these are only simpliﬁed descriptions of real rock be-
haviour. Rock failure is a complex process which is still not fully understood. Much of the
framework used to handle rock failure is therefore based on convenient mathematical de-
scriptions of observed behaviour, rather than derivations from basic laws of physics. Some
of the concepts used here, including the concept of failure, may thus be poorly deﬁned and
sometimes not very relevant, as will be seen below.

For most of the chapter we shall assume that rocks are homogeneous and isotropic.
Anisotropy is discussed in Section 2.9, while some consequences of inhomogeneities are
brieﬂy discussed in Sections 2.5 and 2.8.

2.1.1. Strength and related concepts

The stress level at which a rock typically fails is commonly called the strength of the rock.
Obviously, as “stress level” is not a uniquely deﬁned parameter, neither is strength. Rock
strength is therefore a meaningful parameter only when the stress geometry—that is: the
type of test, in a laboratory setting—is also speciﬁed. We shall soon describe the impact
of stress geometry on rock strength. First, we shall however take a look at a couple of the
most important tests used to measure rock strength, the uniaxial and triaxial tests, in order
to illustrate the complexity of rock failure, and to introduce some basic concepts. Rock
mechanical testing procedures for strength measurements will be described in more detail
in Chapter 7.

Fig. 2.1 illustrates a typical test specimen, a cylinder with length to diameter ratio 2:1.
A pair of pistons applies (axial) stress to the end faces of the cylinder, while a conﬁning oil
bath provides a stress of possibly different magnitude to the circumference. It is normally
assumed that the stress state within the specimen is homogeneous. If the conﬁning stress
is zero, we have a uniaxial stress test (also called unconﬁned compression test). When the
test is performed with a non-zero conﬁning pressure, a so-called triaxial test is performed.

region may be very small.

Fig. 2.2 shows a typical result from a uniaxial test. The applied axial stress (denoted σz)
is plotted as a function of the axial strain (εz) of the sample. Several important concepts
are deﬁned in the ﬁgure:

Elastic region: The rock deforms elastically. If the stress is released, the specimen will

return to its original state.

Yield point: The point beyond which permanent changes will occur. The sample will no

longer return to is original state upon stress relief.

Uniaxial compressive strength: The peak stress.
Ductile region: A region in which the sample undergoes permanent deformation without

loosing the ability to support load.

Brittle region: A region in which the specimen’s ability to withstand stress decreases

rapidly as deformation is increased.

BASIC CONCEPTS

57

Fig. 2.3. Triaxial testing: typical inﬂuence of the conﬁning pressure on the shape of the differential stress (axial
stress minus conﬁning pressure) versus axial strain curves.

A triaxial test is usually performed by increasing the axial and conﬁning loads simulta-
neously, until a prescribed hydrostatic stress level is reached. Then, the conﬁning pressure
is kept constant while the axial load is increased until failure occurs. The axial loading is
normally applied such that it gives a constant axial deformation rate.

For a triaxial test, it is customary to plot the difference between the axial stress and
the conﬁning pressure (σr) versus the axial deformation. One then obtains a curve that
looks similar to Fig. 2.2. However, the behaviour may be quite different at the higher stress
levels. Fig. 2.3 illustrates results from triaxial tests with various conﬁning pressures. It is
seen that for the higher conﬁning pressures the specimen’s ability to support load is not
lost, although its stiffness is clearly reduced. This is further discussed in Section 2.8.

So far, we have not given a precise deﬁnition of failure, mainly because it is rather
difﬁcult to give a general deﬁnition. For the uniaxial test shown in Fig. 2.2, a seemingly
unambiguous deﬁnition of failure may be given, corresponding to the peak stress point
on the curve. For the higher conﬁning pressures in Fig. 2.3, one may on the other hand
deﬁne failure at some point where the slope of the stress–strain curve changes. This may
not seem totally appropriate, however, since the specimen still supports increasing load
after it has failed. Disregarding these problems, we shall in the following sections discuss
failure criteria assuming that a consistent deﬁnition of failure exists. Later, in Section 2.8,
on post-failure behaviour described by the theory of plasticity, we shall be a little more
precise, at least for problems that can be described within the framework of that theory.

The most common mode of failure observed in uniaxial and triaxial tests is shear fail-
ure. This failure mode is caused by excessive shear stress. Another failure mode is tensile
failure, which is caused by excessive tensile stress. Finally, pore collapse is a failure mode
that is normally observed in highly porous materials, where the grain skeleton forms a rel-
atively open structure. Pore collapse is usually caused by excessive hydrostatic stress. The
various failure modes are discussed in Sections 2.2–2.4.

The concept of rock failure is associated with the state of the solid framework. Thus, the
stresses that causes failure are the effective stresses felt by the framework. The effective
(cid:2)
stress concept was introduced in Section 1.6.3 where we also introduced the notation σ

58

to distinguish the effective stress from the total stress σ . Note however that the relation
specifying the effective stress in a failure criterion is in general different from the relation
(1.168) which speciﬁes the effective stress for deformation of a linearly elastic material.
This will be further discussed in Section 2.6.1.

2.1.2. The failure surface

From the considerations above, we see that a rock fails when the stress exceeds a certain
limit, while it remains intact (more or less, as we shall see later) as long as the stress is
lower than this limit. We also see that this limit depends on the total stress state, not only
the stress in one direction. A graphical representation of this in an abstract “stress space”
turns out to be quite useful.

ically as a point in the principal stress space, that is, the space spanned by the σ

axes. Imagine that the specimen is taken to failure by increasing the principal stresses in
some manner, and that the point of failure is plotted in the principal stress space. If this
procedure could be repeated an inﬁnite number of times, following different stress paths,
we would get an inﬁnite number of failure points in the stress space. We assume that these
points will form a continuous surface, which we call the failure surface. A schematic illus-
tration of such a surface is shown in Fig. 2.4.

In this simpliﬁed picture, the assumption is that the rock is intact at stress states inside

stress state outside the failure surface is inaccessible, since the rock may under suitable
conditions be able to support increasing load after failure, as mentioned above.

It is difﬁcult to draw a surface in three dimensions. Therefore, the failure surface is
often presented by cross-sections instead. The most common of such representations are
cross-sections in a π-plane. These planes are normal to the hydrostatic axis (also called
= σ
(cid:2)
hydrostat), that is the axis where σ

The existence of the failure surface is by no means obvious. For instance, its existence
implies that failure is independent of stress gradients and of stress history for stress states
on the inner side of the surface. This approximation is not always fulﬁlled, as we shall
see later in this chapter. Also, we have already seen that failure does not necessarily occur
abruptly at the failure point, but may be a gradual process that changes rate at the failure
surface.

In the following, we shall ﬁrst consider the failure surface in two dimensional stress
space, focusing on the impact of the largest and smallest principal stresses. These conﬁg-
urations are relatively simple to handle both intuitively and mathematically, and are also
most commonly used for practical applications. Corresponding failure criteria in three di-
mensional stress space is discussed in Section 2.5.

2.2. Tensile failure

Tensile failure occurs when the effective tensile stress across some plane in the sample
exceeds a critical limit. This limit is called the tensile strength, it is given the symbol T0,
and has the same unit as stress. The tensile strength is a characteristic property of the rock.
Most sedimentary rocks have a rather low tensile strength, typically only a few MPa or
less. In fact, it is a standard approximation for several applications that the tensile strength
is zero.

A sample that suffers tensile failure typically splits along one—or very few—fracture
planes, as illustrated in Fig. 2.5. Thus tensile failure is a highly localized and inhomoge-
neous process. The fracture planes often originate from preexisting cracks, oriented more
or less normal to the direction of the tensile stress. The highest probability for further dam-
age of the rock is at the perimeter of the largest of these cracks, hence the largest crack(s)
will grow increasingly faster than the other, and rapidly split the sample. We shall see later
(in Section 6.4.4) that the tensile strength is very sensitive to the presence of cracks in the
material.

The failure criterion, which speciﬁes the stress condition for which tensile failure will
occur, and identiﬁes the location of the failure surface in principal stress space, is given as:

(cid:2) = −T0

σ

(2.2)

For isotropic rocks, the conditions for tensile failure will always be fulﬁlled ﬁrst for the
lowest principal stress, so that the tensile failure criterion becomes

FAILURE MECHANICS

Fig. 2.5. Tensile failure.

Fig. 2.6. Shear failure.

2.3. Shear failure

Shear failure occurs when the shear stress along some plane in the sample is sufﬁciently
high. Eventually, a fault zone will develop along the failure plane, and the two sides of the
plane will move relative to each other in a frictional process, as shown in Fig. 2.6.

It is well known that the frictional force that acts against the relative movement of two
bodies in contact depends on the force that presses the bodies together. It is therefore
reasonable to assume that the critical shear stress (τmax) for which shear failure occurs,
depends on the normal stress (σ

) acting over the failure plane. That is:

(cid:2)

|τmax| =f (σ

(cid:2)

)

(2.4)

This assumption is called Mohr’s hypothesis.

(cid:2)

In the τ –σ

plane, Eq. (2.4) describes a line that separates a “safe region” from a “failure”
(cid:2)
region, and we may consider Eq. (2.4) as a representation of the failure surface in the τ –σ
plane. The line is sometimes referred to as the failure line or the failure envelope. An
example is shown in Fig. 2.7, where we have also indicated the three principal stresses and
the Mohr’s circles connecting them. It was explained in Section 1.1.6 that for a given set
lie within the area in between
of principal stresses all possible combinations of τ and σ
the three circles (i.e. the shaded area of Fig. 2.7).

not on the intermediate stress.

By choosing speciﬁc forms of the function f (σ

) of Eq. (2.4), various criteria for shear
failure are obtained. The simplest possible choice is a constant. The resulting criterion is
called the Tresca criterion. The criterion simply states that the material will yield when a
critical level of shear stress is reached:

2.3.1. The Mohr–Coulomb criterion

A more general and frequently used criterion is the Mohr–Coulomb criterion, which is
based on the assumption that f (σ

:

) is a linear function of σ
|τ| = S0 + μσ

(cid:2)

Here μ is the coefﬁcient of internal friction. The latter term is clearly chosen by anal-
ogy with sliding of a body on a surface, which to the ﬁrst approximation is described by
Amontons’ law:

τ = μσ

(cid:2)

(2.7)

In Fig. 2.8 we have drawn the Mohr–Coulomb criterion, and a Mohr’s circle that touches
the failure line. The angle ϕ deﬁned in the Figure is called the angle of internal friction (or
friction angle) and is related to the coefﬁcient of internal friction by

tan ϕ = μ

Note that the Tresca criterion can be considered as a special case of the Mohr–Coulomb
criterion, with ϕ = 0.
The intersection point between the Mohr–Coulomb failure line and the normal stress
axis is of no practical interest in itself, as the point is inaccessible due to tensile failure.
However, for some purposes it is convenient to make use of the parameter A deﬁned as the
distance from the intersection point to the origin (see Fig. 2.8). The parameter is called the
attraction. The attraction is related to the other Mohr–Coulomb parameters by

A = S0 cot ϕ

(2.9)

Fig. 2.8 also shows the angle 2β, which gives the position of the point where the Mohr’s
circle touches the failure line. It can be seen from the ﬁgure that the shear stress at this
point of contact is

The allowable range for ϕ is from 0° to 90° (in practice the range will be smaller, and

We may conclude that the failure plane is always inclined at an angle smaller that 45° to

One important point to note is that β is given solely by ϕ, which is a constant in the
Mohr–Coulomb criterion. Thus the orientation of the failure plane is independent of the
conﬁning stress. This is a special feature for the Mohr–Coulomb criterion. Experiments
often show that the failure angle decreases with increasing conﬁning pressure, in particular
at low conﬁning pressures.

2.3.2. The Grifﬁth criterion

65

Grifﬁth (1921) developed a failure criterion based on a study of elliptical microcracks in
a two dimensional model. When the tensile stress at the tip of the crack exceeds a certain
value characteristic of the material, the crack will grow and the failure process is initiated.
The theory is scaled in terms of the uniaxial tensile strength T0, and the resulting failure
criterion can be written

In a principal stress plot the criterion is represented by a parabola ending in a straight line.
This is illustrated in Fig. 2.11a.

The uniaxial compressive strength C0 is given by Eq. (2.23) as

C0 = 8T0

(2.25)

It is seen that the ratio between the uniaxial compressive strength and the tensile strength
is here given as a ﬁxed number. This ratio of 8 appears to be reasonable compared to
experimental values, which often are in the range of 10–15. However, it is clear that ﬁtting
the criterion to experimental data may sometimes be difﬁcult, since the criterion only has
one free parameter.

(cid:2)

In τ –σ

-coordinates, the Grifﬁth criterion is given by only one equation:

τ 2 = 4T0(σ

FAILURE MECHANICS

(See for instance Jaeger and Cook (1979) for the transition from Eqs. (2.23) and (2.24) to
Eq. (2.26).)

Eq. (2.26) shows that the criterion is a parabola also in a τ –σ

-plot, as illustrated in
Fig. 2.11b. Unlike the Mohr–Coulomb criterion, the Grifﬁth criterion is seen to have a
steeper slope at low conﬁning pressures. This feature is typical for experimental observa-
tions.

(cid:2)

It is often observed that the Grifﬁth criterion may give a reasonably good description
of failure at low conﬁning stresses, while a straight line Mohr–Coulomb criterion gives a
better description at higher conﬁning stresses. This has led to the development of a modi-
ﬁed Grifﬁth criterion (Brace, 1960; McClintock and Walsh, 1962). This criterion is based
on the idea that the microcracks will close at sufﬁciently high pressure levels, resulting in
a transition towards frictional behaviour corresponding to the Mohr–Coulomb criterion. If
we assume that the stress required to close the cracks is so small that it can be neglected,
< 0)
the modiﬁed Grifﬁth criterion is simply a Grifﬁth criterion for tensile conditions (σ
> 0). The critical
coupled to a Mohr–Coulomb criterion for compressive conditions (σ
(cid:2) = 0 (see Eq. (2.26)) is used
shear stress τ = 2T0 predicted by the Grifﬁth criterion at σ
for the cohesion S0 in the Mohr–Coulomb part of the criterion. A result from this modiﬁed
theory is that the ratio between uniaxial compressive strength and the tensile strength is
given by

where μ is the coefﬁcient of internal friction related to the Mohr–Coulomb part of the

2.4. Compaction failure

Pore collapse is a failure mode that is normally observed only in high porosity materials,
where the grain skeleton forms a relatively open structure. When the material is com-
pressed, grains may loosen or break and then be pushed or twisted into the open pore
space, resulting in a closer packing of the material. The process is called compaction. This
deformation mode is schematically illustrated in Fig. 2.12.

In sandstones where the size of the pores is of the same order of magnitude as the size
of the grains, pore collapse typically consists in reorientation of the grains to better ﬁll
the void spaces, as indicated in Fig. 2.12. For high porosity chalks, where the size of the
individual grains may be an order of magnitude smaller than the dimensions of the pore
space, the pore collapse mechanism becomes very important.

Pore collapse may occur under pure hydrostatic loading. Microscopically, however, fail-
ure will be due to local excessive shear forces acting through grains and grain contacts.
From this point of view, pore collapse may be regarded as distributed shear failure within
the material.

Another failure mechanism that may occur under hydrostatic loading is grain crushing.
If the stresses are sufﬁciently high, the grains may be partly crushed at the grain con-
tacts, and splitting of the grains may result. Either way, these local failure mechanisms

represent permanent damage of the rock framework and causes yielding, with associated
reduction in the stiffness of the rock. This type of failure also occurs to some extent under
non-hydrostatic stress conditions, and may be observed in triaxial tests at high conﬁning
pressure (see Fig. 2.3; high conﬁning pressure). The process is then referred to as shear-
enhanced compaction.

In principal stress space, this type of failure is represented by an “end cap” that closes
the failure surface at high stresses, as seen on Fig. 2.13. An elliptical form is often used for

for compaction. Note that the equation predicts failure at ¯σ

(q = 0).
Compaction leads to a denser structure, and the rock will still be able to carry load. As
the structure becomes increasingly dense, the load carrying capacity may even increase.
Hence Eq. (2.28) represents essentially a compactive yield surface. This differs from tensile
failure and unconﬁned shear failure, where the load carrying capacity is completely lost
after failure. Compaction is also a more homogeneous failure mode, however localization
may occur even for compaction. This is further discussed in Section 2.8.
Boutéca et al. (2000) argued that the following simple form of Eq. (2.28) (obtained by
choosing γ = 0 and δ = 1) may be an acceptable approximation for many rocks:

2.5. Failure criteria in three dimensions

The stresses in the underground formations and around wells will generally be 3-dimen-
sional in the sense that the principal stresses will have different values. It is therefore
necessary to extend the 2-dimensional failure criteria to deal with the more general case.

This also brings up the question of the role of the intermediate principal stress. With the
development of equipment for true triaxial testing, it has been possible to approach this
question experimentally. The general result from such tests is that under shear conditions
the intermediate stress plays a role, although minor compared to the effect of the other
stresses.

Most of the failure criteria used in rock mechanics were developed before the role of the

still valuable approximations, and will still be used.

The irregular hexagonal pyramid shape of the surface reﬂects that according to the
Mohr–Coulomb criterion, failure is independent of the intermediate principal stress. The
surface is not differentiable at the corners, a fact that may cause problems in numerical cal-
culations involving the criterion. The cross-section of the Mohr–Coulomb failure surface
in a π-plane (see Section 2.1.2) is shown in Fig. 2.16. It is seen to be an irregular hexagon
with sharp corners and threefold symmetry.

The Tresca criterion also has a six sided cross-section in the π-plane, but for this crite-
rion the section will be a regular hexagon. As the friction angle is zero, the failure surface
will be parallel to the hydrostatic axis.

A 3-dimensional failure surface can be obtained for the Grifﬁth criterion in a similar
way as for the Mohr–Coulomb criterion. The three pairs of planes ending in a sharp corner
for the Mohr–Coulomb criterion (Fig. 2.15) is for the Grifﬁth criterion replaced by three
pairs of singly curved parabolic surfaces ending in a plane section.

The failure surface constructions presented here demonstrate one basic feature of the
failure surface in 3 dimensions, namely the three-fold symmetry of the π-plane cross-
section. However, they suffer from the fact that they ignore the inﬂuence of the intermediate
principal stress. Other extensions to 3 dimensions have therefore been proposed, as dis-
cussed below.

2.5.2. Criteria depending on the intermediate principal stress

(cid:2)
Mounting experimental evidence has shown that the intermediate principal stress (σ
2) has
a signiﬁcant—although moderate—impact on the strength of several rock types (see for
instance Colmenares and Zoback (2002), for an overview). Typically, it is found that rocks
are stronger when σ

As mentioned in the previous paragraph, the failure surfaces constructed simply on the
basis of two-dimensional criteria also possess sharp corners that causes problems when the
criteria are used for numerical modelling. Various other failure criteria which include the
intermediate principal stress have therefore been proposed.

One simple solution is to implement rotational symmetry for the π-plane cross-section.
This approach has no physical foundation, however it is mathematically attractive, and is
the basis for some of the most commonly used criteria shown below. (Alternative formula-
tions of these criteria, in terms of invariants, are given in Section 2.7.)
One of these criteria is the von Mises criterion, which can be written

represented by a cylinder centred around the hydrostatic axis, as illustrated in Fig. 2.17.

The criterion is seen to be identical to the Tresca criterion for σ

the Tresca criterion, the von Mises criterion describes a shear failure mechanism where the
failure condition is independent of the stress level in the material. The von Mises criterion
is commonly used to describe yield in metals. It has however very limited applications for
rocks.

Murrel (1963) introduced the extended Grifﬁth criterion, which degenerates to the orig-
inal Grifﬁth criterion (Eqs. (2.23)–(2.24)) in two dimensions. In principal stress space it is

The extended Grifﬁth criterion predicts that the relation between uniaxial compressive

strength and tensile strength is given by

C0 = 12T0

(2.35)

This value of C0/T0 is typical for many rocks. Also for this criterion the cross-section in
the π-plane is given by a circle, except for the conical part at negative stresses.

An empirical failure criterion based on actual observations of the behaviour of soils
was formulated by Lade (1977). A modiﬁed version of this criterion was presented by

while ηL is related only to the internal friction:

In principal stress space the criterion has the form of a convex, triangularly shaped cone.
The parameter ηL determines the shape of the cross-section in the π-plane. As the value of
ηL increases, the cross-sectional shape changes from circular to triangular with smoothly
rounded edges. Fig. 2.18 shows a comparison of the modiﬁed Lade criterion to other crite-
ria in the π-plane.

The modiﬁed Lade criterion is a simple criterion which appears to account for the inﬂu-
ence of the intermediate principal stress on shear strength in a realistic way. As such, this is

a useful criterion for practical calculations. The formulation based on I

may however be somewhat impractical, as it requires solution of a cubic equation. An al-
ternative formulation is given in Eqs. (2.41)–(2.44)).

π-plane representation

The Drucker–Prager, von Mises and Murrel criteria are circular in the π-plane, while the
modiﬁed Lade and Mohr–Coulomb criteria have a 3-fold symmetry. It is clear that for an
isotropic material, the yield surface must at least have a 3-fold symmetry in the π-plane.
This means that in general, the failure surface in principal stress space may be given by
specifying the mean stress, and the radius in the π-plane as a periodic function of the angle
3ϑ (where ϑ is the Lode angle deﬁned in Eq. (1.51) and Fig. 1.10).

The radial distance to a point on the failure surface is given by Eq. (1.50). Deﬁning two

general functions f1 and f2 we may thus write a general failure criterion as

(2.41)
where the cosine function ensures the required symmetry in the π-plane, and the factor 2
of Eq. (1.50) has been absorbed in f1 and f2. The separation of ϑ and ¯σ
means that the
shape of the π-plane cross-section is independent of ¯σ
The choice of the cosine in Eq. (2.41) is convenient, since cos 3ϑ can be expressed
in terms of invariants (Eq. (1.51)), and does not represent a limitation since any periodic
function may be expressed by a series in cos 3ϑ.

The function f1 can not be chosen completely arbitrarily, since both empirical evidence

that the failure surface should be convex. If we choose f1 to be a constant, Eq. (2.41)

f2 is linear in ¯σ

instance choose

This relation gives k = 6/7 ≈ 0.857 for ϕ = 30° (note that the convexity criterion requires
k (cid:2) 10/11 ≈ 0.909). Eqs. (2.45) and (2.46), in combination with

By choosing f1 appropriately, it is possible to formulate the Mohr–Coulomb criterion

exactly in terms of the invariants. The expression

explicit 3-fold symmetry of Eq. (2.41) (for which we pay by the limited range of validity
in ϑ). This is not a major concern, however, since using arccos in Eq. (1.51) maps all stress
states to a ϑ in the correct range.

For papers using the formulation presented here, see e.g. van Eekelen (1980) or Nordal

et al. (1989). This representation is convenient for generation of π-plots like Fig. 2.18.

Physical explanations

Wiebols and Cook (1968) proposed a model which offers a physical explanation to the
impact of the intermediate principal stress on rock strength. They considered the shear
strain energy associated with microcracks in the material. Activation of such a crack, in
terms of sliding between the crack surfaces, will occur when a frictional criterion like
the Mohr–Coulomb criterion (Eq. (2.6)) is fulﬁlled locally for this crack. The shear and
normal stresses controlling this process are given by the relative orientation of the crack and
the principal stresses (see Eq. (1.36)). The situation is illustrated graphically in Fig. 2.19,
(cid:2)
3.
showing three different stress states: σ
We assume that there exists a large number of such cracks with random orientation in the
material. For simplicity, we also assume that they all have the same activation threshold, so
that the failure line shown in the ﬁgure is the same for all cracks. Thus, for every possible
stress state represented by a point on (or within) the Mohr circle(s) in the τ –σ
-plot there
exist some corresponding cracks that are activated if the point is above the failure line.

An alternative explanation was proposed by Fjær and Ruistuen (2002). They based their
analysis on the classical assumption (see Section 2.3) that the rock will fail when the shear
stress across a potential failure plane fulﬁls a failure criterion, like for instance the Mohr–
Coulomb criterion. Any imaginary plane through a rock sample is a potential failure plane,

hence any point representing a possible stress state in the τ –σ
sents at least one possible failure plane.

Fjær and Ruistuen assumed that there is a variation in the strength of each potential
failure plane, due to the natural heterogeneity of rocks. This implies that there is a ﬁnite
probability for a plane to fail even if its corresponding point in the Mohr circle diagram lies
below the failure line, and there is correspondingly a ﬁnite probability for the plane not to
fail even if its corresponding point lies above the failure line. For the high symmetry cases

least one of these planes will fail early. For the low symmetry case σ
all of the points representing these planes have moved away from the failure line, and the
probability for early failure is correspondingly reduced. The net effect of this is that the

2.6. Fluid effects

2.6.1. Pore pressure

In our discussion of failure criteria the pore pressure has so far appeared only indirectly
through the effective stresses. The effective stresses are thought to represent the forces

76

FAILURE MECHANICS

transmitted through the rock skeleton, which in turn causes the deformation of the material,
while the remaining parts of the total stresses are carried by the pore ﬂuid. As the pore
pressure is equal in all directions, it will affect only the normal stresses. The shear stresses,
that are due to differences in the principal stresses, will be unaffected. In a τ –σ
-plot the
effect of increasing the pore pressure while the total stresses are kept constant, is to move
the Mohr circles to the left and closer to the shear and tensile failure lines, as illustrated in
Fig. 2.20. Thus, increasing pore pressure may destabilize a rock with respect to shear and
tensile failure.

(cid:2)

The effective stress concept as given by Eq. (1.168) in terms of the Biot constant α, was
derived under the assumption that the rock is linearly elastic, and is not directly applicable
for a rock at failure. It is, however, generally accepted that Terzaghi’s deﬁnition of effective
stress (see Section 1.6.3)

(cid:2) = σ − pf

σ

(2.49)

appears to be the most relevant deﬁnition to be used in failure criteria (Detournay and
Cheng, 1988; Boutéca and Guéguen, 1999).

We may ﬁnd an argument for this observation by observing that in the vicinity of failure,
the rock is softening (that is, the slope of the stress–strain curve is strongly reduced; see
Fig. 2.2). It is not obvious however, that Eq. (2.49) is the best deﬁnition for the effective
yield stress, as the rock is supposed to behave elastically until it yields.

2.6.2. Partial saturation

Even unconsolidated sand may have some degree of consolidation. Any child that has
visited a sandy beach on a sunny day, has experienced the magic of moist sand, which
can be shaped and reshaped to make all kinds of fantastic ﬁgures. When the tide comes
and ﬂoods the beach, the magic is broken and the ﬁgures disintegrate into loose sand. The
“magic” is caused by the fact that moist sand is partially water saturated. This means that
there is a meniscus of water at every grain contact, as shown schematically in Fig. 2.21.

FLUID EFFECTS

77

Fig. 2.21. Schematic illustration of the distribution of ﬂuids at a grain contact.

It is energetically favourable for the grain–water–air system to maintain this constellation,
hence a certain force is needed to rip the grains apart. This acts as a cohesion, giving
the moist sand a ﬁnite shear and tensile strength. The strength is fully recovered after
a reorganization of the grains, hence the moist sand can be reshaped indeﬁnitely. When
the sand becomes completely dry or fully water saturated, the meniscus constellation is
destroyed, and the cohesion and strength are gone.

The effects of partial saturation occur whenever the pore space is ﬁlled with at least two
immiscible ﬂuids, like for instance oil and water. Normally, it is energetically favourable
that one of the ﬂuids (the wetting ﬂuid) stays in contact with the solid material, while the
other (non-wetting) ﬂuid is shielded from the solid to some degree, giving a constellation as
illustrated in Fig. 2.21. This so-called capillary effect produces a difference in the pressure
for the two ﬂuids, given as

pcp = pnw − pwe

(2.50)

where pwe is the pressure in the wetting ﬂuid, pnw is the pressure in the non-wetting ﬂuid,
and pcp is called the capillary suction.

The magnitude of the capillary suction depends on the type of ﬂuids, the condition of the
solid surface (which determines the degree of wettability for the various ﬂuids) and the size
of the pore at the point where the two ﬂuid phases meet. The wetting ﬂuid will always tend
to ﬁll the smallest pores, so that the contact between the ﬂuid phases will move to larger
pores when the degree of saturation for the wetting ﬂuid is increased. Thus pcp varies from
one pore to the next, and falls off rapidly with the degree of saturation for the wetting ﬂuid.
The capillary suction has some effect on the effective stresses in the rock, and we may

deﬁne a generalized effective stress (Bishop, 1959)

(cid:2) = σ − α(pnw − Swepcp)

σ

(2.51)
Swe is the degree of saturation of the wetting ﬂuid. The term Swepcp typically has a peak
at a low value for Swe (≈0.1 or less) and vanishes for Swe = 0 and Swe = 1. It is normally
quite small, however, typically less than 1 MPa even at its peak value, and can in most
cases be ignored with respect to the effective stresses.

The capillary suction also affects material properties that can be related to the intergran-
ular cohesion of the rock (Papamichos et al., 1997). This is a more signiﬁcant effect that

may have a large impact on both the strength and the stiffness of the rock, as illustrated in
Fig. 2.22.

2.6.3. Chemical effects

Some abundant components in rocks, like salts and some clay and carbonate minerals, are
dissolvable in water. Over geological time, the solid minerals in a rock will establish a
chemical equilibrium with the pore water, which implies that the minerals dissolve and
precipitate at the same rate. If the pore ﬂuid is changed, for instance during drilling or
production, the chemical equilibrium may be disturbed, and a net dissolution or deposition
of minerals may occur. This may have a strong effect on the rock properties, typically a
reduction in strength of 30–100% is seen in many rocks due to deterioration of the cement
(Broch, 1974). For instance, dry or oil saturated Red Wildmoor sandstone has a uniaxial
compressive strength of about 14 MPa, while it essentially turns into loose sand if it is
saturated with fresh water. The reason for this is that this rock consists of quartz grains
cemented together only by clay minerals which dissolve in water.

The solubility of minerals in the pore water may also be affected by the acidity (pH-
value) of the water, as well its temperature and pressure. Thus, it is to be expected that the
strength of some rocks may be sensitive to changes in these parameters too, if the changes
are given sufﬁcient time to act.

Experimental studies by Risnes et al. (2003) have shown that the chemical activity of
(cid:2) = 0.9 tests

the pore water seems to have an impact on the strength of chalk. In a set of K
(see Section 7.3.9) on Liège chalk, they found the relation

= −6 MPa

σyield

aw

(2.52)

PRESENTATION AND INTERPRETATION OF DATA FROM FAILURE TESTS

79

between the yield stress (σyield) and the water activity (aw). Thus, a low salt concentration
in the pore water (which corresponds to a high water activity) makes the chalk weaker.
Risnes et al. (2003) concluded that the water activity seems to be the key parameter in the
water weakening effect seen in chalk, and that capillary effects play only a minor role.

2.7. Presentation and interpretation of data from failure tests

To determine the mechanical properties of a rock, normally a series of triaxial compression
tests are performed at different conﬁning pressures. From the stress strain diagrams both
elastic properties and failure or yield data are obtained. The strength data resulting from
such a test series will consist of pairs of corresponding yield (or failure) and conﬁning
stresses. This set of failure data can be displayed in different types of diagrams.

It may be confusing that the word failure is often used in a somewhat general sense, not
distinguishing between failure and yield. An argument for this practice is that yield can
be considered as the onset of failure. However, when actual failure data are presented, it
should be checked if the data refer to yield or failure in the strict sense.

(cid:2)

Three types of plots are commonly used to present failure data: the principal stress plots

(Fig. 2.10), the τ –σ

plots (Fig. 2.8), and the q–p

plots, which will be described below.

In a principal stress plot, the stress path of a given test can be traced as a line, while
failure is represented by the point where the stress path crosses the failure surface. The
principal stress plot is suitable for mapping the entire failure surface, including all types of
failure, as demonstrated in Fig. 2.13.

(cid:2)

A τ –σ

plot displays effectively how the shear stress and the normal stress across a plane
in a stressed rock varies with the orientation of the plane relative to the orientation of the
principal stress axes. It is therefore well suited for identifying critical shear stresses, and
(cid:2)
for illustrating orientational effects, like Fig. 2.19. As explained in Section 2.4, the τ –σ
plot is not well suited for displaying collapse.

The q–p

plot essentially displays the maximum shear stress versus the mean effective
stress. It is based on the parameter q, usually called the generalized shear stress and deﬁned
as (see Eq. (1.46))

BEYOND THE YIELD POINT

81

partly due to the fact that failure is not very well deﬁned. Although the failure point can
be deﬁned relatively precisely for the uniaxial test in Fig. 2.2, the situation is much less
clear for the higher conﬁning pressures in Fig. 2.3. Here we have a gradual transition to a
material with decreased stiffness, but still with an increasing capacity to carry load as the
strain increases. Thus the material can not be considered as completely failed, although it
has been signiﬁcantly altered at this stage. Whether the alteration is critical or not, depends
on the actual situation. For example, the practical criteria for a road tunnel and a wellbore
may be quite different. Whereas no change in proﬁle is acceptable for a road tunnel, one
may well live with a borehole with breakouts in many cases (see e.g. Guenot, 1989).

The remarks above illustrate the need for a post-yield description linked to the deﬁn-
ition of failure and the failure criterion. To properly describe post-yield behaviour, one
would need a description treating the rock as an inhomogeneous medium, penetrated by
interacting faults and cracks.

Compared to a continuum model, such a description would—of course—be very com-
plicated. It is therefore reasonable to look for a continuum theory, that can at least model
some post-yield behaviour with some precision, although the physical interpretation may
be less precise. One possible candidate is the theory of plasticity, which is widely used in
the description of metals. An introduction to plasticity is given in Section 2.8.1.

Beyond the yield point the solid framework of the rock is gradually destroyed, and it
may become increasingly relevant to compare its behaviour to unconsolidated materials.
A model derived for the description of soils is presented in Section 2.8.2.

At some point in the failure process, the description of the rock as homogeneous is
clearly not valid, even on a macroscopic scale, as exempliﬁed by the formation of shear
planes in a triaxial test. This calls for other types of modelling. Models addressing local-
ization effects at failure are brieﬂy discussed in Section 2.8.3.

2.8.1. Plasticity

Plasticity is a concept describing non-elastic deformation of a material. Unlike elastic de-
formation, plastic deformation is not recovered when the load causing the deformation is
released. Rocks stressed beyond the yield point typically suffer such deformations, and it
is often relevant to describe post yield behaviour of rocks by the concepts of plasticity.

The theory of plasticity is designed to model ductile behaviour, that is—behaviour in
which the material can sustain a load comparable to the failure load well beyond failure,
and no attempt should be made to model brittle failure with this theory.

The theory of plasticity is based on four major concepts:

1. Plastic strain. The total strain increment associated with a stress increment is as-

sumed to consist of an elastic part and a plastic part:
+ dε

dεij = dεe

p
ij

ij

(2.60)

ij is related to the stress increment by conventional elasticity theory, and will vanish
p
ij is a permanent deformation, and

dεe
when the stress is released. The plastic strain dε
will remain when the stress is relieved.

82

FAILURE MECHANICS

2. A yield criterion. In Section 2.1 we deﬁned yield as the point at which irreversible
changes occur in the rock. Thus, the yield point represents the onset of plastic defor-
mation. Clearly, yield can be deﬁned more precisely than failure. A yield criterion is
similar to the failure criteria deﬁned in Sections 2.2–2.4, and deﬁnes the surface in
stress space where plasticity is initiated.

3. A ﬂow rule. The ﬂow rule describes how the plastic strains develop for a given loading

situation.

4. A hardening rule. We mentioned in Section 2.1.1 that a rock under certain condi-
tions may sustain increasing load after the initial failure. This is described by the
hardening rule. The hardening (or, alternatively, the softening) may be interpreted
as a change of the yield surface in principal stress space. This can be described by
changing Eq. (2.1) to

(cid:2)
1, σ

(cid:2)
2, σ

3, κ) = 0
(cid:2)

f (σ

(2.61)

where κ is a parameter describing the hardening effects.

An ideally plastic material is a material that can endure inﬁnite plastic strain without
change in the stress level. Fig. 2.24 shows schematically the stress–strain diagram for a
linearly elastic – ideally plastic material. After the initial elastic phase, the material de-
forms at constant stress.

Plastic ﬂow

The function of the ﬂow rule is to describe the development of the plastic strain increments.
The basic assumption concerning plastic ﬂow dates back to Saint-Venant in the nineteenth
century. It states

= dλhij (σ

(cid:2)
kl)

p
dε
ij

(2.62)

BEYOND THE YIELD POINT

83

where λ is a scalar not speciﬁed by the ﬂow rule. It is seen that the hij ’s are functions of
the stress components. There are two main implications of Eq. (2.62). First, it states that
the direction of plastic ﬂow is determined by the stress state, and is not inﬂuenced by the
stress increments or by stress gradients. Second, the magnitude of the plastic strain is not
unique. Referring to Fig. 2.24, this is quite trivial for an ideally plastic material, since the
yield stress is maintained for any magnitude of the plastic strain.

The assumption that the plastic strains are independent of stress increments, is intuitively
understandable in the following simple example. Consider an object resting on some sur-
face, and assume that a force nearly overcoming the rest friction between the object and
the surface is applied. Now, a small force increment is applied at some angle to the pri-
mary force. If the increment has a component in the direction of the primary force, the rest
friction will be overcome, and the object will start to slide in the direction of the primary
force, irrespective of the direction of the force increment.

Eq. (2.62) puts some restrictions on the plastic behaviour, however it is far from a com-
plete description which requires a speciﬁcation of the functions hij . Some help is found
from the fact that plastic deformation is a dissipative process, which implies that

(cid:2) 0

A signiﬁcant simpliﬁcation results from the assumption of von Mises (1928), that the hij ’s
can be derived as the gradient of a function g in stress space:

= dλ

∂g
(cid:2)

(2.64)

The function g is called plastic potential and must of course be chosen such that Eq. (2.63)
is obeyed. Although the assumption of a plastic potential reduces the need for a speciﬁca-
tion of six functions hij of six variables to one function g of six variables, it is by no means
sufﬁcient to completely specify plastic ﬂow.

One solution to the problem is Drucker’s (1950) deﬁnition of a stable, work hardening

material. Such a material is deﬁned by a more strict version of Eq. (2.63):

(cid:2) 0

p
ij

(2.65)

(cid:6)

(cid:2)
ij dε

dσ

ij

Note that while Eq. (2.63) is a thermodynamic law, Eq. (2.65) is not, and thus the con-
sequences derived from Eq. (2.65) need not be obeyed by all materials. From Eq. (2.65)
Drucker found that the plastic potential g is identical to the function f describing the yield
surface, that is:

= dλ

dε

p
ij

∂f
(cid:2)

∂σ

(2.66)

Thus, once the yield surface is speciﬁed, so is plastic ﬂow—a gratifying result indeed.
However, we shall see that some of the consequences of Eq. (2.66) are not always fulﬁlled
by rock materials, such that one may need to return to the more general assumption (2.64).
Since, in Eq. (2.66), plastic ﬂow is derived from the yield criterion, it is called an associ-
ated ﬂow rule. The ﬂow rule derived from the more general plastic potential g is conversely
called non-associated ﬂow.

84

FAILURE MECHANICS

Fig. 2.25. Associated plastic ﬂow for the Coulomb criterion in a principal stress plot.

Associated ﬂow

In this section, we shall discuss associated plastic ﬂow, mainly in conjunction with the
Coulomb criterion. Fig. 2.25 shows a principal stress plot with a Coulomb failure line (see
Fig. 2.10). We assume that this line represents the yield surface. According to Drucker
(1950) it thus also represents the plastic potential, as described above. Consider that a
material is brought to the stress state represented by point A on the ﬁgure. Any small
increment of the stresses that brings the stress state above the line will result in a plastic
deformation.

The axes of plastic strain increments coincide with the principal stress axes. According
to Eq. (2.66) the plastic strain increment is parallel to the gradient of the plastic potential.
This implies that the direction of the plastic ﬂow is parallel to the normal of the yield
surface at point A, as indicated by the arrow on the ﬁgure. (The gradient of a function is
always normal to the equisurface of that function.) From the ﬁgure we see that

This means that the volume increases (remember our sign convention from Chapter 1). This
effect is called dilatancy. Referring to Fig. 2.24, we note that for an ideally plastic material,

this effect occurs while the mean stress is constant. This is different from a linearly elastic
material, for which a change in volume only occurs as a result of a change in the mean
stress.

In the literature, one will encounter plots in which the direction of plastic ﬂow is in-
dicated as a normal to the yield criterion in a τ –σ
-plot, as shown in Fig. 2.26. Since the
interpretation of this at ﬁrst glance may be unclear, we will brieﬂy discuss it here. Eq. (2.16)
may be written as:

Therefore, a plot giving the stress deviation (σ

the y axis of Fig. 2.26 as (ε

1. If the arrow is tilted to the left (ϕ (cid:2) 0), the material is positively dilatant.
2. If the arrow is vertical (ϕ = 0), the material does not change volume (incompressible

plastic ﬂow).

3. If the arrow is tilted to the right (ϕ (cid:3) 0), the material is negatively dilatant, or con-

tractant.

Thus, a normal Mohr–Coulomb criterion describes dilatant plastic ﬂow, whereas the Tresca
criterion describes an incompressible plastic ﬂow.

Experimentally, one often observes some dilatation, but rarely to the degree predicted
by the Mohr–Coulomb criterion and associated plastic ﬂow. This is an indication that the
assumptions leading to associated ﬂow do not always hold. Also, the restriction given by
Eq. (2.65) means that the stress–strain curve is a monotonically increasing curve, again a
consequence of associated plastic ﬂow that is by no means always fulﬁlled.

86

Non-associated ﬂow

FAILURE MECHANICS

Non-associated plastic ﬂow may occur if the plastic potential is not identical to the yield
surface. It is a convenient model to use in order to have control on dilatancy without chang-
ing the yield criterion.

Ψ is called the dilatancy angle, and from the discussion in the previous section, we know
that we will have dilatant, incompressible, or contractant ﬂow—depending on whether Ψ is
larger than, equal to, or smaller than zero. Note that the allowable range for Ψ is restricted,
since Eq. (2.63) has to be fulﬁlled.

Hardening

According to Eq. (2.61) hardening can be described by a change in the yield surface as a
function of a parameter κ that is, in some way, related to the plastic strains. This is shown
schematically in Fig. 2.27. In the ﬁgure we deﬁne the initial yield surface, and a current

yield surface, i.e. the yield surface after some plastic straining. Also shown is the failure
surface, which is deﬁned as the surface that separates accessible states from inaccessible
states. Note that for an ideally plastic material, the initial yield surface and the failure
surface coincide. The use of only one parameter κ to describe hardening is, of course, a
simpliﬁcation, since there are six plastic strain components.

There are two common ways to relate κ to the plastic strain. One way is to assume that κ
is a function of the total plastic strain. This is called strain hardening, and can be expressed
as

This is called work hardening.

Hardening is commonly decomposed into two main modes, isotropic hardening and
kinematic hardening. Fig. 2.28 illustrates the difference between these concepts. Isotropic
hardening means that the yield surface expands (or shrinks) in a uniform way about the
hydrostatic axis. Kinematic hardening consists of a translation of the failure surface in
stress space. In practice, hardening must be described by a combination of the modes or an
even more complicated behaviour, in which different parts of the yield surface deform in
different ways.

Before concluding, we shall mention one important effect concerning hardening, which
is normally observed experimentally. The Baushinger effect states that if a material is
(cid:2)
subjected to a given plastic strain in one direction, given a yield stress σ
1, the correspond-
ing yield stress found when the specimen is later loaded in the opposite direction will

2.8.2. Soil mechanics

FAILURE MECHANICS

The failure mechanics described so far in this chapter was primarily developed for hard
rocks. Weak sedimentary rocks are however intermediate between hard rocks and soils,
and it has been found that a mechanical model developed for soils may be applied with
success in some weakly cemented sedimentary rocks, such as shale (Nakken et al., 1989;
Marsden et al., 1989) and chalk (Jones and Leddra, 1989). We shall here give an introduc-
tion to the main concepts of this mechanical model called “soil mechanics” (also called
the “Cam Clay model”). For more details and a more comprehensive description, see for
instance Atkinson and Bransby (1978), Head (1984) or Wood (1990).

Soil mechanics has been developed for systems with no or little cement between the
individual grains. Clay is a material that ﬁts into this description. In this section we will take
a look at the behaviour of a clay under isotropic compression, and deﬁne some concepts
commonly used in soil mechanics.

Voids ratio e is the volume of voids Vvoid relative to the volume of the solid grains Vsolid

in the material:

(2.77)
Speciﬁc volume υ is the total volume (grains + voids) divided by the volume of the solid
grains, that is

Vsolid

e = Vvoid

υ = Vsolid + Vvoid

= 1 + e

Vsolid

(2.78)

(2.79)

The speciﬁc volume and the voids ratio are related to the porosity φ by

φ = e
1 + e

= υ − 1

υ

In a drained test the ﬂuid pressure in the sample is controlled at a given value, by allow-
ing the ﬂuid to enter or leave the sample (see Section 1.6). An undrained test is a test where
no ﬂuid is allowed to enter or escape from the sample during the test. The ﬂuid pressure in
the sample will change during an undrained test.

Fig. 2.29 shows schematically the result of isotropic loading of a clay under drained
conditions. The plot shows speciﬁc volume υ versus the logarithm of effective mean stress
(cid:2) = p−pf (= the Terzaghi effective pressure, see Section 1.6.3). Note that we use the soil
p
mechanics convention of denoting the mean stress by p (= ¯σ in Section 1.1.7). The reason
for using logarithmic scale on the pressure axis is that the loading paths are close to straight
lines in this case. As a sample is loaded, the speciﬁc volume will decrease along the line
1–2–3–4 in the ﬁgure. Assume now that we start with an identical sample and load it up to
(cid:2)
the point 2, and then unload it. The unloading path follows the line 2–2
, which has a lower
(cid:2)
slope. Reloading again from 2
–2 up to the point 2, thereafter it
follows the line of the ﬁrst sample towards point 3. Unloading again after reaching point 3,
the sample follows the line 3–3

, the path follows the line 2
(cid:2)

, which has a slope equal to that of 2–2

(cid:2)

(cid:2)

.

The description above is idealized. In practice the lines will not be exactly straight, there
(cid:2)
will be some hysteresis along the lines 2–2
and 3–3
will differ somewhat. Still, the description gives a good picture of the overall behaviour of

clays. A main point to be learned is the following: the stiffness of a sample which is loaded
above the highest pressure it has been exposed to before, is lower than the stiffness of a
sample which has seen higher pressures than the present state.

A sample which is at the highest stress it has ever experienced is said to be normally
consolidated. The sample described above was normally consolidated whenever it was
on the line 1–4 (Fig. 2.29). A sample which has been subjected to higher stresses before
is said to be overconsolidated. The sample above was overconsolidated when it was on
(cid:2)
(Fig. 2.29). The highest stress a sample has been exposed
one of the lines 2–2
to is commonly called preconsolidation stress. Theoverconsolidation ratio of a sample is
deﬁned as the highest stress it has been experienced, divided by the current stress.

or 3–3

(cid:2)

Triaxial tests on sandstones are usually run on drained samples, and plots showing stress
versus strain (like Figs. 2.2 and 2.3) are used to present the results. Due to the low per-
meability, triaxial tests on a material like clay are usually run on undrained samples. It is
and the
also customary to analyse the test results in terms of the effective mean stress p
generalized shear stress q, deﬁned in Section 2.7.

(cid:2)

Fig. 2.30 shows schematically a typical test on a normally consolidated clay. The loading
path curves to the left, which means that the mean effective stress is decreasing. Thus the
pore pressure increases throughout the test. For strongly overconsolidated samples, one
expects the path to curve to the right as the sample approaches failure.

Typical behaviour during undrained triaxial testing, for normally consolidated clays and

strongly overconsolidated clays can be summarized as follows:

Normally consolidated clay:

1. No peak stress in the stress–strain diagram, i.e. the shear stress does not fall below

previous value as the strain increases.

2. The sample contracts throughout the loading.

(cid:2)

3. The loading path in a q–p

-plot curves to the left, i.e. the pore pressure increases.

Strongly overconsolidated clay:

1. A peak is normally observable in the stress–strain diagram, i.e. at some point the

shear stress falls below previous values as the strain increases.

2. The sample contracts initially, then dilates as failure is approaching.

3. The loading path in a q–p

decreases.

The normally consolidated clays and the strongly overconsolidated clays are seen to behave
quite differently. We shall now describe each of them in more detail.

Normally consolidated clays

Fig. 2.31 illustrates the stress paths for three undrained tests on samples of a normally
consolidated clay, starting from three different isotropic compression levels. The arrows
show the paths of the tests from the start of the triaxial phase to the failure state, that is to
the point where the stress–strain curve ﬂattens out and large shear strains may occur at no
increase in the shear stress. The loading paths in the υ–p
-plot are horizontal, since there
is no change in speciﬁc volume during an undrained test. Note that the ends of the paths
seem to fall on continuous “failure” lines in both plots.

(cid:2)

Fig. 2.32 shows the corresponding stress paths for drained tests. Again the end points
are seen to fall on continuous lines. It has been found that the continuous failure lines
deﬁned by the ends of the tests in Figs. 2.31 and 2.32 are indeed the same lines to a fair
approximation. If we plot the test results in a three-dimensional plot, with υ–p
–q as the
axes, we ﬁnd that the failure lines in the q–p
planes are projections of a line
in this three-dimensional space, the critical state line (CSL). The critical state line with
its projections onto the q–p
planes are shown in Fig. 2.33. The critical state
represents an ultimate state where large shear strains may occur at no change in shear
stress.

isotropic consolidation line in common, it seems reasonable to assume that the two surfaces
may actually be the same. This assumption has been conﬁrmed with reasonable precision
–q space
from experiments. The surface is called the Roscoe surface. Its location in υ–p
is a characteristic property of the actual material. All tests on a normally consolidated
sample of this material—drained, undrained or intermediate—will follow a path on the
Roscoe surface, and end at the critical state line at failure. The Roscoe surface is shown in
Fig. 2.33.

Overconsolidated clays

For a normally consolidated clay, there is a unique relationship between the speciﬁc vol-
ume and the effective stress, deﬁned by the normal consolidation line in the υ–p
plane.
For an overconsolidated clay, there may be a range of voids ratios for a given effective
stress, depending on the preconsolidation stress from which the material was unloaded.
This means that whereas an undrained test on a normally consolidated material traverses
a unique path in the υ–p
–q space if the starting speciﬁc volume is given, there will be a
range of possible paths for an overconsolidated material.

(cid:2)

(cid:2)

(cid:2)

We now imagine that we do a series of undrained tests on a clay, for a given speciﬁc
volume, but start at different effective hydrostatic stress levels, corresponding to different
overconsolidation ratios. Fig. 2.34 shows the (idealized) results of these tests, projected
onto the q–p
plane. A slightly overconsolidated material moves more or less vertically
until it reaches the Roscoe surface, and then follows this surface until it reaches the critical
state. (The curve is initially vertical only to the extent that the Skempton B coefﬁcient is
close to 1, otherwise the curve tilts slightly to the right; see Section 1.6.5.) For strongly
overconsolidated specimens the movement is again vertical in the initial phases of the ex-
periment. The path does not reach the Roscoe surface, but changes direction upon reaching
a limiting curve which like the Roscoe surface passes through the critical state. This lim-
iting curve is nearly a straight line. In the ﬁgure we have assumed that the sample can not
sustain tensile stresses, and the change on slope at low p

reﬂects this.

(cid:2)

If similar tests are done for the same material at various speciﬁc volumes, one will ﬁnd
that they map out a surface in the υ–p
–q space, the Hvorslev surface. This surface plays
a similar role for overconsolidated samples as the Roscoe surface does for normally (and
slightly over-) consolidated samples. It is a limiting surface for all stress paths, not only
undrained tests. The Hvorslev surface and the Roscoe surface are shown in Fig. 2.35. Note
that they are joined together at the critical state line.

(cid:2)

The behaviour of the material at the Hvorslev surface is less predictable than at the
Roscoe surface. If the material behaved uniformly, it would follow the Hvorslev surface up

to the critical state line. However, overconsolidated samples often behave in a non-uniform
way, due to localization effects such as the formation of shear bands, as discussed earlier
in this chapter. This means that different parts of the sample take different loads, and thus
the recorded behaviour is not indicative of the intrinsic material properties. As a result,
the sample does not end up at the ultimate critical state as it would have if it had behaved
uniformly.

2.8.3. Localization

Complete failure of a rock sample usually implies that the sample breaks up into several
pieces, and falls apart. This implies that the rock at some point in the failure process ceases

94

FAILURE MECHANICS

to behave as a homogeneous material even on the macroscopic scale. It also implies that
failure is complete only within a few restricted areas of the rock sample, like fracture planes
developed under tensile failure, and narrow shear bands developed under shear failure.

The formation and growth of localized failure zones occurs when it is energetically
favourable for cracks or other (preexisting or randomly induced) defects to grow and in-
teract with nearby defects. For tensile failure and unconﬁned shear failure this is usually
an unstable situation that rapidly leads to macroscopic failure of the sample. However, for
failure under compressive stresses, the situation may lead to non-uniform deformation in a
planar band within the sample, while the deformation outside the band remains homoge-
neous, and the material remains stable.

Rudnicki and Rice (1975) described the conditions for localization of deformation into
planar bands. The formation of such bands can be considered as a constitutive instability,
closely linked to the plastic hardening of the material. It is found that for a material obeying
associated plastic ﬂow (see Section 2.8.1) the formation of shear bands can only occur after
the peak stress point. For materials obeying non-associated plastic ﬂow, such bands may
also be formed prior to the peak stress point, at least for stress conﬁgurations close to pure
shear.

At lower stress levels, the rock sample is supposed to follow one unique path of uniform
deformation. When the conditions for the formation of a localized deformation band are
fulﬁlled, there are at least two possible orientations of the band. Thus, further deformation
of the rock sample will follow one out of several equivalent paths. This spontaneous split-
ting of the deformation path is called bifurcation, and the point where the conditions for
localized deformation are ﬁrst fulﬁlled is called the bifurcation point (see Vardoulakis and
Sulem, 1995).

Other forms of non-uniform deformation are also possible, for instance surface buckling
(Biot, 1965; Vardoulakis, 1984) which implies that the material spontaneously changes
its shape when the conditions for such deformation are fulﬁlled. It has been demonstrated
(Mollema and Antonellini, 1996; Olsson, 1999; Olsson and Holcomb, 2000) that also com-
paction can be localized, in so-called compaction bands. Such bands may act as barriers
for ﬂuid ﬂow, and may therefore be of importance under given conditions, by changing
ﬂow paths or altering pore pressure gradients and thereby also the effective stresses. (See
also Borja and Aydin, 2004; Fossen et al., 2007.)

2.8.4. Liquefaction

Failure of a highly porous rock results in a volume reduction and a corresponding reduction
in the pore space. If the rock fails under undrained conditions, the pore space reduction will
lead to increasing pore pressure. This implies reduced effective stresses and a correspond-
ing reduction in conﬁnement. For a poorly consolidated (or previously damaged) rock, this
is a highly unstable condition that may result in very large deformations driven by the static
shear stresses.

This extreme condition is called liquefaction. It is sometimes observed in connection to
earthquakes, and is highly noticeable due to its sudden appearance and quick development,
and the large distance the liqueﬁed material may move (see for instance Kramer, 1996).

FAILURE OF ANISOTROPIC AND FRACTURED ROCKS

95

2.9. Failure of anisotropic and fractured rocks

In the discussion so far, it has been assumed that the material properties are isotropic, so
that the strength is independent of the orientation of the applied stresses. In reality this may
not be the case. Isotropy is often assumed just for simplicity.

We shall here distinguish between intrinsic anisotropy and structural anisotropy. Intrin-
sic anisotropy implies that an otherwise homogeneous material have different mechanical
properties in different directions. Structural anisotropy is associated with localized discon-
tinuities like planes of weakness or fractures.

2.9.1. Intrinsic anisotropy and the failure surface

For isotropic materials the principal axes of strain and the principal axes of stress coin-
cide. For anisotropic materials this is not the case in general. Still it is possible, at least in
principle, to determine a failure surface in stress space, by performing experiments along
different stress paths. However, such a failure surface will depend on the orientation of the
anisotropic material relative to the principal stress axes. There is no longer a unique failure
surface that characterizes the material behaviour. The concept of a failure surface is thus
less convenient for visualizing failure properties.

2.9.2. The plane of weakness model

The plane of weakness model is a simple approach to strength anisotropy. The model as-
sumes that the inherent strength is the same in all directions, except for one set of parallel
planes where the strength is lower. Since the bedding planes in sedimentary rocks may be
planes of weakness, the model has a physical basis, and it is therefore quite important in
spite of its simplicity. Obviously the model also applies to a set of parallel fracture planes.
Assume that we run a series of triaxial tests on a material with a set of parallel planes
of weakness. According to Mohr–Coulomb-type failure criteria, it is clear that the weak
planes have no effect on strength if we choose the axis of the plug normal to or parallel to
the planes, since we have no shear stress on the weak planes in these cases. (Remember
though, that the assumption of shear failure may not be correct—see the discussion of
uniaxial compressive and tensile strength in Section 2.3.2.) It is also clear that for some
intermediate orientations, we expect the weak planes to fail at a lower stress than expected
for the intact material.

Consider a τ –σ

-plot for this material, as illustrated in Fig. 2.36. The material has two
failure criteria—one ordinary, isotropic criterion and one for the weak planes—and corre-
spondingly two failure lines. The weak plane criterion is given by the cohesion S0w and
the friction angle ϕw. The corresponding failure angle is given as

(cid:2)

βw = π

+ ϕw

(2.80)

If the stress state in the rock sample is such that the Mohr circle touches the failure line for
the weak planes, as shown in Fig. 2.36, the material will fail only if the sample is oriented

such that the angle θ between the major principal stress and the normal to the weak planes
(cid:2)
is equal to βw. If the sample has a different orientation, it can take a higher value for σ
1
and a correspondingly higher shear stress. The situation is then as shown in Fig. 2.37,
where the Mohr circle intersects the weak plane failure line in two points. At this stress
level, the sample will fail only if θ = β1 or θ = β2. For any orientation within the range
β1 < θ < β2 the sample will have failed along the weak planes at a lower stress level.

Finally, if the stress state is such that the Mohr circle touches the failure line for the
isotropic criterion, as shown in Fig. 2.38, the sample will fail for any orientation of the
weak planes—except for orientations where βmin < θ < βmax, in which case the sample
will already have failed along the weak planes at a lower stress level.

The criterion that predicts the lowest strength for a given orientation θ is always the relevant
criterion. Fig. 2.39 illustrates how the strength varies with the orientation of the sample for
such a material.

Note that for a general, three dimensional stress state, the shear and normal stresses
over the weak planes are given by Eqs. (1.36)–(1.37), and the weak plane failure criterion
becomes much more complicated.

More advanced theories may be developed by allowing cohesion and friction angle to
vary as function of orientation. Such theories will predict a smoother dependence on orien-
tation. A more empirical approach to the problem was given by Hoek and Brown (1980).

2.9.3. Fractured rock

The behaviour of a fractured rock depends both on the properties of the fractures and on
the properties of the intact rock. Generally, fractured rocks will be much weaker than the
corresponding intact rock, as the resistance against shear failure is considerably less for an
already existing fracture.

To predict the behaviour of a fractured rock it may be necessary to apply numerical
simulation methods to the actual fracture system. Alternatively, effective rock properties
may be assigned to a representative volume that is much larger than the fracture spacing.

compressive strength of the fractured rock is given by

(cid:29)

(cid:29)

C0f =

(2.84)
Obviously, s = 1 for intact rock, so that 1 − s represents the degree of fracturing. A com-
parison of the Hoek–Brown criterion to the Mohr–Coulomb criterion (Eq. (2.22)) indicates
that mb has some relation to the internal friction (see Eqs. (2.13) and (2.8)), however there
is no direct correspondence between Eqs. (2.83) and (2.22).

sC2

A typical application of this criterion implies that a value (mi) is determined for mb by
a set of triaxial tests on intact parts of the rock, while s is estimated by visual inspection,
following a speciﬁc characterization scheme (Hoek and Brown, 1997). The actual value of
mb is obtained as

mb ≈ mis0.321

where s → 0 and a → 0.65. Note that Eq. (2.86) is identical to Eq. (2.83) when a = 0.5.

STRESS HISTORY EFFECTS

2.10. Stress history effects

99

In our discussion of failure we have in this chapter mostly assumed that the rock will fail
when it has been brought to a stress state that fulﬁls a failure criterion, regardless how it
was brought to this state. We have seen, however, that the yield surface may move as a
result of plastic deformation (Section 2.8.1), and that the presence of fractures—that may
be the result of previous loads—reduces the strength of the rock (Section 2.9.3). It was also
described in Section 1.9.2 that creep may eventually lead to failure. These examples tell us
that not only the current stress state, but also the stress history may have an effect on rock
failure.

2.10.1. Rate effects and delayed failure

It was shown in Section 1.9.2 that a rock may deform continuously under a constant shear
load. The effect is more signiﬁcant the closer the actual load is to the shear strength of the
rock.

Consider a rock sample that has been tested in a standard triaxial test (Fig. 2.40a). In
a second test on an identical sample, we stop loading at some level (A) before the peak
stress of the standard test is reached, and maintain the stress at this level. When the stress
reached level A, the rock may already have suffered some damage, so that on a microscopic
scale some parts of the rock are intact while other parts are not. While the stress is kept
constant the rock creeps, and the increasing shear deformation implies that the shear load
on the intact parts of the rock increases, and the areas of failure are growing. Thus, parts
of the deformation and corresponding damage that occurred at stress levels above A in the
standard test occurs while the stress is maintained at A in the second test, only delayed.

When the loading is stopped at a relatively low level, like A, the creeping process
declines and eventually stops after a limited amount of delayed deformation. For a sample
that is brought to a sufﬁciently high stress level (like B, Fig. 2.40a) before the loading is

100

FAILURE MECHANICS

stopped, the creeping process is unstable and it will after a while accelerate and result in
failure (accelerating creep, see Section 1.9).

The fact that all of the damage that may occur at a given stress level does not occur
immediately, points directly to an effect of loading rate on rock strength. Clearly, if the
rock is loaded at a lower rate, more damage may occur per unit of stress increase, and the
rock will essentially be weaker (Fig. 2.40b).

Note that effects of loading rate may also be seen in hydrostatic loading, even if creep is
primarily thought to be related to shear deformation. This can be ascribed to local ﬂuctua-
tions in the stresses that will occur in a heterogeneous material like a porous rock.

2.10.2. Fatigue

Excessive deformation at a limited stress level, as described in the previous paragraph, may
be provoked and accelerated if the stress is released and reapplied over and over again. For
each unloading-reloading cycle a little more damage is added, and the rock sample deforms
correspondingly. Eventually, the rock may be destroyed by fatigue failure. The number of
cycles required to bring a rock to failure increases dramatically if the peak stress level for
the loading cycles is reduced.

If the peak stress of the loading cycles is kept sufﬁciently low, the rock may not fail
even after a very large number of cycles. Still, the cyclic loading may have affected the
strength of the rock, so that in a subsequent failure test the rock will fail at a stress level
different from its normal strength. Typically, cyclic loading will reduce the strength of a
rock sample, however increased strength due to cyclic loading is also reported (Ray et al.,
1999).

Geological aspects of petroleum related rock mechanics

From a practical rock mechanics view point, the present state of a rock and its present
mechanical properties are of interest. The long and in many cases complicated process
from an initial state as a loose sediment to the present state as a rock will however clearly
affect rock mechanical behaviour.

A sedimentary basin may be exposed to sedimentary subsidence, sea-level changes and
tectonic forces creating repeated cycles of elevation and depression, in addition to erosion,
changes in sedimentary environment, changes in sedimentation rate, solution and precipita-
tion of cementing material etc. All these effects will complicate the geological description
of the sedimentary basin. These geological activities and events will affect not only current
rock mechanical properties, but also current boundary conditions in terms of in situ stresses
and pore pressure.

Therefore, knowledge of geological processes is valuable in rock engineering. Although
on a totally different time scale and length scale, geological processes are often comparable
with events in rock mechanics laboratory testing, which means that such tests may be used
to enhance our understanding of geological phenomena.

The purpose of this chapter is to give an introduction to geological aspects which are of

particular importance in petroleum related rock mechanics.

3.1. Underground stresses

Normally, an underground formation has to carry the weight of the overlying formations.
The vertical stress at the bottom of a homogeneous column of height z is σv = ρgz, where
ρ is the density of the material and g is the acceleration of gravity. If the density varies
with depth, the vertical stress at depth D becomes

Note that the z-axis is here pointing vertically downwards, with z = 0 corresponding
to the Earth surface. The average density of sediments in the overburden is between 1.8

20 MPa/km (typically 1 psi/ft).

The pore ﬂuid density in case of brine with sea water salinity is in the range 1.03–

v, is then also increasing with approximately 10 MPa/km.
The effective vertical stress, σ
In many important cases, however, the pore pressure deviates from the normal value pfn.
We will return to these so-called abnormal pore pressures and their possible origins in
Section 3.2.

The underground stress state consists of the three mutually orthogonal principal stresses,
plus the pore pressure. It is very common (and convenient) in the oil industry to assume
that the vertical stress is a principal stress. This is reasonable at large depth within a homo-
geneous Earth, in areas that have not been exposed to tectonic activity or are relaxed in the
sense that there are no remnant stresses from previous tectonic activity. The vertical stress
is governed by gravity, which has a unique direction, pointing towards the centre of the
Earth. So it is not unreasonable to assume that the vertical is a principal stress direction.
Let us however be aware that there will be cases when this is not fulﬁlled, such as near
the surface: Because the surface is stress free, the principal stress directions at and near it
will be governed by the surface topography. In the case of a strongly sloping surface, even
at depth, the principal stress directions may be far from the vertical-horizontal directions.
Also, near heterogeneities such as inclusions or faults, near underground openings such as
boreholes (Chapter 4), or near depleting reservoirs (Chapter 12), principal stress directions
will differ from the vertical–horizontal orientation.

Below we will consider the vertical stress as a principal stress. To begin with, assume
a relaxed area where the horizontal stress is induced simply as a result of the vertical
stress. For simplicity, think of a ﬂuid: The overburden causes a vertical stress (pressure) in
the ﬂuid, but at the same time an equal horizontal stress (pressure). In a rock, the ability
to resist shear stresses causes the horizontal stress σh in general to be different from the
vertical stress. We write (in terms of effective stresses):

The ratio K
between the effective horizontal and effective vertical stress may vary signiﬁ-
cantly. At shallow depths (0–150 m) it may vary from 1 to 10 or even higher, while values
from 0.2 to 1.5 may be found at larger depths. Bjørlykke and Høeg (1997) pointed out that
chemical compaction increases in importance at depths below 2–3 km, and will contribute
to horizontal stresses by altering the trend seen from pure mechanical compaction above
this level.
(cid:2) → 1, so that the stress state becomes hydro-
static, with the magnitude given by the weight of the overburden according to Eq. (3.1).
This is called Heim’s rule, after work by the Swiss geologist Albert Heim in the nineteenth
century. Heim suggested that the mechanism causing this development is creep. This state
of stress is referred to as lithostatic.1

It has been suggested that, with time, K

1 In the literature, the term lithostatic stress is sometimes deﬁned as the vertical stress being given by Eq. (3.1),
without reference to the horizontal stresses. In this book, we follow Jaeger and Cook (1979), Engelder (1993) and
others, and take lithostatic to imply that the stress state is also hydrostatic.

UNDERGROUND STRESSES

105

The transition toward lithostacy is normally a very slow process, and the lithostatic state
of stress is rare in the lithosphere (Engelder, 1993). Some examples of underground stress
illustrating non-lithostatic stress states are shown in Figs. 3.1, 3.12 and 9.10.

The idea that creep brings the stress state towards lithostacy is however considered
sound, and it is therefore not likely to ﬁnd a general rule for predicting horizontal stress
at depth, unless very sophisticated models taking long-time stress history into account are
developed.

We now consider two very simple models for estimating the in situ stress state. First,
assume that the formation under consideration is laterally constrained; i.e. there is no
horizontal strain under the process of rock formation. Furthermore, we assume that the
rock during this process behaves according to the theory of linear elasticity. Then, from
Eqs. (1.102)–(1.103), with εx = εy = 0, one ﬁnds:
= νfr
1 − νfr
is given the name Ko. In a ﬂuid, where Poisson’s

In this particular case, the coefﬁcient K
ratio is 1/2, Ko = 1. For a rock with νfr = 1/3, Ko = 1/2.
There are many reasons to apply the relationship above with great care. We assumed
linear elasticity, and we assumed zero lateral movement. In reality we also assumed that
the elastic properties of the rock have been constant throughout the whole process of rock
formation. This is clearly not true. An approach based on a complete stress history analy-
sis was presented by Warpinski (1989), incorporating variations in mechanical properties
over time. Consolidation, diagenesis, changes in pore pressure due to gas generation, tem-
perature gradients, and various tectonic and thermal episodes may be incorporated in this
model. Viscoelasticity appeared, for the cases studied, to be more relevant for stresses in
shale than in sandstone.

(3.4)

(cid:2)

Another simple approach is to say that the rock has been, and still is, in a critical state
within the Earth, i.e. it should obey some kind of a failure criterion. Leaning on ideas of
self-organized criticality (see e.g. the book by Bak, 1996), this may be a reasonable as-
sumption, in particular in areas of active tectonics. Choosing the Mohr–Coulomb criterion
Eqs. (2.18) or (2.22) as criterion for active faulting, the ratio between the minimum and
the maximum effective stress should be (for the case when the unconﬁned strength C0 is
negligible)

These are very simple examples of models for horizontal stress estimation. In reality,
as mentioned above, horizontal stresses are difﬁcult to assess from mathematical models.

GEOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF PETROLEUM RELATED ROCK MECHANICS

Fig. 3.1. Stresses versus depth: Vertical stress (from Eq. (3.1) with density 2.1 g/cm3, full line), horizontal
stress (from Eqs. (3.7) and (3.8), dashed line), and pore pressure (from Eq. (3.2) with ﬂuid density 1.05 g/cm3,
dotted line).

The most direct method of obtaining horizontal stress is to measure it, for instance by a
fracturing test of the formation (see Sections 8.3 and 11.5).

Breckels and van Eekelen (1982) used fracturing data from whole regions, and derived
relationships between horizontal stress and depth. They also accounted for possibly ab-
normal pore pressures. For the US Gulf Coast, Breckels and van Eekelen presented the
following relations:

σh = 0.0053D1.145 + 0.46(pf − pfn)
σh = 0.0264D − 31.7 + 0.46(pf − pfn)

(D < 3500 m)

(D > 3500 m)

(3.7)

(3.8)

where D is depth in metres, pf is the pore pressure in MPa, pfn is the normal pore pressure
(corresponding to a gradient of 10.5 MPa/km) and σh is the smallest horizontal stress
in MPa. Note that these relations were developed at zero or shallow water depths (see also
Section 8.3).

The predicted horizontal stress from Breckels and van Eekelen’s relationship is shown
in Fig. 3.1 together with trends for vertical stress and normal pore pressure (from Eqs. (3.1)
and (3.2), using constant densities for rock and pore ﬂuid).

The Gulf Coast curve (Eqs. (3.7) and (3.8)) may be used with a fair degree of conﬁdence

also in other tectonically relaxed areas such as the North Sea.

The principal horizontal stresses are in general not equal, contrary to what has been
anticipated in Eqs. (3.3)–(3.8). We will in the continuation refer to the maximum horizontal
stress as σH and the minimum horizontal stress as σh. The main reason for horizontal stress
anisotropy is tectonic stresses. The terms tectonic activity and tectonic stresses relate back
to the theory of tectonophysics. The Earth’s crust consists of a number of discrete tectonic
plates. These are extensive (a few hundred to thousands of kilometres across) but thin (15–
200 km thick) plates that move about the Earth’s surface as rigid bodies. Fig. 3.2 shows
two types of plate boundaries: spreading ridge (two plates moving away from each other)

UNDERGROUND STRESSES

and subduction zone (two plates moving toward each other and one plate subducts under
the other).

A third type of plate boundary is a transform fault, where two plates slide past each
other. Extensive deformation (faulting, earthquakes) occurs along plate boundaries where
the plates interact. Tectonic activity refers to all forms of breaking and bending in this outer
layer of the Earth. A tectonic stress component in one direction may also be accompanied
by stress components in other directions. Consider for example a situation where there is
(cid:2)
a tectonic stress σ

direction (εy = 0), and no vertical restriction, the accompanying stresses σ

would become (according to linear elastic theory, Eqs. (1.102)–(1.104)):

The total stresses in the region are then given by superimposing these stresses on the
stresses given in Eqs. (3.1) and (3.4). Previous tectonic activity and associated effects are
thus of major concern when discussing underground stresses, as both magnitudes and prin-
cipal directions are affected.

Fig. 3.3 shows a stress map of the North Sea region, where principal stress orientations
obtained from various techniques (primarily earthquake focal mechanisms and borehole
breakouts; see Section 8.3.2) are indicated. More detailed maps and maps of other geo-
graphical areas can be found at http://www.world-stress-map.org.

As mentioned above, the horizontal stresses may become very large at shallow depths.
This may be because of residual stresses originating in the previous history of the rock or
structural stresses (caused by large scale inhomogeneities).

An example of how residual stresses may originate is illustrated in Fig. 3.4. This ﬁgure
shows how relative block movement exposes one block to erosion. The uplifted block will
now, at the same depth as the neighbouring block, have a different stress history. If erosion
takes place relatively rapidly, the higher stresses which existed previously will not decay as
rapidly as the erosion takes place. If the rock behaves as a viscoelastic material, the stresses
will at some stage die away. If the rock yields however, the stresses may not relax back to
normal stresses at that depth.

The maximum stress a rock has ever been exposed to is often referred to as the pa-
leostress. In soil mechanics (Section 2.8.2), the term preconsolidation stress is used. The
uplifted and unloaded block in Fig. 3.4 has previously experienced higher effective stresses.
Such a sediment is in soil mechanics said to be overconsolidated (Section 2.8.2). Examples
of structural stresses are stress ﬁelds below slopes or mountains. The structural inhomo-
geneities affect both stress magnitudes and directions.

The Ekoﬁsk ﬁeld in the North Sea provides a good example of how geological events
can explain the present state of stress. Ekoﬁsk is the largest of several chalk reservoirs in
the southern part of the Norwegian sector of the North Sea. The chalks are of Maastrichtian
(Upper Cretaceous) and Danian (Lower Tertiary) age, and the ﬁeld has a dome-like struc-
ture of elliptical shape. The chalk has a relatively high porosity (around 30% average), but

a low matrix permeability (around 1 milliDarcy). The reservoir is however highly frac-
tured, providing a much (around two orders of magnitude) higher reservoir permeability.
This fracturing is believed to be a result of stresses induced by the growth of an underly-
ing salt dome (Byrd, 1975). Teufel and Farrell (1990) presented results from in situ stress
measurements in the Ekoﬁsk ﬁeld. The stress measurements were made using hydraulic
fracturing and anelastic strain recovery (ASR) of oriented cores (more about this technique
in Section 7.4).

Fig. 3.5 shows the azimuth of the maximum horizontal stress determined from ASR.
On the crest the maximum horizontal stress tends to be oriented sub-parallel to the long
axis of the ellipse, while on the ﬂanks the maximum horizontal stress tends to be oriented
perpendicular to the structural contours of the dome. Teufel and Farrell also looked at the
distribution of natural fractures and found that a radial fracture pattern existed, aligned
closely with the direction of the maximum horizontal stress on the ﬂanks of the structure.
Teufel and Farrell assumed the principal stress directions to lie in the horizontal and ver-
tical planes. This is a reasonable assumption, since the areal extent of the dome is large
compared to its curvature.

Since the structure of the ﬁeld obviously affects the horizontal stress directions, it is
however reasonable to infer that principal stress directions will not be completely horizon-
tal and vertical at all locations. Rather, they will tend to have one principal direction normal
to the dome surface. This implies that on the crest, principal stress directions are likely to
be vertical and horizontal, while they will become tilted on the ﬂanks of the dome.

There is a close relationship between structural geology and rock mechanics. Rock
mechanics laboratory experiments permit us to study processes in small scale which are
similar to those of the large scale of structural geology. For instance, a brittle shear failure
in a laboratory specimen is a miniature analogue of a fault. Faults are by deﬁnition shear
fractures with relative displacement along the plane of the fracture. The surface of the frac-
ture is the fault plane, which can be described by its dip and strike; see Fig. 3.6. Strike
is deﬁned by a horizontal line formed by intersection of a horizontal plane and the tilted
layer, and is given in degrees relative to a compass direction. The dip-angle is the angle
between the tilted layer and a horizontal plane. Brittle behaviour leading to fault formation
is characteristic of rocks subjected to low conﬁning pressure, i.e. in some respect close to
the surface of the Earth.

UNDERGROUND STRESSES

Fig. 3.7. Illustration of fault types.

An extensional, brittle failure in a laboratory test produces a miniature joint. A joint is
characterized by no displacement along (parallel to) the fracture plane. The rock on each
side of the tensile fracture is moved apart, perpendicular to the failure plane.

The various types of faults can be classiﬁed (Anderson, 1951; Twiss and Moores, 1992)
according to well-known theories of shear failure (e.g. Mohr–Coulomb). According to
these theories, fracturing will take place in one or both pairs of conjugate planes which
are parallel to the direction of the intermediate principal stress, and are both at equal an-
gles of less than 45° to the direction of the maximum principal stress. Some of the most
common types of faulting are illustrated in Fig. 3.7, assuming that one principal direction
is vertical.

Normal faulting occurs when the maximum principal stress (σ1) is vertical, and the dip is
hence larger than 45° (usually around 60°). If the minimum principal stress (σ3) is vertical,
the hanging wall is moving upwards, the dip is less than 45° (usually around 30°), and a
thrust fault is formed. Thrust faults with very shallow dips (less than 10°) are also called

overthrusts. If the intermediate principal stress (σ2) is vertical, vertical failure planes are
created. This is referred to as strike-slip faulting.

With reference to Fig. 3.7, ψ is the angle between the maximum principal stress and the

failure plane. This angle is then related to the failure angle, β, such that (see Fig. 3.8):

ψ = π/2 − β

(3.11)

Laboratory testing of sand and sandstone commonly yield values of the failure angle in the
range 55°–70°, corresponding to ψ values in the range 35°–20°. According to the Mohr–
Coulomb failure criterion (see Section 2.3.1), shear fracturing will take place when:

(cid:2)

= C0 + σ

(cid:2)

(3.12)

where C0 is the unconﬁned (uniaxial compressive) strength of the rock.

The type of fault is dependent on the relative values of the principal stresses. Whether
faulting will take place, and at what angle, is however also dependent on the failure para-
meters of the rock.

To illustrate this further, let us consider some simple examples, using the Mohr–

Coulomb criterion for shear fracturing.
Consider an unconsolidated sand with zero unconﬁned strength (typical of shallow
sediments). A typical failure angle of the sand is 60°, corresponding to ψ = 30°. The
Mohr–Coulomb criterion in this case (note the use of effective stresses) reduces to:

(3.13)

We assume principal stresses to be vertical and horizontal, with the total vertical stress
equal to ρgz. If the vertical stress is the largest principal stress (see Fig. 3.9a), the effective
horizontal stress must be as low as one third of the effective vertical stress in order for
normal faulting to occur. For thrust faulting, the effective horizontal stress must be 3 times
larger than the effective vertical stress (see Fig. 3.9b). For strike-slip faulting, the vertical is

the intermediate principal stress. The two horizontal stresses are limited as follows: If the
maximum horizontal stress is equal to the vertical, then the minimum effective horizontal
= (ρgz − pf)/3. If the minimum horizontal stress equals the vertical,
stress must be σ
then the maximum effective horizontal stress must be σ

= 3(ρgz − pf).

There are however also examples of faults which can not directly be identiﬁed from the
three types shown in Fig. 3.7. One such example is a so-called oblique slip, where there
is both vertical and horizontal movement; see Fig. 3.10. The most obvious reason for this
fault direction is that the principal stresses are not aligned vertically and horizontally. In
a formation which has not been fractured by previous tectonic activity, the fault direction
is mainly controlled by principal stress directions. The fault direction may however be
disturbed if the rock has been fractured previously. Fault movement can then be partly
controlled by the previous fault direction and partly by present principal stress directions.
Complex fracture systems are generated in this way.

Rocks buried deep in the Earth, at high conﬁning stress and high temperature, tend to
exhibit a more ductile behaviour when exceeding the elastic limit. This plastic ﬂow can
involve both change in shape and in volume. This may result in folding of the rock, see
Fig. 3.11.

114

GEOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF PETROLEUM RELATED ROCK MECHANICS

Available techniques for measurement and estimation of in situ stress directions and
magnitudes are discussed further in Section 8.3 The most direct measurements are those
involving hydraulic fracturing, where detection of fracture closure pressure yields informa-
tion about stress magnitudes. Borehole imaging and/or borehole shape measurements (by
e.g. a 4-arm caliper) may reveal information about fracture or drilling-induced breakout
directions, and hence stress directions (Section 8.3). There is also a number of core based
techniques (anelastic strain recovery, wave velocity anisotropy, differential strain or wave
velocity analysis, acoustic emission) that can be related to stress magnitudes and direc-
tions (Section 7.4). For large scale stress ﬁelds, earthquake focal mechanisms represent a
valuable source of information.

3.2. Pore pressure

Pore pressure is an important parameter in any rock mechanics study of porous, ﬂuid-ﬁlled
rock systems. The pore ﬂuid will carry part of the total stresses applied to the system,
thus relieving the rock matrix from part of the load. The effective stress as deﬁned by
Terzaghi is equal to the total stress minus the pore pressure. This effective stress concept
was introduced in soil mechanics in 1923 on an empirical basis. It has later been reﬁned
by Biot; see Section 1.6 for further details.

There is overwhelming evidence that porous, saturated and permeable rocks obey an
effective stress law. Both strain, given by the stress–strain relationship (constitutive equa-
tion), and yield or failure of the rock is controlled by effective rather than total stresses.

Therefore, when studying borehole stability during drilling, rock stability during produc-
tion, and compaction/subsidence, knowledge of the pore pressure in the various formations
is extremely important.

Pore pressure will develop in a saturated formation as sediments are buried. If the pore
ﬂuid can escape and migrate to the surface at about the same rate as the rate of compaction,
a normal pore pressure gradient is maintained, given by the weight of the ﬂuid column
above (Eq. (3.2)).

There are however several cases where the pore pressure within a zone has a value dif-
ferent from the expected normal pore pressure. Usually the pore pressure will in such cases
be higher than the normal, and the zone is referred to as abnormally pressured or overpres-
sured. High pore pressures in a reservoir will of course make the ﬁeld more proliﬁc. On the

PORE PRESSURE

115

other hand, overpressured formations are a potential hazard during drilling. Furthermore,
borehole stability problems are often encountered in overpressured shales.

Brieﬂy stated, abnormal pore pressure (overpressure) has three main causes (Osborne

and Swarbrick, 1997; Yassir and Addis, 2002):

1. The rate of sedimentation and compaction being higher than the rate of ﬂuid expul-

sion and migration (disequilibrium compaction; undercompaction).

2. Tectonic loading that leads to undrained shear stress with associated pore pressure

development.

3. Pore ﬂuid generation or expansion by thermal or chemical processes.

Due to the low permeability of compacted clays, shaly zones can easily become overpres-
sured. Shale permeabilities are typically in the nanoDarcy range, but may be even lower
(Swan et al., 1989; Chenevert and Sharma, 1991; Katsube et al., 1991; van Oort et al.,
1996; and others). Actually, laboratory measurements representative of in situ shale per-
meability are very scarce, because of the experimental difﬁculties involved in measuring
such low permeabilities, and because shale cores when retrieved from depth are altered in
such a way that the permeability is likely to be overestimated from experiment. Anyway,
shale permeability is low enough that a thick shale formation may not be able to expel ﬂuid
at the same rate as it is compacted. Sands which are embedded within such shale bodies
are also likely to become overpressured.

Rapid sedimentation is obviously another possible reason for the development of over-
pressures. Abnormal pressures generated by disequilibrium compaction tend to decline in
the course of geologic time. As pointed out by Osborne and Swarbrick (1997) this may
explain why overpressure is more common in Tertiary than Paleozoic sequences.

As an example, consider a shale with a permeability of 10 picoDarcy (0.01 nanoDarcy),
porosity of 25%, and uniaxial compaction modulus of 3 GPa, saturated with a brine of bulk
modulus 2.5 GPa and viscosity 1 cP. The characteristic diffusion time will be l2
D/CD, where
CD is the diffusion constant given by Eq. (1.244) and lD is the characteristic diffusion
length, say the thickness of the shale layer. The characteristic time for establishment of
pore pressure equilibrium in a 100 m thick shale layer using these values turns out to be
about 30 million years, which is on the geological time scale. Osborne and Swarbrick
(1997) suggested that disequilibrium compaction is the primary mechanism responsible
for overpressure in shale sequences.

As pointed out by Yassir and Addis (2002), there is a strong correlation between oc-
currence of overpressure and compressional tectonics. According to Eq. (1.186) pore
pressure will increase with increasing shear stress, in a manner proportional to Skemp-
ton’s A-parameter. Consider as an example a situation where the horizontal stress σH is the
major and the vertical stress (given by the weight of the overburden) is the minor principal
stress. Keeping σv constant during tectonic activity, the pore pressure change is

pf = ABσH

(3.14)

For normal consolidation processes, A may exceed 1, while B is close to 1, leading to
very high pore pressure, possibly exceeding the vertical stress. In overconsolidated or well
cemented low porosity rock on the other hand, shear loading is associated with dilatancy,

116

GEOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF PETROLEUM RELATED ROCK MECHANICS

leading to pore pressure reduction. This mechanism is therefore expected to cause abnor-
mally high pore pressure preferably in young sediments. Note that tectonic activity (e.g.
salt tectonics) will result in sustained abnormal pore pressure only if the system remains
closed and does not fracture.

Another possible source of overpressure is the uplift-erosion process shown in Fig. 3.4.
If the rock maintains its pore pressure after the uplift, it will be abnormally pressurized
compared with its neighbouring formations at the same depth. Often, however, faulting
is associated both with tectonic and uplift processes, and in such cases the pore pressure
build-up would be only transient.

As mentioned above, generation or expansion of pore ﬂuid may lead to overpressure,
primarily in shale sections. This may be a result of increase in temperature (aquathermal
pressuring). It may be caused by hydrocarbon (kerogen or gas) generation. It may also
be caused by free water released during transformation of montmorillonite to illite. This
transition is temperature dependent, requiring temperatures of 70–90°C, corresponding to
depths of 2–3 km in areas of average geothermal gradient.

When the pore pressure increases due to ﬂuid expansion/generation, there will be an
associated horizontal stress increase. The relation between horizontal stress and pore pres-
sure is hence not unique, but depends on the overpressure mechanism (Yassir and Addis,
2002).

Yet another class of mechanisms is associated with ﬂuid movement caused by e.g. den-
sity differences between liquids and gases, or possibly by osmotic potentials. There is
however no evidence that these mechanisms play any signiﬁcant role in practice.

Fig. 3.12 presents typical pore pressure gradient curves from two North Sea ﬁelds, the
Gullfaks ﬁeld and the Valhall ﬁeld. Valhall is a chalk reservoir (Cretaceous) in the Ekoﬁsk
area of the Norwegian sector of the North Sea. Gullfaks is a sandstone reservoir (Jurassic),
located further north. Both parts of Fig. 3.12 include the estimated fracture pressure, taken
from leak-off and mini-frac tests (see Section 8.3). The Valhall ﬁeld is characterized by a
high initial pore pressure. Close to the top of the reservoir at 2500 m, the pore pressure
is about 44.7 MPa. The overburden gradient is not included for the Valhall ﬁeld, but at
this depth the total vertical stress is approximately 49 MPa, which makes the difference
between the overburden stress and the pore pressure quite small. Thus, the effective vertical
stress is very low.

In such a situation, the net grain-to-grain stress is small, and unless the strength of the
cement between the grains is signiﬁcant, particles may easily be mobilized. Production
problems have been experienced in the North Sea chalk ﬁelds, materializing both as inﬂow
of solids and casing collapse (see Chapter 10 for analysis of particle production).

Both ﬁelds are characterized by a rapid increase of the pore pressure gradient just above
the reservoir (top of Gullfaks is at approximately 1850 m). This is relatively typical in
many of the North Sea reservoirs. The effective vertical stress in the Gullfaks ﬁeld is ap-
proximately 6 MPa.

Pore pressures above the reservoir, in the low-permeability zones, are normally esti-
mated from trendlines and deviations from expected trendlines in wireline log readings.
In many cases the accuracy of these methods is not good enough, and stability problems
during drilling may be a consequence (see also Chapter 9). In the reservoir, where the rock

has a higher permeability, more direct and accurate pore pressure measurement methods
can be applied, thus improving the quality of the estimates.

The mechanical properties of a rock normally refer to constants in the constitutive equa-
tion which the rock is assumed to obey. A linearly elastic and perfectly brittle isotropic
rock would hence be described by 4 mechanical parameters: two elastic parameters (e.g.
Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio; Section 1.3) and three strength parameters (e.g. fric-
tion angle and uniaxial compressive strength when applying the Mohr–Coulomb failure
criterion, plus the tensile strength; Chapter 2).

The present properties of a sedimentary rock are determined by the entire process from
erosion of rock fragments to transportation, deposition, compaction and lithiﬁcation. Some
knowledge of these processes is therefore valuable when trying to assess the mechanical
properties of a rock.

3.3.1. Grains and minerals

Some deﬁnitions related to grains and granular materials are appropriate at this stage:

Grain size is a measure of the diameter of the grain, see Table 3.1. According to this

classiﬁcation scheme, the grain size determines the classes of sedimentary rocks.

Grain shape involves both the roundness (angularity of corners) and sphericity (proximity

to a spherical shape).

Grain sorting is a measure of the range of grain sizes (grain size distribution). A rock
containing a wide range of grain sizes is said to be poorly sorted, whereas well sorted
implies a narrow distribution.

The packing of grains is important since it affects porosity and permeability. The packing
depends both on grain size, shape and sorting. Round grains will have a smaller friction
angle than the more angular grains at the same porosity. A poorly sorted sand will have a
higher friction angle than a well sorted sand.

There are several rock forming mineral groups: silicates (e.g. feldspar, clay, mica), car-

bonates (calcite, dolomite), oxides, sulphides, sulphates and phosphates.
The silicate group is the most important rock forming mineral group, making up more
−4
silicon tetrahe-
than 90% of the Earth’s crust. The basic unit of the silicates is the SiO
4
dron. The various structures are formed by linking tetrahedral units together by sharing
oxygen. Feldspar is the most important single silicate mineral. The three main groups of
feldspars are: potassium feldspars (KAlSi3O8), sodium feldspars (NaAlSi3O8) and cal-
cium feldspars (CaAl2Si2O8). These are formed by Al substituting for Si, thus allowing
additional or different cations to enter the structure.

Although chemically an oxide, silica (SiO2), is closely related to silicates. Quartz, which
is one of the minerals in the silica group, is the most common mineral in sandstone, ranging
from 65% to practically 100%. The feldspar content in sandstone is typically 10–15%, and
mica and clay minerals may also be found.

The most important minerals in shaly rocks are clay minerals, which are composed
of layers of sheet shaped crystals. Two basic structural units exist: One type of sheet is
built from silica tetrahedra linked together in a hexagonal structure with chemical formula
Si4O4−
4 . The second type is an octahedral sheet in which silicon is replaced by cations like
Al3+
(this sheet is named gibbsite, with basic formula Al2(OH)6), Mg2+
(named brucite;
Mg3(OH)6), Fe3+
, surrounded by six hydroxide groups. Within a given sheet, ions
different from the dominant ones may be present (isomorphic substitution), giving rise to

or Fe2+

SEDIMENTOLOGICAL ASPECTS

possible charge deﬁciency. Usually, mainly because of oxygen and hydroxide at the sur-
faces, these have negative excess charge, and will therefore attract cations.

The basic sheets are combined to form layered clay minerals. The most common groups
of clay minerals are kaolinite, illite, and smectite. Kaolinite is a two-layer mineral (often
referred to as a 1:1 layer silicate), consisting of alternate layers of gibbsite and silicon
tetrahedron sheet. A basic unit is 0.7 nm thick, while typical composite crystals may be
70–100 layers, have six-fold symmetry and are ﬂake shaped, up towards the micrometre
range in lateral extent. The successive layers are strongly bonded to each other with a
hydrogen bonding, and therefore water is not permitted to enter in between layers. Mineral
density is 2.6–2.7 g/cm3.

Smectite is a 2:1 layer mineral, composed of a central gibbsite sheet embedded between
two silicon tetrahedron sheet, with a combined thickness of about 1 nm. Isomorphous sub-
stitutions are common both within the central octahedral sheet and in the tetrahedral sheet.
The bonding between two silica sheet connecting the unit layers is very weak (through van
der Waals’ forces). In smectite, this permits water and exchangeable ions to enter between
the platelets, leading to a swelling capacity: At surface conditions, smectite minerals may
absorb up to 10 times their own weight in water (“swelling clays”). Calcium and sodium
are common ions in the interlayer space. Smectite crystals are normally not more than
2–5 nm thick in hydrated state, with an average diameter of about 1 µm. Normally, the
basal spacing is found to be near 1.5 nm, indicating that two monolayers of water are ac-
commodated within the mineral. The speciﬁc surface area associated with the interlayer
space is 500–700 m2/g. Mineral density varies between 2.0 and 2.6 g/cm3.

Montmorillonite is a name often used synonymously with smectite, or as a common
term for expandable clay minerals. In principle, this is a member of the smectite group
with geographical origin in Montmorillon, France. Another well-known smectitic clay is
Bentonite, from Wyoming in the USA. Vermiculite, which is hydrated muscovite (a mica
mineral), is also classiﬁed as smectite, but has much less swelling capacity than the clay
minerals mentioned above.

Illite is another 2:1 layer clay mineral, formed by weathering of feldspars, degradation
of muscovite, and transformation of smectite to illite at depth. Some of the silicon atoms
in smectite are replaced by aluminium, causing a negative charge which is balanced by
potassium ions that provide bonding between the silica tetrahedron sheet. This bond is
much stronger than in smectite, preventing hydration, but it is considerably weaker than in
kaolinite. The basal layer thickness of illite is 1 nm. Mineral density is 2.6–2.9 g/cm3.

The water near the surfaces of clay crystals is different from free water. This was sug-
gested by Derjaguin and Churayev (1971). Molecular dynamics simulations (e.g. Skipper
et al., 1991; Karaborni et al., 1996; Park and Sposito, 2002) show that bound water in the
intralayer space and adsorbed water on surfaces have ordered, crystal-like structures.

Chlorite is often also referred to as a clay mineral. It has a 2:1 sandwich structure, but
with an additional brucite-like (where the dominant ion may be magnesium, iron or nickel)
layer embedded between the tetrahedral layers. It has the characteristic ﬂake shape, but
does not have any swelling capacity. Density may be from 2.6 and up to 3.3 g/cm3.
The basic unit of carbonates is (CO3)2−
. Common carbonate minerals are calcite
(CaCO3), aragonite (which is a polymorph of calcite) and dolomite (CaMg(CO3)2). Calcite
is the main component of carbonate sediments (chalk, limestone).

3.3.2. Pre-deposition and deposition

Clastic sedimentary rocks originate from some sort of pre-existing rock. The pre-existing
rock is broken into fragments by weathering (mechanical and/or chemical) and erosion.
Then it is transported by water (rivers, tides) or wind to another site where it is deposited.
This accumulation of fragments from pre-existing rocks form what is called a clastic sedi-
ment. The most common types of clastic sediments are conglomerate, sandstone, siltstone
and shale. Other types of sediments are chemical sediments (e.g. precipitation of salt
crystals due to evaporation) and organic sediments (e.g. shells and skeletons from sea or-
ganisms forming a chalk or limestone). Note that for instance a limestone can be both
clastic and organic in origin.

Transport, deposition and sediment accumulation may take place in a variety of deposi-
tional environments. These various environments will give rise to different distributions of
grain size, grain shape etc., which may affect the mechanical properties of the rock millions
of years later. Particles may be transported by air (aeolian), water (ﬂuvial) or ice (glacial
transport). Deposition occurs if the particle ﬂow velocity is lower than a settling velocity,
being proportional to the square of particle size and the density contrast between particle
and suspending ﬂuid, and inversely proportional to ﬂuid viscosity.

When transported by air (aeolian transport), the particles have a very small buoyancy,
and the viscosity of the air is low. Particles transported by winds are therefore typically
more ﬁne-grained than particles transported by water.

In water, such as in a river or a marine environment, particles can be transported in sus-
pension (suspended load) or along the bottom (bed load). Sediments deposited in running
water are termed alluvial (poorly sorted, emerging from a high energy environment) or ﬂu-
vial (well sorted, low energy environment). As long as the concentration of particles in the
suspension is low, the water can be regarded as a Newtonian ﬂuid, obeying ordinary hy-
drodynamic laws. As the concentration increases, the properties of the suspension (density,
viscosity) will start to deviate signiﬁcantly from those of pure water. Such a suspension can
start to ﬂow as a heavy liquid due to the difference in density between the suspension and
the surrounding water. This is known as a turbidity current. This kind of sediment transport
is believed to be an important mechanism when considering transport of sediments from
deltas and shallow areas, down the continental shelf and into the deep oceans.

Grain ﬂow is another mechanism of sediment transport, resulting from grain collisions
that contribute to keep the grains from concentrating close to the bottom. Grain ﬂow will
have a low content of clay matrix material. As the contents of silt and clay increases, debris
ﬂow and eventually mudﬂow develops. Debris ﬂow and mudﬂow sediments are often very
poorly sorted.

In the shallow beach zone, deposition will often result in well sorted coarse-grained
rocks with high porosity. The grains will tend to be well rounded due to the constant action
of waves, currents and tides. Further down, the grain size decreases and the sorting is
poorer. Clastic deposits of terrestrial origin, resulting from stream transport into the sea,
can also be well sorted, but normally contain more clay than the beach deposits. The delta
is the zone where ﬂuvial and marine processes meet. If the marine activity is low, the
ﬂuvial depositions in the delta will be maintained. If the marine activity is high, however,
the deposits will eventually accumulate as a marine sediment. In a delta front deposit,

SEDIMENTOLOGICAL ASPECTS

121

fresh water, sea water and pore water from previous sediments meet. Water from these
different sources will be of completely different composition, and form an environment of
active precipitation and dissolution. This can lead to cementation (silica, carbonate) of the
sediment.

Although carbonate rocks can originate from clastic sediments, the primary source of
carbonates is from plants and animals which make use of carbonates in some way. Car-
bonate sediments will be ﬁne-grained (grain size in the micrometre-range), and the ﬁnal
properties of the carbonate rock will depend very much on the post-depositional processes
(diagenesis), since the carbonates are strongly inﬂuenced by pore ﬂuid chemistry and tem-
perature/pressure. Carbonates may also contain larger grains (e.g. fragments of fossils) of
sand particle size or larger. In the same way as for sand deposits, the carbonate is more
likely to be coarse grained and well sorted in high energy, shallow waters.

3.3.3. Post-deposition

After sediment deposition follows a lengthy process of transformation into a rock (sand
to sandstone, clay to shale, silt to siltstone). As the sedimentation process continues, an
overburden of younger sediments is deposited. This extra weight on top of a sediment
causes the sediment to compact. Compaction will result in a closer packing of the grains,
thus reducing both porosity and permeability. The friction angle will increase as a result of
compaction, see Fig. 3.13a. Compaction itself is however not sufﬁcient to create a massive,
cemented rock, as closer packing alone does not affect the cohesion. The sediment will
however act as if it is stronger when the weight of the overburden increases, since the
friction angle is always larger than zero. The increased overburden will result in increased
horizontal stresses when the sediment is conﬁned horizontally. This will have the same
effect as a conﬁning pressure in the laboratory, and the sediment can tolerate larger shear
stresses before it fails. This is illustrated in Fig. 3.13b.

For the transformation to be complete, processes by which grains are cemented together
are required. These physical and chemical postdepositional processes are referred to as dia-

Fig. 3.13. Effects of compaction on strength properties: a) Increase of friction angle as a result of compaction;
b) Increase of failure stress as a result of conﬁnement.

122

genesis. The parts of the diagenetic processes which contribute to harden the rock, are also
referred to as lithiﬁcation. The term consolidation is often used in a sloppy way by petro-
leum engineers, referring to the degree of cementation. For instance, “poorly consolidated
sandstone” is supposed to mean poorly cemented sandstone. Strictly speaking, however,
consolidation refers to time dependent deformation due to dissipation of pore pressure (see
Biot’s theory of consolidation in Section 1.6). That means; poorly consolidated basically
means poorly compacted. There is however often some correlation between the amount of
diagenetic cementation and the effective stresses developing in a formation due to com-
paction, especially in sand deposits.

Physical changes, in addition to compaction, include changes brought about by tectonic
activity. With respect to diagenetic effects, the chemical changes are however the most
important. Cementation is mainly the result of precipitation of a binding agent. When con-
sidering chemical processes, the interaction between the solid grain minerals (especially
the surface minerals) and the pore ﬂuid is the basic process. As only the pore water is free
to move in the sediment (at least as long as porosity and permeability are maintained), these
processes are closely linked to changes in pore water chemistry. Precipitation of calcite
onto the surface of sand grains is one such example of chemically induced cementation.

Carbonate (especially calcite) and silica are the minerals that account for most of the
cementation of sandstones. If the contact stress between quartz grains gets sufﬁciently high,
pressure solution may occur. The idea is that dissolution at the grain contact points liberates
SiO2 to the pore water. The SiO2 is then reprecipitated as quartz overgrowth because the
pressure in the pore water is lower, resulting in silica-cementation. Both calcite and quartz
cementation lead to strong sandstones. If the grains are held together by clay minerals, the
sandstone will be weak.

In carbonate sediments (commonly called carbonates), cementation is mainly precipita-
tion of carbonate minerals. Primary cementation will often consist of aragonite or calcite
with a high (up to 30%) magnesium content. These calcium carbonates are metastable, and
will after some thousands of years transform to the more stable form, low-magnesium-
calcite, through dissolution and precipitation. Dolomitization involves conversion of cal-
cium carbonate and magnesium to dolomite:

2CaCO3 + MgCl2 → CaMg(CO3)2 + CaCl2

This process requires a certain ratio of Mg/Ca in order to take place. This required ratio
is reduced as sediments are buried and the temperature increases because the magnesium
ions then become less hydrated.

Dolomitization, as most other processes of precipitation and cementation, will often lead
to reduced porosity as the void space is fully or partially ﬁlled up. This increases the rock
strength in most cases, but also reduces the potential of the rock as a reservoir formation.
Cementation processes will however, as we have seen, require increased pressures or
some throughﬂow of pore water. If these conditions are not met, cementation will come
to a halt. Some of the North Sea reservoirs can exemplify this. Both the sandstone and
chalk reservoirs are characterized by abnormally high pore pressures (see Fig. 3.12). This
has prevented pressure solution, and an efﬁcient cap rock has prevented further circulation
of pore ﬂuid through the reservoir rock. This has helped maintain a very high porosity,
30–50% in the most proliﬁc chalk and around 30% in the sandstone reservoirs. This has

MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF SEDIMENTARY ROCKS

123

however also resulted in very low cohesive strengths, and some formations are more or
less uncemented, almost like soil. The cohesive strength in situ is then mainly a result of
capillary forces, and hence very low. This has resulted in signiﬁcant production problems,
such as production of sand particles and ﬂow of chalk material into wells (see Chapter 10).
As a general statement it can be said that the degree of cementation and hence the
strength of a given rock increases with depth of burial, due to increased compaction, pres-
sure solution etc. This general trend is however often broken, either due to lithological
changes or due to conditions which may retard the diagenetic processes, such as the abnor-
mal pore pressure mentioned above.
By volume, sandstones and carbonates make up around 15% and 10%, respectively, of
sedimentary rocks. The most abundant sedimentary rock is however shale (∼75%). Most
of the overburden which has to be drilled through to get down to the reservoir, consists of
shale. These shale sections are often associated with stability problems during drilling (see
Chapter 9) and are therefore of interest in petroleum rock mechanics.

Diagenetic processes in clay are mainly a result of reactions between the clay minerals
and the pore water. Unstable minerals react with the pore water, depositing new and more
stable minerals. For this process to continue, there must be a continuous ﬂow of pore water
through the sediment, if not, the process will stop. In ﬁne-grained sediments like clay, the
permeability is very low (nanoDarcy and below) and equilibrium between pore water and
minerals will be established. Clays will therefore not be much altered, and the diagenetic
processes which take place will be very slow.

One example of diagenesis in clay is the transition of montmorillonite to mixed layer
illite/montmorillonite and illite (see also Section 3.2). This transition requires temperatures
corresponding to depths of 2–3 km to take place, and is accompanied by release of water
to free pore water.

Due to its plate-like structure, an uncompacted and soft clay (as a soil) will normally
have a low friction angle. As compaction and consolidation takes place, and porosity and
ﬂuid content decrease, the shale will develop a higher friction angle. Shale, like any other
sedimentary rock, is however anisotropic by nature. Often transversely isotropic symmetry
is assumed, with the symmetry axis normal to bedding. This will affect permeability, elastic
properties and strength parameters of the shale (Section 3.4).

3.4. Mechanical properties of sedimentary rocks

Here we give a brief overview of the mechanical properties of sedimentary rocks of interest
to the petroleum industry, namely sandstones, chalk, and shales. A main difference between
these rocks is grain (or pore) size, ranging from 0.1–1 mm in sands down to the nanometre
range in shales. This affects petrophysical characteristics, such as the permeability, which
has a profound inﬂuence on mechanical behaviour, in particular time dependent phenom-
ena. Also, the relevant laws of physics controlling the force transmission at microscale are
different in the nanometre and millimetre environments. However, in all cases we are deal-
ing with assemblies of bonded particles, and the gross behaviour of the different rocks are
largely seen more similar than different.

We have also included a brief description of rock salt, which impacts amongst other

seismic interpretation and drilling operations in many sedimentary basins.

Fig. 3.14. Thin section image of Castlegate sandstone (courtesy of Reidar Bøe, SINTEF Petroleum Research).

3.4.1. Sandstone

A thin section image of a sandstone is shown in Fig. 3.14. The dominant grain sizes of
sandstone are typically 0.01–1 mm. Pore sizes are the same order of magnitude, but slightly
smaller. This gives permeabilities ranging from microDarcy to several Darcies.

The predominant matrix mineral is quartz. The cement may be quartz as well (in the case
of pressure solution), it may be carbonate (especially calcite), or clay minerals. Quartz has
a bulk modulus of 37.5 GPa and a shear modulus of 41 GPa (see Appendix A).

The texture may vary from isotropic to anisotropic. Intrinsic (lithological) anisotropy is
caused by microlamination (bedding), induced for instance by seasonal variations during
deposition. This typically gives alternating layers of coarse and ﬁne grains. Anisotropy
may also be caused by deposition of ﬂat grains with their long axis parallel to each other.
An unconﬁned test with a sandstone, or a triaxial test at a low conﬁning pressure, typi-
cally shows nonlinear stress–strain behaviour during initial loading, with stiffening as the
stress is increased. This nonlinearity can be attributed to pre-existing microcracks within
the core, generated by stress release during coring (for cores from depth; see Section 7.1.2)
or caused by weathering (for outcrop or near surface cores). For weak sandstones, where
many grain contacts are not cemented, the grain contact itself is a nonlinear element
(cf. Hertzian contact theory; Chapter 6).

It is not possible to state any number that characterizes the strength or stiffness of a typ-
ical sandstone—a “typical” rock does simply not exist. We ﬁnd sandstones with porosities
ranging from less than 5% up to 40%. The strength varies with porosity—as illustrated by
Fig. 3.15 (from Plumb, 1994).

Plumb found an empirical correlation for the unconﬁned strength of very clean sand-

stones:

C0 = 357(1 − 2.8φ)2

(φ < 0.357)

(3.15)

with C0 given in MPa and φ as a fraction.

This represents an upper bound to the unconﬁned strength. For sandstones containing
clay, the strength falls well below the trend suggested by this equation. Note the similarity
between Eq. (3.15) and the critical porosity model discussed in Section 6.2.

Young’s modulus shows a strong correlation with strength. Deere and Miller (1966)
investigated 82 sandstones from 18 different locations in USA. They found the static
Young’s modulus to be proportional to the unconﬁned strength (C0), but with signiﬁcant

scatter. Most data presented by Deere and Miller, and elsewhere, give a proportionality
ratio (E/C0) between 100 and 400.

Tensile strength (T0) is not often measured directly on sandstone cores. Values are nor-
mally derived from indirect measurements, such as Brazilian tests (see Section 7.5). The
general impression is that (C0/T0) is between 5 and 20 for sandstones. Note however that
unconﬁned data are often not very reliable, because of pre-existing cracks or ﬂaws in the
rocks tested.

When a sandstone starts to yield at low conﬁning pressure, the behaviour is often found
dilatant. There is a brittle-ductile transition: Above a certain conﬁning pressure, the rock
fails in a ductile manner, and plasticity theory is required to describe the constitutive ma-
terial behaviour. The failure envelope is often matched to a linear criterion, although it is
usually found to be nonlinear, with a decreasing friction angle at high conﬁning stresses.
The typical friction angle is near 30°, but may vary typically between 20° and 40°. The
higher friction angles are found for low porosities and low clay contents.

Sandstones are found to exhibit an end cap in their failure envelope (i.e. material failure
under high isotropic stresses). This is often associated with grain crushing, but may also
result from collapse of the pore structure by grain reorganization. Localized “compaction
bands” of crushed material have been observed in triaxial tests with high porosity sandstone
at high conﬁning pressure (Olsson and Holcomb, 2000). The stress threshold for grain
crushing depends on particle size distribution and particle shape, and on the degree of
cementation. Data on sandstones between 15 and 25% porosity by Wong et al. (1997)
show (Boutéca et al., 2000) that the hydrostatic yield stress is 6–7 times the unconﬁned
strength.

126

3.4.2. Chalk

A microscope image of chalk is shown in Fig. 3.16. Chalk particles originate as skeletons
of algae that are called coccospheres, with a typical initial size of 30 µm. During burial the
coccospheres are crushed, and most particles (and pores) of present chalk are in the range
of a few (1–10) µm, with associated matrix permeabilities between micro- and milliDarcy.
The predominant mineral is calcite, which has a bulk modulus of 74 GPa and a shear
modulus of 27.5 GPa (see Appendix A). In addition to calcite, chalks contain silica and
clay minerals.

Chalk porosity may be as high as 70%. In normally pressured areas, chalk porosity is
typically less than 10% at depths larger than 2000 m. In North Sea reservoirs however,
chalk porosities of 15–50% are found at depths of 2500–3500 m because of overpressure.
These reservoirs are also naturally fractured, leading to high reservoir scale permeabilities
in the 100 milliDarcy range.

North Sea chalk has been widely studied because of the prominent chalk reservoirs
(Ekoﬁsk, Eldﬁsk, Valhall, Tommeliten and others). Andersen (1995) gives a comprehen-
sive summary of these studies. Havmøller and Foged (1996) compiled a large amount of
North Sea reservoir and outcrop chalk data to establish correlations between mechanical
properties and porosity (see also Engstrøm, 1992). The overall trends they found (for North
Sea chalk), can be summarized in the following equations:

As for sandstone, chalk has a failure surface with a brittle shear failure at low conﬁning
pressures, and also with an end cap at high stresses. Friction angles are typically between

pointed out that compressive, tensile and end cap failure modes appear to be governed by
one failure surface. The end cap is associated with pore collapse, a phenomenon which may
signiﬁcantly reduce the pore space in high porosity chalks. An example of a typical stress–
strain curve for chalk under hydrostatic compression (as for example given by Dahou et al.,
1995) is shown in Fig. 3.17. The stress reaches a plateau after an initial elastic phase. This
plateau represents pore collapse. After pore collapse, the material regains some stiffness if
it is continued to be strained.

tests is given as

Because of its signiﬁcance as a reservoir rock in the North Sea, chalk has been widely
studied and characterized. Less comprehensive laboratory studies have been performed
with more competent carbonate rocks (e.g. Yasar and Erdogan, 2004; and references
therein). Yasar and Erdogan studied limestone, dolomite and (metamorphous) marble, and
established correlations between P-wave velocity (see Section 5.2) versus strength and

3.4.3. Shale

A Scanning Electron Image of a shale is shown in Fig. 3.18. Shales consist to a large extent
of clay minerals. From the rock mechanical viewpoint, it is natural to deﬁne a shale as a
rock in which clay minerals constitute a load-bearing framework. In practice this means
that clay content needs to be higher than about 40%. As demonstrated in Fig. 3.18, shale
texture is strongly anisotropic. This is often seen through a plane of weakness along which
the shale easily splits. It means that all non-scalar physical quantities will be anisotropic, a
fact which is often neglected in practical rock mechanical analysis, due to lack of data.

Because of the abundance of clay minerals, pore sizes in shale are very small; typically
between 5 and 25 nm. In addition, the clay minerals contain structurally bound water. This
means that it is difﬁcult to measure as well as to deﬁne the elastic properties of the solid
material contained in shales.

Various approaches have been used, including theoretical models (Alexandrov and
Ryzhova, 1961; Katahara, 1996), extrapolation of wave velocity measurements on shales
(Tosaya, 1982; Han, 1986; Castagna et al., 1995; and others summarized in Mavko et
al., 1998) or clay powders (Vanario et al., 2003) to zero porosity, and theoretical inver-
sion of velocity measurements on epoxy impregnated shale samples (Wang et al., 1998).
Values scatter widely—the extrapolation techniques give bulk modulus between 5 and
25 GPa, and shear modulus ranging from 4 to 10 GPa. These numbers clearly depend
on which type of clay mineral (kaolinite, smectite, illite) is dominant, and in particular
on the adsorbed or bound water present within minerals and on mineral surfaces. When
sufﬁciently large crystals are available, such as in the case of muscovite, one may mea-
sure directly the stiffness of the solid material in a dry state (no bound water). Such
data give for this particular mineral (Carmichael, 1984; Alexandrov and Ryzhova, 1961;
Katahara, 1996) a bulk modulus of 51 GPa and a shear modulus of 32 GPa. Note however
that this mineral is strongly anisotropic, with moduli in the crystal symmetry plane being
4–6 times larger than moduli representing normal to plane stiffnesses.

Shales have, because of the narrow pore space, very large speciﬁc surface areas. These
surfaces are negatively charged, and attract cations from the pore water. Hydrated ions are
often attached to the mineral surfaces. Shale porosity may vary from very small (a few %)

MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF SEDIMENTARY ROCKS

to quite high (up to 70%). Even with the highest porosities, permeability remains very
small. The nanometre size pores lead to laboratory measured permeabilities in the nano-
Darcy range (see references given under Section 3.2). Even lower values may be expected
for shale under in situ conditions.

The very low permeability makes shale a very special rock material to study. It means
that rock mechanical tests become extremely time-consuming, since pore pressure equili-
bration is slow. It also means that cores when taken out of the Earth, always will have a
tendency to be damaged by tensile failure occurring during core retrieval: The core would
have to be retrieved at an extremely low rate in order to prevent overpressure inside. This
means that shale cores may be incompletely saturated. Such a damaged core is clearly not
representative of the shale in situ. Resaturation of a shale core can not be done as in stan-
dard petrophysics analysis. Capillary forces may lead to further damage of the shale. The
authors’ experience is that the best results are obtained when a pore pressure is enforced
(or measured, as a response to applied stress).

The difﬁculties in testing and specimen preparation are discussed further in Chapter 7. It
means however that good laboratory test results are scarce, and have to be judged carefully
in light of the laboratory procedures applied. Also, because shale is not a reservoir rock
and has only indirect economic interest, it has not been studied to the same extent as other
sedimentary rocks.

Lashkaripour and Dusseault (1993) collected a large set of shale data from published
literature and in-house studies. The majority of shales tested had porosity below 20%. They
found unconﬁned strength to increase with decreasing porosity, and proposed a relation of
the form

C0 = 193φ
where C0 is given in MPa and φ is given in %.

−1.14

(3.25)

(3.26)

Their data set also showed strength and stiffness to be related. The ratio between
Young’s modulus and unconﬁned strength (E/C0) is typically around 200. The compres-
sive strength is typically 10–15 times higher than the tensile strength.

Horsrud (2001) studied North Sea shales, most of them with higher porosities (30–55%).
He conﬁrmed a proportionality between the Young’s modulus and unconﬁned strength,
with a proportionality constant of ∼150. These data show good correlation of strength with
porosity, but the correlations are different from those found for lower porosity shales by
Lashkaripour and Dusseault. Both works demonstrated that P-wave velocity measurements
show a good correlation to shale strength, which is a valuable result if one wants to relate
shale strength to sonic measurements on drill cuttings or from log/seismic data. Horsrud
(2001) found the relation

C0 = 0.77 v2.93
p
where C0 is given in MPa and vp is given in km/s.

Due to its plate-like structure, an uncompacted and soft clay (like soil) will normally
have a low friction angle. As compaction and consolidation takes place, and porosity
and ﬂuid content decrease, the shale will develop a higher friction angle. Horsrud also
showed that the friction angle in most tests with high porosity shale was very low, typi-
cally 10°–20°.

Fig. 3.19. Samples loaded to failure: a) Maximum load normal to bedding; b) Maximum load parallel with
bedding.

As mentioned above, the plate-like structure of shale also leads to anisotropy. Fig. 3.19
shows two samples loaded to failure, one with the largest principal stress direction normal
to the bedding (a) and one parallel to the bedding (b). Samples with the maximum load
parallel to the bedding will often have a higher failure angle than samples with maximum
load normal to the bedding. With equal conﬁning pressures, the sample with maximum
load normal to the bedding will require a higher maximum stress in order to fail. This gen-
eral trend is reasonable to expect, since the bedding planes will represent possible planes of
weakness. The strength anisotropy is also likely to inﬂuence borehole failure, in particular
for deviated holes. The degree of anisotropy may however vary signiﬁcantly, depending on
both depositional environment and post-depositional processes. Tectonic activities result-
ing in fracturing of the rock may enhance or disturb this general trend, depending on the
direction of the induced fractures.

3.4.4. Rock salt

Rock salt is precipitated from sea water and may occur in the Earth as extensive salt beds
or interstratiﬁed with e.g. sedimentary rocks. The mineralogical composition of natural
rock salts varies from very homogeneous (99% halite; NaCl) to heterogeneous mineral
associations. In many areas salt domes are found, such as beneath the Ekoﬁsk ﬁeld in the
North Sea, where the underlying salt has a strong impact on the reservoir stresses (see
Section 3.1). Salt may also be found above reservoirs, such as in the Gulf of Mexico area.
Quite often salt is found to impose drilling problems. Salt has very low permeability and is
therefore of interest for long term storage of hazardous waste.

Salt grains (or crystals) can be between 1 and 50 mm in size. Virgin rock salt is usually
characterized by very low porosity (<0.5–1.0%) which in some cases may be less than
0.1%. A signiﬁcant portion of the pore volume may occur as closed voids containing gas,
brine or both. Pore sizes are in the nanometre to micrometre range. Permeability of virgin
rock salt in the Earth is probably in the nanoDarcy range or lower (Cosenza and Ghorey-
chi, 1996). Ultra low permeability of natural intact rock salt enables one to hold this rock
impermeable in many practical situations. The negligible permeability of rock salt is also
attributed to healing processes and creep taking place under in situ conditions (Horseman,
1988).

A practical problem of measuring porosity and permeability is the solubility of rock salt
in the liquids usually used in laboratory routine work. Therefore, organic ﬂuids or inert
gas is often used for permeability tests. Laboratory measured permeabilities and porosities
may be much larger than those representative for ﬁeld conditions.

The value of Young’s modulus in rock salt as obtained in a conventional static test is rate-
sensitive. To reduce the effect of rate sensitivity, Young’s modulus is usually measured
during unloading-reloading paths, yielding E-values of 10–30 GPa for various types of
rock salt. Poisson’s ratio ranges between 0.15 and 0.4 being 0.2–0.3 on the average (Hansen
et al., 1984).

Some rock salt types have tight cementation and are quite competent while others are
loosely cemented and can be crushed by hand pressure. Uniaxial compressive strength
C0 typically ranges from about 15 MPa to 35 MPa. Tensile strength T0 varies from less
than 1 MPa to 2–3 MPa. Low resistance against tensile stresses is one of the characteristic
features of rock salt. The ratio of C0/T0 can be above 20 (Silberschmidt and Silberschmidt,
2000). The angle of internal friction ranges from 40° to 65°. Conﬁning pressure remarkably
increases the ductility of rock salt. Axial strain measured at failure in the conﬁned regime
can reach 10–25% (Lux and Rokahr, 1984).

The plastic behaviour of rock salt is linked to very signiﬁcant creep behaviour. This
phenomenon can be explained microscopically by a dislocation glide mechanism (Munson
and Wawersik, 1993; Fokker and Kenter, 1994), and can be modelled macroscopically in
analogy with time dependent metal plasticity. The amount of creep strain increases with
increasing deviatoric stress, and increases strongly with increasing temperature.

Stresses around boreholes. Borehole failure criteria

Underground formations are always in a stressed state, mostly due to overburden and
tectonic stresses (see Chapter 3). When a well is drilled into a formation, stressed solid
material is removed. The borehole wall is then supported only by the ﬂuid pressure in the
hole. As this ﬂuid pressure generally does not match the in situ formation stresses, there
will be a stress redistribution around the well. This may lead to deviatoric stresses greater
than the formation can support, and failure may result. Knowledge of the stresses around a
well is therefore essential for discussions of well problems.

4.1. Stresses and strains in cylindrical coordinates

To examine the stresses in the rock surrounding a borehole, we need to express the stresses
and strains in cylindrical coordinates. The stresses at a point P identiﬁed by the coordinates
r, θ, z, are denoted σr, σθ , σz, τrθ , τrz and τθ z. The stresses in a plane perpendicular to the
z-axis are indicated in Fig. 4.1(a). The relations between the stresses in cylindrical and
Cartesian coordinates are as follows (compare to Eqs. (1.18)–(1.21), see also page 455):

4.2. Stresses in a hollow cylinder

The hollow cylinder model, as sketched in Fig. 4.2, is a simple example of a borehole in
a stressed formation. The model is important in itself, as laboratory tests concerning well
stability often are carried out on such samples. The hollow cylinder model also provides a
model for vertical wells through formations where the horizontal stresses are equal.

4.2.1. The equilibrium equations

The inﬁnite hollow cylinder has full rotational symmetry about the axis of the cylinder, as
well as full translational symmetry along the axis. We assume as a starting point that the
cylinder is loaded with an axial stress σv, and we shall derive expressions for the stresses
in the cylinder as it is loaded with an internal pressure pw and an external stress σro.
The external stresses on the cylinder are at all times normal, and independent of θ and z.
Therefore the cylindrical coordinate axes, (with the z-axis along the cylinder axis) also
represent the principal stress directions.

It is then clear that the only deformation will be in the radial direction, and that there will
be no variation along the axis. Thus the model will be in plane strain (see Section 1.2.4),

Fig. 4.2. Section of the hollow cylinder model.

and εz = 0. (If we consider a ﬁnite height cylinder (e.g. in a lab test), the plain strain will
apply only if the top and bottom platens are ﬁxed, and if end effects can be ignored.)

Ignoring body forces, the equations of equilibrium (4.25)–(4.27) are simpliﬁed to a sin-

gle equation

(4.28)

We now replace the stress with the radial displacement u using Eqs. (4.19)–(4.20) (Hooke’s
law), the deﬁnition of effective stress (Eq. (1.170)), and the strains in terms of u from
Eqs. (4.13) and (4.14). The result is

The sum in the parenthesis in the middle can be recognized as the sum of radial and tan-
gential strain, which thus is seen to be constant. Together with the plane strain condition,
εz = 0, this means that for the present case, the elastic rearrangement of the stresses
around a wellbore does not result in any volumetric changes. Further, from Hooke’s law
(Eq. (1.99)) it follows that the mean stress is constant.

The expression

u = C1r + C2

r

(4.31)

is the general solution of the displacement equation (4.30), with C1 and C2 as integration
constants.

The radial and tangential strains are given by

If there is a mud cake, pf(Rw) is the ﬂuid pressure behind the mud cake.

142

STRESSES AROUND BOREHOLES. BOREHOLE FAILURE CRITERIA

From a physical point of view this result can be explained as follows: If the well pressure
is higher than the reservoir ﬂuid pressure, ﬂuids are injected and the pore ﬂuid pressure
is increased around the well. This will give a tendency for the material to expand and
the stresses increase. If on the other hand the well is on production, the well pressure is
lower than the reservoir pressure. The lower ﬂuid pressure around the well will make the
formation shrink, and hence the corresponding reduction in the tangential and axial stress.
Note that the wall stresses are independent of the details of the radial variation in pf(r),
only the difference between the farﬁeld value and the value at the borehole wall appears in
the equations.

The superposition principle

Since the governing equations are linear, the ﬁnal expressions can be seen as a sum of
different basic loads, which are uncoupled. For the hollow cylinder, these basic loads are
the external radial stress, the borehole pressure and the pore pressure.

As an illustration, the well pressure term pwR2

w/r2 is the same in Eqs. (4.43) and (4.55).
Further, we expect the well pressure term to be the same if we introduce a more compli-
cated far-ﬁeld stress, e.g. corresponding to a deviated hole in an anisotropic stress ﬁeld.
(See Eq. (4.83).)

Radial ﬂow

A special case is obtained if the pressure variation is given by stationary radial ﬂow into
the well. We will ﬁrst study the case of a hollow cylinder with outer radius Ro, and look
for a stationary solution, i.e. we assume that all transients have died away.

The ﬂuid pressure can then be calculated from Darcy’s law (see Section 1.9.1)

(4.61)

where Qo is the constant ﬂow rate, h is the height of the cylinder, k is the permeability and
ηf is the ﬂuid viscosity. Note that Qo is here deﬁned to be positive for ﬂow in the inwards
direction.

Solving the equation above, assuming a constant pressure pfo at the outer radius Ro, the

pressure is given by the well-known equation

Inserting this result into Eqs. (4.51)–(4.53), the equations published by Risnes et al. (1982)

A common assumption in reservoir engineering is that the reservoir pressure pfo is constant
at all times at a drainage radius Re. (We underline however, that in reality, true stationary
ﬂow will never be reached in an inﬁnite formation.)

These equations can be used as an approximation to a producing well. Eq. (4.68) depends
on the plane strain condition, which is valid for an inﬁnitely long borehole. In a real case,
the ﬂow will be in a reservoir of limited height, and hence a solution based on generalized
plane stress (see Section 1.2.4) would be valid when the depleted zone extends far into the
reservoir, and the full vertical stress is transmitted to the reservoir. In practise, there will be
some arching of the overburden preventing the maintenance of the full vertical stress, and
hence the true solution will be somewhere in between.

4.2.4. Stress distributions with heat ﬂow

When a well is drilled, the drilling mud will alter the temperature of the surrounding for-
mation. When the temperature changes, the formation expands or shrinks, and the stresses
will change. (See Section 1.5 for the basic formulas of thermoelasticity.)

From the correspondence between poroelasticity and thermoelasticity, see Section 1.6.6
and Eqs. (4.58)–(4.60), we may immediately write the expressions for the stresses at the
wellbore wall:

σr = pw
σθ = 2σh − pw + Efr
1 − νfr
σz = σv + Efr
αT (Tw − To)
1 − νfr

αT (Tw − To)

144

STRESSES AROUND BOREHOLES. BOREHOLE FAILURE CRITERIA

Tw is the temperature in the well and To is the reservoir temperature. The thermally induced
changes in stress affect both the tangential and the axial stress. The radial stress is of course
equal to the well pressure regardless of any temperature changes.

4.2.5. Stress distributions in nonlinear formations

The results in Section 4.2.2 as displayed in Fig. 4.3 showed that there is a rapid increase in
the stress deviation towards the borehole wall. These results were based on the assumption
of linear elasticity, i.e. that the elastic moduli of the rock are independent of the stress
state. However, elastic moduli of rocks are normally stress dependent to some extent (see
Section 1.8). Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the elastic moduli close to the wellbore
wall will differ from those of the virgin formation, due to the stress alteration in the vicinity
of the borehole.
Santarelli et al. (1986, 1987) modelled this effect by assuming that Young’s modulus
depends on the minor principal stress σr as E(σr ) = E0σ a
r . Here E0 and a are empirical
constants; normally 0 < a < 1, and E0 may be interpreted as the value of Young’s mod-
ulus as measured in uniaxial compression tests. Based on this assumption, they found the
following expressions for σr and σθ corresponding to Eqs. (4.43)–(4.44).

The implications for the stress distribution around the borehole are signiﬁcant. Fig. 4.4
shows the variation of stresses as functions of radial distance as calculated by Eqs. (4.72)–
(4.75) using a = 0.5 and νfr = 0.2. Also the vertical stress is reduced close to the wellbore,
as σz is linked to σr and σθ through Hooke’s law (although it is no longer linear).

An important consequence of the nonconstant E-modulus is the relative reduction of
σθ near the wellbore wall. This effect is most pronounced for low borehole pressures for
which it may even happen that the difference σθ − σr is larger at some distance into the
formation than at the borehole wall. Thus, the commonly observed effect that Young’s
modulus increases with increasing conﬁning pressure, has the consequence that the stress
deviation near the borehole wall at low borehole pressures is reduced compared to the
linear elastic solution.

ELASTIC STRESSES AROUND WELLS—THE GENERAL SOLUTION

145

Fig. 4.4. Stresses around a borehole in a formation with pressure dependent elastic properties.

4.3. Elastic stresses around wells—the general solution

In the previous sections we studied the simple example of a vertical borehole in a forma-
tion with isotropic horizontal stress. We shall now proceed to describe the general elastic
situation: the borehole is deviated, and the horizontal stress is anisotropic.

We shall assume that the principal stresses are the vertical stress σv, and the major and
minor horizontal stresses σH and σh. (The generalization to a case where the vertical stress
is not a principal stress is trivial.)

As an introduction, a brief historical overview may be appropriate: The stress distribu-
tion around a circular hole in an inﬁnite plate in one-dimensional tension was published by
Kirsch in 1898.1 The Kirsch formulas generalize easily to a vertical borehole with unequal
farﬁeld stress, such that this solution is also often referred to as the Kirsch equations.

The “standard”, easily available reference in petroleum rock mechanics literature for
the full solution is Bradley (1979), who quoted a report by Fairhurst (1968). However,
according to Peška and Zoback (1995), the equations were ﬁrst published by Hiramatsu
and Oka (1962).

There appears to be a sign error in part of the τrθ expression in Bradley’s paper. This
error has propagated in the literature, for instance in the ﬁrst edition of this book, and
several other works. An easily available reference that appears to be correct is Hiramatsu
and Oka (1968).

1 The famous paper of Ernst Gustav Kirsch (1841–1901) is an example of a classic paper that is probably more
often cited than read. As a result, many variants of the title and citation details exist in the literature, some of
which suggest that the writer does not understand the German language. It is therefore a pleasure to bring the
correct citation here. By the way, the original paper does not reveal Kirsch’ ﬁrst name or initials. The Kirsch
paper is not a good starting point for those wishing to the study the derivation of the Kirsch equations, as the
paper relies on detailed references to a contemporary German textbook. We suggest that the interested reader
should instead study Chapter 10 of Jaeger and Cook (1979) or Chapter 5 of Charlez (1991).

The solutions corresponding to Eqs. (4.43)–(4.45) are found assuming plane strain normal
to the borehole axis.

Again, it is convenient to express the stresses in terms of cylindrical polar coordinates

relative to the x-axis, and z is the position along the borehole axis (see Fig. 4.6). The stress

The borehole inﬂuence is given by terms in r

position around the wellbore. Generally the shear stresses are non-zero. Thus σr, σθ and

These are the equations which are used in linear elastic analysis of borehole stability.

The stress solutions as given by Eqs. (4.83)–(4.88) and Eqs. (4.89)–(4.94) are the stress
solutions for nonporous materials or for porous material with constant pore pressure. Due
to the superposition principle, pore pressure effects may simply be added. Thus, if we
assume a radially symmetric pressure distribution around the borehole, the pore pressure
terms from Eqs. (4.55)–(4.57) or Eqs. (4.66)–(4.68) may be used directly.

For a hole along a principal stress direction, the general equations (4.83)–(4.88) simplify
considerably. We here give the resulting equations for a vertical borehole, but the expres-

which shows that unlike the situation for equal horizontal stresses (see the discussion fol-
lowing Eq. (4.42)), the drillout leads to a change in the mean stress. The average change
(along a circular path concentric with the hole) is zero, but consists of an increase in mean
stress in the direction of the minor horizontal stress, and a decrease in the major horizontal
stress direction. See Fig. 4.7 for an illustration. Thus, immediately after drillout, we ex-
pect a pore pressure increase along the σh-direction and a pore pressure decrease along the
σH-direction (since a change in mean stress leads to a volumetric strain).

Eq. (4.101) shows that the tangential stress at the borehole wall varies between the max-

imum value

and the minimum value

σθ,max = 3σH − σh − pw

σθ,min = 3σh − σH − pw

(4.105)

(4.106)

where the maximum value occurs in the direction of σh and the minimum value in the direc-
tion of σH. The variation in tangential stress around the borehole is illustrated in Fig. 4.8.

4.4. Poroelastic time dependent effects

In a nonporous, linear elastic material, the stress redistribution upon drilling or well pres-
sure change is immediate. In a porous and permeable medium, however, there are time

POROELASTIC TIME DEPENDENT EFFECTS

151

effects due to the fact that the pore pressure propagates with a limited rate. (See Sec-
tion 1.9.1.)

There are two main sources of the poroelastic time effects:

1. Pore pressure change due to production or the invasion of the wellbore ﬂuid.

2. Pore pressure change because the redistribution of the formation stresses gives a vol-

umetric strain, see e.g. Eq. (4.104).

While the ﬁrst mechanism requires a non-sealing wellbore wall, the second will occur

even if the wellbore wall is completely sealed.

Detournay and Cheng (1988) discuss in detail the case of a vertical hole with unequal
far-ﬁeld stresses. We reproduce some of their results here, but strongly recommend the
original paper for a complete discussion. See also Chapter 2 of Charlez (1997).

4.4.1. Wellbore pressure invasion

We consider ﬁrst case 1, in which the pore pressure is changed by communication with
the wellbore pressure. Let us assume that initially pw = pfo, that we have a permeable
borehole wall and that at time zero the well pressure is changed by pw. Assuming an
axisymmetric pressure proﬁle, the pore pressure is decoupled from the deformation, and
the pressure inside the formation will develop according to a decoupled diffusion equation
similar to Eq. (1.241). The pressure development as a function of time and radial distance

where the diffusion constant CD is given by Eq. (1.242). For an 8
to milliseconds or less for a high-permeable sand, and up to several days for a tight shale.
Once the pore pressure proﬁle is known, the tangential stress may be computed by
Eq. (4.56). If we assume that as time tends to inﬁnity the well pressure change has pen-
etrated deeply into the formation, we see from Eq. (4.56) that the contribution to the
tangential stress from the pore pressure change is
σθ (t → ∞) = ηpw

(4.108)

(cid:4)

(cid:5)

1 + R2

r2

This is of course in addition to the elastic contribution as given by the ﬁrst two terms of
Eq. (4.56) (or by Eq. (4.44)).

Note that the assumptions leading to Eq. (4.108) are different from those leading to
Eq. (4.67). The latter assumes a steady ﬂow for large times, while the former assumes that
the pore pressure far into the formation has become equal to the well pressure for large
time. Both cases are approximations that are not fulﬁlled in practise.

We also see from Eq. (4.59) that at the borehole wall, the change in tangential stress is

σθ = 2ηpw

(4.109)

at all times.

There are no explicit analytical solutions of the diffusion equation for the current prob-

lem, and hence it must be solved by numerical methods.

In Fig. 4.10 we show the time development of the pore pressure induced contribution
to the tangential stress. Let us assume that we are considering production, i.e. pw is
negative. We see that at the borehole wall, the tangential stress is reduced relative to the
elastic case at all times. However, for short times, we have an increase in the tangential
stress in the near wellbore region. The region of increased stress propagates outwards with
time.

.

POROELASTIC TIME DEPENDENT EFFECTS

153

The origin of this increase in tangential stress may be understood by considering that
the reduced tangential stress near the borehole must be compensated by an increase of
tangential stress further away. The position of the region of increased radial stress follows
the position the pressure front. Hence it propagates outwards and broadens with time.

4.4.2. Drillout induced pore pressure changes

We saw (e.g. in Eq. (4.104)) that when the farﬁeld horizontal stresses are unequal, the
drillout leads to a volumetric strain and hence to a change in pressure, which will dissipate
with time due to ﬂuid ﬂow. This will lead to time-dependence of the near wellbore stresses,
also when the wellbore wall is completely sealing.

The pore pressure change depends both on the radial position and on the azimuth. Hence
there will be both radial and tangential ﬂuid ﬂow as a result of the drillout. Since the
diffusion distance is shortest close to the borehole, pore pressure will reach equilibrium
fastest here. A partly or fully open wellbore wall will contribute further to this.

As a result, the near wellbore behaviour will be drained, whereas the response deeper
into the formation will be undrained for short times. Since the drained moduli are smaller
than the undrained, the stress concentration in the near wellbore region will initially be
shielded relative to its full elastic value. This is similar to the shielding seen for nonlinear
formation, or plastic formations, see Sections 4.2.5 and 4.6. Obviously, the effect will be
strongest when there is a signiﬁcant difference between drained and undrained parameters,
i.e. for soft materials.

As the pore pressure imbalance dissipates, the shielding disappears, and the elastic stress
concentration is reestablished. Detournay and Cheng (1988) suggested that this may be a
mechanism of delayed failure for boreholes in tight formations.

Fig. 4.11 shows the variation in tangential stress as a function of radius in the minimum
stress direction for various dimensionless times (Eq. (4.107)). The plot has been generated
for ν = 0.4, νfr = 0.2 and Skempton’s B = 0.8. (An example of a set of parameters
in our notation that gives these values are φ = 0.15, Kfr = 4 GPa, Gfr = 4 GPa and
Ks = 37.5 GPa.)
We underline that the ﬁgure shows only the tangential stress due to the deviatoric load-

ing, i.e. the stress corresponding to the cos 2θ term in Eq. (4.96).

Fig. 4.12 shows the variation in tangential stress at the wellbore wall as a function of
time, again in the direction of the minimum horizontal stress. The initial reduction in stress
concentration is evident.
For a numerical example, assume pw = 20 MPa, σH = 40 MPa, σh = 30 MPa. Then
Fig. 4.12 shows that σθ ≈ 15 MPa initially and σθ ≈ 20 MPa at large times. The total
tangential stress is found by adding the contribution from the mean farﬁeld stress, σθ =
σH + σh − pw = 50 MPa. Thus, the tangential stress at the borehole wall (in the direction
of the minor stress) increases from 65 MPa at early times to 70 MPa at large times.

In addition to the poroelastic time effects, there are also time effects due to temperature

change and chemical processes. See Chapter 9 for further discussion.

4.5. Borehole failure criteria

As shown in the previous sections, there may be large stress deviations in the formation
close to the borehole, when the borehole pressure differs from the formation pressure. If
the stress deviation somewhere exceeds the failure criterion for the rock, the rock fails.
This situation is what we shall associate with the term “borehole failure” in this section.
Conversely, “borehole failure criterion” means the boundary conditions for which borehole
failure occurs.

The consequences of borehole failure according to this deﬁnition are normally bore-
hole deformations of some kind. Note, however, that such deformations are not necessarily

BOREHOLE FAILURE CRITERIA

155

dramatic from an operational point of view (see Chapter 9). Thus, “borehole failure” as
deﬁned here should by no means be taken as a synonym for a lost well. Development of
borehole failure beyond failure initiation is discussed in Section 4.6.

4.5.1. Vertical hole, isotropic horizontal stresses and impermeable borehole wall

For a material that behaves linearly elastic, the largest stress differences occur at the bore-
hole wall, hence rock failure is expected to initiate there.

We start with the simplest case, a vertical borehole with constant pore pressure and
isotropic farﬁeld horizontal stresses. We assume that the wellbore is lined with a perfect
mud cake, which means that the pore pressure is not inﬂuenced by the well pressure.

Within this assumptions, the principal stresses at the borehole wall are, according to

Eqs. (4.43)–(4.45)

σr = pw
σθ = 2σh − pw
σz = σv

(4.110)
(4.111)
(4.112)

There are several conditions for which the borehole may fail, depending on the relative
magnitudes of the principal stresses. Let us ﬁrst assume that we are lowering pw such that
σr = pw becomes the smallest principal stress. We see from Eqs. (4.111) and (4.112) that
depending on the relative magnitude of σh and σv, either σθ or σz will become the largest
principal stress at the borehole wall.

Consider ﬁrst the situation where σθ > σz > σr at the borehole wall. According to the

Mohr–Coulomb criterion (Eq. (2.22)), failure will occur when

(cid:2)

θ

σ

= C0 + σ

(cid:2)
r tan2 β

(4.113)

Using an effective stress coefﬁcient equal to 1 for failure (see Section 2.6.1) we ﬁnd that
the failure criterion for the borehole becomes

pw,min = 2σh + pf(tan2 β − 1) − C0

1 + tan2 β

= pf + 2(σh − pf) − C0
1 + tan2 β

(4.114)

Thus, if the well pressure falls below the value given by Eq. (4.114), shear failure will
occur at the borehole wall.

Next, assume that σh is smaller relative to σv, such that σv is the largest principal stress

at failure. Proceeding as above, the failure criterion becomes

pw = σv + pf(tan2 β − 1) − C0

= pf + σv − pf − C0

tan2 β

tan2 β

(4.115)

In practice, one needs to calculate both cases, and pick the criterion that gives the largest

borehole pressure at failure.

In order to map the region of mechanical stability for a borehole, all six permutations
of the three principal stresses σr, σθ and σz need to be considered. The resulting equations

are summarized in Table 4.1. The various conditions for borehole failure are shown graph-
ically in Fig. 4.13. Cases d, e and f are mainly of academic interest however, since they
imply a wellbore pressure higher than the overburden stress, a condition that is usually
unacceptable in drilling. See discussion below.

The conditions constitute a polygon enframing a region where the borehole is stable
with respect to shear failure; if subject to stress states outside the polygon, the borehole
will fail.

In addition to the shear failure criteria, we must consider that σ

(cid:2)
θ at the borehole wall
becomes negative if the well pressure is sufﬁciently large, according to Eq. (4.111). If
θ < −T0, where T0 is the tensile strength of the material, tensile failure will occur at the
(cid:2)
σ
borehole wall. This adds an additional criterion for borehole failure to the list:

pfrac
w,max

= 2σh − pf + T0

(4.116)

According to this criterion, tensile failure will occur at the borehole wall if the well pressure
is increased above the value given by Eq. (4.116). Borehole failure of this kind is called
hydraulic fracturing, which is a topic we will return to in Chapters 8, 9 and 11.

Note that the criterion in Eq. (4.116) applies if the full stress concentration around the
borehole as predicted by Eq. (4.111) exists. This requires a perfectly circular hole, and a
linear elastic material. In practice, both these criteria will be only partly fulﬁlled, and hence
the real limit for hydraulic fracturing will occur at a lower value for pw.
When the fracture has propagated away from the borehole, it may continue to propagate
if pw is higher than approximately σh + T0. (See further discussion in Section 11.3.) This
corresponds to the diagonal line labelled σr = σθ in Fig. 4.13 (for the case T0 = 0).
Fig. 4.13 is a graphical representation of the failure criteria discussed, assuming C0 = 0,
pf = 0.4σv and tan2 β = 3. The shaded region is bounded by the shear failure criteria,
while the oblique line labelled “Vertical fracture init.” represents hydraulic fracturing.

C0 = 0, pf = 0.4σv and tan2 β = 3 is assumed. The polygon will grow in all directions if C0 is nonzero. In
particular, if T0 = 0, the line c will coincide with the vertical fracturing line if C0 = σv − pf. (After Guenot,

1987; with permission from A.A. Balkema.)

The horizontal line labelled “Horizontal fracturing” represents another failure criterion,
which needs to be taken into account: If there is any preexisting fracture or ﬂaw in the
borehole wall, the wall pressure will act with a vertical component on the formation there.
A horizontal fracture will then grow if σv − pw is less than −T0, i.e. ifp w > σv + T0.

4.5.2. Vertical hole, isotropic horizontal stresses and permeable borehole wall

If the borehole wall is permeable, the pore pressure at the borehole wall is equal to the well
pressure. This means that we must use pw rather than pf when computing the effective
stresses. In addition, we must take into account the change in the total stresses induced by
the varying pore pressure, as given by Eqs. (4.58)–(4.60)).

The stresses at the wellbore wall are thus

σr = pw
σθ = 2σh − pw + 2η(pw − pfo)
σz = σv + 2η(pw − pfo)

(4.117)
(4.118)
(4.119)

where η is the poroelastic stress coefﬁcient (see Eq. (4.54)) and pfo is the farﬁeld pore
pressure. Remember that the last equation follows from the plane strain assumption, and is
hence strictly valid only for an inﬁnitely long borehole.

158

STRESSES AROUND BOREHOLES. BOREHOLE FAILURE CRITERIA

Inserting these expressions into the Mohr–Coulomb criterion, using pw when computing

the effective stress, we then ﬁnd for σθ > σz > σr

Note that the equation contains Biot’s α because of the elastic redistribution of the stresses

unity in the failure criterion. Also, observe that since the minor effective stress is zero, the
failure angle does not appear in Eq. (4.120).

Again, this last equation assumes plane strain conditions, and can not be directly applied to
pressurization of a limited section of a borehole. Hence, the equation has limited practical
applicability, and is mainly of academic interest.

4.5.3. Borehole along a principal stress direction

The stresses at the wall of a vertical hole with unequal far-ﬁeld stresses, and constant pore
pressure, were given in Eqs. (4.100)–(4.103). Since all shear stresses vanish in this case,
σr, σθ and σz are the principal stresses and may be used directly in the failure criterion.

From Eq. (4.101) and Fig. 4.8 it is clear that the maximum tangential stress occurs in
the direction of the minimum horizontal stress, and hence shear failure at the borehole wall
will initiate in the direction of the minimum horizontal stress, see Fig. 4.14.
Comparing to Eq. (4.111) we see that the critical well pressure when σθ > σz > σr
(case a of Table 4.1) may be found by substituting 2σh with 3σH − σh in Eq. (4.114):

pw,min = pf + 3σH − σh − 2pf − C0

1 + tan2 β

(4.124)

BOREHOLE FAILURE CRITERIA

159

Fig. 4.14. Location of shear failure initiation at the wall of a vertical hole with anisotropic horizontal stresses.

Similarly, by comparing Eq. (4.102) to Eq. (4.112) we see that for σz > σθ > σr, (case b

of Table 4.1) we have

pw,min = pf + σv + 2|νfr|(σH − σh) − pf − C0

tan2 β

(4.125)

Note that we need to take the absolute value of the Poisson’s ratio. This is because the
largest value of σz in Eq. (4.102) occurs for θ = 0° for negative νfr and for θ = 90° for
positive νfr.

The tensile failure criterion Eq. (4.116) is also modiﬁed if the horizontal stress is
anisotropic. In this case, failure will occur at the positions where σθ is smallest, and hence
fracturing will occur in the direction of maximum horizontal stress (see Fig. 4.8). The
criterion becomes

pfrac
w,max

= 3σh − σH − pf + T0

(4.126)

Here we see that an increase in the largest horizontal stress reduces the upper stability
limit for the well pressure. Thus anisotropy in the formation around a borehole reduces the
region where the borehole is stable.
Observe that if σH is sufﬁciently large, the pressure given by Eq. (4.126) may be smaller
than the criterion for fracture growth outside the inﬂuence of the borehole, which is pw ≈
σh + T0. Eq. (4.126) may thus be the criterion for initiation of a fracture that does not
propagate beyond the stress concentration around the borehole. See Section 11.2 for a
more detailed discussion.

The above equations were derived for a vertical borehole. It is however trivial to adept
them to a horizontal borehole along a principal stress direction by appropriately inter-
changing the far-ﬁeld stresses. As an example, for a horizontal hole along σH, we must
interchange σv and σH (assuming σv > σh).

4.5.4. Borehole in a general direction

In the general case it is not possible to obtain closed-form expressions for the critical well
pressure, and one must resort to numerical solution methods.

160

STRESSES AROUND BOREHOLES. BOREHOLE FAILURE CRITERIA

In brief, the procedure for establishing the lowest possible well pressure is as follows:

1. From the known far-ﬁeld stresses, compute the stresses in the borehole coordinate

system according to Eqs. (4.77)–(4.82).

2. Compute the stresses at the borehole wall according to Eqs. (4.89)–(4.94).

3. Subdivide the interval 0 < θ < π into a number of sub-intervals (depending on the
accuracy required). For each sub-interval perform the following:
• Diagonalize the stress tensor at the borehole wall to ﬁnd the principal stresses.
• Find the critical well pressure by inserting the principal stresses into the failure
criterion.

4. The lowest admissible pw is the largest critical well pressure found from the iteration

in the step above.

4.6. Beyond failure initiation

Borehole failure is commonly observed as breakouts in the borehole wall. Fig. 4.15 shows
a typical example of a failure mode denoted “borehole elongation”, due to the extension of
the borehole cross-section in one direction. The stress conditions causing this cavity to fail
corresponded to case a in Table 4.1. The diagram in Fig. 4.13 is split in various sectors by
the dashed border lines where two principal stresses are equal. Each sector is associated
with a failure condition in Table 4.1. A typical mode of rupture is associated with each
sector. These are described in Table 4.2 and Figs. 4.16–4.18 for the most relevant cases.

The orientation of breakouts due to failure of type a are related to the orientation of the
horizontal stresses, as discussed in Section 4.5.3. This connection is used in the ﬁeld for
determining the direction of the stresses, see further discussion in Section 8.3.2.

are isotropic.

The criteria for the initiation of borehole failure discussed in Section 4.5 only deﬁne
the initiation of borehole failure, and do not reveal the consequences of failure initiation,
which is of course of equal interest.

An idea of the development of borehole failure can be obtained by tracing a potential
failure plane from the borehole wall into the formation. We here choose the simplest case
of a linearly elastic formation and isotropic formation stresses, and assume pw < σh. The
orientation of a potential failure plane at a distance r from the borehole centre is given by
the orientation of the largest and smallest principal stress (σθ and σr, respectively), and the
failure angle β (which is related to the coefﬁcient of internal friction, see Section 2.3.1).
The situation is shown schematically in Fig. 4.19. The plane proceeds in the direction

and C1 is a constant. (The coefﬁcient of internal friction μ was deﬁned in Eq. (2.6).) The
±-sign in Eq. (4.128) arises because we have an alternate failure plane which is the mirror
image about the σr-direction of the one indicated in the ﬁgure.

Fig. 4.20 shows a set of curves as given by Eq. (4.128). There are clear similarities in
the crack patterns of Figs. 4.15 and 4.20. In Fig. 4.20, the number of failure planes and the
positions of the failure plane initiations (determined by the constant C1) were deliberately
chosen such as to make the ﬁgure resemble the observation. In a more extended analysis,
Zoback et al. (1985) connect these parameters to horizontal stress anisotropy. They also
suggest that the formation of such breakouts takes place in successive stages, where new
generations of failure planes develop outside the initial ones.

This suggestion is founded on an important aspect of the problem: the formation of a
failure plane causes a redistribution of the stresses around the borehole. Thus the conditions
for failure of the still intact parts of the borehole wall are being altered. Unfortunately, this
alteration also implies a reduction in the symmetry of the problem so that calculation of
the stresses becomes more complicated.

Redistribution of stresses and a reduction of stress state symmetry may even occur prior
to the formation of shear failure planes, if the symmetric deformation becomes unstable

STRESSES AROUND BOREHOLES. BOREHOLE FAILURE CRITERIA

relative to a surface buckling (Vardoulakis et al., 1988). Due to the reduced symmetry, the
complexity of the problem rises quickly, and numerical techniques are normally needed
for further modelling.

The failure process also involves opening of cracks oriented parallel to the major princi-
pal stress (or—more precisely—oriented with their normals parallel to the minor principal
stress), as discussed in Section 6.4.4. In a situation corresponding to case a, Table 4.1,
these cracks will be oriented parallel to the borehole wall. The opening and growth of
these cracks is by some authors considered as the fundamental fracture mechanism for
breakout formation in boreholes (Zheng et al., 1988; Ewy and Cook, 1989).

Theoretical simulations based on this consideration also resulted in elongated boreholes
similar to Fig. 4.15. The simulations further gave the important result that the elongated
borehole becomes stable when it has reached a speciﬁc shape. This shape depends on the
actual combination of stresses and strength, and also on the stress path.

In these simulations, a breakout is initiated as a slab of rock covering a certain angle
of the borehole wall is spalled off. This causes further stress concentrations in front of the
spalled region, and further spalling takes place within this sector of the borehole. Thus,
once a breakout is initiated within a sector, it will not become wider, but will deepen until
it reaches its stable shape.

4.6.1. A simple plasticity model

Stabilization of the borehole after failure initiation can also be described analytically, given
some simplifying assumptions. We shall here discuss a simple model, in which the rock is
assumed to behave according to the linear elastic/ideally plastic model described in Sec-
tion 2.8.1 (Fig. 2.24). Rock failure is in this model associated with the transition from
elastic to plastic behaviour. This transition does not involve the development of failure
planes, hence the symmetry of the stress state is preserved after failure.

Consider the situation discussed in Section 4.5.1, with a low well pressure. If the stress
state at the borehole wall fulﬁls the failure criterion, there will be a zone surrounding the
borehole where the rock acts as a plastic material. Outside this region the material remains
elastic. In the outer, elastic region the general solutions Eqs. (4.35) and (4.36) are still
valid (although the coefﬁcients of integration will change). In the inner, “plastic zone”, the
equation of equilibrium (4.28) is valid, but the principal stresses must also satisfy a yield
criterion.

The Tresca criterion

To illustrate the main principles with as simple mathematics as possible, we ﬁrst use the
Tresca criterion (Eq. (2.5)). We assume that σθ and σr will be the largest and smallest
principal stresses in the plastic zone. The Tresca criterion then requires

σθ − σr = C0

(4.130)

BEYOND FAILURE INITIATION

in the plastic zone. Introducing Eq. (4.130) into Eq. (4.28) we have

Eqs. (4.132) and (4.133) apply in the plastic zone, Rw < r < Rp, where Rp is the radius
of the plastic zone.

Outside the plastic zone, r > Rp, the elastic solutions given by Eqs. (4.35) and

The stress distribution around the borehole is shown in Fig. 4.21. Although this solution
has been obtained through a series of simplifying assumptions, it illustrates the general
features of the plastic zone concept. It will, however, become clear below that the Tresca
based solution above is not even approximately accurate in frictional materials.

The Mohr–Coulomb criterion

The calculation steps are essentially the same for the Mohr–Coulomb criterion, although
the formulas become more complex. As above, we assume that σr is the minimum stress
and σθ the maximum stress. For simplicity, we assume pf = 0. The generalization to a con-
stant pore pressure is however simple. We write the Mohr–Coulomb criterion (Eq. (2.22))
in the elastic zone on the form

where k = tan2 β and β is the failure angle.

The stress distribution around the borehole, assuming a friction angle of 30° is shown in
Fig. 4.22. Note that the extent of the plastic zone is considerably smaller than for the Tresca
case. Fig. 4.23 illustrates how the radius of the plastic zone depends on the well pressure.
Observe that the extent of the plastic zone is reduced as the friction angle increases.

The axial stress σz is more tricky to determine. More sophisticated models indicate that
the plastic region consists of two zones; in the inner zone the axial stress is equal to the
tangential stress, while in the outer zone all three principal stresses may differ.

The models presented above are simpliﬁcations, since both are based on ideal plas-
ticity, and do not take properly into account how the plastic strain changes the yield
criterion. More realistic models need to incorporate a description of plastic ﬂow and hard-
ening/softening, and necessarily become signiﬁcantly more complicated than the simple
models sketched here. Although the Mohr–Coulomb based equations above may be used
for quick overview calculations, more advanced models, normally implemented in Finite
Element codes, are necessary for precise calculations.

STRESSES AROUND BOREHOLES. BOREHOLE FAILURE CRITERIA

We have used the Tresca criterion, because it allows the main points to be demonstrated
with simple mathematics. Using a more realistic criterion, like the Mohr–Coulomb crite-
rion, adds signiﬁcantly to the complexity of the calculations. See Risnes et al. (1982).

4.7. Spherical coordinates

In petroleum related rock mechanics stress and strain solutions in spherical coordinates are
of much less importance than solutions in cylindrical coordinates. While the cylindrical
geometry is often a good approximation for a borehole, spherical cavities are to a less
extent a good approximation to real cases.

Still, solutions in spherical coordinates have been employed as a crude approximation
to producing cavities (see Section 10.2.3), and are also useful in some methods for the
estimation of surface subsidence (see Chapter 12).

We therefore give a short presentation of some basic equations here.

4.7.1. Basic equations

We use the standard convention, and denote the spherical coordinates by (r, θ, φ), and limit
ourselves to a situation with full spherical symmetry. The only deformation is then in the
radial direction, and the non-zero strains are given by (see Appendix D.1.2 for the complete
expressions for strain in spherical coordinates)

These stress solutions are sketched in Fig. 4.24. The thin dashed lines show the corre-
sponding distribution for a cylindrical hole (see Fig. 4.3). If we assume σo to be equal to
σh, the stress difference between the tangential and the radial stress at the cavity wall will
be 2(σh − pw) in the cylindrical hole case but only (3/2)(σh − pw) in the spherical cav-
ity case. It follows that a spherical cavity tends to be more stable than an open hole with
respect to shear failure.

where 4π r2 is the area of a sphere of radius r. All the other parameters are the same as in
Eq. (4.61). If we assume that the ﬂow rate is independent of r, the ﬂuid pressure distribution
is given by

Solving the displacement equation, the steady state solutions for ﬂuid ﬂow into the cavity
can then be written:

(σo − pw) − 2η(pfo − pw)

As for the cylindrical hole the stresses at the free surface are the same as in the no-ﬂow
case, except that the tangential stress has an additional term due to pressure drawdown.
This term is exactly the same as derived for the cylindrical vertical well.

Elastic wave propagation in rocks

175

Elastic waves are mechanical disturbances that propagate through a material. Such waves
are able to travel over very long distances through the Earth, and thus bring us information
about parts of the formations that are otherwise inaccessible. In seismic surveys, elastic
waves are generated at the surface, and the echoes from various layers in the formations
below are used to map the structure of the underground. Earthquakes are generated by
abrupt failure processes and propagate as elastic waves.

Elastic waves in air and water are usually called acoustic waves, or sound waves. These
terms are often used about elastic waves in rocks too. Elastic waves in rocks propagate with
a velocity that is given by elastic stiffnesses and the density of the rock. These parameters
depend on other parameters such as porosity. Thus elastic waves also provide a method by
which speciﬁc formation parameters can be estimated in the ﬁeld.

As we proceed, we shall see that this evaluation is not straightforward—for example,
the stiffness probed by an elastic wave is generally different from the static stiffness. How-
ever, the fact that elastic waves are mechanical disturbances means that there has to be a
fundamental connection between rock acoustics and rock mechanics.

In this chapter we ﬁrst present the fundamentals of elastic wave propagation in porous
media (Sections 5.1–5.5). Section 5.6 addresses the main focus of this chapter: the con-
nection between rock acoustics and rock mechanics. Finally, we give some background to
understand sonic wave propagation in boreholes and seismic waves through the subsurface
(Sections 5.7–5.9).

5.1. The wave equation

When an elastic wave passes through a material, each part of the material is forced into
oscillating motion. Consider a volume element within the material. The element is pushed
by the adjacent element behind it, and accelerates. The movement causes the volume el-
ement to push on the next element in front of it. This way the movement is propagating
from volume element to volume element through the material as a wave.
Wave propagation is described mathematically by the wave equation. This equation fol-
lows directly from Newton’s second law of motion: Force = mass· acceleration. The force
(per unit volume) acting on a volume element due to the stress the adjacent elements exert
was derived in Chapter 1. The force Fx in the x-direction is given as (see Eq. (1.14)):

Fx = ∂σx

∂x

+ ∂τxy

+ ∂τxz

∂y

∂z

(5.1)

For simplicity, we shall ﬁrst consider a plane, unidirectional mode of deformation in the
x-direction. We shall further assume that the material is a ﬂuid, so that no shear forces can
exist, that is τxy = τxz = 0. The mass (per unit volume) is given as the material’s density

176

ELASTIC WAVE PROPAGATION IN ROCKS

ρ, and the acceleration is given as the second derivative (with respect to time t) of the
displacement u of the volume element. Newton’s second law of motion thus requires that

∂2u
∂t 2

ρ

= ∂σx

∂x

(5.2)

The stress σx can be expressed in terms of the displacement u according to Hooke’s law
(Eqs. (1.93)–(1.98)), which under the conditions assumed here (plane wave in x-direction,
which implies that ∂/∂y = ∂/∂z = 0; and ﬂuid, which implies that G = 0) becomes

σx = λ

∂u

∂x

(5.3)

Note that for a ﬂuid the Lamé coefﬁcient λ is equal to the bulk modulus. Combining
Eqs. (5.2) and (5.3), we obtain

∂2u
∂t 2

ρ

= λ

∂2u
∂x2

(5.4)

This is the wave equation for a plane wave propagating in the x-direction in a ﬂuid. The
solution of the wave equation has the form

u = uo ej(ωt−qx)

(5.5)

where j represents the imaginary unit. The real part of this expression describes a periodic
displacement in the x-direction, with amplitude uo. The complex formulation has been
chosen here because it is mathematically simpler to work with.

The periodic displacement is a wave which propagates in the x-direction, with angular
frequency ω, and wavenumber q. The angular frequency ω is related to the frequency f as

ω = 2πf

(5.6)
The wave described by Eq. (5.5) extends from −∞ to +∞ both in space and time. A dis-
placement pulse, which is limited in space and time, is described as a sum of waves like
Eq. (5.5), each with different angular frequency and different amplitude, such that the net
displacement vanishes for large values of |x| and |t|.
The displacement u(x, t ) represents the displacement of a volume element at position x
and time t, as the wave passes by. In this context, the volume element has been considered
as a particle, attached with “springs” to its neighbouring elements. The displacement is
therefore often called particle displacement. The displacement wave described by Eq. (5.5)
can also be considered as a pressure wave, through the relation between displacement and
stress given by Eq. (5.3).
Any two points x1 and x2, which are separated by a distance such that qx2 = qx1 + 2π,
will at all times have equal displacement according to Eq. (5.5). The distance between two
such points, x2 − x1, is called the wavelength (λw). The wavelength is thus related to the
wavenumber as

(5.7)
The term (ωt − qx) in the exponent of expression (5.5) is called the phase of the wave. If
we follow the wave, locked on to a ﬁxed displacement like a surfer on a sea wave, we move

λw

q = 2π

P- AND S-WAVES

177

with a velocity v = x/t such that the phase (ωt − qx) remains constant. This velocity is
called the phase velocity, and is related to the angular frequency, the wavenumber and the
wavelength as

v = ω

q

= λwf

(5.8)

Inserting Eq. (5.5) into Eq. (5.4) and solving for ω/q, we ﬁnd that the phase velocity is
given by the elastic stiffness and the density as

(cid:28)

v =

λ

ρ

(5.9)

Thus, we have derived the general result that the phase velocity of an elastic wave is propor-
tional to the square root of an elastic modulus, and inversely proportional to the square root
of the density. This result provides our basis for using elastic waves to explore mechanical
properties of rocks.

The phase velocity is the velocity at which the phase of an elastic wave travels. Elastic
waves in ﬂuids and gases are usually called sound waves, or acoustic waves, and the phase
velocity is usually called the sound velocity. For fresh water, the elastic modulus λ =
Kf ≈ 2.25 GPa and the density ρ ≈ 1.0 g/cm3 (where both depend on temperature
and pressure), hence the sound velocity is 1500 m/s, according to Eq. (5.9). For dry air
under normal atmospheric conditions, λ ≈ 0.14 MPa (adiabatic value; see Section 1.5)
and ρ ≈ 0.0012 g/cm3, thus the sound velocity is 343 m/s.
As shown above, the deﬁnition of the phase velocity is associated with a wave which
extends to inﬁnity in space and time. In practice, we usually work with acoustic signals in
the form of pulses of ﬁnite duration. The velocity of a pulse, or equivalently, the velocity
of the wave energy, is called the group velocity, and is given as

vgroup = ∂ω

∂q

(5.10)

By comparing Eqs. (5.8) and (5.10) we see that if the phase velocity varies with the
frequency—a phenomenon called dispersion—the group and phase velocities will be dif-
ferent.

5.2. P- and S-waves

We now proceed to a more general case, and allow the material to possess a shear stiffness
so that shear forces may exist. That is, we shall look at elastic wave propagation in an
isotropic solid. Starting with Newton’s second law of motion, and the general expression
(5.1) for the force, we ﬁnd the wave equation for displacement u in the x-direction

(Note that the symbol v here represents displacement in y-direction.) A general solution of
this equation is

u = uo ej(ωt−qˆl·(cid:5)r)

The vector (cid:5)r has the components x, y and z, while ˆl is a unit vector parallel to the di-
rection of wave propagation. The components lx, ly and lz will be the direction cosines
(see Eqs. (1.27)–(1.29)) of the propagation vector. Equations similar to Eq. (5.12) can be
derived for particle displacement in the y- and z-directions. In general, these are coupled
equations in u, v and w, however there are two relatively straightforward solutions which
can be derived from Eq. (5.12). First we search for a solution where the wave propagation
is parallel to the displacement u (that is, lx = 1; ly = lz = v = w = 0):

(5.13)

u = uo ej(ωt−qx)

(5.14)

Such a wave is called a longitudinal wave, or alternatively a compressional wave, as it
involves a periodic compression of the material. It is also often termed a primary wave, a
name which originates from studies of earthquakes.
Since we are now considering a plane wave propagating parallel to the x-axis, we have
∂/∂y = ∂/∂z = 0, and Eq. (5.12) reduces to

ρω2 = q2(λ + 2G)

The phase velocity is

vp = ω

q

(5.15)

(5.16)

The subscript p denotes that this is a primary wave.
Eq. (5.12) also has other solutions. For instance, it is possible to establish a mode of
motion in which the particles are displaced only in the x-direction (that is, u (cid:8)= 0, v =
w = 0), while the wave is propagating as a plane wave in the y-direction (which implies
∂/∂x = ∂/∂z = 0). The solution is then

u = uo ej(ωt−qy)

Inserting this into Eq. (5.12), we ﬁnd

Fig. 5.1. Particle motion in P-wave and S-wave propagation.

The subscript s denotes that this is the velocity of a secondary wave. Such a wave is also
called a transversal wave, or alternatively a shear wave, since it involves a periodic shear-
ing of the material. The motion of the volume elements (or “particles”) in a material during
propagation of compressional and shear waves is illustrated in Fig. 5.1. By comparing
Eqs. (5.16) and (5.19), and remembering that ν > −1 (see Section 1.4), we see that vp is
always larger than vs in an isotropic, linearly elastic solid.

The two solutions we found to Eq. (5.12), the compressional wave and the shear wave,
are the only types of waves that exist for an isotropic, homogeneous solid. For convenience,
these are often denoted P-wave and S-wave, representing the primary and secondary waves,
respectively. Also in this area there is a divergence in the use of names: In physics and rock
mechanics “acoustic waves” as well as “elastic waves” means both P- and S-waves. In
seismics, “acoustic waves” means only P-waves, while “elastic waves” means both P- and
S-waves.

The direction of particle motion is called the polarization of the wave. For any given
direction of wave propagation, there only exists one type of waves with polarization par-
allel to the direction of propagation (the P-wave), and one type of waves with polarization
normal to the direction of propagation (the S-wave). (Strictly speaking, two independent
S-waves exist for a given direction of propagation, since the polarization can be in any di-
rection in the plane normal to the direction of propagation. In an isotropic solid, however,
these S-waves are equivalent in all respects except for the polarization.)

By inverting Eqs. (5.16) and (5.19), we can express the elastic coefﬁcients in terms of

the phase velocities:

Further relations can be established by use of Table 1.1. Note that

(5.25)

where H is the uniaxial compaction modulus (also referred to as plane wave modulus,
or P-wave modulus; see Section 1.3) Eqs.(5.20)–(5.25) were derived for a linearly elas-
tic, isotropic and homogeneous material, and show how values for elastic moduli can be
obtained from measurements of acoustic velocities in such a material. Rocks are usually
neither isotropic nor homogeneous, nor are they linearly elastic, and we shall see later
(Section 5.6) that this complicates the relations between static elastic moduli and acoustic
velocities.

5.3. Elastic waves in porous materials

The elastic response of a porous material may be signiﬁcantly affected by the presence of
a pore ﬂuid. In poorly consolidated sediments, the P-wave velocity for a water saturated
material can be several times larger than it is when the material is dry. Qualitatively, we
can explain this as a consequence of the added resistance against compression provided by
the pore ﬂuid. For more competent materials, or materials under high conﬁning pressure,
the frame stiffness is higher and the contribution of the pore ﬂuid is relatively less, hence
the effect of saturation is much smaller. As saturation also implies an increase in density, it
may even result in a reduction of the P-wave velocity for a stiff rock. Saturation is assumed
not to affect the shear modulus for a permeable rock (see Section 1.6.2), hence it usually
results in a small decrease in velocity for S-waves.

Clearly, the impact of the pore ﬂuid on the velocities is strongly related to the porosity
of the rock. A simple assumption, that has been frequently used for interpretation of well
logs, is that the interval transit time (which is the inverse of the P-wave velocity) is related
linearly to the porosity, according to the time average equation (Wyllie et al., 1958):

(5.26)

vp

vﬂuid

+ 1 − φ

vsolid

vﬂuid and vsolid denote the P-wave velocities of the pore ﬂuid and the solid grain mater-
ial, respectively. The equation has an empirical basis (it is theoretically valid in the high
frequency limit for a material consisting of layers of ﬂuid and non-porous solid), and it
works with reasonable accuracy for several practical purposes. If the lithology (and hence
vsolid) is known, it can be used to estimate the porosity, or alternatively—it can be used for
identiﬁcation of the lithology if the porosity can be estimated by other means. The equa-
tion is not applicable for predicting the effect of saturation, however, nor can it be used for
S-waves.

5.3.1. Biot’s theory of elastic wave propagation

In Chapter 1 we applied Biot’s theory of poroelasticity to describe the effect of the pore
ﬂuid on the elastic properties of porous materials. The same formalism may also be used

ELASTIC WAVES IN POROUS MATERIALS

181

to describe elastic wave propagation in saturated rocks (Biot, 1962; Stoll, 1974). The pro-
cedure for establishing the wave equation and deriving the velocities is analogues to that of
Sections 5.1 and 5.2, however we now have to account for the pore pressure pf in addition
to the external stress. Also, we have to take into account that the displacement of the ﬂuid
(uf) may be different from the displacement of the solid material (us).

Considering longitudinal motion parallel to the x-axis, and following the same approach

as in Section 5.1 we ﬁnd that Newton’s second law of motion requires that

φρf

∂2uf
∂t 2

+ (1 − φ)ρs

∂2us

∂x

(5.27)

We now differentiate with respect to x on both sides of the equation, introduce the strain
parameters εx, ζ (from Eq. (1.134)) and H (from Eq. (1.237)). As we are considering only
wave motion in the x-direction, we have ∂/∂y = ∂/∂z = 0. Expressing the stress σx in
terms of the strains according to Eq. (1.136) we ﬁnd that Eq. (5.27) may be written as

∂2

∂t 2 (−ρfζ + ρεx ) = ∂2

∂x2 (H εx − Cζ )

Here ρ, deﬁned as

ρ = φρf + (1 − φ)ρs

(5.28)

(5.29)

is the bulk density of the porous medium. Eq. (5.28) is a wave equation, similar to Eq. (5.4),
although we here use strain rather than displacement as the variable. However, Eq. (5.28)
has two variables (ζ and εx), hence we need one more equation. Turning to the movement
of the ﬂuid, we ﬁnd according to Eqs. (1.229) and (1.230) that the net effective force (per
unit area) acting on the ﬂuid part of a volume element is

ELASTIC WAVE PROPAGATION IN ROCKS

1. The pore ﬂuid does not ﬂow strictly in the direction of the pore pressure gradient, but
is constrained to follow the pore channel network. To compensate for this, the second
term on the left hand side of Eq. (5.32) is multiplied by a parameter T , called the
tortuosity. The tortuosity is a measure of the twistedness of the pore channels. Given
a porous sample with thickness L, the pore ﬂuid has to travel a distance Le > L to
penetrate the sample. The tortuosity is deﬁned as T = (Le/L)2. Thus T (cid:2) 1. For
sandstone, T is typically in the range 2–3.

low frequency limit. Thus the solid and the ﬂuid are moving in phase (that is: together)
during the oscillatory movements caused by the elastic wave.

3 Gfr and K is given by Eq. (1.155).

(5.41)

Eqs. (5.39) and (5.41) describe the effect of saturation on elastic wave velocities, in the low
frequency limit.
To illustrate the predictions of the equations, we shall look at an example. In a water-
saturated sandstone, we have Kf ≈ 2.2 GPa, ρf ≈ 1.0 g/cm3 and ρs ≈ 2.7 g/cm3, while
for a dry rock we may assume Kf = ρf = 0. The frame moduli Kfr and Gfr are not speciﬁed
by the Biot theory, however these will vary with the porosity and the degree of cementation
(see Chapter 6). Various empirical relations between the frame moduli and porosity have
been presented. For this example, we choose to use the critical porosity relations. Fig. 5.2
illustrates how ﬂuid saturation affects the elastic velocities in the low frequency limit for
sandstones with various porosities, according to Eqs. (5.39), (5.41), (6.16) and (6.17). We
can see that saturation will lead to an increase in vp for soft (high porosity) rocks, while it
may lead to a slight decrease in vp for stiff rocks. We also see that saturation always leads to
a reduction in vs. The effect of saturation depends on the ratio between the frame stiffness
and the ﬂuid modulus, and an increase in vp may thus be seen also for low porosity rocks
if the frame stiffness is sufﬁciently low.

The frequency dependence of vp and vs is controlled by the term j v2

in Eqs. (5.38)
and (5.40). In the high frequency limit this term vanishes. For the shear wave, this gives
the solution

ELASTIC WAVE PROPAGATION IN ROCKS

By comparing Eq. (5.41) and (5.42) we see that the shear wave velocity will increase with
frequency. The effect is quite small—typically less than 3% from the low frequency limit
to the high frequency limit for tortuosity T = 3. The velocity increase is a result of the
coupling to the pore ﬂuid motion. It may be shown that ζo (cid:8)= 0 in the high frequency
limit, thus the pore ﬂuid is moving out of phase with the solid framework. The actual mass
involved in the wave motion is therefore reduced, and the velocity increases, as Eq. (5.42)
shows. This ﬂow of ﬂuid relative to the solid framework is often called “Biot ﬂow”.

For the P-wave, the solution is more complicated for higher frequencies. First of all,
Eq. (5.38) is a second degree equation in v2
p for ω > 0, and thus it has two solutions. The
largest root is the solution (5.39) in the low frequency limit. This is the “normal” P-wave
that is observed in seismic surveys and well logging. The expression for this solution in the
high frequency limit is somewhat complicated, however it can be shown that there is only
a marginal increase (typically less than 1 per cent) in velocity from the low frequency limit
to the high frequency limit in most cases. However, for very soft rocks (in the suspension
limit), the dispersion can be signiﬁcantly higher. In general, the dispersion is larger for
higher porosity and lower tortuosity.

The other solution is a so-called “slow wave” which is highly attenuated. At low fre-
quencies the wave does not exist as a propagating wave, however it is rather a diffusive
mode approaching ordinary (Darcy) ﬂow through the porous rock in the limit ω → 0. Al-
though the slow wave is usually not observed as a propagating wave, its existence has been
proven in laboratory experiments (ﬁrst time by Plona, 1980) which provides justiﬁcation
of the basis of the Biot theory.

5.3.2. Dispersion due to local ﬂow

In reality, the actual P-wave dispersion is higher than predicted by Biot’s theory. It is
assumed that this is related to thin cracks in the solid framework (at grain contacts, for
instance). At low frequencies, the ﬂuid pressure within these thin cracks will be equal to
the pore pressure outside the cracks, and the cracks will thus be a part of the pore space in
Biot’s model. At high frequencies, the ﬂuid pressure within the thin cracks will not be able
to follow the rapid oscillations of the pore pressure outside. The cracks will then effectively
be sealed off and no longer be a part of the pore space in Biot’s model (which requires that
the entire pore space is connected). As thin, sealed, ﬂuid-ﬁlled cracks are almost incom-
pliant (see Section 6.4), the effective stiffness of the solid framework will thus increase at
higher frequencies.

The thin cracks tend to be closed at high external stresses. Thus, we may expect to ﬁnd
a relation between the bulk and shear moduli of the framework in the high frequency limit
and the effective bulk modulus of the dry rock at high external pressure (Mavko and Jizba,
1991). The dispersion effect caused by the local ﬂow is usually comparable to or larger
than the effect predicted by the Biot theory alone.

5.4. Attenuation

The waves described in Sections 5.1 and 5.2 are waves propagating with plane wavefronts
without any loss of energy, so that the amplitude remains constant. In reality, the amplitude

ATTENUATION

185

of an elastic wave that travels through a rock will be reduced as the wave propagates. We
say that the wave is attenuated. This will partly be due to geometrical spreading caused
by a non-planar wavefront, partly due to scattering of wave energy in other directions, and
partly due to transformation of wave energy into other forms of energy (absorption).

The amplitude reduction is a certain fraction of the amplitude itself, hence the amplitude
will fall off exponentially with travelled distance. For a plane wave propagating in the
positive x-direction, the amplitude will thus fall off as

u = u0 e

−αx

(5.43)
−1], but it is

(5.44)

where α is a measure of the attenuation. The unit for α is inverse length [m
often referred to in decibel per metre [dB/m]:

α [dB/m] ≡( 20 log10 e )α [m

−1] ≈8.686 α [m

−1]

The quality factor Q (often called the Q-factor, for short) is another parameter that is
frequently used as a measure for attenuation. The Q-factor is inversely proportional to α,
hence a high Q-factor implies low attenuation and vice versa. It is deﬁned as

Q = ω
2αv

Another measure for attenuation is the loss tangent δ, deﬁned as

δ = π

Q

(5.45)

(5.46)

While α represents the loss per unit length, the loss tangent is a measure for the loss per
wavelength. Measured Q-factors vary strongly with conditions and type of rock. Fig. 5.3
shows typical laboratory data (ultrasonic frequencies) for sandstone. Reliable data for at-
tenuation is usually hard to obtain, and the amount of data reported in the literature is
limited.

et al., 1979; with permission from SEG.)

186

ELASTIC WAVE PROPAGATION IN ROCKS

Geometrical spreading is associated with the radius of curvature for the wavefront. For
a wave propagating spherically from a point source, the radius of curvature is equal to the
radius (r) of the sphere that the wavefront constitutes at the time of investigation. The am-
plitude then falls off inversely proportional to r. For a plane wave, the radius of curvature
is inﬁnite. If the radius of curvature R is so large that it can be considered as a constant
over the distance we are considering, the amplitude falls off with travelled distance x as

u = u0 e

−x/R

(5.47)

Thus geometrical spreading causes an apparent attenuation. Notice that the radius of cur-
vature for a wavefront may be altered when the wave crosses an interface and enters into
a different material where the phase velocity is different. This is a consequence of refrac-
tion, which will be discussed in Section 5.7. The radius of curvature will also be affected
by anisotropy. Under special conditions (usually caused by reﬂection at a curved interface)
the radius of curvature may become negative. This corresponds to a spherical wave trav-
elling inwards, towards the sphere centre. As Eq. (5.47) shows, the amplitude will then
increase as the wave propagates.

Geometrical spreading is mostly independent of the material the wave propagates
through. More interesting to us is attenuation which depends explicitly on the rock prop-
erties. Several mechanisms are of importance—which ones are most important depend on
the conditions: lithology, saturation, frequency, strain amplitude etc. The most important
mechanisms are:

1. Solid friction (Walsh, 1966; Johnston et al., 1979). Elastic waves induce displace-
ments between grains or crack faces. Due to friction, this implies that a part of the
mechanical energy of the acoustic wave is absorbed and transformed into heat, and
the wave is attenuated. Absorption due to friction gives a Q-factor which is indepen-
dent of frequency, that is:

QSF = const.;

αSF ∝ ω

(5.48)

Since the static friction increases with increasing normal stress, the solid friction
losses decrease with increasing external stress on a rock. Solid friction has tradition-
ally been considered to be the dominating attenuation mechanism in rocks, however
recent studies indicate that ﬂuid mobility is a more signiﬁcant mechanism (Batzle et
al., 2006).

2. Local (squirt) ﬂow (Mavko and Nur, 1979; Murphy et al., 1984; Jones, 1986;
Mavko and Jizba, 1991). These losses only occur in partially or fully saturated rocks.
The periodic contraction and expansion in a rock when an acoustic wave passes by
also involves contraction and expansion of the pore space. Due to local variations
in shape, the volumetric strain of the pore space will differ considerably over short
distances. For instance, a ﬂat crack may suffer large volumetric deformations while
a spherical pore close by only experiences minor volumetric strains. This gives rise
to local variations in pore pressure, which will make the pore ﬂuid ﬂow back and
forth following the oscillating deformations. The energy required for the ﬂuid ﬂow
oscillations are taken from the acoustic wave, thus elastic energy is absorbed and
transformed into other forms of energy and the wave is attenuated.

ATTENUATION

187

Fig. 5.4. Sketch of stiffness (solid line) and Loss tangent (dashed line) versus frequency for a liquid saturated
grain to grain contact. (After Murphy et al., 1984; with permission from AIP.)

The attenuation effect is most pronounced in a frequency range where the period
of the oscillations matches the characteristic relaxation time for the local ﬂuid ﬂow.
At lower frequencies, the ﬂuid has sufﬁcient time to ﬂow so that the pore pressure
is almost equalized at any time. At high frequencies, the oscillations are so quick
that the ﬂuid has no time to move. Deformations of the most compliant parts of
the pore space will then be counteracted by local pore pressure build-ups. The rock
will effectively be stiffer, so that the velocity of the elastic wave will be higher, as
described in Section 5.3.2. Fig. 5.4 shows schematically how attenuation and velocity
change with frequency due to local ﬂow at a grain to grain contact. The transition
frequency is inversely proportional to the ﬂuid viscosity. For water-saturated rocks
the transition frequency is typically a few kHz.

3. Macroscopic (Biot) ﬂow (Biot, 1956a, 1956b; 1962). An elastic wave may also in-
duce ﬂuid ﬂow on a macroscopic scale, as described in Section 5.3.1. Like the local
(squirt) ﬂow, the ﬂuid ﬂow oscillations will suck energy out of the acoustic wave,
which is thus attenuated. There will also be a velocity dispersion and a peak in at-
tenuation associated with the macroscopic ﬂow. An expression for the attenuation
can be derived from the imaginary part of the solution of Eq. (5.38), and the relation
outlined below (Eq. (5.50)). The transition frequency is proportional to the ﬂuid vis-
cosity, and inversely proportional to the permeability of the rock. At low frequencies
ω at high frequencies. For water-saturated rocks, the transition
frequency is typically about 100 kHz. The effect is however rather small: The peak
attenuation has a minimum Q-value of about 100.

α ∝ ω2, while α ∝ √

4. Scattering. Heterogeneities in velocity or density within a rock will result in Rayleigh
scattering when an elastic wave passes by. The scattered energy is not absorbed and
transformed into other forms of energy, however the primary pulse loses energy and
is thus attenuated. The effect is stronger the larger the impedance contrast of the
heterogeneity is, thus pores are strong scatterers, also for P-waves if the pores are
empty (that is: the material is dry). Cracks and fractures may also be strong scat-

188

ELASTIC WAVE PROPAGATION IN ROCKS

terers, unless both the direction of propagation and the polarization are parallel to
the crack/fracture. Scattering is strong when the wavelength (λw) is comparable or
smaller than the size (a) of the heterogeneity. For longer wavelengths, attenuation
falls off quickly with decreasing frequency:

αscatt. ∝ ω/Qscatt. ∝ a3ω4

for λw > a

(5.49)

In sandstones, scattering on grains and pores is dominating in the MHz range, and
effectively prohibits wave propagation over distances longer than a few centimetres at
these (and higher) frequencies. At lower frequencies, scattering on grains and pores
can be neglected, however scattering on cracks and fractures may still be signiﬁcant.
Scattering loss usually decreases with increasing external stress, since conﬁnement
tends to close cracks and fractures in the rock. Scattering also reduces the velocity.
This is further discussed in Chapter 6.

Comparing Eqs. (5.43) and (5.5) we ﬁnd that the attenuation coefﬁcient α can be asso-

ciated with the imaginary part of the wavenumber q, that is:

α = −Im[q]

(5.50)

According to the wave equation, the wavenumber is complex if the corresponding elas-
tic modulus is complex. Thus the phase velocity is related to the real part of the elastic
modulus and attenuation to the imaginary part. Denoting by C the relevant elastic modulus
(which may for instance be (λ + 2G) as in Eq.(5.15) , or G as in Eq. (5.18), etc.), the
general relations are

ρv2 ≈ Re[C]
≈ Im[C]

Re[C]
Q

(5.51)

(5.52)
−2 (cid:11) 1. Note that this link
provided that the attenuation is sufﬁciently small, so that Q
between the imaginary part of the elastic modulus and the attenuation is not valid for
apparent attenuation due to geometrical spreading.

The real and imaginary parts of the elastic constants are related to each other, accord-
ing to the physical principle called causality (the principle that a reaction can never occur
before its cause). A speciﬁc result of this is that—within the frames of linearity—the ve-
locity can only be independent of frequency if the corresponding attenuation is zero. That
is: no velocity dispersion implies no attenuation. Fig. 5.4 shows a typical relation between
attenuation and velocity dispersion in accordance with causality.

Finally, consider a simple mechanical system consisting of a spring in parallel with a
viscous dash pot element coupled in series to another spring (Fig. 1.27, except for the
right-hand dash pot element). This could represent a rock which responds to stress changes
with some degree of transient creep. An elastic modulus C of this rock can be expressed
as (see Eqs. (1.91), (1.248), (1.249) and (5.33))

C = σ

ANISOTROPY

189

Thus, the elastic modulus of this rock is complex and the elastic wave corresponding to
C will be attenuated. For sufﬁciently low frequencies, such that ω < (κ1 + κ2)/χ, the
imaginary part of C will be proportional to ω and consequently 1/Q ∝ ω according to
Eq. (5.52). For higher frequencies we ﬁnd that 1/Q ∝ 1/ω. On the other hand the real part
of C is seen to approach κ1κ2/(κ1+κ2) when ω → 0 while it approaches κ2 when ω → ∞.
Thus the model describes dispersion and a corresponding peak in attenuation, similar to
Fig. 5.4. This example also illustrates the relationship between creep and attenuation.

5.5. Anisotropy

Most sedimentary rocks are to some extent anisotropic. This was discussed in Section 1.7,
regarding directional dependence of rock stiffness. This directional dependence does of
course also affect the acoustic properties of the rock. To account for this, we need to es-
tablish a generalized version of the wave equation and its solutions. We shall here present
an outline of the procedure and the results. For a detailed discussion, see for instance Auld
(1990).

5.5.1. The Christoffel equation

As described in Section 5.1, the wave equation can be established by looking at the sta-
bility of a volume element. For this general case, we choose not to simplify in terms of
longitudinal or transversal wave motion from the start. Using the generalized form for the
stress (Eq. (1.195)), we see that Newton’s second law requires:

We assume that the solutions are of the type (ref. Eq. (5.13)):

Combining Eqs. (5.54) and (5.55) with (1.195), using the expressions (1.74) and (5.8), we

that is if:

(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8) = 0

This is a compact way of writing a rather lengthy equation. The expanded expression for
the determinant of a 3 × 3 matrix is shown in Appendix C.2.10. It turns out that Eq. (5.59)
is a cubic equation for v2. Thus, we shall in general expect to ﬁnd 3 independent so-
lutions for the wave velocity. One of these represents a P-wave (or, in the most general
case, a quasi-P-wave, meaning a wave with polarization nearly parallel to the direction
of propagation). The other two represent S-waves with mutually orthogonal polarizations
(or quasi-S-waves, meaning waves with polarizations nearly normal to the direction of
propagation).

To demonstrate how velocities and polarizations can be found from these equations,
we shall consider the special case of transversal isotropy (see Section 1.7.2). Switching
to the Voigt notation (see Appendix C.10), and choosing the z-axis as the unique axis,
the stiffness matrix is given by expression (1.221). The Christoffel equation (5.56) then
becomes, in expanded form:

The direction cosines l1, l2, and l3 deﬁnes the direction of wave propagation, and the par-
ticle displacement vector (cid:5)uo deﬁnes the polarization. The next step is to choose a direction
of wave propagation that we want to study. For simplicity, we ﬁrst choose the x-direction,
for which l1 = 1, l2 = l3 = 0. The Christoffel equation (5.60) then simpliﬁes to:

and the requirement that the determinant of this matrix shall be zero becomes

(C11 − ρv2)(C66 − ρv2)(C44 − ρv2) = 0

(5.62)
This is a cubic equation for v2, as it should be, hence it has three solutions. One solution is

v2 = C11/ρ. Introducing this result for v into Eq. (5.61) shows that we have to have uo
(cid:8)= 0 as the only non-trivial solution for the particle displacement. Thus,
uo

for this particular solution, both the direction of wave propagation and the polarization is
in the x-direction. This wave is therefore a P-wave.
Another solution of Eq. (5.62) is v2 = C66/ρ. Introducing this result into Eq. (5.61)
(cid:8)= 0 as the only non-trivial solution. For this solution, the
we ﬁnd uo
1
polarization is thus in the y-direction, that is normal to the direction of wave propagation,
hence this is an S-wave. The last of the three solutions is v2 = C44/ρ. Eq.(5.61)
tells
us that this is also an S-wave, polarized in the z-direction. Thus, there are three different
waves that can travel in the x-direction in this medium, one P-wave and two S-waves.

and two S-wave solutions, both with v2 = C44/ρ. Introducing the S-wave solution for v,
Eq. (5.63) only tells us that uo
2 may be non-zero.
Thus, for an S-wave travelling parallel to the unique axis, the velocity is independent of
the polarization.

1 and uo

For wave propagation in a general direction, the off-diagonal terms of the Christoffel
matrix no longer vanish and the solutions become more complicated mathematically. Typ-
ical for the transversely isotropic medium is that for any direction of wave propagation,
there exists one pure S-wave with polarization normal to the unique axis, plus one P-wave
and another S-wave. Except for wave propagation parallel or normal to the unique axis,
the last two waves will not have polarization exactly parallel or normal to the direction of
propagation, hence they will in general be a quasi P-wave and a quasi S-wave, respectively.
A full treatment of wave propagation in anisotropic media is beyond the scope of this

book. We refer the interested reader to for instance Auld (1990).

5.5.2. Weak anisotropy

Thomsen (1986) simpliﬁed the description of anisotropy considering transversely isotropic
rocks with weak anisotropy. His description is relevant for oilﬁeld rocks and the data avail-
able in ﬁeld situations, and has become widely applied. Thomsen introduced a new set of
parameters:

2C33

εTh = C11 − C33
γTh = C66 − C44
δTh = (C13 + C44)2 − (C33 − C44)2

2C33(C33 − C44)

2C44

(5.64)

(5.65)

(5.66)

The wave velocities in a general direction in a transversely anisotropic material can be
derived from Eq. (5.59). When linearized in terms of the Thomsen parameters (5.64)–
(5.66), the expressions for the velocities take the relatively simple forms:

(cid:5)
vp(θ ) ≈ αTh(1 + δTh sin2 θ cos2 θ + εTh sin4 θ )
vsv(θ ) ≈ βTh
(εTh − δTh) sin2 θ cos2 θ
vsh(θ ) ≈ βTh(1 + γTh sin2 θ )

where αTh = √

ELASTIC WAVE PROPAGATION IN ROCKS

C44/ρ, and θ is the angle between the unique axis and
the direction of wave propagation. vsh is the velocity of the S-wave polarized normal to the
unique axis, and vsv is the velocity of the other S-wave (see Section 5.5.1).

εTh can be interpreted as the P-wave anisotropy and γTh as the S-wave anisotropy. How-
ever, for P-waves propagating at small angles to the unique axis the anisotropy will be
dominated by δTh. The special case where δTh = εTh is known as “elliptical anisotropy”.
It can be shown (Tsvankin, 1997; Mensch and Rasolofosaon, 1997) that, by making the
Thomsen parameters depend on the azimuth, these equations can also be applied for ma-
terials with even lower symmetry than transversely isotropy—provided that the anisotropy
is weak.

5.6. Rock mechanics and rock acoustics

At the beginning of this chapter, we argued that elastic waves may provide means to esti-
mate mechanical parameters of rocks. We shall here take a closer look at the links between
the parameters describing elastic waves, and the parameters describing rock mechanical
properties.

5.6.1. Static and dynamic moduli

Sound velocities depend explicitly on elastic moduli. This was shown in Section 5.2
(Eqs. (5.20)–(5.24). These relations imply that we for instance should obtain the same value
for E if we measure the acoustic velocities and the density and make use of Eq. (5.23), or
we measure stress and strain in a uniaxial compression test and make use of Eq. (1.91).
With knowledge about the P- and S-wave velocities and the density, for instance from well
logs or seismics, it should thus in principle be a simple job to obtain the elastic moduli
even if we do not have the possibility to perform rock mechanical tests.

In reality, this is not quite so simple. There is a wide range of experimental evidence
showing that the elastic moduli obtained from stress and strain measurements in a rock
mechanical test (“static moduli”) differ signiﬁcantly from those obtained from acoustic
velocities and density (“dynamic moduli”). Normally, the dynamic moduli are larger than
the corresponding static ones. The difference is largest for weak rocks, and is reduced with
increasing conﬁnement (King, 1970). In the relatively well cemented Berea sandstone, the
difference at a stress level corresponding to depth in the kilometre range is 20–30%. In a
weak sandstone, however, the difference can be an order of magnitude or more, depending
on the stress state. Fig. 5.5 shows as an example how the static and dynamic moduli changes
with the stress state in a relatively weak rock. These measurements were performed on a
dry sample.

The pore ﬂuid is a potential cause for the difference between static and dynamic mod-
uli in rocks. In a velocity measurement the deformation of the rock is undrained, which
implies that the pore ﬂuid contributes to the velocity (see Section 5.3.1). Thus the moduli
derived from velocity measurements on a saturated rock are likely to be higher than the

corresponding static moduli measured in a drained test. This effect does however not ex-
plain the large differences between static and dynamic moduli observed in soft dry rocks,
and we have to look for other causes.

Unloading-reloading cycles in a static test (Fig. 5.6) are somewhat intermediate be-
tween a normal static test and a velocity measurement, as the material will experience
similar stress cycles (with low amplitudes) when an acoustic wave passes by. In a set of
measurements on dry Castlegate sandstone, Plona and Cook (1995) demonstrated that the
elastic modulus derived from the slope of the stress–strain curve during such cycles ap-
proaches the corresponding elastic modulus derived from velocity measurements when the
amplitude of the cycles approaches zero. Thus the difference in strain amplitude explains
to some extent the difference between dynamic moduli and the static moduli measured
in unloading-reloading cycles. However, the material is usually much stiffer during an
unloading-reloading cycle than during initial loading (see Fig. 5.6), and it is the behaviour
during initial loading that is normally studied in standard rock mechanical tests.

To further understand the origin of the static-dynamic discrepancy, it is interesting to
notice that the static and dynamic moduli are equal for a homogeneous, elastic material
like steel (Ledbetter, 1993). Thus the physical origin of this discrepancy is likely to be
related to the heterogeneous microstructure of the rocks. It is furthermore to be expected
that much of the effect originates at the grain contacts, since the stress concentrations in the
contact areas may exceed the elasticity limit of the material even at low external stresses.
A quantitative model for the relations between static and dynamic moduli was formu-

lated by Fjær (1999), based on observations on weak sandstones:

Kstat =
Estat =

Kdyn

1 + (Pz + 2Pr )Kdyn
(1 − F )
1 + PzEdyn

Edyn

(5.70)

(5.71)

Here Kdyn and Edyn are the bulk modulus and Young’s modulus, respectively, obtained
from velocity measurements, while Kstat and Estat are the corresponding moduli obtained
from the slope of the relevant stress–strain curve during initial loading. The expressions
are related to a standard triaxial test, and the subscripts z and r refer to the axial and radial
directions of the test geometry. The difference between the static and dynamic moduli is
contained in the parameters Pi and F . Analyses of tests like the one shown in Fig. 5.5
have shown that Pi is largest at lower stress levels, while F increases with increasing
shear deformation. (Note that for F = 1 we haveE stat = 0 according to Eq. (5.71). This
represents the peak point in the stress–strain curve.)

It is suggested that Pi is predominantly a measure of a process which involves crushing
of asperities at the grain contacts, while F is associated with friction controlled sliding
along contact points or closed micro-cracks in the material during shear loading. Thus
the discrepancy between static and dynamic moduli in weak rocks is interpreted as being
caused by a series of local failure processes on a microscopic scale occurring during the
entire loading sequence.

5.6.2. Stress state and stress history

Sound velocities in rocks also depend on the state of stress. To some extent, this effect can
be ascribed to stress induced changes in porosity. However, this is not sufﬁcient to explain
the stress sensitivity of velocities in most rocks. Fig. 5.7 shows the typical behaviour for
a sandstone. The behaviour can be understood in terms of micro-cracks (much smaller
than the wavelength) that are opened or closed by the action of the stress. An open crack
strongly reduces the velocity of a wave if the crack is oriented normal to the direction of
propagation or polarization of the wave, while its effect on the velocity is only marginal
otherwise (see Section 6.4).

During hydrostatic loading the velocities increase uniformly, with a gradually diminish-
ing rate. This is to be expected due to closure of cracks which make the rock stiffer, or
similar processes which broadens or multiply grain contacts. These effects are discussed in
detail in Sections 6.3 and 6.4. During uniaxial loading, the velocities of waves with polar-
ization and/or direction of propagation parallel to the increasing load are seen to increase
initially, due to the same type of processes that causes increases in velocities during hy-
drostatic loading. Upon further loading, the velocities of waves with polarization and/or
direction of propagation normal to the minimum principal stress are seen to be reduced.
This is associated with the formation of tensile cracks (often illustrated as “wing cracks”
formed during frictional sliding of closed cracks, as shown in Section 6.4.4, Fig. 6.11).
Thus stress anisotropy induces acoustic anisotropy. The relevance of interpreting stress
induced velocity changes in sandstones in terms of changes in the occurrence of disconti-
nuities such as cracks, has been nicely demonstrated by Sayers (2002).

The impact of micro-cracks on acoustic wave propagation is also reﬂected in the atten-
uation, as the scattering losses due to such cracks can be signiﬁcant. Thus attenuation is
typically reduced with increasing conﬁning pressure, as can be seen from Fig. 5.3.

196

ELASTIC WAVE PROPAGATION IN ROCKS

Using observed acoustic anisotropy as a measure for stress anisotropy is however not
straightforward. This is partly due to the fact that also other effects—like ﬁne layering or
grain orientation—can cause anisotropy, and partly to the fact that rocks are usually formed
and cemented under stress. Stress induced anisotropy in uncemented sediments is a conse-
quence of static loading making the grain contacts stiffer (see Section 6.3). Different stress
in different directions thus induce different stiffness in different directions, which results in
acoustic anisotropy. The cementation process provides added stiffness to all grain contacts,
so the relative stiffening is largest for the weakly loaded ones. The characteristic signature
of the stress state is thus masked. Subsequent stress induced anisotropy is characteristic
for the stress changes occurring after cementation, rather than the current stress state. Thus
the stress history of a rock may have a signiﬁcant impact on the stress dependency of the
velocities.

For a core taken from a deep well, the major recent stress history is the unloading process
taking place during and after coring. The cement which was formed free from effective
stress at the grain contacts will be subjected to tensile stress as the grain contacts deform
when the load disappear. This will generate cracks which reduce the elastic stiffness and
thus also the acoustic velocities. When sufﬁcient stress is applied to the core in a laboratory
test, these cracks will close and the velocities will increase correspondingly. A signiﬁcant
part of the stress dependency of acoustic velocities observed in laboratory tests may there-
fore be related to core damage effects, and not be representative for the in situ behaviour.
This has been demonstrated through tests on synthetic sandstones cemented under stress
(Nes et al., 2002). The effect is illustrated in Fig. 5.8. Note that the velocity is quite insen-
sitive to small changes in the stress while the rock is still in the vicinity of its cementation
state, and that it drops signiﬁcantly upon extensive unloading. Upon reloading, as for a core
tested in the laboratory, the velocity increases with a rate that is lower than the decreasing

the cementation state (marked with a circle). The upper right curve could represent in situ loading (caused by
depletion), the upper left curve in situ unloading (caused by injection or coring), and the lower curve a laboratory

rate at the end of the unloading path, yet signiﬁcantly higher than the initial (“in situ”) rate
in the vicinity of the cementation stress (see also Chapter 7).

It was shown in Section 1.6.3 that the deformation of a porous, linear elastic rock is
controlled entirely by an effective stress (Eq. (1.168)) that accounts for the combined action
of the external stress and the pore pressure. It is tempting to assume that this principle is
also valid for acoustic velocities, however this is not the case in general. Often, but not
always, the velocities may depend on an effective stress

(cid:2) = σ − npf

σ

(5.72)

within a limited range of stress and pore pressure. The coefﬁcient n depends on the type of
wave as well as the type of ﬂuid, and may be larger as well as smaller than 1. In some cases
this principle is not applicable at all. One simple example is a linearly elastic material, for
which the frame moduli are stress independent (as will be the case for instance for a well
cemented rock not suffering from core damage). Since the P-wave velocity also depends
on the bulk modulus and density of the ﬂuid, which in turn depend on the ﬂuid pressure, it
is clear that the effects of changes in σ and pf are fundamentally different, and Eq. (5.72)
is not valid in this case.

5.6.3. Additional effects

Elastic wave propagation in rocks is also affected by other parameters, which we shall only
mention brieﬂy here.

Temperature

There is normally a slight reduction in velocities with increasing temperature. This ef-
fect is usually less than 5% for a 100 °C increase in temperature (Bourbie et al., 1987;
Christensen, 1982). The effect may be signiﬁcantly larger if one or more of the rock con-
stituents undergoes a phase transition within the actual temperature range, for instance if
the pore ﬂuid is freezing or melting. Attenuation is also reduced with increasing tempera-
ture. This effect appears to be somewhat larger than the temperature effect on the velocities
(Jones and Nur, 1983).

Partial saturation

Partial saturation may have a signiﬁcant effect on both velocities and attenuation. Consider
a rock saturated with water and gas. At low frequencies, the pore ﬂuid may be considered
as a suspension of gas bubbles in a liquid (at least if the water saturation Sw is larger than
about 20%). We may then assume that the gas pressure follows that of the water at any time,
and the effective ﬂuid bulk modulus Kf is then given by an equation similar to Eq. (1.132):

Eqs. (5.73)–(5.74), (5.39), (5.41) and (1.155) (solid lines), for a dataset representing a relatively weak rock at
low pressures and low frequency. The dashed line indicates the P-wave velocity for patchy saturation, while the
gray area indicates the range of possible values for the P-wave velocity for various ﬂuid distributions at higher
frequencies.

Kw and Kg are the bulk moduli of water and gas, respectively. Typically, Kg (cid:11) Kw, and
we thus have that Kf (cid:11) Kw unless Sw is very close to 1. The bulk density

(cid:13)

(cid:14)

ρ = ρs(1 − φ) + φ

Swρw + (1 − Sw)ρg

(5.74)

is much less sensitive to Sw, hence the net effect is that the P-wave velocity (Eq. (5.39))
drops dramatically when Sw falls below 1, and only picks up slowly as Sw continues to
decrease (Fig. 5.9). The S-wave depends only on ρ in addition to Gfr (which is not affected
by the degree of saturation, at least not for permeable materials at low frequencies), hence
the S-wave velocity is only marginally dependent on the saturation. For very low satura-
tion, capillary forces (see Section 2.6.2) may provide an additional stiffness that makes the
velocities increase.

At higher frequencies, the distribution of the water and gas in the pore space becomes
signiﬁcant. For instance, water trapped in thin cracks may effectively respond to compres-
sion with a stiffness close to Kw, and the velocities will be correspondingly higher (see also
Section 6.4). The distribution of water and gas is a result of the wetting properties of the
rock and the way the actual saturation was reached. Consequently, there is not a one-to-one
relationship between P-wave velocity and water saturation (Endres and Knight, 1989), but
rather a range of possible values for the velocity at each saturation level, as indicated by
the gray area on Fig. 5.9.

The water and the gas may also be separated on a larger scale, such that some areas are
fully water saturated while others are not (patchy saturation). The fully saturated areas will
behave as saturated, undrained rock if the pore pressure diffusion length is less than the
typical size (l) of the fully saturated areas, that is—if

where CD is the pore pressure diffusion constant (see page 48), and f is the frequency. The
dashed line in Fig. 5.9 indicates how the P-wave velocity changes with saturation for such
cases.

Similar behaviour may be seen for partially oil saturated rocks. Note however that oil
may contain signiﬁcant amounts of dissolved gas (“live oil”), which reduce the density as
well as the bulk modulus of the oil, and hence reduce the contrast between the oil and the
gas. Note also that for gases, both the bulk modulus and the density increases signiﬁcantly
with increasing pressure, hence the effect of partial saturation decreases with increasing
ﬂuid pressure.

The considerations above may also be used to estimate the behaviour of rock saturated
with water and oil. The effects of partial saturation are signiﬁcantly less in this case, how-
ever, since the differences in bulk modulus and density are much less for water and oil than
for water and gas.

Table 5.1 shows some typical values for pore ﬂuid properties, for a couple of pres-
sure/temperature combinations corresponding roughly to about 1500 m depth and 3000 m
depth, respectively. Note however that there are signiﬁcant variations in the properties of
oil and gas, depending on their chemical composition, as well as variations in pressure and
temperature conditions at a given depth. Also the properties of brine vary somewhat with
salinity and amount of dissolved gas. The brine properties listed in Table 5.1 represent a
salinity typical for sea water.

Chemical effects

The minerals of the rock framework may react chemically with the pore ﬂuid. In particu-
lar, chalk and clay minerals become soft or even dissolve in water (if the water is not in
chemical equilibrium with the minerals). This implies that ﬂuid substitution may actually
change the framework moduli (Kfr and Gfr), due to chemical effects. Hence the elastic
wave velocities, as well as the static elastic moduli, may be strongly sensitive to the type
of saturating ﬂuid (see also Section 2.6.3).

ELASTIC WAVE PROPAGATION IN ROCKS

5.7. Reﬂections and refractions

When an elastic wave hits a boundary of the medium it is travelling through, the wave may
be reﬂected—like light in a mirror, or refracted—like light at a water surface, or converted
into other types of elastic waves. Such boundaries, or interfaces between different parts of a
medium, are important for most aspects of rock acoustics. In particular, reﬂections at inter-
faces are the foundation of surface seismics, while sonic logging tools rely on refractions
for obtaining a wave path through the rock along the hole.

Consider ﬁrst the simple situation where a plane P-wave like (5.14) approaches a bound-
ary normal to the direction of propagation. The laws of physics require that
• the displacement normal to the boundary is continuous at the boundary,
• the stress normal to the boundary is continuous at the boundary.
To fulﬁl these requirements when the wave hits the boundary, two new waves are created
at the boundary: one reﬂected wave and one transmitted wave. We shall now see how these
physical continuity requirements can be used to identify the amplitude and phase of both
the reﬂected wave and the transmitted wave, relative to the amplitude and phase of the
initial wave. We denote by subscript 1 the parameters of the medium through which the
wave is initially travelling, and by subscript 2 the parameters of the medium on the other
side of the boundary. The three waves interacting at the boundary are then

ui = uo,i ej(ωt−q1x)
ur = uo,r ej(ωt+q1x) Reﬂected wave
ut = uo,t ej(ωt−q2x) Transmitted wave

Initial wave

The initial wave is travelling in medium 1 towards the boundary, the reﬂected wave is
travelling in medium 1 away from the boundary, and the transmitted wave is travelling in
medium 2 away from the boundary. Note that the frequency ω is the same in both media.
The two physical continuity requirements can now be expressed as

(cid:4)
(λ1 + 2G1)

∂ui
∂x

(cid:5)

ui + ur = ut
+ ∂ur

= (λ2 + 2G2)

∂ut
∂x

(5.77)
Positioning for simplicity the x-axis such that the interface is located at x = 0, introducing
the expressions for ui, ur and ut, and dividing by ejωt , we ﬁnd

∂x

(5.76)

(5.78)
(5.79)

uo,i + uo,r = uo,t

(λ1 + 2G1)(−jq1uo,i + jq1uo,r) = (λ2 + 2G2)(−jq2uo,t)

These are two equations with two unknowns, namely uo,r and uo,t. These equations are
complex, thus the equations give us both the amplitude and the phase of the reﬂected and
transmitted wave. Rather than presenting these expressions explicitly, we now introduce the
reﬂection coefﬁcient rpp, which expresses the stress amplitude of the reﬂected wave, and
the transmission coefﬁcient tpp, which expresses the stress amplitude of the transmitted
wave, both relative to the stress amplitude of the initial wave.

REFLECTIONS AND REFRACTIONS

201

Expressed in terms of particle displacement amplitudes, these coefﬁcients are deﬁned as

rpp = − uo,r
tpp = ρ2vp2

uo,i

ρ1vp1

uo,t
uo,i

(5.80)

(5.81)

Expressions for rpp and tpp can be found from Eqs. (5.78) and (5.79). Introducing further
Eqs. (5.8) and (5.16) the expressions take the following form:

rpp = ρ2vp2 − ρ1vp1
ρ2vp2 + ρ1vp1
tpp =
ρ2vp2 + ρ1vp1

2ρ2vp2

(5.82)

(5.83)

The product ρvp is called the acoustic impedance of the medium. Thus the reﬂection and
transmission coefﬁcients depend on the impedance contrast between the two media. Note
that rpp and tpp may be deﬁned in different ways, depending on the choice of coordinate
system and wave describing parameters. The deﬁnition used here implies that a compres-
sion is reﬂected as a compression if rpp > 0, while for rpp < 0 the reﬂection involves phase
inversion.

The amplitude of the reﬂected wave depends on the density and velocity of the sec-
ond medium, although the incoming and reﬂected waves have only propagated through
medium 1. This may be used in analyses of seismic data, as we shall see in Section 5.9.

This example was particularly simple, since the displacement as well as the stress only
had one component, normal to the interface between the two media. Consider next a
P-wave which hits an interface at an angle of incidence θi relative to the normal of the
interface. It is now convenient to consider the wave as a ray, as we here wish to focus on
the direction of propagation. A part of the wave will be reﬂected at an angle θr = θi (see
Fig. 5.10). Another part of the wave will be transmitted at an angle θt. The relation between

Fig. 5.10. Reﬂection and refraction of an acoustic ray at the interface between two media.

202

ELASTIC WAVE PROPAGATION IN ROCKS

the angle of incidence θi and the transmission angle θt is given by Snell’s law:

sin θt
vp2

= sin θi
vp1

(5.84)

Thus the transmitted wave will proceed in a direction somewhat different from the incom-
ing wave, provided that vp2 (cid:8)= vp1. This effect is called refraction.
Note that we may have a situation where (vp2/vp1) sin θi > 1, which would imply that
sin θt > 1 according to Eq. (5.84). This is mathematically and physically unacceptable,
hence θt is not deﬁned in this situation. This implies that the refracted wave does not exist,
and we have total reﬂection at the interface. The condition for total reﬂection of the P-wave
is thus

sin θi > sin θcr ≡ vp1

vp2

(5.85)

The angle θcr is called the critical angle for total reﬂection.

P- and S-waves are different modes of propagating elastic energy, and are not coupled
in an ordinary medium due to symmetry. When a wave hits an interface at a skew angle
relative to the direction of propagation, the symmetry is broken and the waves may become
coupled at the interface. In our example here, the incoming P-wave has a particle motion
which is not fully orthogonal to the particle motion of an S-wave “reﬂected” from the in-
terface at an angle θrs (Fig. 5.11), with polarization in the same plane as the incoming wave
and the normal to the interface. Thus such an S-wave may be generated at the interface.
The angle θrs is given by the equation

sin θrs
vs1

= sin θi
vp1

in this example: vp1 = 2500 m/s, vs1 = 1450 m/s, ρ1 = 2.1 g/cm3, vp2 = 3000 m/s, ρ2 = 2.2 g/cm3.

The incoming P-wave will also be coupled to a “refracted” S-wave, propagating in medium
2 at an angle θts given by

sin θts
vs2

= sin θi
vp1

(5.87)

This wave also has its polarization in the same plane as the incoming wave and the normal
to the interface. The two S-waves are said to be converted waves, since they originated
from a wave of a different type. Similarly, if the incoming wave is an S-wave with polar-
ization in this plane, two converted P-waves may be generated at the interface in addition
to the reﬂected and refracted S-waves. Note that an S-wave with polarization parallel to the
interface is not coupled to any P-wave at the interface, hence no such wave is created from
an incoming P-wave, nor will such a wave generate converted P-waves.

The degree of coupling between the incoming wave and the reﬂected, transmitted and
converted waves will vary with the angle θi. The expressions for the reﬂection, trans-
mission and conversion coefﬁcients are rather complicated, and are therefore given in
Appendix D.2.2.

Fig. 5.12 shows an example where the reﬂection coefﬁcient for the incoming P-wave
has been calculated for various angles of incidence. The ﬁgure shows that the reﬂection
coefﬁcient increases abruptly just below the critical angle (Eq. (5.85)) for total reﬂection.
The reﬂection coefﬁcient is furthermore seen to depend on the shear wave velocity vs2 of
the second medium.

5.7.1. Interface waves

In addition to the P- and S-waves, which can propagate through a material, there also
exist some elastic waves that only propagate along the interface between two media. One
familiar example is sea waves, which only exist at the surface of the water. An interface

204

ELASTIC WAVE PROPAGATION IN ROCKS

wave along the surface of a solid material is called a Rayleigh wave. This is the wave
normally observed as a result of an earthquake. Since the wave is conﬁned to the surface,
it has a lower loss due to geometrical spreading than a body wave, and therefore may
propagate over larger distances. The velocity of a Rayleigh wave (vR) is given by the shear
wave velocity of the solid and the Poisson’s ratio (see for example Viktorov, 1979):

vR ≈ 0.87 + 1.12ν

1 + ν

vs

(5.88)

Waves along a planar solid–ﬂuid interface are called Scholte waves, while waves along
a solid–solid interface are called Stoneley waves. There is a tradition within the petro-
leum industry, however, that both types of waves are called Stoneley waves. Such interface
waves can be excited at the sea ﬂoor when a seismic wave passes through, or at the bore-
hole wall during sonic logging operations, and thus be observable during normal ﬁeld data
acquisition.

The direction of propagation of any interface wave is obviously along the interface. For
the Rayleigh wave the particle motion is an elliptical movement in the plane normal to the
interface and parallel to the direction of propagation. The amplitude of this motion falls off
exponentially into the solid material. Characteristic features of interface waves in borehole
geometry are discussed in Section 5.8.

5.8. Borehole acoustics

Sonic well logging is an important application of elastic waves in the petroleum industry.
The purpose of such logging is to measure the sonic velocity of the formation surrounding
the well. The basic elements of a sonic logging tool are shown in Fig. 5.13. The tool
consists of a transmitter and a receiver separated by a distance L. When the transmitter
emits a pulse, it generates a P-wave which travels through the mud and hits the borehole
wall at different angles along the hole, where it may be reﬂected, refracted or converted

into different modes. Eventually, a series of pulses arrive at the receiver: the direct P-wave
travelling through the mud, a refracted P-wave, a converted S-wave, and a set of borehole
eigenmodes.

Fig. 5.14 illustrates refractions in the borehole geometry. Rays that hit the borehole wall
at a sub-critical angle, will be refracted into the formation, and the energy can never return
to the borehole. However, the ray that hits the wall at an angle such that the transmission
angle θt = 90° will propagate parallel to the wall. This wave will continuously radiate
energy into the borehole. We say that this wave is critically refracted. Some of this energy
will reach the receiver. Since the critically refracted wave continuously loses energy, it will
be attenuated even in the absence of absorption.

Using the notation of Figs. 5.13 and 5.14, we can ﬁnd an expression for the expected
arrival time of the critical refraction as a function of transmitter–receiver separation. The
length travelled in the ﬂuid is

shown is the arrival time of a direct wave with the velocity of the ﬂuid (dashed line). The following parameters
were used: v = 3500 m/s, vw = 1500 m/s, R = 10 cm.

Thus, the arrival time is a constant, plus a term that is equal to the separation between
the transmitter and the receiver divided by the velocity of the formation. This means that
the difference in arrival time between two receivers at different separations from the trans-
mitter directly measures the velocity of the formation. Fig. 5.15 illustrates Eq. (5.91), and
compares it with a direct wave travelling with the velocity of the borehole ﬂuid. As can be
seen, the refracted wave will be the ﬁrst arrival, as long as the source-receiver separation is
above a limiting minimum.

In the above discussion, we have not speciﬁed whether v is the shear or compressional
velocity of the formation. The arguments work equally well for both cases, which means
that we may have both a critically refracted compressional wave and a critically refracted
(converted) shear wave. This conclusion is, of course, subject to the condition that the
formation velocities are higher than the ﬂuid velocity. For the compressional wave this
will nearly always be fulﬁlled, but for the shear wave this is not so. Indeed, formations are
characterized as slow or soft when the shear wave velocity is slower than the ﬂuid velocity,
and as fast or hard otherwise.

5.8.1. Borehole modes

In addition to the refractions, the full wavetrain also consists of borehole modes. These
are modes that are localized to the borehole, and do not radiate into the formation (at least
for some parameter ranges). This means that they are often the dominating components
of the full wavetrain as far as amplitude is concerned. The borehole modes also contain
information about the formation parameters, albeit in a more complicated manner than the
refractions.

The most important eigenmode is the Stoneley wave, which is an interface wave. (The
name “Stoneley wave” actually deviates from the strict deﬁnition of the type of interface

wave we are considering here; see page 204.) Its velocity is always smaller than that of the
ﬂuid in the borehole. The wave has relatively low dispersion. In the low frequency limit
the wave is known as the tube wave and its velocity vSt is

vSt =

(5.92)

vw(cid:7)
1 + ρwv2

w
ρv2
s

where vw and ρw are the velocity and density, respectively, of the ﬂuid in the borehole,
while vs and ρ are the shear velocity and density, respectively, of the formation. This rela-
tion is plotted in Fig. 5.16 for two different density ratios. Note that for sufﬁciently small
shear velocities, the Stoneley wave becomes attenuated in the low frequency limit. This is
due to the fact that it will radiate energy in the form of ordinary shear waves when vSt is
higher than the solid’s shear velocity.

Eq. (5.92) indicates the possibility of using the Stoneley velocity to determine the shear
wave velocity of a formation. Quite conveniently, the sensitivity to the shear wave veloc-
ity is highest when this velocity is small and no shear refraction exists. Some remarks of
caution are however necessary. The high Stoneley wave attenuation in slow formations, as
mentioned above and illustrated in Fig. 5.16, is a main limiting factor. Further, Eq. (5.92)
is a low frequency approximation, and should for practical applications be replaced by
a numerical inversion in the frequency band of the source. More important, the Stoneley
wave velocity is quite sensitive to the formation permeability, especially at low frequencies
(see e.g. Schmitt, 1988a). Finally, the Stoneley wave and the refracted (converted) S-wave
are sensitive to different components of the stiffness tensor, which may be signiﬁcant in
anisotropic formations. In principle, this offers the possibility of assessing the acoustic
anisotropy of a fast formation, but in practice this is very difﬁcult since the Stoneley veloc-
ity has a low sensitivity to the shear velocity when the shear velocity is high.

The shear eigenmodes or pseudo-Rayleigh waves have phase velocities that are higher
than the ﬂuid velocity, and slower than the shear velocity of the formation. Consequently,

they only exist as undamped modes in fast formations. The pseudo-Rayleigh modes have a
cut-off frequency that increases with mode number (in principle, inﬁnitely many pseudo-
Rayleigh modes exist). The cut-off frequency can be roughly estimated by requiring that
an integer number of half wavelengths should ﬁt into the borehole. For a borehole with
diameter of 20 cm, this means that the order of magnitude of the cut-off frequency for the
lowest mode is 10 kHz. Note that the presence of the logging tool in the borehole reduces
the effective radius of the hole.

Fig. 5.17 shows examples of dispersion relations for the Stoneley mode and the lowest
pseudo-Rayleigh modes. Fig. 5.18 shows examples of (computed) full wavetrains in a fast
formation for three different source spectra. All wavetrains are shown in the same scale.
In the lower left, the early part of the wavetrains are shown ampliﬁed by a factor 10.
The ﬁgure illustrates that the full waveform depends strongly on the source spectrum. The
arrows indicate the expected arrivals of the P- and S-refractions and the Stoneley wave
based on ray theory.

Considering the high frequency source in the lower frame, the wavetrain is dominated by
the P-refraction and the pseudo-Rayleigh waves. No Stoneley wave is seen. In the middle
frame, the onset of the P- and S-refractions coincide well with the expectations from ray
theory. The Stoneley overlays the pseudo-Rayleigh waves, and is seen as a marked change
in amplitude.

For the low frequency case in the upper frame, there are no pseudo-Rayleigh waves,
and the waveform is dominated by the Stoneley wave. Note that the Stoneley wave breaks

respectively. The early parts of the wavetrains are also shown with 10 times ampliﬁcation. The amplitude scale is

before the time expected from the low frequency velocity. This is due to dispersion. It is
not possible to determine clear P- and S-refractions in this case.

The wavetrains in a slow formation, as Fig. 5.19 show examples of, are considerably
simpler, due to the absence of the shear refraction and the pseudo-Rayleigh modes. In
certain cases, damped pseudo-Rayleigh modes may however be seen in slow formations.
In the high frequency case in the lower frame of Fig. 5.19, the only clear feature is the
P-refraction. Looking at the middle frame of Fig. 5.19, we ﬁnd two clear events: the P-
refraction and the Stoneley wave. Note the relatively low frequency of the Stoneley wave.

20 kHz, 10 kHz and 2 kHz for the lower, middle and upper frames, respectively. The amplitude scale is the same
in all three frames. The low frequency wavetrain is also shown with the amplitude reduced by a factor 20 (dashed
line).

This is due to the fact that the Stoneley wave is excited most strongly at low frequencies,
such that it favours the low frequencies of the excitation pulse. It is also evident that the
early part of the Stoneley wave is lower in frequency than the later part. This is due to
the dispersion of the Stoneley mode in slow formations, where the low frequency parts
propagate fastest. (In a fast formation, however, the high frequency parts are the fastest.)
The slow onset of the Stoneley mode in a slow formation of course makes picking of

the arrival time rather difﬁcult for real data, where noise is a complicating factor. This is
another reason why the application of Eq. (5.92) for estimation of vs is difﬁcult.

For the low frequency source in the upper frame, the amplitude of the Stoneley wave
is strongly increased, due to higher contents of low frequencies in the source. Note that
the frequency of the Stoneley wave is more or less the same as in the middle frame. The
P-refraction breaks where it is predicted from the ray theory.

In fast formations, one may in principle get the shear wave velocity from the shear refrac-
tions, but in practice the shear wave may be embedded in the ringing of the compressional
wave and noise, such that its extraction is at least non-trivial. In slow formations, one may
obtain the shear velocity from the Stoneley wave. However, as discussed, this method is
subject to several restrictions making it a far from ideal method.

For estimation of mechanical properties, one is most interested in the shear velocity
in slow formations, since a low shear velocity indicate low strength, and hence potential
stability problems. Dipole and quadrupole acoustic logging tools, which enable direct mea-
surements of the shear wave velocity in both slow and fast formations, are very useful tools
for this purpose.

The basic concept of the “Hula” log was suggested by White (1967). A dipole transmitter
can in principle be pictured as two close monopole transmitters driven with opposite phase.
The result may be thought of as a force oriented normal to the borehole wall which induces
a ﬂexural motion of the borehole (see Fig. 5.20).

At sufﬁciently low frequencies, such that the wavelength is much longer than the bore-
hole diameter, the ﬂexural mode is little affected by the borehole and propagates with the
shear velocity of the formation. At higher frequencies, the propagation velocity becomes
lower. In fact, the dispersion of the ﬂexural mode is quite similar to the Stoneley mode,
with the exception that it is less affected by the permeability of the formation. An example
of the ﬂexural mode dispersion is shown in Fig. 5.21. A quadrupole tool excites a mode
called the screw mode, which also propagates at the shear velocity at low frequencies and
has a similar dispersion.

5.8.2. Borehole alteration

We have seen that the full waveform is quite complicated even in the simple model used
above. We will here discuss brieﬂy a slightly more complicated situation, in which there
is a concentric altered zone around the wellbore. The alteration may be due to mud ﬁltrate
invasion, or stress induced damage (see Section 4.5). We assume that the zone is homoge-
neous and isotropic. Fig. 5.22 sketches the situation.

From the ray-theory point of view, it is now clear that we may have refractions both from
the borehole wall and from the interface between the two formation zones (assuming that
the velocity of the altered zone is lower than that of the virgin formation).

Fig. 5.23 shows the expected arrival times as a function of distance. The ﬁrst refracted
arrival will be the shallow refraction for short transmitter receiver distances, and the deep
refraction for longer separations. This effect has been used by Hornby and Chang (1985),

who—using data from several runs of an experimental logging tool with variable trans-
mitter receiver spacing—computed the altered zone thickness and velocity as a function
of depth. Such calculations should, of course, be considered with some caution, since the
model used is very simple. The assumption of an axisymmetric altered zone is dubious,
and the abrupt transition from altered to unaltered formations is only a ﬁrst approximation.
Fig. 5.24 shows examples of synthetic wavetrains in an altered soft formation. The al-
tered zone velocities are 10% higher/lower than those of the virgin formation. It is clear

214

ELASTIC WAVE PROPAGATION IN ROCKS

from the ﬁgure that alteration affects signiﬁcantly the character of the wavetrain. The am-
plitude of the P-refraction is changed considerably, and the dispersion characteristics of
the Stoneley wave are also changed. This is due to the fact that the Stoneley wave samples
some average of the altered and virgin shear velocities at low frequencies, but sees only the
altered zone at high frequencies.

5.9. Seismics

A seismic survey is the only tool available for mapping and characterization of large sub-
surface structures. The major objectives for surface seismic surveys are to identify and
localize the subsurface structures. From a rock mechanical point of view, the fact that
P- and S-wave velocities, density and to some extent anisotropy may be determined from
seismic data, provides a basis for large scale applications.

The basic element in a seismic survey is a seismic shot, as shown in Fig. 5.25. The
distance (x) between the source and the receiver is called the offset. When a shot is ﬁred by
the source, a semi-spherical wave is propagating down through the rock masses. At each
interface between the various layers in the formation, a part of the wave is reﬂected and
propagates back towards the surface, and is eventually detected at the receiver. The elapsed
time (tT) from the shot is ﬁred until the reﬂection is detected at the receiver is called the
Two-Way Traveltime (TWT).

Consider a situation as shown in Fig. 5.25, where the wave propagates with velocity v
through a uniform formation until it is reﬂected at a plane, horizontal interface at depth D.
By a simple geometric analysis, we ﬁnd that the TWT for a given offset can be expressed
by the hyperbolic equation

where tT(0) = 2(D/v).

T(x) = t 2
t 2

T(0) + x2
v2

(5.93)

Fig. 5.25. A seismic shot.

SEISMICS

215

Consider now a set of shots with different offsets around the same midpoint. Corre-
sponding values of TWT and offset should then fall on a straight line in a plot of t 2
T(x)
versus x2. From this plot it is possible to identify both tT(0) (from the intercept at x = 0)
and v (from the slope). Thus it is possible to identify both the depth D and the velocity v
from the seismic data.

A collection of shots around a common midpoint is called a CMP gather. In order to
enhance the useful information (i.e. the reﬂected pulse) and suppress noise, it is standard
procedure to add up all recorded traces in a CMP gather, after having scaled the time axis
of each trace as

(cid:28)

tT(x) →

T(x) − x2
t 2
v2

(5.94)

This scaling ensures that the reﬂection occurs at the same place for all traces. Such a sum
of traces is called a CMP stack. Note that stacking disturbs information about amplitude
and phase in the signals.

If the formation consists of several layers, the wave is refracted at each interface both
before it reaches the actual interface we are considering and on its way back to the surface.
The expression for TWT is then rather complicated, however in the hyperbolic approxima-
tion we have (Dix, 1955)

where the so called “root-mean-square velocity” vRMS is given as

T(x) ≈ t 2
t 2

T(0) + x2

RMS
N(cid:6)

tT(0)

(5.95)

(5.96)

Lj and vj are the thickness and velocity of layer j, respectively, and N is the number of
layers, while the TWT at zero offset is given as
tT(0) = 2

(5.97)

N(cid:6)
j=1

Lj
vj

As we are able to obtain both vRMS and tT(0) from the CMP gather for the reﬂection from
each layer, we have the 2N equations needed to determine the 2N unknowns Lj , vj . This
procedure, called Dix inversion, allows us to determine both velocity and thickness of each
layer.

An alternative form of the traveltime equation (5.95) is found by Taylor expansion of

the traveltime in x:

tT(x) = tT(0) +

x2
2tT(0)v2

(5.98)
The function tT(x) = tT(x)−tT(0) is called the normal moveout (NMO), and the velocity
vNMO is called the normal moveout velocity. In general, vNMO differs from vRMS, however
for plane, horizontal, homogeneous layers, we have vNMO = vRMS.

ELASTIC WAVE PROPAGATION IN ROCKS

In practice, the processing of seismic data is complicated by several factors, such as
dipping layers (which imply that the reﬂection point differs from the common midpoint),
lateral velocity variations and anisotropy (which both implies that the velocity is different
for different offsets), and spurious reﬂections originating from refracted waves, converted
waves, interface waves and multiple reﬂections. Data derived from seismic processing may
thus suffer from large uncertainties.

We have shown earlier that the amplitude of a reﬂection generated at an interface de-
pends on the acoustic impedance. Since the acoustic impedance depends on both velocity
and density, the amplitude of a seismic reﬂection also carries information about the rock
density. In general, the reﬂection coefﬁcient depends on the angle of incidence, the P-wave
velocities and densities of both layers, as well as the shear wave velocity vs2 of the lower
layer (see example in Fig. 5.12). Thus, the variation in amplitude versus offset (correspond-
ing to the angle of incidence) for a P-wave reﬂected at the interface between two layers
carries information about both the P- and S-wave velocity of the layer below the interface.
In marine seismic surveys, both the source and the receivers are ﬂoating in water, hence all
information to be extracted about the formations below the sea ﬂoor has to be carried by
P-waves. Application of the method outlined above is a possible way to extract also shear
wave velocities from marine seismic data. The method is known as AVO (Amplitude Ver-
sus Offset). In land- or ocean bottom-based seismic surveys, where both P- and S-waves
are generated and detected, an extended method called Multicomponent AVO may be ap-
plied to improve the conﬁdence of the estimated shear wave velocity. This method also
includes analyses of amplitudes of reﬂected S-waves, by a similar set of equations as those
described in Appendix D.2.2.

A velocity derived from a seismic data set is a kind of “average” velocity over a distance
given roughly by the wavelength. If the rock is heterogeneous on a scale shorter than this
distance, the observed velocity will not be fully representative for the velocity on a shorter
length scale. Examples of how the “average” velocity relates to the short scale velocities
and the geometrical structure of the heterogeneities are given in Section 6.1.

The resolution of seismic data—that is, the typical size of the smallest objects that can
be seen as reﬂections—is usually assumed to be about a quarter of the wavelength. As a
seismic wave contains a band of frequencies (typically 10–100 Hz), the resolution limit is
usually deﬁned as the wavelength of the component that has the highest frequency. The fre-
quency content in a seismic signal is mainly given by the attenuation (which is a constant-Q
type with Q in the order of 30–100 for underground formations), the distance travelled by
the wave, and the type of wave. For a P-wave reﬂected at about 1000 m depth, the typical
wavelength is about 100 m, while the resolution limit is about 20 m, depending of course
on the local conditions. The loss of the highest frequencies with increasing travel-time
(which is a consequence of constant-Q attenuation) implies that the resolution is poorer for
deeper reﬂections. For a P-wave reﬂected at about 4000 m depth, the typical wavelength
is about 200 m, and the resolution limit about 50 m. Improved recording technology may
improve the resolution somewhat, maybe as much as a factor of 2. Still the resolution is
quite poor, and this limits the applicability of seismic data for determination of formation
properties. Further improvements in the resolution require different processing techniques
which may be more sensitive to noise.

Rock models

219

In the previous chapters, we have discussed the mechanical behaviour of rocks in terms
of continuum mechanics. That is, we have treated the rocks as homogeneous materials.
However, sedimentary rocks are made up of small particles, and are largely heterogeneous
materials on a length scale comparable to the particle size (Fig. 1.18). Furthermore, inho-
mogeneous distribution of particle types and particle sizes in the form of layers or clusters,
as well as fractures, produce heterogeneities on larger length scales. The mechanical prop-
erties of the rock will differ largely from one part to another if measured on a length scale
which is small or comparable to the size of the heterogeneities. The continuum approach
can be applied with conﬁdence only as an average, and on a length scale which is large
compared to the size of the heterogeneities.

For many practical applications the continuum approach is valid. However, it is intu-
itively clear that the mechanical properties of the rock even on a large scale must depend in
some way on the microscopical nature of the rock. We have already touched this problem
when we introduced the poroelastic formalism (Section 1.6). The theory of poroelasticity
is based on the assumption that the rock consists of both a solid part and a ﬂuid part, which
are separated on a microscopic scale, but coexist on a macroscopic scale. One of the state-
ments of this theory is that the rock’s framework has its own moduli, separate from those
of the solid material and the pore ﬂuid.

The poroelastic formalism of Biot introduced earlier (Chapter 1) is capable of predict-
ing the elastic properties of a porous material provided that parameters like the frame bulk
(Kfr) and the shear (Gfr) moduli are known. These are macroscopic parameters, describing
the properties of the rock on a length scale much larger than the grains and pores. The Biot
theory is called a macroscopic theory since it only deals with macroscopic quantities. It is
an ultimate goal to be able to express the macroscopic parameters like Kfr and Gfr in terms
of the properties of the constituents the rock is made of and the microstructure of the rock
fabric. Having obtained values for the macroscopic parameters from the microscopic the-
ories, we may consider these parameters to represent a material which is homogeneous on
a macroscopic scale. This virtual, homogeneous material is commonly called an effective
medium.

The elastic properties of a composite material like a sedimentary rock depend primarily

on the following three factors:

1. the relative amount of each component present

2. the elastic properties of each component

3. the geometrical distribution of each component.

It is not possible to obtain accurate data for all three factors for a given rock, hence any
model of the rock will necessarily be based on simplifying assumptions. A model is there-
fore valid as a representation for the real rock only to the extent that the features governing

220

ROCK MODELS

the observed behaviour of the rock are accounted for in the model. This also implies that a
model may be a good representation for the rock in a given situation, while it is not at all
describing the actual behaviour of the rock in other situations.

A large number of rock models have been derived over the years, describing various
properties of various rocks under various conditions. A comprehensive collection of such
models was given by Mavko et al. (1998). Here, we shall ﬁrst take a look at a model for
a simple heterogeneous material, in order to illustrate how the physical properties may
depend on the length scale on which the material is being observed (Section 6.1). Some
models for porous rocks involve only porosity, with no explicit reference to the shape
of the pore space. Such models are presented in Section 6.2. Other models are based on
the forming process of sedimentary rocks, and describe essentially packs of grains. Such
models are described in Section 6.3. Models describing cracked and fractured rocks are
described in Sections 6.4 and 6.5.

6.1. Layered media

Consider a material made up of parallel, isotropic layers. This is one of the simplest exam-
ples one can ﬁnd of a non-homogeneous material. We shall use this as an example to see
how a material can be considered as heterogeneous on one scale, and effectively homoge-
neous on another.

Given a sample of a layered material. We denote the thickness of layer number i as Li,
so that the total thickness L of the sample is the sum of all Li. If an external load σz is
applied in the direction normal to the layers, all layers have to carry the same load. The
strain of layer i will be εz,i = σz/Ei, where Ei denotes the Young’s modulus of layer i.
The sample will thus deform according to

We use (cid:18)x(cid:19) to denote the average of the quantity x weighted by the volumetric proportion

For an elastic wave with sufﬁciently low frequency, such that the wavelength λw is much
larger than the thickness of any of the layers, the layered material will effectively appear
as a homogeneous and anisotropic material with stiffness given by Eqs. (6.3)–(6.8). The
velocity of a P-wave travelling normal to the layers is then, according to Eq. (6.4) and

For an elastic wave with high frequency, such that the wavelength is much shorter than

The difference between Eq. (6.11) and Eq. (6.9) represents the different properties dis-
played by a heterogeneous material when it is studied on two different length scales.
Eq. (6.11) represents a situation where the relevant length scale of the observation (i.e.
the wavelength of the elastic wave) is much smaller than the length scale of the hetero-
geneities (i.e. the layer thickness), hence the material appears as heterogeneous. Eq. (6.9)
represents on the other hand a situation where the length scale of the observation is much
larger than the length scale of the heterogeneities, and the material appears effectively as
homogeneous.

The transition between these two cases was nicely demonstrated in a laboratory experi-
ment by Marion and Coudin (1992), where acoustic waves with different wavelengths were
transmitted through a stack of plates of alternating steel and plexiglass. A simulation of a
similar experiment, using a discrete element code, is shown in Fig. 6.1. Note that the ve-
locity of the wave is signiﬁcantly lower when the thickness of the layers is much smaller
than the wavelength, as compared to the situation when the layer thickness is larger than

the wavelength. Note also the strong attenuation for the intermediate cases, indicating that
the wave is almost unable to propagate under such conditions. Hovem (1995) showed by
analytical modelling that wave propagation is dispersive with no loss for frequencies below
a critical limit, while waves with higher frequencies are evanescent, suffering loss at each
interface. The critical frequency limit depends on the periodicity of the layered material
and the impedance contrast between the layers.

This example demonstrates clearly that the properties of a heterogeneous material may
be very different when observed on different length scales. An effective medium repre-
senting the material has the properties of the material when it is observed on a length scale
much larger than that of the heterogeneities.

6.2. Models involving porosity only

For a simple porous rock consisting only of one type of solid material and being saturated
with only one type of ﬂuid, the relative amount of the components is speciﬁed by the
porosity φ, while the elastic properties of the components are given by the bulk modulus of
the ﬂuid Kf, and the bulk (Ks) and shear (Gs) moduli of the grain material. Many available
expressions for the elastic properties of rocks are based only on these parameters, as details
about the geometrical distribution of each component is normally not known.

Precise estimates for the elastic moduli of a rock can not be obtained without the vital
information about the geometrical distribution of each component, however there are upper

MODELS INVOLVING POROSITY ONLY

223

and lower limits for their values. Such limits—or bounds as they are usually called—can
be established by considering extreme geometrical distributions of the constituents.

Assuming a distribution such that both the grain material and the ﬂuid experiences the
same strain due to an external hydrostatic stress, the bulk modulus (KV) of the rock is given
as

KV = φKf + (1 − φ)Ks

(6.12)

KV is an upper bound for the bulk modulus of a real rock, and is called the Voigt bound.
Similarly, if we assume that the stress is the same in both the grains and the ﬂuid, we ﬁnd
that the bulk modulus (KR) of the rock is given as (see Eq. (1.132))

1
KR

= φ
Kf

+ 1 − φ

Ks

KR is a lower bound for the bulk modulus, called the Reuss bound. Similar bounds can
be found for the shear modulus simply by replacing the bulk moduli in Eqs. (6.12) and
(6.13) by the corresponding shear moduli. Note that the Reuss bound for the shear modulus
GR = 0 for any φ > 0 (since Gf = 0), while the Voigt bound GV > 0 for any φ < 1.
Physically, the Reuss bound represents a suspension, e.g. solid particles in a liquid. It
may also describe gas bubbles in a liquid (in which case the bulk modulus Kg of the gas
has to replace Ks in Eq. (6.13)). The Voigt bound represents an alloy of constituents, and
is most appropriate for a rock at low porosity.

The Voigt and Reuss bounds are very wide, and of limited value for modelling of rock
properties. A narrower range is given by the Hashin–Shtrikman bounds. In a general form,
these are given as (Hashin and Shtrikman, 1963)

) and lower (KHS−

Subscripts 1 and 2 denote component 1 and 2, respectively, while v represents the vol-
ume fraction of the actual component. The upper (KHS+
, GHS−
)
bounds are found by interchanging material 1 and 2 (the upper bound is found when mate-
rial 1 is the stiffest one). Physically, the Hashin–Shtrikman bounds represent the moduli of
an assembly of spheres of material 2, each of which is surrounded by a shell of material 1.
Note that for the simple grain-ﬂuid model of a rock described above, the lower Hashin–
Shtrikman bound is identical to the Reuss bound for both the bulk and the shear modulus.
This is also the exact solution for a suspension of grains in a ﬂuid (see Section 1.6).
The arithmetic average of the Voigt and Reuss bounds are sometimes used to ob-
tain estimates of the moduli, rather than just the allowable range. These averages, K =
(KV + KR)/2 and similar for the shear modulus, are usually called the Voigt–Reuss–Hill
average moduli (Hill, 1952). The Voigt–Reuss–Hill average moduli represent no well de-
ﬁned model of the rock microstructure, however it may be seen as a speciﬁc mixture of the
extreme structures represented by the Voigt and Reuss bounds.

224

ROCK MODELS

An alternative approach would be to look for the most probable microstructure in a
porous rock and try to estimate the moduli for such a structure. Considering for instance a
collection of sand grains, it is clear that there exists a maximum porosity, above which the
grains will no longer be in contact with each other and the frame moduli will vanish. For
an ordered simple cubic packing of equally sized spheres, this critical porosity φc is 0.476,
for a random packing it is about 0.36, while for a typical clean sand it is about 0.40. Based
on this simple argument, combined with the expectation that the moduli should be equal
to the moduli of the grain material if the porosity is zero, we ﬁnd as the simplest possible
expression

The critical porosity concept (Nur et al., 1991, 1995) is not really a micromechanical
model, and the critical porosity is an empirical constant which will differ from one rock
type to another, however the concept provides an explanation for the characteristic behav-
iour of the frame moduli of sedimentary rocks. Fig. 6.2 shows the undrained bulk modulus
versus porosity for a rock, as given by Eq. (6.16) with φc = 0.39. The ﬁgure also shows
the Voigt, Reuss and Hashin–Shtrikman bounds for a dry rock, and the Voigt–Reuss–Hill
average. For comparison, the empirical results of Murphy et al. (1993) for clean sands are
also included.

dotted line is based on the empirical curve of Murphy et al. (1993) for clean sandstones. The ﬂuid contribution
has been accounted for by use of the Biot–Gassmann equation (1.155) for both the empirical curve and the critical
porosity curve.

GRAIN PACK MODELS

225

The critical porosity concept also provides some understanding of the properties of
sand–clay mixtures (Marion and Nur, 1991). Small amounts of clay in a sandstone usu-
ally appear as pore ﬁll, and the mechanical properties of the rock are mainly determined by
the framework of sand grains. The stiffness of the rock is however still largely determined
by the sand grain framework, as the sand grains are stiffer than the clay. On the other hand,
clay mixed with only a small amount of sand will behave as a kind of suspension, where the
mechanical properties will be dominated by those of the clay. The transition between the
two types of behaviour will occur when the relative volume of sand is about 1 − φc, that is
when the sand volume is just large enough for the grains to make a continuous framework.

6.3. Grain pack models

Sedimentary rocks are formed by small pieces of solid material that are compacted and to
some extent cemented. Models describing the elastic properties of grain packs may thus
provide interesting information about such materials.

Consider two spherical grains that are pressed together with a normal force F acting
along the line through the centres of the spheres (Fig. 6.3). Due to the force, the grains
will be deformed in the vicinity of the contact spot. The contact area will be a circle with
radius b, depending on the force F as
b =

This equation was originally derived by Hertz (1882), assuming linearly elastic grain
material and that the contact radius is small (b (cid:11) a). νs and Es are the Poisson’s ratio and
Young’s modulus of the grain material, respectively. The distance between the centres of
the grains is reduced with s due to the external force:

The relationship between the force F and the external pressure σp causing the force, as

Eqs. (6.24) and (6.25) can be used to estimate how acoustic velocities depend on an
1/3
external hydrostatic stress σp for a dry rock. Since both K and G depend on σ
p , we
1/6
immediately see that both vp and vs depend on the stress as σ
p . Experiments on loose
sands (Domenico, 1977; Bachrach et al., 1998; Han and Batzle, 2006) have shownv p and vs
depending on the stress as σ n
p , where n is in the range 1/4 to 1/5. There are several possible
reasons for this discrepancy (Makse et al., 2001). The analytical grain pack models do not
account properly for partial slip and associated grain rotation and rearrangement. The load
is further assumed to be carried equally by all grain contacts, while in reality, it is carried by
localized force chains through the grain assembly. This may be described by an effective,
stress-dependent coordination number. With realistic grain shapes, the surface roughness
of the grains may also lead to grain contact stiffnesses described by an exponent different
from 1/3 (as in Eqs. (6.21) and (6.22)). An example of such behaviour is the “bed of nails”
model by Carlson and Gangi (1985), which is described under Section 6.5.1. Note that the
theory also predicts that the ratio between vp and vs does not depend on the external stress.
The Hertz–Mindlin contact theory has also been derived for various ordered packings
of grains (see f.i. Wang and Nur, 1992, for a review). Extensions to the model have been
made to take into account the effects of a saturating ﬂuid (White, 1983; Brandt, 1955),
and to describe cemented rather than pressure generated grain contacts (Digby, 1981;
Schwartz, 1984; Dvorkin et al., 1991). For cemented contacts the force constants Dn and
Dt become unknown parameters. and the stress dependency of the acoustic waves tends
to be less pronounced. The Hertz–Mindlin theory is no longer valid at high stress levels,
when plastiﬁcation of the grain contacts may occur. The stiffness will then increase with
stress at a rate lower than indicated by the exponent 1/6.

The general case of variously sized, cemented particles in a random dense pack has not
been solved analytically yet. However, such systems can be studied numerically. Discrete
particle modelling has developed rapidly over the last few years, with the continuous de-
velopment of faster and more powerful computers. One such approach is the PFC (Particle
Flow Code1), which is based on the pioneering work of Cundall and Strack (1979).

In PFC, which may be formulated both in 2D and 3D, circular or spherical particles of ar-
bitrary size distribution are packed into a granular assembly under a speciﬁc applied stress.
Each disk or sphere is treated as a rigid body, with translational and rotational degrees of

freedom. When two particles come in contact, forces are generated as a result of relative
(normal and shear) displacements at the contact. Using a so-called soft contact approach,
the particles are permitted numerically to overlap each other, and the degree of overlap
controls the contact forces through a contact law. The contact law may be Hertzian, or lin-
ear, or user-deﬁned. By applying boundaries representative for the problem to be studied
(e.g. ﬂat walls to mimic pistons, in case a laboratory test is simulated), the stress conditions
can be changed and the contact forces and associated particle movements calculated, until
equilibrium is reached and a new load increment can be applied. This procedure is cycled
over and over again until a numerical experiment is completed.

The particle contacts may be unbonded or bonded. When simulated cement bonds are
inserted, they have bond stiffnesses that are in general different from those of the unce-
mented contacts. In addition, the bonds have shear and tensile strength. When a shear or
tensile failure criterion is exceeded locally, the bond fails, and it then retains the properties
of the uncemented contact. With the features described above, the discrete model permits
calculation of the complete stress–strain behaviour of an uncemented or cemented granular
medium (Potyondy and Cundall, 2004). It thus serves as a tool for studying rock failure
mechanics on the particle scale.

Several features may be added to permit direct comparison between laboratory measure-
ments and discrete element computations, such as ﬂuid coupling to simulate stress effects
on permeability. For instance, wave propagation may be simulated directly in PFC, since
the model is inherently dynamic (Li and Holt, 2002). Also, acoustic emissions may be
simulated by calculating the energy associated with bond ruptures (Hazzard and Young,
2000).

Discrete particle modelling may be used to gain understanding and insight, in particular
in comparison with laboratory experiments. It may also be used to solve engineering prob-
lems, in competition with continuum methods. The main beneﬁt (Cundall, 2001) is that no

pre-assumed constitutive material law is needed: complex behaviour, including develop-
ment of localized fractures and cracks is a natural output of the modelling.

From a fundamental viewpoint, one may ask to what extent the assumptions behind the
simple effective medium theories sketched above are valid. As an illustration of that, a
distribution of contact forces in a 2D network is shown in Fig. 6.5. The distribution is
clearly heterogeneous, with a small number of contacts carrying a large part of the load
(see also Radjai et al., 1996; Williams and Rege, 1997). This allows a.o. for studies of
various stress geometries, stress history and degrees of cementation. Note that the network
of force lines is heterogeneous on a larger scale than the grain size.

The numerical calculations also allow for “snap-shots” of grain contact failures at given
points in time, as shown in Fig. 6.6. Such ﬁgures may help to better understand deformation
mechanisms and failure processes in sedimentary rocks.

6.4. Models for cracks and other inclusions

The grain pack models discussed above describe the porous material as a collection of
grains with varying degree of contact between the grains. This may seem to be a logical
path to follow when studying sedimentary rocks, since they are indeed formed this way.
However, we may also consider a porous material as a solid with lots of holes in it, like a
“Swiss cheese”. For some purposes it appears that this approach may be equally relevant,
especially for well cemented rocks. More generally, we talk about such models as inclusion
models, as they consider the effect of including an object in a host material.

To establish a model for such a material, we need descriptions for how holes of various
shapes affect the elastic properties of the solid. In a static approach (Eshelby, 1957; Walsh,
1965a, 1965b), it is assumed that a static external load is imposed on a sample consisting of
a host material with embedded inclusions. The elastic properties of the effective medium

MODELS FOR CRACKS AND OTHER INCLUSIONS

231

are obtained by requiring that the effective medium shall suffer the same deformation as
the real sample when subjected to the same external load. In a dynamic approach (Kuster
and Toksöz, 1974), it is assumed that a region consisting of inclusions embedded in a
host material is embedded in the effective medium. The elastic properties of the effective
medium are deﬁned such that the scattering of elastic waves from the embedded region is
eliminated. The wavelength of the elastic wave is assumed to be much larger than the size
of the region.

The two approaches converge when the concentration of inclusions is low. In Sec-
tions 6.4.1 and 6.4.2 we shall take a look at models valid for low concentrations of
inclusions. Models intended to account for higher concentrations of inclusions are dis-
cussed in Section 6.4.3.

6.4.1. Linear, isotropic models

∗

Assuming that the concentration of inclusions is so low that interactions can be neglected,
we may express the impact of the inclusion on the elastic stiffness of the material as a
perturbation, proportional to the concentration of the inclusions. Assuming also that the
∗
host material is isotropic, the effective bulk modulus K
and the effective shear modulus
of a material containing inclusions, can be written as
G
∗ = Ks(1 − QK ξincl)
∗ = Gs(1 − QGξincl)

(6.30)

G

K

Ks and Gs are the bulk modulus and shear modulus, respectively, of the solid material
without inclusions. ξincl is an appropriate measure of the concentration of the inclusions,
depending on their shape (as will be seen below). QK and QG are measures of the impact
these inclusions have on the respective moduli of the material. QK and QG are functions
of the moduli of the host material and the material within the inclusions. Other moduli can
be represented by similar expressions.

Consider ﬁrst the case where the inclusions are spherical, ﬂuid-ﬁlled holes. The poros-
ity φ, which is here given as the sum of the volumes of the holes relative to the total volume,
is a suitable measure for the concentration of inclusions, thus ξincl = φ. The expressions
for the effective moduli can for instance be derived from Eqs. (6.14) and (6.15), by deﬁning
KHS+ = K
, v2 = 1 − v1 = φ, K1 = Ks, K2 = Kf, G1 = Gs, G2 = 0 (the
upper Hashin–Shtrikman bound then represents a solid surrounding a spherical, ﬂuid-ﬁlled
inclusion), and linearizing the expressions in φ. The results are (see also Mackenzie, 1950;

We shall now consider the case where the inclusions are thin, ﬂat cracks. For such inclu-

the effective moduli is the crack density ξ. For very thin, ﬂuid-ﬁlled cracks, for which
γ (cid:11) Kf/Ks, we have that D → 0 which implies that the cracks are almost incompliant.
Again, only the crack density affects the effective moduli. Thus, details regarding the shape
of thin cracks have no impact on the effective moduli (Budiansky and O’Connell, 1976;
Mavko and Nur, 1978).

is affected by saturation, hence it is clear that these equations
are not consistent with Biot’s theory (Section 1.6.2). The reason for this discrepancy is that
some of the cracks will necessarily have an orientation such that they will be compressed
(or opened up) due to an applied shear stress. This change in volume of the crack implies
that the ﬂuid occupying the crack will be compressed (or expanded), to an extent that is
partly given by Kf. Biot’s theory, which has no assumptions about the shape of the pore
space and hence should be valid also for thin, ﬂat (crack-shaped) pores, is based on the
fundamental assumption that the material is permeable. Hence the compression of one
crack due to an applied shear stress will only lead to ﬂow of ﬂuid from this crack into
another crack whose orientation implies that it expands due to the same stress state. Thus
there is no local build-up (or reduction) of ﬂuid pressure, and the ﬂuid bulk modulus does
not affect the effective shear modulus.

MODELS FOR CRACKS AND OTHER INCLUSIONS

233

It is possible to make an inclusion model consistent with Biot’s theory by deﬁning that
∗
is not affected by saturation. This is a way of implementing hydraulic connections
G
between the elements of the pore space (i.e. making the material permeable; see Thomsen,
1985). Alternatively, one may use the inclusion model only for the material in a dry state
(for which D = 1), thus modelling the frame moduli, and add the effects of saturation by
Biot’s theory. The actual situation we are trying to model determines which alternative is
the most representative. For instance, for high frequency elastic waves (see Chapter 5), the
ﬂuid may not have time to ﬂow into and out of the cracks, hence the cracks will effectively
be closed, and expressions like Eqs. (6.35)–(6.37) may give a good representation of the
moduli. At low frequencies, the ﬂuid pressure will have time to equalize, and a better
representation of the moduli is found by using the inclusion model to estimate the frame
moduli, and the Biot model to add the ﬂuid effects.

6.4.2. Anisotropic models

Cracks in rocks are not always randomly oriented. More typically, cracks grow as a result
of anisotropic changes in the stress state, which leads to a preferred crack orientation with
respect to the stress state (see also Section 1.8). The elastic constants of a material with
parallel cracks can be expressed, similar to Eqs. (6.29) and (6.30), as:

∗

ij (1 − Qij ξ )

Co is the stiffness tensor of the host material (without cracks), and Qij is the impact of the
∗
cracks on C
ij (note that the Einstein summing convention, page 459, is not applied here). If
the cracks are oriented normal to the z-axis, the coefﬁcients Qij are given as the respective
components of the matrix Q (see for instance Hudson, 1981):

Eqs. (6.38) and (6.39) show that C
is softer when loaded perpendicular to the cracks than parallel to them. Thus the parallel
cracks induce elastic anisotropy in the rock. Stress dependence of acoustic velocities in
sedimentary rocks, as well as stress induced acoustic anisotropy, can to a large extent be
described in terms of cracks. This was also discussed in Chapter 5. This is a consequence
of the fact that shear stresses tend to create cracks with a preferred orientation.

assuming no mechanical interaction between the cracks.
We remember that D → 0 for thin, ﬂuid-ﬁlled cracks (Section 6.4.1). This can be ex-
plained as follows: Even a small normal stress tends to impose a very large volumetric
strain on an empty crack. If the crack is ﬁlled with a ﬂuid, the volumetric strain will imme-
diately be counteracted by a large alteration of the ﬂuid pressure. Consequently, the crack
is almost non-deformable due to normal stresses.

These considerations imply that cracks induce only a small P-wave anisotropy in a satu-
rated rock, according to Eqs. (6.39) and (5.59). Thomsen (1995) pointed out that this model
does not necessarily give a realistic description of a porous rock, since the pore ﬂuid may
ﬂow between the cracks and the pores that deform differently under stress. For a low fre-
quency wave, the ﬂuid pressure in the cracks and the pores will be nearly equalized at any
time, which implies that the presence of the pore ﬂuid can not prevent the cracks from
deforming—at least not to such an extent as for isolated cracks. Assuming perfect pore
pressure equalization, Thomsen derived a modiﬁed expression (Dcp) for the D-parameter
that accounts for the hydraulic interaction between ﬂat cracks and spherical pores.
Assuming that Kf (cid:11) Ks so that higher order terms of (Kf/Ks) can be neglected, and
neglecting mechanical interaction between the inclusions, we ﬁnd from Thomsen’s work
that the D-parameter can be expressed as

(Note that Eq. (6.41) is slightly different from Thomsen’s deﬁnition of Dcp, in order to

The porosity due to the cracks is given as

(6.42)
hence (1 − (φp/φ))/γ does not depend on γ , and Dpc will not vanish regardless how thin
the cracks are, provided that φp > 0. The realism in Thomsen’s model was conﬁrmed in a
model experiment by Rathore et al. (1995).

The expression (6.41) is valid for static or low frequency oscillations of the external
stress. At high frequencies, the pore ﬂuid will not have time to ﬂow between the cracks and
the pores, and the cracks will effectively appear to be sealed. For this situation, Eq. (6.37)
is the relevant expression for the D-parameter.

For completeness, the direct impact of the pores should also be taken into account.
Within the approximations used here, this can be done by adding an extra term to the
expression (6.38) for the effective elastic stiffness tensor:

between the cracks and the pores are accounted for. Mechanical interaction between the

question whether they should be included or not, are discussed in Section 6.4.3.

to the crack density. In general, however, BN and BT may be considered as independent,
and the model thus allows for a description of more general discontinuities than open
cracks. The fact that this model describes the impact of the discontinuities as additions to
the compliance, rather than deductions from the stiffness (as in Eq. (6.38)), is of minor
importance as long as the concentration of discontinuities is small.

6.4.3. Models accounting for interactions

Eqs. (6.29) and (6.30) are based on the assumption that the concentration of inclusions is
so small that interactions between the inclusions can be neglected. When several inclusions
are present, they will interact in the sense that the impact of one inclusion on the material’s

236

ROCK MODELS

stiffness is affected by the presence of the others. This implies that QK and QG to some
extent depend on ξincl. Alternatively, we can express this by adding higher order terms in
ξincl to Eqs. (6.29) and (6.30).

A number of models have been derived, where interactions between the inclusions are
accounted for in one way or another in order to make the model valid also for high densities
of inclusions. Several of these models are based on the concept of self consistency. This
implies that the inclusions are assumed to be surrounded by the effective medium, rather
than the host material. Thus, we can make Eqs. (6.29) and (6.30) self consistent by redeﬁn-
ing the coefﬁcients of the impact terms (KsQK and GsQG, respectively) by replacing the
∗
elastic moduli Ks and Gs of the solid host material with the resulting moduli K
and G
of the effective medium.

∗

This approach was used by Budiansky and O’Connell (1976) when they introduced self
consistent expressions for the elastic moduli of a cracked material, except that they started
by introducing the impact of the cracks as a perturbation to the compliance rather than the
stiffness. That is, their initial equations were of the type

rather than Eqs. (6.29) and (6.30). For low concentrations of cracks, this makes no dif-
ference since the corresponding expressions converge for small values of ξ. The relevant
expressions for QK and QG can be derived from Eqs. (6.35) and (6.36), respectively.
Eqs. (6.51) and (6.52) are made self consistent by making the impact terms functions of

The effective moduli derived from this model are shown in Fig. 6.7.

Berryman (1980) introduced self consistency into the dynamic theory of Kuster and Tok-
söz (1974), and derived a set of implicit equations for the effective moduli. The equations
are given in Appendix D.3.2. These solutions approach the linear solutions given in Sec-
tion 6.4.1 for low concentrations of inclusions. Berryman also showed that if the material
contains non-solid inclusions, the effective shear modulus vanishes at a critical concentra-
tion of that inclusion. The critical concentration depends on the shape of the inclusions.

The concept of self consistency is a simple and yet efﬁcient way to account for in-
teractions between inclusions. However, the approach does not give unique solutions.
Berryman’s model, as well as the model of Budiansky and O’Connell which express the
impact of inclusions as a perturbation to the compliance, predict that the shear modulus
vanish when the concentration of non-solid inclusions reaches a critical limit. On the other

238

ROCK MODELS

hand, a self-consistent version of Eqs. (6.29) and (6.30) predicts that the shear modulus
never vanish completely.

One attempt to get around this apparent problem was the Differential Effective Medium
theory, initially introduced by Salganik (1973), and later studied in detail by Zimmerman
(1991). This model considers the effect of introducing an inﬁnitesimal amount of inclu-
sions into a material. The equations describing the impact of the inclusions (like Eqs. (6.29)
and (6.30)) can then be written on differential form, in which case it does not matter
whether the inclusions are considered as perturbations to the compliance or the stiffness.
The effective moduli for a ﬁnite concentration of inclusions can be found by integration.

The Differential Effective Medium model appears to eliminate the problem of non-
uniqueness, however this does not imply that this model is in general more correct than
the others. Which of the models that gives the most accurate description of the interactions
between inclusions in a material depends on the actual positions of the inclusions relative
to each other. This is closely related to the statement we made at the beginning of this
chapter, that the elastic properties of a composite material also depend on the geometrical
distribution of each component.

None of the models described above include any explicit information about the positions
of the inclusions relative to each other, however the fact that the models predict different
results implies that they represent different conﬁgurations. Unfortunately, most papers pre-
senting such models do not specify which conﬁguration the model represents. Thus it may
be difﬁcult to decide whether a given model is a suitable representation for a given mate-
rial or not. We may get an indication however, by looking at an example that shows how
different positions of inclusions affect the interactions between them.

Consider the simple, 2-dimensional sample shown in Fig. 6.8a. By applying a force on
the sample (indicated by the arrows on the ﬁgure) and measuring the deformation, we
obtain a measure of the stiffness of the material. The thin slit in the middle of the sample
represents an inclusion similar to a crack. The presence of the crack reduces the stiffness
of the sample, as shown in Fig. 6.9.

The presence of the crack also makes the stress distribution in the sample nonuniform. In
the areas at the side of the crack the stress level will be larger than it would have been if the
crack was not present. If new cracks are introduced in these areas, as shown in Fig. 6.8b,
the stiffness of the sample will be more reduced than a simple linear extrapolation of the

impact of one crack would predict (positive interaction; see Fig. 6.9). If we keep adding
cracks in these areas, the sample will eventually split in two, and the stiffness will vanish.
On the other hand, the areas above and below the initial crack will be less exposed to
the applied stress because of the presence of the crack. Adding more cracks in these areas
as shown in Fig. 6.8c, will only have a marginal effect on the sample stiffness, which
will asymptotically approach the value for two separate pillars (negative interaction; see
Fig. 6.9). Thus, the reduction in stiffness due to the presence of a large number of cracks
may be very different for different positions of the cracks relative to each other. In some
cases the actual stiffness may be larger than predicted by a simple linear model, in other
cases it may be less.

We may deduce from this example that a self-consistent model based on a perturbation
of stiffness represents a material similar to the one shown in Fig. 6.8c, where the inclusions
are positioned such that they tend to shield each other from the external load. On the other
hand, a self-consistent model based on a perturbation of compliance represents a material
similar to the one shown in Fig. 6.8b, where the inclusions are positioned in areas that are
particularly exposed to the external load because of the presence of other inclusions.

To pick which model that is best suited as a representation for a speciﬁc material, we thus
need to know something about the distribution of inclusions in the material. Knowledge
about the process that created the inclusions may be of some help. For instance, cracks in-
duced by a tensile stress tend to appear in particularly exposed areas, like Fig. 6.8b. A linear
model like Eqs. (6.29) and (6.30) represents a kind of average over both types of geome-
tries, and may be a good starting point if we know nothing about the actual distribution of
inclusions.

240

ROCK MODELS

6.4.4. Crack development in stressed rocks

Changes in the stress state of a rock may cause cracks to initiate and grow, or maybe
to close, depending on the orientation and sign of the principal stresses relative to the
orientation of the cracks. Thus, the number, size and predominant orientation of the cracks
in a rock specimen largely reﬂects the stress state and stress history of the specimen.

A compressive stress acting in a direction more or less normal to a crack tends to close
the crack. The closure process depends on the shape of the crack (Mavko and Nur, 1978).
Mismatch between the crack faces implies that the closure process extends over a large
range of stress values (see Section 6.5.1).

It is intuitively clear that a crack may grow if the crack faces are pulled apart with a
sufﬁciently large force. Following Grifﬁth (1921), we shall consider crack growth induced
by tensile stress in a planar (2-dimensional) system. The specimen under consideration
is a plate of thickness t, and the crack is a ﬂat, elliptical slit of length 2a penetrating
the plate. A tensile stress σ (<0) acting normal to the crack causes the plate to deform
(Fig. 6.10). The strain energy due to the crack, Wc, deﬁned as the strain energy of the
specimen containing the crack minus the strain energy a similar specimen without a crack
would have if it was exposed to the same stress, is given as

Wc = π a2t

E

σ 2

(6.59)

where E is the Young’s modulus of the material the plate is made of. A free surface is
supposed to possess a surface energy ws per unit area (associated with broken atomic
bonds), thus the surface energy Ws of the crack is
Ws = 4wsat

(6.60)

The surface energy required to increase the crack size by a small amount 2a is
(∂Ws/∂a)a while the strain energy available for this increase is (∂Wc/∂a)a. Thus,
the crack is unstable and will start to grow if

∂Wc
∂a

(cid:2) ∂Ws
∂a

(6.61)

By combining Eqs. (6.59)–(6.61), we ﬁnd that the crack will start to grow if the tensile
stress exceeds the threshold value

(cid:7)

T0 =

2wsE
π a

(6.62)

Crack growth implies that a increases, and consequently the threshold value decreases, ac-
cording to Eq. (6.62). The situation is thus unstable, and the crack will continue to grow
until the specimen fails. Therefore, T0 represents the tensile strength of the specimen con-
taining the crack. This demonstrates that pre-existing cracks have a pronounced effect on
the tensile strength of a rock.

Crack growth is often analysed in terms of stress intensity factors, which deﬁne the
stress state at the tip of a crack. For a crack that is experiencing tensile stress as described
above (also called Mode I loading) the stress ﬁeld in the vicinity of the crack tip can be
expressed as

The coordinates r and θ are deﬁned in Fig. 6.10. f (I)
ij (θ ) are known functions of the angle θ
(see for instance Anderson, 1995; see also Appendix D.3.1). KI is called the stress intensity
factor for Mode I loading, and is a measure for the stress singularity at the crack tip. It is a
function of the farﬁeld stress σ and the crack length 2a:

KI = −yσ

√

π a

(6.64)

where y is a dimensionless constant depending on geometry. For a slit in a plate as de-
scribed above, y = 1. For a penny-shaped crack (with radius a) in an inﬁnite medium,
y = 2/π.
If KI exceeds a critical limit KIC called the fracture toughness, the crack will start to

grow.

Crack growth may also occur under compressive stresses. If the stress state is
anisotropic, the stress conditions at the tip of a crack oriented at a skew angle relative
to the largest principal stress may become tensile, and the crack will grow if this tensile
stress exceeds a critical value. Based on such considerations, Grifﬁth extended his theory
to general stress conditions. The resulting failure criterion is given in Section 2.3.2. As the
crack growth is assumed to be caused by local tensile stress, the tensile strength is a key
parameter also for the compressive failure criterion.

The situation is illustrated in Fig. 6.11a (also discussed in Section 1.8). Even though the
initial crack may be closed because of the compressive stress σ , the crack faces may start
to slide relative to each other due to the shear stress τ if the static friction is overcome. The
orientation of the local stresses at the tip of the crack is such that the crack growth will
occur parallel to σ1, and normal to σ3, thus the so-called wing cracks will develop.
The relation between crack growth and global failure of a sample is in general more
complicated for compressive stresses. In unconﬁned situations (σ3 = 0), failure typically

conditions. b. Local failure (shear: grey lines, and tensile: black lines) caused by external loading on a 2D sample,

occurs by axial splitting, starting with opening of axial cracks from the tip of the largest
pre-existing crack or ﬂaw in the specimen. Under conﬁnement, like in a standard triaxial
test, the wing cracks related to a suitably oriented crack will grow when the conditions are
fulﬁlled, however these cracks will not be able to grow critically and cause macroscopic
failure on their own. Global failure is thus related to interaction and coalescence of several
cracks forming an array along the plane that eventually becomes the global failure plane.
A mathematical model was developed by Horii and Nemat-Nasser (1985), incorporating

both shear failure and axial splitting. The input parameters to their model were:

1. The length and the orientation of the largest pre-existing crack.

2. The cohesive yield stress and average friction coefﬁcient of the crack interface.

3. Fracture toughness for crack opening in the matrix material.

4. The conﬁning pressure.

Clearly, such detailed knowledge of material properties may be hard to obtain in a general
situation. The model is however useful in the sense that it can explain from microscopic
principles the shape of the observed failure envelopes: the nonlinearity of the failure enve-
lope, which is often observed in practice, is here explained by the transition from failure
initiated at the largest pre-existing ﬂaws (at low conﬁning pressures) to failure initiated at
critically oriented ﬂaws (at high conﬁning pressures). Horii and Nemat-Nasser obtained
a good ﬁt between model prediction and experimental observations for the variation of
ultimate strength with conﬁning pressure in Westerly Granite.

Cracks of the type shown in Fig. 6.11a are not normally observed in rocks. However,
local damage induced by shear stress typically involves both shear and tensile failure, as
illustrated on Fig. 6.11b. The construction shown in Fig. 6.11a represents a model that
provides a coupling between shear and tensile failure, and is as such intuitively useful.

FRACTURED ROCKS

243

The fact that the irregular microstructure of a granular material makes this coupling more
complex is not surprising.

6.5. Fractured rocks

Most rocks that we see in nature appear to be fractured masses rather than intact, solid
materials. We may also expect fracture systems to penetrate the formations in the under-
ground. This may be the case on many length scales, from major faults on a scale larger
than reservoirs, to microfractures seen in a core plug. An example is the fractured chalk
reservoir of the Ekoﬁsk ﬁeld in the North Sea. Here the fractures are responsible for the
main part of the permeability. It is therefore of importance to be able to identify as early as
possible the existence of such fracture systems in reservoirs, and to ﬁnd the directions of the
fractures. It may also be important (with reference to e.g. the Ekoﬁsk case and prediction of
reservoir compaction during depletion) to know how much the fractures contribute to the
overall mechanical behaviour of a rock mass. In this section, we shall discuss how fractured
(or jointed) rocks behave mechanically, starting with the mechanical behaviour of a single
fracture (or joint). The terms fracture and joint will be used synonymously throughout this
section, although there is a difference from the geological viewpoint (see Chapter 3). With
the mathematical idealizations presented here, they can however be treated within the same
framework.

6.5.1. Single fractures

Previously in this chapter we considered the effect of cracks on rock mechanical and
acoustical properties. By a crack we meant an open void of a given, idealized shape (spher-
oid, penny-shaped) which acts as a local discontinuity. In practice however, a crack in a
porous rock does not have an ideal geometry. Fracture surfaces are rough, and they may
touch each other at some points.

In general, the complete stress–strain behaviour of a fracture relates normal displace-
ment (δwF) to normal stress (δσ ) on the fracture, and shear displacement (δuF) to shear
stress (δτ ) along the fracture interface. We may deﬁne δwF such that δwF = wF
− wF,
o is the initial fracture opening and wF the actual fracture opening. The frac-
where wF
ture is closed when δwF = wF
max is the fracture opening at maxi-
mum closure. The stress-displacement relation can be written as (see e.g. Bandis, 1990;
Saeb and Amadei, 1992): (cid:4)

where the indices in the fracture stiffness tensor (Kij ) denote n for normal and t for tan-
gential. Observed deformational behaviour is highly nonlinear for increasing compressive
load, while unloading causes large hysteresis and inelastic behaviour. Under tension, the
associated fracture stiffness is close to zero. Under shearing, the stress–strain relation may

244

exhibit “plastic” as well as “brittle” behaviour, depending on the fracture size. On an empir-
ical basis, the following type of expression for Knn has been proposed for joints (Goodman,
1974):

nn is the initial normal stiffness of the joint. The appearance of K o

implies that stress history dependence may be accounted for in the joint stiffness.

The shear stress dependence of Ktt has been described by a relationship of the type

tt is the initial shear stiffness and τs is the asymptotic value for τ at large shear displace-

ments. The off-diagonal terms in the stiffness tensor (Eq. (6.65)) account for coupling
between shear and normal behaviour due to dilatancy. A mathematical model incorporat-
ing these terms has been presented by Saeb and Amadei (1992).

Given the fracture stiffness parameters (Eq. (6.65)), one may calculate the frequency
dependent time delay, and the sound transmission and reﬂection coefﬁcients caused by a
single fracture (Pyrak-Nolte et al., 1990). The calculations show an increased damping of
high frequencies in a transmitted acoustic signal when the fracture stiffness is reduced. The
effect of viscosity in a ﬂuid ﬁlling the fracture was also analysed, showing increased high
frequency damping with decreasing viscosity.

From a microscopic viewpoint, closure of a fracture can be described mathematically
by parameters depending on the roughness characteristics of the fracture surfaces. Brown
and Scholz (1986) derived a relationship where they accounted for the following fracture
surface parameters: a distribution function for asperity heights, the number of local maxima
per unit area, the effective radius of curvature of the asperities, the fracture width at zero
stress, and a correction factor for tangential stress contributions. For a particular choice of
the asperity height distribution function, the strain vs. stress relationship can be written

δεF = A + B ln δσ

(6.68)
where δεF = δwF/wF is the fracture strain. A and B are functions of the fracture surface
parameters described above. The joint closure is thus a highly nonlinear function of the
normal stress.

Carlson and Gangi (1985) modelled a fracture using a “bed of nails” concept (see
Fig. 6.12). A set of cylindrical rods of different lengths Li are attached to the crack walls,
simulating a distribution of asperities. The rods are assumed to act as springs. As the nor-
mal stress is increased across the fracture, the walls of the fracture move closer and more
and more rods come in contact with the opposite wall. Therefore, the stiffness is increased
as the strain increases, similar to Eq. (6.68). For a through-going fracture, the fracture strain
can be expressed as:

(cid:4)

where σc is the stress required to close the crack. The exponent m ((cid:3)1) is given by the
distribution of rod lengths. The fraction n of rods in contact is:

n = (δεF)(1−m)/m

(6.70)
m is thought to be constant throughout a given experiment. The value m = 1 corresponds
to a closed crack with perfectly smooth surfaces, while m = 0 corresponds to and open
crack with smooth surfaces.

Carlson and Gangi modiﬁed the expression (6.69) for the case of an isolated crack in a

solid matrix, giving

δεF =

m

(6.71)

Here σo is equivalent to an initial stress (associated with the tensile strength of the ma-
terial). The expressions can be used quantitatively to evaluate the stress dependence of
P-wave velocities in cracked media, leading to a relationship of the following form which
is applicable for high porosity sedimentary rocks:
1 + σ

(6.72)

(cid:4)

σo

In Section 6.3 we found for a model consisting of spheres in contact (where the contacts
behave according to Hertzian theory) that the sound velocity would increase with stress
according to a power law behaviour, with exponent 1/6. This corresponds to m = 2/3
(and σo → 0) in Carlson and Gangi’s theory. In many rocks, exponents <1/6 have been
observed, indicating that m is closer to 1 (Carlson and Gangi, 1985).

246

ROCK MODELS

The shear strength of a joint or fracture is often expressed in terms of a Mohr–Coulomb

criterion with zero cohesion (see Section 2.3.1):

τ = σ tan ϕ

(6.73)

Based on laboratory experiments with more than 200 artiﬁcial tensile fractures, Barton and
Bandis (1990) found that the friction angle ϕ can be expressed as

ϕ = JRC log

+ ϕr

JCS
σ

(6.74)

JRC is called the joint roughness coefﬁcient, while JCS is the wall strength, identiﬁed as
the unconﬁned compressive strength of the intact rock. ϕr is the residual angle of friction
(≈30°, see Chapter 2). JRC can be found from simple shear tests, and has typically a value
around 20 for a rough joint without steps. It is a scale dependent factor, and a scaling
relation has been established (see Barton and Bandis, 1990), giving JRC as a function of
roughness amplitude over proﬁle length.

6.5.2. Rocks with many fractures

A rock mass normally contains a system of fractures. Such a system is speciﬁed in terms
of fracture orientation, fracture width, length and spacing. While the orientation is mainly
determined by the stress state at the time the fracture was formed, the remaining parameters
are primarily given by the lithology. These parameters are necessary in order to quantify the
ﬂow of ﬂuids in a fractured reservoir. In nature, there is of course a distribution of fracture
parameters. Many investigators have claimed that fracture size distributions observed in
outcrops tend to be scale invariant (fractal).

Several Finite Element and Finite Difference codes have been developed in order to
analyse the mechanical behaviour of discontinuous media. Standard input parameters are
a set of fracture stiffnesses and the elastic moduli of the intact material. We shall not de-
scribe any of these methods here, but rather discuss one analytical model for the elastic
behaviour of fractured rocks. This theory was developed by White (1983). Consider a
cube (Fig. 6.13) consisting of fractured blocks. Each block is spot-welded to the neigh-
bouring blocks (Fig. 6.14). The average dimensions of a block are Lx, Ly and Lz, and
the number of contact points per unit area Nx, Ny and Nz, respectively. The spot-welded
contacts are assumed to be circles of average diameters Dx, Dy and Dz. The elastic prop-
erties of the fractured cube is derived based on the Hertz–Mindlin approach introduced
in Section 6.3. For the effective contact radius b (Eq. (6.18)) we here use the parameter
Σx b = (Dx Nx Ly Lz)/2 for a surface normal to x, and corresponding expressions for y
and z. The compressive strain εx due to a force σx has two contributions:

Firstly, the deformation at the fracture planes normal to x causes a strain (see Eq. (6.21))

substituted for Rx , ax. The derivation of ax is rather tedious and is not included here. The
result is

(6.81)
and similar expressions for C55 and C66. Note that Rx = Ry = Rz → ∞ means that the
material effectively contains no fractures, i.e. the elastic moduli are those of the solid. As a
plausible example, consider an average distance between fractures Lx = Ly = Lz = 1 m,
with Nx = Ny = 5 m
−2 contacts per unit area and an average contact spot diameter of
Dx = Dy = 0.1 m. Thus, Rx = Ry = 0.5. Fig. 6.15 shows how the shear velocities
associated with C44 (SV) and C66 (SH) vary as functions of Rz in this case (assuming
νs = 0.25). The ﬁgure also shows the case of a planar fracture system (Rx = Ry → ∞).
Both shear moduli are strongly reduced by the presence of fractures. This also underlines
the existence of a size effect: if a sample is smaller than the smallest fracture block, one
will measure the solid properties rather than the properties of the rock mass. White’s model
can also be used to reveal the effects of a directional distribution of fracture planes, which

theory. Rx , Ry and Rz are deﬁned in the text.

Mechanical properties and stress data from laboratory
analysis

Evaluation of in situ rock mechanical behaviour requires relevant input data: What is the
stress state and the pore pressure at the depth of interest? What are the elastic moduli and
the strength parameters? Can we expect creep or other types of non-elastic behaviour to
take place?

Our main data sources in order to answer these questions are core material and data
recorded in the ﬁeld (measurements while drilling, wireline logs, seismic data and vari-
ous well tests). The logs provide data recorded continuously vs. depth, but do not measure
directly the parameters that are needed for a rock mechanical analysis. For instance, rock
strength can not be measured from wireline logs. Strength estimates may, however, be
given if a proper interpretation procedure is applied. Field measurements of rock mechan-
ical parameters are discussed in Chapter 8.

In this chapter we shall discuss rock mechanical core analysis. Cores provide a possibil-
ity for direct measurement of e.g. rock strength parameters and static elastic properties. We
shall start by looking at the rocks to be tested: the cores in the laboratory may not be fully
representative of the formation we intend to study. They may also have been altered during
coring and subsequent handling. Some of these problems can not be solved, others can
be overcome by proper sample preparation methods, test procedures and correction proce-
dures. On the other hand, if proper preparation procedures are not applied, severe errors
in the test results may be introduced. These factors will be discussed in more detail below
(Section 7.1). We shall then discuss the laboratory equipment and measurement techniques
(Section 7.2) applied in rock mechanical testing, including also acoustic measurements.

A rock mechanical core analysis has to be designed according to the purpose of the in-
vestigation. If the objective is to predict reservoir compaction, then the tests and testing
procedures may not be the same as for instance in a borehole stability study. Consideration
also has to be given to the rock type which is going to be tested. Shales require both spe-
cial preparation procedures and special test procedures. In Section 7.3 we shall describe
relevant test procedures which are applied in rock mechanical testing and give some rec-
ommendations for test interpretation.

The literature reports numerous attempts to determine in situ stresses from laboratory

testing of core samples. The most relevant test methods will be discussed in Section 7.4.

In some cases it may be useful to perform a set of simpler measurements which can
be used as indicators of rock strength and stiffness. This can provide information at less
cost and at less material consumption. The latter is particularly relevant if the core is in
a poor state and larger test plugs can not be prepared. If performed at the rig-site, results
may be available closer to real-time. Some of these so-called index tests are described in
Section 7.5.

MECHANICAL PROPERTIES AND STRESS DATA FROM LABORATORY ANALYSIS

7.1. Core samples for rock mechanical laboratory analysis

7.1.1. Core representativeness and size effects

As we stated above, cores are our only possibility of obtaining direct measurements of
rock strength and static mechanical parameters. Cores are, however, only available from
discrete levels, and may only be representative of the formations in or near the borehole
itself. The limited availability of core material may cause large uncertainty in the results.
Normally, cores are taken mainly or only in the reservoir, while the mechanical behaviour
of the overlying strata may be of large importance for drilling problems, subsidence and
repeated seismic interpretation during reservoir depletion.

(cid:2)(cid:2)
A core plug used in standard mechanical testing has a diameter of 1–2.5

. Only in spe-
) samples be used. This means that the
cial cases will larger (4–5
tested cores may, in case of inhomogeneities, not be representative of the interval under
investigation. For instance, in a fractured zone, the rocks to be tested are normally taken
from the intact parts. One has to recall that the elastic behaviour of the fractured rock mass
can be very different from that of the intact rock (Chapter 6). This means that if the prop-
erties which are important are those of the rock mass, then the analysis will be biased. The
samples should then, if possible, be taken so that fractures are contained in them. If, on the
other hand, the data will be applied in e.g. sand prediction analysis, then the fractures may
not be relevant, and the samples should be taken from the intact parts of the rock.

(cid:2)(cid:2)

) or smaller (0.1–1

(cid:2)(cid:2)

The discussion above shows that the size of the sample may be important. If the fractures
occur on a scale of several metres, then it is very unlikely that tests on small samples will
provide reliable data. Fractures and cracks may, however, occur on several length scales,
down to and below the sample size. Statistically, a larger sample is expected to contain
larger cracks than a small sample. Qualitatively, this would lead to an increased strength
with decreasing sample size, since the strength decreases with the size of the largest crack.
This hypothesis is often valid in experiments (see e.g. Vutukuri et al., 1974), but is not
generally conﬁrmed. In fact, experiments with sedimentary rocks some times may show an
opposite trend (strength increases with sample size). Even though the size effect problem
has been focused since the advent of material property testing in the 18th century (see the
interesting historical overview in Hudson et al., 1972), it still remains unsolved.

Clearly, in granular rocks, there is a lower limit to the sample size given by the require-
ment that the sample should contain a large number of grains. In the procedures suggested
by the ISRM (International Society for Rock Mechanics) (Brown (Ed.), 1981), it is stated
that the diameter of a specimen prepared for rock mechanical testing should be at least ten
times the diameter of the largest grain in the rock.

7.1.2. Core alteration

A rock specimen is most likely altered when taken from in situ to laboratory conditions.
In situ it may have been at a depth of one or more kilometres, at an ambient temperature
of say 50–150 °C, and in chemical equilibrium with its own pore ﬂuid. When cored, it is
brought to atmospheric conditions in terms of stress, pore pressure and temperature. It is

in a normally stressed rock. (After Holt et al., 2000; with permission from Elsevier.)

also in contact with some chemically active/inactive drilling mud, and mud ﬁltrate may
penetrate the core. Thus the main core alteration mechanisms are stress release, pore pres-
sure release (especially in low-permeability rocks), thermal effects and chemical effects
due to ﬂuid exposure. The cores may be further damaged by the action of the drill bit, and
by subsequent improper handling and storage (see Section 7.1.3).

Stress release probably has the most severe effect on rock mechanical properties. Fig. 7.1
shows schematically the effective stress ﬁeld alterations experienced by a core during the
coring process. This is under the assumption of a vertical well drilled in an initial stress ﬁeld
with a vertical stress and isotropic horizontal stresses. As the core is drilled, the vertical
stress is reduced ﬁrst, while the horizontal stress is reduced as the core enters the core
barrel. Thus there is a period where the horizontal stress may be signiﬁcantly larger than
the vertical stress. This may result in yielding and/or failure of the core. The amount of
core recovery and the size of the recovered pieces are thus qualitative measures of the rock
strength. The weaker the rock, the less intact core material will be recovered. Macroscopic
failure may also occur as tensile failure (core discing). This has been used to evaluate in
particular the ratio between horizontal and vertical principal stress components (Maury et
al., 1988).

Laboratory testing of rock alteration due to stress release has shown an effect on the
mechanical properties of sandstone (Holt et al., 2000), resulting in a reduced uniaxial
compressive strength, reduced stiffness, reduced acoustic velocities and increased stress
sensitivity.

Shale may have nanoDarcy or lower permeability (Section 3.4.3) which means that pore
pressure equilibrium will not be maintained when the core is retrieved from depth. Thus,
tensile failure is very likely to occur, either macroscopically, or on a microscopic level.
This process, as well as volumetric expansion during coring and retrieval, causes the shale
core to be incompletely saturated when reaching the surface. As discussed further below

254

MECHANICAL PROPERTIES AND STRESS DATA FROM LABORATORY ANALYSIS

(see Section 7.1.4), this may affect shale properties signiﬁcantly, and needs to be accounted
for in sample preparation and conditioning.

7.1.3. Core handling

We have seen above that cores may be disturbed by the coring process itself. Further treat-
ment on the rig, during transport, during storage and prior to testing in the laboratory may
also be critically important to the outcome of the rock mechanical analysis. There are two
major problems which are relevant for sedimentary rocks: one is the fact that they can be
mechanically weak, and in some cases completely unconsolidated. The other is that they
may be sensitive to the exposure to or loss of ﬂuids.

For poorly consolidated sandstones, samples may not be kept intact unless they are
frozen immediately after coring, and kept so until mounted in the triaxial cell. Freezing
should, however, be avoided if possible, since it may induce permanent changes in the
rock. This is in particular the case if water is present. Since clay minerals contain bound
water, freezing may cause disintegration and redistribution of these minerals. If the clay
minerals act as cement, this will clearly affect the mechanical properties.

For sandstones (in particular clay-rich sandstones) the rock mechanical properties are
also found to depend on moisture content. The general observation is that (see e.g. Colback
and Wiid, 1965) uniaxial compressive strength decreases with increasing moisture content.
Colback and Wiid relate this to a change in the surface energy.

It has been observed by the authors of this book that a sandstone stored in normal labo-
ratory atmosphere for one year after sampling increased its strength by a factor of two due
to drying. This was an effect of smectite in the sandstone which contributed signiﬁcantly
to the cementation when dried.

Shales contain both bound water and free water and should therefore never be frozen.
Shales are also extremely sensitive to contact with wetting ﬂuids like water, or to loss of
water from the pores. This means that the samples should be preserved as soon as the core
is retrieved, so that the natural water content is not reduced. Dehydration may cause them
to disintegrate completely within a matter of minutes. In other cases, depending on the
microstructure and the shale composition, dehydration may lead to strengthening of the
material.

Shale cores intended for rock mechanical tests should be sealed immediately after cor-
ing, for instance by wrapping them in a plastic ﬁlm with further protection like aluminium
and wax on the outside. If this packing process can not be performed immediately after the
core has been landed on the rig, it is still important to ensure that water transport effects
are avoided. One alternative is to cut the core and the core liner in appropriate lengths
(typically one metre), wipe the mud from the core surface (especially if water-based mud
has been used), ﬁll the annulus between the core and the liner with an inert ﬂuid like oil
and then seal the liner. In all cases it is essential to minimize the period when the core is
exposed to air.

Shales should not be contacted with water or any other ﬂuid which wets the shale. Even
if the water is assumed to completely match the chemistry of the pore water, large capillary
suction pressures may be induced because the shale core is no longer 100% saturated when

CORE SAMPLES FOR ROCK MECHANICAL LABORATORY ANALYSIS

255

it is under atmospheric conditions. The capillary pressure is generated to counterbalance
the surface tension which develops at the interface between the wetting (water) and the
non-wetting (gas) ﬂuid.

The capillary pressure generated in a gas bubble as a rock sample is entirely surrounded

by water is given by the Laplace equation:

p = 2γ cos θ

r

(7.1)

where γ is the interfacial tension between the two phases, θ is the contact angle between
the wetting phase and the solid, and r is the radius of the capillary tube which in a porous
medium would be characteristic of the pore size.
Consider a water/air interface in shale with a mean pore size (radius) of 20 nm (Horsrud
et al., 1998). With an interfacial tension of 0.07 N/m and fully wetting conditions (θ = 0),
this gives a potential capillary pressure of 7 MPa. Such a large internal pressure may easily
exceed the tensile strength of the shale and cause rupture and disintegration of the shale.

7.1.4. Preparation of test samples

(cid:2)(cid:2)

Cores normally arrive in the laboratory at 4
in diameter and in lengths up to one metre.
Core plugs then have to be drilled from these full-size core sections. When drilling the core
plugs it is important to be consistent with respect to drilling direction, since rock properties
often are anisotropic. This is often linked to the bedding direction. The strength has a
minimum when the sample is oriented with its long axis at an oblique angle to the bedding
(see Section 2.9). It may therefore be necessary to perform a series of measurements with
specimens oriented with their axes parallel to, normal to, and at intermediate angles with
respect to the bedding plane. The possibility of performing this type of investigation is in
practice limited by the amount of core material available. In deviated wells with unoriented
core it is therefore necessary to make sure that the bedding direction can be established
before core plugs are drilled.

It is recommended to avoid sampling the outer centimetre of the core, due to potential
alteration of this part of the core. This alteration may have been induced by the drilling
mud and invasion of drilling mud ﬁltrate.

Core drilling may be very difﬁcult in weak rocks. Although not recommended, drilling
and handling of unconsolidated sandstone may be impossible unless the sample is kept
frozen. For a somewhat consolidated sandstone, pressurized air may be used for cooling
and for removal of drill cuttings instead of water. If a drilling ﬂuid is used, it should be
chemically compatible with the rock. When drilling chalk cores it is customary to apply a
water which has been saturated with the same chalk.

Shales and other strongly layered rocks may be difﬁcult to drill normal to the bedding,
since the bedding is often a weak plane. The tendency for core discing may be reduced by
applying a small axial load on the sample (inside the coring bit) during drilling.

Shale samples should be drilled using an inert ﬂuid like a mineral oil. For reasons already
discussed, contact with water may induce capillary effects, even if the water is believed to
have exactly the same chemical composition as the pore water. These capillary effects are

256

MECHANICAL PROPERTIES AND STRESS DATA FROM LABORATORY ANALYSIS

due to incomplete saturation of the shale and the presence of air in the sample. It has been
proposed to remedy this by resaturating the shale (e.g. Schmitt et al., 1994). This is not
done by immersion, but in a controlled humidity atmosphere where water vapour con-
denses in the pores. To avoid trapped air it is preferable to have a continuous gas phase
before starting resaturation. This may require a ﬁrst stage with drying of the sample. How-
ever, it has been strongly argued that such a process may change the structure and properties
of the shale (Santos et al., 1996). Therefore, attempts to resaturate shale should be avoided.
The best approach is to make sure that the shale is well preserved, so that sufﬁcient resat-
uration can be obtained by loading the sample prior to or during testing (Horsrud et al.,
1998). The water content of the rock should always be measured before rock mechanical
tests are performed.

The signiﬁcance of sample saturation is well known from soil mechanics. In rocks with
small pores (shale, chalk), the presence of air may cause signiﬁcant overestimation of the
mechanical properties of the rock (Schmitt et al., 1994; Papamichos et al., 1997). As a ﬁrst
order approximation one may express this as a generalized effective stress:

(cid:2)(cid:2) = σ − pgas + Sw(pgas − pwater)

σ

(7.2)
where Sw is the water saturation and pgas − pwater is the pore-water capillary suction. The
capillary suction effect may then be compared with the effect of a conﬁning stress. To
some extent this is consistent with the observations of increased strength and stiffness with
reduced saturation.

Reservoir rocks (sandstone, chalk) may also be sensitive to the ﬂuid in the pores. A dry
rock is usually stronger than a ﬂuid saturated rock. When measuring petrophysical prop-
erties of sandstone it is common procedure to clean the sample and then resaturate it with
the relevant ﬂuid(s). When doing rock mechanical testing of weak sandstone this is not
recommended, since the cleaning process may disturb the cementation of the rock. Weak
sandstones should be well preserved and tested with the native ﬂuid content.

Another important observation relates to the high porosity North Sea chalks. Laboratory
testing has shown that oil saturated chalk samples are signiﬁcantly stronger than water sat-
urated samples (Andersen, 1995). It has been suggested that this effect could be explained
be capillary forces which are caused by the irreducible water still present in oil saturated
chalk. However, it has been shown that the chalk is strengthened (both in compression and
tension) also when saturated with methanol which is fully miscible with water (Risnes and
Flaageng, 1999). Thus there must be other mechanisms present which have not yet been
explained.

The ISRM (International Society for Rock Mechanics) standards (Brown (Ed.), 1981,
and revision by Kovari et al., 1983) require that specimens intended for standard rock me-
chanical tests are right, circular cylinders with a length (L) to diameter (D) ratio between
2 and 3. The reason for this is that the sample should be sufﬁciently long to accommodate
a shear plane penetrating through the side walls. If the sample is too short, the shear plane
will penetrate through the end faces, and an additional support will be provided. Fig. 7.2 il-
lustrates this, and the expected effect of variations in L/D on strength. The chosen criterion
therefore makes sure that the length to diameter ratio is such that the uniaxial compressive
strength is rather insensitive to minor deviations in L/D. This type of relationship has been
conﬁrmed by experiments (see e.g. Vutukuri et al., 1974).

As mentioned above, the diameter should be at least ten times the diameter of the
largest grain. The end surfaces should according to ISRM standards be ﬂat to within
±0.01 mm (which is unrealistic in coarse-grained, weak materials!), the parallelism better
than L/L = 0.001, and the sides smooth and straight to within 0.3 mm over the full
sample length. The sample diameter should be measured to the nearest 0.1 mm by averag-
ing diameters measured at right angles to each other at the top, the middle and the bottom
of the sample. Sample length should be determined to the nearest 1.0 mm, but a higher
accuracy is requested if e.g. acoustic velocity measurements are performed during rock
mechanical testing.

A geological description of the rock samples should be made. This includes an overview
of the mineralogy, with focus on how the rock is cemented. The grain size distribution
should be obtained, either from sieve analysis or from thin section analysis. Photos of the
samples should be made prior to and after testing.

Since the results are going to be used in downhole operations (drilling, completions,
stimulation), it is important that the laboratory results can be compared with well log read-
ings. An accurate measure of the core depth is therefore required. Abrupt lithology changes
can easily be recognized in the recovered core as well as on logs. One possibility is to use
a Gamma ray detection tool during coring and compare the signatures with readings of the
Gamma ray logging tool. If anelastic strain recovery, differential strain curve analysis (see
Section 7.4) or other techniques for determining the orientation of the in situ stress ﬁeld
are applied, it is necessary also to have oriented cores. Cores may be oriented by knives
inscribing the geographical direction on the core during coring, or by using geological
markers.

7.2. Laboratory equipment

A standard rock mechanical test laboratory for studies of sedimentary rocks includes (see
Fig. 7.3) the following equipment:

258

• Load frame.
• Triaxial cell.
• Conﬁning pressure system.
• Pore pressure system.
• Computer for control and data processing.

7.2.1. The load frame

The load frame is a central element in the test equipment. Two features are essential for its
operation in a rock mechanical laboratory: the frame stiffness and the ability to operate the
system in a mode of constant displacement rate (Hudson et al., 1972).

Traditionally, force was regarded as the independent variable in materials testing. If a
brittle rock sample is loaded with a constant load increment per unit time, then the material
will fail abruptly and no controlled measurement can be achieved in the post-failure region.
This is unsatisfactory for most rock testing, since the load bearing capacity of a rock after it
has failed may be an important design parameter. In order for the post-failure behaviour to
be properly recorded, the experiment has to be run in displacement control. This is achieved
with most modern equipment, which is servo-hydraulically controlled. This means that

LABORATORY EQUIPMENT

259

a feedback control system is implemented: a detected difference between the recorded
displacement and the programmed displacement can then be used to control a servo-valve,
which induces further displacement of the loading pistons.

Studies of post-failure behaviour of brittle rocks require also that the testing apparatus
is stiff compared to the maximum slope in the descending part of the stress–strain curve
(Hudson et al., 1972). If not, a major part of the energy stored in the machine-specimen
system will be released during the fracture process, causing the measured characteristics
beyond failure to be an artifact induced by the test machine. However, using a stiff and
servo-hydraulically controlled test machine, the experiment can be run at a constant defor-
mation rate, provided the response time of the feedback system is sufﬁciently fast. In this
mode, post-failure behaviour can be studied in detail.

−1. The choice of a particular
ing is normally performed with strain rates of 10
strain rate depends on the nature of the rock and the problem which is actually studied. It
is generally thought that rock strength increases with increasing strain rate. Experiments
with different rocks (Vutukuri et al., 1974) show signiﬁcant increases in strength at strain
rates above ≈10
−1. There are at least two mechanisms which may cause such strain
rate effects, namely creep and consolidation. In particular, if tests are performed with low
permeability rocks (e.g. shales) in which pore ﬂuid drainage should be facilitated, then it
is important that sufﬁcient time is allowed for the pore ﬂuid to escape during sample com-
pression (see e.g. Swan et al., 1989). If one wishes to quantify strain rate effects as part of
a dedicated test programme, then at least three orders of magnitude in the strain rate should
be spanned (Jones, 1988). This may mean that tests in extreme cases have to be run over
periods of several weeks or even months, which imposes a strong requirement on system
stability.

Further key parameters of the load frame are maximum operating force in compression
and extension, total stroke, free compression space and accuracy of the force or displace-
ment control.

7.2.2. The triaxial cell

The other central element of the test system is the triaxial cell (Fig. 7.4). There are two
types of triaxial cells used in rock testing (Jones, 1988). One is a cell where the sample
is placed between two movable pistons (the “Hoek cell”; Hoek and Franklin, 1968). The
other uses a ﬁxed pedestal carrying the sample.

A triaxial cell (Fig. 7.4) contains the loading pistons, which are pressed against the
sample. The sample is surrounded by a sleeve, which separates it from the conﬁning ﬂuid
in the case of conﬁned tests.

The pistons should be made of a hard material (ISRM requirements (Brown (Ed.), 1981)
are steel pistons having a minimum speciﬁed hardness). The surfaces should be ground
and polished, and their ﬂatness should be within 5 µm. The ﬂatness of the pistons has an
important effect on the test results. If the friction coefﬁcient between the sample and the
piston is large enough to prevent radial expansion of the sample at the end faces, then this

260

Fig. 7.4. Principle sketch of the interior of a triaxial cell, showing the loading piston with ﬂuid ports, optional
sintered plates for ﬂuid distribution, a radial strain jig (suspended from the specimen) measuring two orthogonal
diameters, and an axial strain jig measuring change in sample length between the pistons. It is also possible to
measure axial strain directly on the sample, and to measure radial strain in more than 2 directions, or measure the
change in circumference by a chain around the sample.

is equivalent to providing the material with an additional support. This will manifest itself
as a length:diameter effect, since the support of the end faces will give rise to a higher
measured strength with a short than with a long sample.

In rock testing for petroleum applications one may wish to have ﬂuid inlet and outlet in
the pistons in order to apply and measure pore pressure. This can be done by using sintered
pistons or by introducing ﬂow channels in the piston surfaces.

For acoustic measurements, the piston material should ideally have acoustic properties
which provide an acoustic impedance-matching between the acoustic transducers and the
rock material. The choice of steel as a piston material is in that case not ideal for studies
of soft rock samples. Thus the requirements to piston material, ﬂatness and hardness may
have to be relaxed in order to combine rock mechanical testing with other petrophysical
measurements. When measuring the permeability during loading, it is recommended to
have a system for distribution of the ﬂuid ﬂow at the end surfaces. This can be obtained
by making grooves in the pistons or by inserting a sintered plate between the piston and
the rock sample. This can, however, impose end effects (e.g. sedimentation of ﬁnes in the
sintered plates). This is a potentially signiﬁcant error source if the pressure drop along the
core is measured on the outside of the sample.

The sleeve should be soft enough not to provide a signiﬁcant support to the core. This is
normally not a problem, but should be considered when testing very weak samples at low
conﬁning pressures. Sleeves are made from rubber, plastic, Teﬂon or other soft materials.
Sleeve wall thicknesses are normally around a few millimetres. To improve the accuracy

LABORATORY EQUIPMENT

261

of radial deformation measurements (and also measurements of acoustic velocities for ra-
dially propagating waves) the sleeve should be made as thin as possible.

7.2.3. Measurements of stresses and strains

Stress measurements are performed with strain gauges in the load cell, and ﬂuid pressure
transducers in the conﬁning ﬂuid in the triaxial cell. The load cell may be external or
internal to the pressure vessel. The use of an internal load cell eliminates problems caused
by loading ram friction, but makes calibration more difﬁcult (Jones, 1988). Pore pressures
are measured with pressure transducers that are connected to the pistons. By monitoring
the pore pressure drop along a specimen with transducers both in the top and the bottom
pistons, and in addition measuring the ﬂow rate, it is possible to measure permeability as
part of a rock mechanical test.

The radial deformation of the sample can be measured in several ways. One technique
is to use LVDTs (Linear Variable Differential Transformers, which operate on a magnetic
induction principle) pressed against the sleeve at various points circumferentially around
the core. Another widely used method is to have strain gauges glued directly to the sample.
A third technique is to use a cantilever system, where the displacement of the arms is
measured by strain gauges. A fourth technique is to use a chain wrapped around the core
plug, where the change in circumference is monitored with strain gauges. The latter method
is accurate, but does not have the potential to monitor anisotropic deformations. The other
techniques are all essentially point measurements. The accuracy depends on calibration for
sleeve deformation. The radial deformation sensors should be mounted on a jig which is not
attached to the walls of the triaxial cell. Otherwise, the measurements must be calibrated
for deformation of the entire cell.

Axial deformation can be monitored in several ways. Measurement of stroke (i.e. piston
movement) is the most common method. This should be done between the pistons inside
the triaxial cell and not between the loading platens on the outside, in order to obtain the
true sample deformation. If measured outside the cell, corrections for piston deformation
have to be made. Attempts have also been made to measure axial deformation by monitor-
ing the relative displacement of two knife-edges pressed against the sleeve at different axial
positions. This technique provides a strain measurement which eliminates end effects, but
will not cover the entire length of the sample.

Measuring devices mounted inside the triaxial cell must always be calibrated for pres-

sure effects exerted by the conﬁning ﬂuid.

Volume changes may also be used to monitor deformations. The change in pore volume
can be measured by monitoring the amount of pore ﬂuid entering or leaving a fully satu-
rated sample. The change in bulk volume may in principle be measured by monitoring the
volume change of the conﬁning ﬂuid.

7.2.4. Acoustic measurements

The importance of acoustic measurements has been stated several times throughout this
book. A major motivation for doing acoustic laboratory measurements is to support the

262

interpretation of sonic log and seismic measurements. Acoustic laboratory measurements
can provide correlations with rock strength, and may help evaluate the difference between
static and dynamic moduli (Chapter 5). They may also provide information about the in
situ stress state.

The range of frequencies where acoustic measurements can be made is limited mainly
by the sample size. The attenuation of sound sets an upper limit, while the requirement
that a sample should contain several wavelengths in order for a propagating wave to be
set up, imposes a lower limit to the frequency. With normal sample sizes (say 5–10 cm
transmission length) the frequency will be in the 100 kHz – 1 MHz range.

The ultrasonic sources and detectors used at these frequencies are piezo-electric (nor-
mally piezo-ceramic) transducer elements. They are deformed mechanically when an ex-
ternal voltage is applied to them, and vice versa: an electric ﬁeld is generated when they
are deformed by an external force. Differently manufactured piezo-elements are used for
generation of P- and S-waves. By placing transducers at two opposing faces of a rock
specimen, the sound velocities are measured from transit times of pulsed wavelets through
the sample. Measurements at various frequencies can be obtained by a spectral analysis
of the waveforms (see Winkler and Plona, 1982), but this is only possible if the transduc-
ers are broadband in operation. The transducers can be embedded inside the pistons of a
triaxial cell, or in the conﬁning ﬂuid for radial transmission. Fig. 7.5 illustrates a set-up
used for acoustic laboratory measurements, and particularly shows how transducers can be
integrated into a rock mechanical test system.

For practical purposes, the quality of acoustic signals is extremely sensitive to the
acoustic coupling between the transducers and the sample. This coupling is normally ob-
tained by a thin layer of grease, a gel or another viscous ﬂuid placed between the face of

LABORATORY TESTS FOR ROCK MECHANICAL PROPERTY DETERMINATION

263

the transducer and the surface of the specimen. It is important that the couplant layer is
thin enough not to contribute signiﬁcantly to the measured transit time.

With shear wave transducers, it is important to make sure that the polarization of the
transmitting and the receiving transducers point in the same direction. The polarization will
normally be marked on the transducers, but should be checked by placing the transducers
face to face. Maximum signal is then obtained when the polarizations are parallel, while
minimum signal is obtained when they are at 90° to each other. If lower frequencies than
the 100 kHz – 1 MHz range are required, one may use the resonant bar technique. In
this case, the resonance frequency of a vibrating sample is determined. The resonance
frequency is related directly to the wave velocity. Different frequencies can be obtained by
using samples of various size.

In the seismic frequency range (10–100 Hz), velocities may be obtained from stiff-
−6) and stress cycles (Spencer, 1981; Batzle et
nesses measured in very low strain (<10
al., 2006). By measuring strains in various directions and assuming isotropic and homo-
geneous specimens, both P- and S-wave moduli are estimated. Monitoring of phase shifts
permits measurements of attenuation. These are however challenging experiments that can
not yet be considered as routine.

Acoustic measurements in the laboratory should be performed with rocks in unconﬁned
as well as stressed conditions. As discussed later (Section 7.4), unloaded cores are thought
to contain an orientational distribution of microcracks, reﬂecting the in situ stress ﬁeld. The
possibility of using acoustic velocity measurements on cores to evaluate the in situ stress
ﬁeld will be discussed further in Section 7.4.3.

Measurements of P- and S-wave velocities on core plugs at atmospheric conditions are
sometimes performed and correlated with rock strength or elastic moduli measured in a
pressure vessel or a triaxial cell. Such correlations are invalid, since the two measurements
refer to different stress conditions. Therefore, for the purpose of obtaining such correla-
tions, acoustic velocities should be measured during the static tests. In order to compare
with log readings, the acoustic velocities should be measured in the same direction, at the
same stress state, and with the same saturating ﬂuid as under downhole conditions. When
this is done, experience shows that laboratory measured sound velocities can be different
from those measured in the borehole. This may be due to a dispersion effect (Chapter 5),
since the frequencies in laboratory studies normally are higher than those used in the ﬁeld.
It may also be due to core alteration, as discussed in Section 7.1.2.

7.3. Laboratory tests for rock mechanical property determination

In this section we will discuss procedures for performing the most common types of rock
mechanical tests, including some comments about test interpretation.

7.3.1. Stresses on cylindrical samples

For cylindrical coordinates, r, θ and z, Hooke’s law can be written (with Biot’s coefﬁcient
α = 1)

The remaining three shear stress equations in Hooke’s law disappear, as the directions r, θ
and z correspond to the principal stress directions due to the symmetry of the sample and
the set-up. The equations are written with effective stresses to make them applicable both
to porous and non-porous materials.

The conﬁning pressure will generate an isotropic stress ﬁeld perpendicular to the sample
axis, as long as the sample can be considered isotropic and homogeneous. (Note that the
case of a hollow cylinder does not comply with these conditions. The material may be
isotropic and homogeneous, but the sample is not.) The radial and tangential stresses will
be equal, and so will the radial and tangential strains. If pc is the conﬁning pressure, we
must have

σr = σθ = pc

εr = εθ

(7.6)

(7.7)

There are thus only two independent stresses, the radial stress σr and the axial stress σz.

7.3.2. Drained and undrained test conditions

In drained tests the outlets through the pistons will be open, so that the pore ﬂuid pressure
can be kept at any prescribed value. Most often, the outlets are open to the atmosphere, so
that the pore ﬂuid pressure will be zero. In that case the effective stresses in the sample will
be equal to the total stresses. But sometimes it is of interest to run tests at actual reservoir
conditions. The pore pressure must then be kept at the reservoir pressure level.

In testing of low permeability materials, for instance like chalk, drained condition means
that the test must be run sufﬁciently slow, in order to avoid unacceptable pressure build-up
when the sample deforms.

In undrained tests the outlets are in principle closed, so that the pore ﬂuids contained
in the sample cannot escape. If the pore ﬂuid pressure is to be measured, there must of
course be hydraulic contact through one of the outlets, but the condition of no ﬂuid ﬂow
must be assured. Undrained conditions are commonly used when testing extremely low-
permeability rocks like shale (Section 7.3.7).

From a more formal point of view, drained conditions mean that the pore pressure in
the sample is an independent variable. In undrained conditions on the other hand, the pore
ﬂuid pressure will be a dependent variable.

7.3.3. Standard triaxial compression tests

Rocks at depth are exposed to an anisotropic stress ﬁeld. During drilling or petroleum
production, enhanced shear stresses occur near the borehole or the producing perforations
(see Chapter 4). The lowest effective principal stress component is zero at the borehole
or cavity wall if the wall is permeable, and slightly higher if e.g. a mudcake blocks the
ﬂuid transport across the boundary (and pw > pf). The unconﬁned compressive strength
C0 is the most important strength parameter in order to describe stability at the borehole
wall. At some distance from the wall, however, the minimum principal stress increases. In
order to evaluate borehole or cavity stability it is therefore of great value to know how the
mechanical properties and the strength characteristics depend on external load conditions.
The most commonly adopted experimental procedure for this purpose is the so-called
triaxial compression test. The axial stress σz and the radial conﬁning pressure σr are kept
equal and increased to a preset level, from which σz is increased further until failure has
occurred, keeping σr constant. Results from a triaxial failure test are shown in Fig. 7.6. By
performing a series of tests at different conﬁning pressures, it is possible to map the entire
failure envelope (Section 2.7). If the aim of the test programme is a borehole stability
or sand prediction analysis, then care should be taken that sufﬁcient data is collected at
low conﬁning pressures, representing the stress state near the borehole. The maximum
conﬁning pressure should correspond to the minimum principal effective stress far from the
borehole. For a producing reservoir, the value at maximum depletion should be selected.

The test can be run under drained or undrained conditions. Since both the elastic prop-
erties and the strength depend on the effective stress, drained tests provide a better experi-
mental control because the pore pressure is kept constant at a known value. With extremely
low-permeability shales (nanoDarcy range), however, undrained tests with pore pressure
measurement performed during the experiment may be advantageous, since undrained tests
require shorter stabilization times (see Section 7.3.7).

Fig. 7.6. Triaxial test—example of experimental result.

266

MECHANICAL PROPERTIES AND STRESS DATA FROM LABORATORY ANALYSIS

Beyond the brittle-ductile transition it may be very difﬁcult to deﬁne the failure point,
which may be visible only as a minor change in slope of the stress–strain curve. The post-
failure behaviour is important, since it tells us how much the remnant strength of the rock
is, i.e. how much load it can sustain after failure has occurred. It is therefore strongly
advised that triaxial tests are run with the load frame in displacement control mode.

Fig. 7.6 illustrates a typical response of a drained triaxial test, including the hydrostatic
loading phase. If we simplify the test response, assuming the stress–strain curves to be
linear up to failure, it is straightforward to interpret the elastic moduli from such a plot.
In the hydrostatic phase the stresses are equal (see also Section 7.3.1), so the bulk mod-
ulus of the framework, is given as Kfr = σ
= pc = 0. Young’s modulus is then given by the slope

z/εz, while Poisson’s
ratio is given by the ratio between the slopes of both the radial and the axial stress–strain
curves in the triaxial phase, i.e. νfr = −εr /εz.
The shear modulus can of course now be calculated directly from Young’s modulus and
Poisson’s ratio (Table 1.1). Alternatively we have Gfr = 1
It is important to realize that if the pore pressure is not kept constant during the test,
this interpretation requires that the Biot constant is known. In a general case one should
consider the full expression (Eqs. (1.136)–(1.142)) and then only eliminate parameters
which are kept constant during the test phase of interest.

Another simpliﬁcation we have made is that the elastic stress–strain response is linear.
As illustrated by Fig. 7.6 this is generally not the case, neither in the hydrostatic phase
nor in the triaxial phase. When presenting elastic moduli it is therefore essential to deﬁne
how the interpretation has been made. For the triaxial phase, the following alternatives are
commonly accepted (see Fig. 7.7):

Fig. 7.7. Illustration of different methods for calculating Young’s modulus from axial stress–strain curves.

LABORATORY TESTS FOR ROCK MECHANICAL PROPERTY DETERMINATION

267

• Initial modulus, given as the initial slope of the stress–strain curve.
• Secant modulus, measured up to a ﬁxed percentage of the peak stress.
• Tangent modulus, given at a speciﬁc percentage of the peak stress.
• Average modulus of a linear portion, given within a speciﬁc maximum and minimum
stress level.

Out of these, the tangent modulus at 50% of the peak stress value is probably the most
used method. However, if the curve is strongly nonlinear, complete information can only
be given if the entire curve is presented. Comparing moduli from different sources it is
thus essential to ensure that the same interpretation method has been used. As illustrated
by Fig. 7.7, the moduli can vary signiﬁcantly with the method used for interpretation.

Such an interpretation is based on several assumptions, where the assumption of an
elastic material has already been mentioned. Clearly, this assumption is violated, if the
stress–strain curve looks like Fig. 7.7. In such a case, the rock is either nonlinearly elas-
tic or elasto-plastic (or both). One should therefore refer to the measured quantities as
static moduli, and avoid the term “static elastic” moduli. To reduce the problem of non-
linearity and variation of the stress–strain slope, it is often recommended to perform
unloading-reloading cycles at different stress levels and interpret the elastic moduli from
the stress–strain response of these loading cycles. The stress levels should be chosen such
that the sample is well within the elastic range. This may result in a much more consistent
interpretation of the elastic moduli.

Another assumption is that the sample is completely isotropic and homogeneous. Given
perfect boundary conditions, this implies that the stress- and strain-ﬁeld is homogeneous
throughout the sample and throughout the test sequence. Observations of experiments have
shown that this is not always true. Barreling, buckling and shear-band formation are typical
examples of loss of homogeneity. This can occur signiﬁcantly below the peak point of a
load-displacement curve, and can for instance be identiﬁed by loss of uniformity of radial
strain measurements in different directions.

These phenomena have been the subject of extensive investigation using bifurcation
theory, both from an experimental and a more theoretical approach. Examples with appli-
cation to failure around boreholes are given by Santarelli and Guenot (1990) and Sulem
and Vardoulakis (1989).

7.3.5. Unconﬁned (uniaxial) compression tests
In an unconﬁned compression test, a sample is inserted into a load frame and the axial load
is increased with zero conﬁning pressure. This test is hence a simpliﬁcation of a standard
triaxial compression test. Monitoring the axial stress plus the axial and the radial deforma-
tions, one can under drained conditions measure (by deﬁnition—see Chapters 1 and 2):
• The unconﬁned compressive strength C0 (also termed the uniaxial compressive
strength, UCS) as the peak stress.
• Young’s modulus Efr (tangential modulus as the slope of the axial stress versus axial
strain curve).
• Poisson’s ratio νfr as the ratio between radial and axial strain.

268

MECHANICAL PROPERTIES AND STRESS DATA FROM LABORATORY ANALYSIS

Most rocks exhibit brittle failure in unconﬁned failure tests, so it is straightforward to
identify C0. For interpretation of Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio, see Section 7.3.4.
If the rock is anisotropic, Poisson’s ratio and Young’s modulus are not proper para-
meters to describe the mechanical behaviour. In Section 1.7, the elastic stiffness tensor
was deﬁned. Eqs. (1.219)–(1.220) illustrate that the value of the measured Poisson’s ratio
depends both on the direction of the applied load and the direction of lateral strain mea-
surement. Thus the orientation of the sample’s symmetry with respect to the directions of
applied and measured stress and strains needs to be speciﬁed.

Theoretically, the uniaxial compressive strength depends on the largest crack or ﬂaw
present in the sample. Thus, measurements of C0 are expected to be very sensitive to sam-
ple heterogeneity, and to cracks induced by coring and core treatment procedures. Large
experimental uncertainties may therefore be expected, especially in weak rocks. Since the
uniaxial compressive strength is a key parameter in many petroleum related rock mechan-
ics applications, it may be worthwhile considering other methods to obtain or estimate
the uniaxial compressive strength. One alternative may be to perform triaxial tests at low
conﬁning pressures, where some of the cracks not associated with the intrinsic rock be-
haviour are closed. Another alternative is a Constant Mean Stress (CMS) test, see also
Section 7.3.9.

In low-permeability rocks like shale, unconﬁned tests are normally not run, since this
test mode requires fully drained conditions which are too time-consuming and difﬁcult to
obtain in low-permeability rocks.

7.3.6. Hydrostatic tests

Hydrostatic measurements are performed mainly to determine the bulk modulus of the
rock (or the frame modulus) and of the solid grains. This test represents the ﬁrst phase of a
standard triaxial test. Normally, failure does not occur under hydrostatic loading, although
pore collapse in chalk and grain crushing in sandstone may induce failure at high stress
levels.

Hydrostatic tests can be performed under drained or undrained conditions. The dif-
ference between moduli measured in drained and undrained conditions was outlined in
Section 1.6. Let us repeat here the most important results for laboratory testing:

In a drained hydrostatic experiment, the slope of the stress vs. volumetric strain curve is

the bulk frame modulus (Kfr) of the rock (see Section 7.3.4).

In an undrained, hydrostatic experiment, the pore pressure will change during the test
and the slope of the stress–strain curve will be equal to the undrained bulk modulus Ku of
the rock, including the effect of the pore ﬂuid (Eq. (1.155)). The increase of pore pressure
during undrained loading in a poroelastic (Biot) medium is (see also Section 1.6.3):

pf = (C/Ku)σp

(7.10)

The constant C is given in Eq. (1.157). The ratio C/Ku is identical to Skempton’s
B-parameter (see Section 1.6.5). For ﬂuid and frame bulk moduli (Kf and Kfr) signif-
icantly smaller than the bulk modulus of the grain material (Ks), one ﬁnds C/Ku →
Kf/(φKfr + Kf). It is seen that for a stiff framework, or a situation where gas is present

LABORATORY TESTS FOR ROCK MECHANICAL PROPERTY DETERMINATION

269

in the pore ﬂuid (Kf → 0), the pore pressure development can be neglected. For a weak
frame, however, the pore pressure may be almost as high as the external stress. One ex-
ample of such behaviour is in soils. In shales, where pore ﬂuid saturation may be hard to
achieve, a measured pore pressure response during undrained loading is a useful indica-
tion that full saturation is actually reached. Note that in case that the rock also deforms
plastically, like in normally consolidated clays or shales (Section 2.8.2), the pore pres-
sure response may be larger than predicted by Eq. (7.10). To reduce the problem of
nonlinearity and variation of the stress–strain slope, it is often recommended to perform
unloading-reloading cycles at different stress levels and interpret the elastic moduli from
the stress–strain response of these loading cycles. The stress levels should be chosen such
that the sample is well within the elastic range. This may result in a much more consistent
interpretation of the elastic moduli.

In an “unjacketed” test, i.e. with the pore pressure equal to the conﬁning pressure, the
slope of the stress–strain curve gives the bulk modulus Ks of the solid particles (1/Ks
is often also termed “grain (or matrix) compressibility”) (Eqs. (1.148) and (1.151)). This
measurement can be performed on a core plug in direct contact with a ﬂuid bath. The
volume change of ﬂuid in the cell is measured as a function of pressure with and without
the core present, and the results are subtracted in order to obtain the grain compressibility.
Since the volume change is small, the results are very sensitive to changes in temperature
or other factors which may inﬂuence the measurement of ﬂuid compressibility.

7.3.7. Triaxial testing of shales

For testing of shales it has been recommended to perform so-called Consolidated-
Undrained (CU) tests (Steiger and Leung, 1992; Nakken et al., 1989; Horsrud et al., 1998).
The procedure is adopted from soil testing (e.g. Head, 1984). This test consists of three
distinct phases:

1. Loading to the predetermined level of conﬁning pressure and pore pressure.

2. Consolidation, maintaining a constant conﬁning pressure and allowing drainage of

the pore ﬂuid against a constant pore pressure.

3. Undrained axial loading under a constant axial displacement rate beyond failure of

the sample.

This test sequence is illustrated schematically in Fig. 7.8. The triaxial phase is performed
in undrained conditions to reduce the time required to complete a test. A fully drained test
of a low-permeability shale may require weeks or months to complete. In the CU-test, the
pore pressure must be monitored throughout the test.

The time required to run such a test depends mainly on the permeability of the shale.
Concepts from soil mechanics testing can be applied to assist in determining when con-
solidation is completed and also to determine the appropriate displacement rate in the
undrained part of the test (Head, 1984). For instance, allowing drainage at the end sur-
faces as well as the sides of the core will reduce testing time considerably. As shown in
Section 1.9 the consolidation response depends both on the permeability of the rock and

270

the elastic properties of the rock. It should thus be noted that in soil mechanics approaches,
the “weak frame” assumption is implicit.

The displacement rate in the undrained phase is chosen such that pore pressure gradients
within the sample are avoided. The total test time thus depends both on the permeability, the
elastic properties, the sample dimensions and the drainage conditions around the sample.
To reduce the test time as much as possible, both axial and radial drainage should be
implemented.

(cid:2)

The results can be plotted in a q–p

plot (see Section 2.7), which facilitates an interpre-

tation of whether the shale behaves as normally consolidated or overconsolidated.

Examples from testing of a Tertiary shale are shown in Fig. 7.9 (from Horsrud et al.,
1998). This shows three tests at different conﬁning pressures which fail macroscopically
by shear. The peak stress values fall on a straight line which can thus be represented by a
Mohr–Coulomb failure criterion.

7.3.8. Oedometer (Ko) test

Laboratory experiments are often performed with rock specimens in uniaxial compression,
i.e. in a situation with no lateral deformation. This type of test is thought to simulate e.g. the
compaction of a reservoir during depletion. For geotechnical applications, similar studies
of soils are routinely performed to evaluate e.g. the stability of foundations. In that case, the
soil can be placed inside a solid, undeformable cylinder and compressed vertically. With
rocks, it is recommended to use a triaxial cell and adjust the conﬁning pressure so that
zero or negligible radial deformation is recorded as the axial load is increased. The normal
way to apply the zero strain criterion is to use point measurements and diametrical strain
recordings in one plane as the control parameters. This requires a homogeneous specimen,
which is isotropic or transversely isotropic with the sample axis as the symmetry axis.
Theoretically, the stress–strain curve of an elastic, isotropic rock in an oedometer test
(drained) is given through Hooke’s law (Eqs. (1.93)–(1.95)), keeping εr = 0. Written with

The modulus dσz/dεz is called the oedometer modulus or uniaxial compaction modulus

(Hfr) (see also pages 21 and 394). In the elastic limit it is given by Eq. (7.11).
The oedometer test is most commonly used in geotechnical engineering. The test is
then performed by placing the sample (which normally has an L/D-ratio of ≈1/2) in a
steel ring. Drainage may be allowed both through top and bottom pistons, or alternatively,
through only one of the pistons. Load is applied incrementally, or in a continuous mode.
Axial stress and strain vs. time, plus pore pressure changes are the parameters measured
throughout these tests.

It has been observed that cyclic loading of sandstones produce moduli that are very dif-
ferent from the ﬁrst loading segment (see for instance Mess, 1978). In a study of synthetic
sandstones formed under stress (Holt et al., 2000), the modulus of the second and subse-
quent cycle was observed to be at least two times larger than the modulus of the ﬁrst cycle.
The initial modulus of the second cycle was found to be close to the initial modulus of
the expected behaviour of a virgin rock, i.e. a rock which had not been through the coring
process.

272

MECHANICAL PROPERTIES AND STRESS DATA FROM LABORATORY ANALYSIS

In addition to the modulus given by Eq. (7.11), the oedometer tests can also provide
information about the coefﬁcient of consolidation CD (see Section 1.9), if the test is run
incrementally. Further, when specimens are brought beyond the elastic limit, the oedome-
ter test provides a simple method of determining the preconsolidation stress. One way of
obtaining this, is to plot the oedometer modulus vs. effective vertical stress. A minimum in
the modulus then corresponds to the preconsolidation stress (Janbu, 1985). Other ways of
interpreting the preconsolidation stress from oedometer tests have also been proposed (see
e.g. Lambe and Whitman, 1979).

7.3.9. Stress path tests

By the use of a triaxial test cell, the tests may be predeﬁned to follow a speciﬁc stress path
other than those already discussed. This is mainly done for special purposes, e.g. to mimic
stress path conditions in a depleting reservoir, but can in principle follow a large variation
of stress paths. Two examples will be included in this section.

Constant stress ratio tests

Constant stress ratio tests are compression tests where the ratio between the conﬁning
pressure and the axial stress is kept constant. This constant ratio is mostly referred to as
capital K

(not to be confused with the bulk modulus), where K

is given by

(cid:2)

(cid:2)

(cid:2)

-ratio equal to 0 corresponds to a drained triaxial compression test, while a K

A K
equal to 1 represents a hydrostatic test.

The interest in this type of tests comes from the fact that stress measurements in com-
pacting reservoirs have revealed that the boundary condition of no lateral movement is not
always adequate. A stress path with constant stress ratio may give a better description.

Constant Mean Stress (CMS) tests

The CMS test has been proposed as an alternative to provide more reliable estimates of
the unconﬁned compressive strength (UCS) of rocks (Kenter et al., 1997). The principle
of the test is shown in Fig. 7.10. The rock sample is ﬁrst loaded hydrostatically to a stress
level which is close to 50% of the expected UCS. The sample is then loaded axially and
unloaded radially until the radial stress is zero. Then the sample is loaded in a uniaxial
stress mode until failure.

The idea behind this approach is that coring-induced microcracks are closed prior to
failure, and thus more reliable and less scattered values of UCS are expected. This method
requires that a rough estimate of the expected UCS can be made prior to testing. If failure

occurs before the radial stress is completely unloaded, the measured strength can be ex-
trapolated towards unconﬁned conditions, or another test at a lower initial stress level can
be run.
Note that the term “constant mean stress” is not entirely correct, since for a cylindrical
sample the mean stress is given as (σz + 2σr )/3, while here it is (σz + σr ) which is kept
constant. The use of this term has been justiﬁed by the fact that the average of the largest
and smallest principal stresses is kept constant.

7.3.10. Other triaxial failure tests

Extension tests

Triaxial tests can also be run in extension: after applying a hydrostatic conﬁning pressure
σr, just like in the standard compression tests, the axial load σz is decreased, keeping σr
constant. If failure does not occur until σz reaches zero, σr is increased. According to
the Mohr–Coulomb criterion the shear strength τc should be the same in extension and
compression. The Grifﬁth criterion, however, takes into account the intermediate stress.
The use of this criterion implies a certain difference in the measured strength values. It is
also commonly observed that rocks are stiffer during unloading than loading, so that the
elastic properties are also different between the two tests.

Multiple and continuous failure state triaxial tests

Determination of the failure envelope is a key task in the analysis of borehole stability and
sand prediction. Normally, there are strong limitations on the amount of material available
for rock mechanical tests. It may therefore be attractive to carry out tests where an entire
failure envelope can be measured with just one sample. There are two slightly different
methods for doing this; one is the multiple failure state test and the other the continuous
failure state test (Kovari et al., 1983). In the ﬁrst case (see Fig. 7.11), the test is started

274

as a normal triaxial test from a given initial conﬁning pressure. When failure is reached
(detected manually or automatically as a signiﬁcant change in the slope of the stress–strain
curve), the conﬁning pressure is increased to a higher level. Changes in acoustic velocities
(especially the radial velocity) measured during the test may also be used as an indicator
of failure (Holt and Fjær, 1991). Another alternative is to use the Acoustic Emission hit
rate as an indicator. The axial stress is then increased further until failure occurs, and in
this way the test continues at a multiple of conﬁning stress levels. This test turns out to
give quite reliable results with regards to failure stresses, at least in weak, brittle rocks like
sandstones (Holt and Fjær, 1991). Obviously, failure detection in ductile materials is more
complicated. In addition, in hard rocks, failure in one of the steps may weaken the material
considerably. Generally, the elastic moduli are inﬂuenced by damage caused in previous
load steps, so this test is not recommended for elastic properties evaluation.

The idea behind continuous failure state tests is similar to that of the multiple failure
state tests. In the continuous failure state test (Kovari et al., 1983), both the radial and the
axial stresses are increased in order to monitor the failure envelope continuously rather
than stepwise.

True triaxial tests

To evaluate further the role of the intermediate stress on the failure envelope, it is possi-
ble to perform tests in test machines that can supply a true triaxial (polyaxial) stress, i.e.
σ1 (cid:8)= σ2 (cid:8)= σ3. These systems normally include three mutually perpendicular pairs of
hydraulic jacks compressed against the faces of a cubically shaped sample. Other applica-
tions of polyaxial tests include testing of sand production, fracturing, perforating, injection
and screen integrity. A limitation for the use of such tests within petroleum related rock
mechanics is that the tests usually require larger specimens than can be obtained from ﬁeld
cores.

7.3.11. Hollow cylinder tests

Hollow cylinders can be used as scaled models to simulate the borehole situation in the
laboratory (see e.g. van den Hoek et al., 1992). Besides that, by changing the external
stresses and/or the internal (hole) pressure, a variety of load situations can be studied,
including a true triaxial stress state at the borehole wall. Thin-walled cylinders offer the
possibility of having an almost homogeneous stress state, but are difﬁcult to prepare.

The stress state at the borehole wall of an externally loaded hollow cylinder is (follows

from a calculation similar to that in Section 4.2):

Fz is the axial load and σro is the conﬁning pressure. σr = σro at the outer boundary
of the sample, while σz shows no radial variation. The ratio between the axial and radial
external load determines which of the stresses σzi or σθi is the maximum principal stress.
From Eqs. (7.14) and (7.15) we ﬁnd that σzi is larger than σθi if Fz > 2π σroR2
o and vice
versa. When σzi is the larger, and if the cylinder is thick-walled (R2
o), the failure
i
process will develop in much the same way as it does in a normal triaxial compression
test, i.e. as a shear fracture. When σθi is the larger, macroscopic fractures are expected to
develop along spiral surfaces parallel to the axis of the cylinder and to the direction of
the intermediate principal stress. By altering the ratio between σzi and σθi it is possible to
investigate the inﬂuence of the intermediate stress on the failure stress. In addition, it is of
interest to investigate the failure mode. In both cases, also the ratio Ro/Ri can be used to
tune the failure stress and the failure mode. A convenient choice may be Ro/Ri = 5, and the
same hydrostatic external pressure on the sample boundaries and on the loading pistons,
i.e. σz = σroR2
i ) = 25/24 σro. Failure will then be induced by the hoop stress
σθi on the borehole wall. According to Eq. (7.15), σθi = 25/12 σro, i.e. failure should occur
when the conﬁning pressure is 12/25 of the uniaxial rock strength. Experimental results,
however, tend to show that failure occurs at larger stresses than predicted. It should be
noticed, however, that it may be difﬁcult to determine the actual stress inducing borehole
failure from the external stress–strain curve. Measurements inside the borehole are thus
necessary. Such measurements include the use of cantilever systems with strain gauges
monitoring borehole deformation.

An alternative way of studying the stability of hollow cylinders is to apply a pressure in
the hole. For a permeable rock, a sleeve can be applied to simulate e.g. a mudcake. Bore-
hole collapse is studied by reducing the internal pressure, keeping the conﬁning pressure
constant. In principle, hydraulic fracture generation can be simulated by increasing the
borehole pressure.

The stability of cavities or perforation tunnels, especially in sandstone, can be studied by
terminating the hole a representative distance into the sample (e.g. Tronvoll et al. (1992)).
For simulation of the sand production potential, ﬂuid ﬂow should be included, and both
conﬁning pressure and ﬂowrate should be varied during a test.

7.3.12. Measurements on small samples

The need for intact core material in laboratory testing in many cases represents a serious
restriction. Either a core is simply not available, or the core may be in such a state that it
is impossible to drill sufﬁciently large test samples. This has motivated the use of smaller
samples (sub-cm) for testing. Especially if drill cuttings can be used, a new source of
information is available without any additional cost.

Again acoustic measurements are attractive, because of the close relation to the me-
chanical response of the rock. Alternative techniques are available, both a sonic pulse
technique (Santarelli et al., 1998) and a continuous wave technique (Nes et al., 1998a).
The sonic pulse technique is in principle similar to the transmission technique described
in Section 7.2.4. The continuous wave technique (CWT) is well known from solid state
physics and ﬂuid studies. This technique also requires a specimen with smooth and par-
allel end surfaces mounted between two acoustic transducers, one used for acoustic wave
generation and the other for detection. This technique relies on the establishment of ul-
trasonic standing wave resonances as the excitation frequency is swept over a frequency
range containing several resonance frequencies. A typical resonance spectrum is shown in
Fig. 7.12. Resonances will occur each time the sample length (thickness) equals an integer
number of half wavelengths. The acoustic phase velocity is then given as

v = 2lf

(7.17)

where f is the frequency difference between resonance peaks, l is the sample thickness
and v is the phase velocity (P or S). CWT is particularly suited for measurements on ﬁne-
grained material like shale, where samples of sub-mm thickness may be used.

When used on core material, such measurements may represent a valuable supplement
to more time-consuming and expensive tests, or an alternative when larger samples can not
be prepared. Efforts have also been made to simultaneously perform static measurements

LABORATORY TESTS FOR STRESS DETERMINATION

277

on such small samples (Nes et al., 1998b). However, questions related to sample size in
relation to material heterogeneities should be considered.

These techniques may also be used on drill cuttings, and as such they have a potential
for ﬁeld use. This is discussed further in Chapter 8. When drill cuttings are used, addi-
tional uncertainties are related to the quality and representativity of the cuttings, i.e. stress
unloading effects, drill bit effects, effects of the drilling ﬂuid etc.

7.4. Laboratory tests for stress determination

The stress release experienced by a rock sample during coring causes opening of microc-
racks by elastic as well as viscoelastic mechanisms. These cracks are thought to be oriented
with respect to the stress ﬁeld experienced in situ. It is normally assumed that most cracks
open such that the crack normals are parallel to the direction of maximum in situ stress,
which is also the direction of maximum stress release. After the period of crack opening,
the cracks remain open. The orientational distribution and the amount of cracks still contain
information about the orientation and the magnitudes of the previously experienced princi-
pal stress components. Clearly, inﬂuence may be expected from earlier loading-unloading
cycles experienced by the rock throughout geological history. It is not clear to what extent
the entire stress history inﬂuences the observations. It is however often assumed that the
most recent and the most rapid unloading will dominate the behaviour (de Waal and Smits,
1988).

If the crack pattern contains information about the in situ stress ﬁeld, then any technique
by which the orientational distribution of microcracks can be measured may provide stress
ﬁeld data.

This section discusses some methods which are based on core measurements. A require-
ment for such testing is of course that the core is oriented, i.e. the geographical orientation
of the core must be known (see Section 7.1.4). This is done by orienting the scribe on the
core by the Paleomagnetic orientation method. The described methods have mostly been
used for determination of horizontal stress directions. The measurements thus have to be
performed in the horizontal plane, either using a vertical core, or mounting the measure-
ment devices such that they are measuring in the true horizontal plane.

Attempts have also been made to estimate the stress magnitudes from these techniques,

but the general experience is that the uncertainty of the results can be considerable.

7.4.1. Differential strain curve analysis

One way of obtaining this orientational information is to measure the anisotropic deforma-
tion of the core upon hydrostatic reloading. In the general case this is done by machining
a cube from the core and attaching strain gauges. The instrumented (and cleaned/dried)
sample is subsequently cast in a compliable medium (e.g. silicone) to prevent conﬁning
ﬂuid from entering the sample during testing. The result is a series of stress–strain curves
for different directions. They will all exhibit initial nonlinearities related to crack closure.
Most strain will occur in the direction of maximum in situ stress.

278

MECHANICAL PROPERTIES AND STRESS DATA FROM LABORATORY ANALYSIS

Fig. 7.13. Geometry of measurement directions in an ASR experiment. Note that here we use ε1 and ε2 to
represent the two principal directions in the horizontal plane.

If one of the principal strain directions is known, four independent strain measurements
are required to determine the complete strain tensor. This will be the case if the vertical
stress is a principal stress and the core is vertical. In that case, one measurement is made in
the vertical direction and three in the transverse plane. In the general case, when a principal
stress direction can not be assumed to be known, it takes six independent measurements to
determine the complete strain tensor. Note that if one principal direction is assumed verti-
cal, only the three measurements in the horizontal plane are strictly required to determine
the directions of the principal horizontal stresses. The horizontal measurements are made
at 45° to each other, as illustrated in Fig. 7.13.

To see how the direction of principal stresses can be determined, we use Eq. (4.7)

εr = εx cos2 θ + εy sin2 θ + 2Γxy sin θ cos θ

(7.18)
Referring to Fig. 4.1, εx and εy are the strains in the x- and y-direction, and εr is the
radial strain in a direction with an angle θ relative to the x-axis. If we now assume that the
x- and y-directions are the principal strain directions, we have

εr = ε1 cos2 θ + ε2 sin2 θ

(7.19)
By measuring εr (θ ), εr (θ + 45) and εr (θ + 90) we have three equations with three
unknowns (ε1, ε2 and θ). This yields the following results:
εr (θ ) − εr (θ + 90)

By hypothesis, the total strain associated with crack closure is proportional to the in situ
stress. The constant of proportionality for stress magnitude estimates can be obtained from
the vertical strain measurement, assuming that the effective vertical stress is known from
e.g. the weight of the overburden, and the pore pressure.

LABORATORY TESTS FOR STRESS DETERMINATION

279

7.4.2. Anelastic strain recovery

This method is based on the anelastic behaviour (creep) occurring after unloading of a rock.
In addition to the instantaneous elastic strain that takes place when the stress is relieved,
an additional anelastic strain also develops over some time. For a core taken from an un-
derground formation, the period of time over which most of the anelastic strain develops is
typically 10–50 hours.

A core which is going to be used for ASR measurements should be instrumented as soon
as possible after retrieval, since most of the anelastic strain will develop during the ﬁrst few
hours. It should be noted that the process of bringing the core out of the well takes several
hours, so that the earliest possible start of the measurements is typically 3–5 hours after
drilling induced stress relief. Once the sample is instrumented, it is vital that it is kept in a
constant temperature and saturated humidity atmosphere during the test.

The principle for determination of principal strain (and stress) directions is the same as

that presented in Section 7.4.1.

Concerning the estimation of stress magnitudes, constitutive models which link the
strains to stresses have to be established. Several methods based on viscoelasticity have
been presented in the literature Blanton (1983), Warpinski and Teufel (1989) and a gen-
eral three-dimensional theory by Matsuki and Takeuchi (1993). For an overview of these
methods, see e.g. Amadei and Stephansson (1997).

There are, however, still questions which need to be resolved before reliable results
from the ASR-technique can be expected. A study by Yassir et al. (1998) showed that for
stress ratios up to 1.5,1 the corresponding strain ratios were very similar, but for stress ra-
tios above 2, the corresponding strain ratios showed more scatter. This study was done
under carefully controlled laboratory conditions, using a synthetic sandstone (see also
Section 7.1.2) which was formed under stress and isotropically unloaded. Under these
conditions one will avoid the damage effects experienced during coring and core retrieval.
Especially under conditions where the shear stress approaches the shear strength of the
rock, one should expect this to affect the measured relaxation strains.

7.4.3. Acoustic techniques

Differential wave velocity analysis

Since acoustic wave velocities and attenuations are extremely sensitive to cracks (see
Chapters 5 and 6), the cracks will also contribute to an acoustic anisotropy. This anisotropy
is preserved after the core has entered the laboratory, and measurements of it may
serve as additional information to evaluate in situ principal stress directions (and possi-
bly also magnitudes). Engelder and Plumb (1984) demonstrated this effect for a num-
ber of rocks sampled at shallow depths. Experiments with reservoir sandstones show
a clear minimum of sound velocity in a direction which corresponds to the in situ

1 The stress ratio is here deﬁned as the ratio between the largest and the smallest of the principal stresses.

280

MECHANICAL PROPERTIES AND STRESS DATA FROM LABORATORY ANALYSIS

vertical, i.e. the expected major principal stress direction (see e.g. Holt et al., 1989;
Teufel, 1989).

This technique (Differential Wave Velocity Analysis; DWVA) is still not fully developed,
and improvements may be expected: it is reasonable to expect a relation between crack
density and stress magnitude (Ren and Hudson, 1985), and it is reasonable to expect that
reloading the sample to its previous stress state will reduce the crack-induced anisotropy.
Care should however be taken before a directional velocity variation is interpreted as
anisotropy. The variation may also be caused by inhomogeneities, since the wave paths
will be slightly different. One way to check that anisotropy is really the source of vari-
ation is to measure S-wave velocities in the assumed principal symmetry directions with
different polarizations, so that velocities of waves travelling exactly the same path but with
different polarizations are measured. Any difference by these velocities can not be due to
heterogeneity, and must therefore be caused by anisotropy.

Acoustic emission

In 1950 Kaiser made the experimental observation that when loading a sample, the sample
would start to produce acoustic emissions (AE) when the load exceeded the maximum
stress level which the sample had experienced previously. This stress history or stress
memory effect has been the basis for numerous attempts to use this phenomenon for de-
termination of in situ stresses. Its application is, however, not straightforward. It has been
shown (Holcomb, 1993) that for triaxial stress states, the maximum stress in a principal
direction can not be retrieved by uniaxial loading in that direction. The onset of acoustic
emission in the loading direction is dependent also on the stress applied in the two other
orthogonal principal directions.

Acoustic emissions are transient elastic waves generated from localized and sudden
changes of the stresses in a sample. In a porous material like a rock, such sudden changes
of local stresses can be the result of growth of microcracks and/or collapse of pores or
grains. This is the basis for the concept of the damage surface of materials, analogous to
a yield surface in the theory of plasticity. A damage surface thus deﬁnes the limit in stress
space where acoustic emissions are generated when passed (Holcomb, 1993). More recent
work has focused on using this damage surface concept as the basis for studying stress
memory effects.

It has been suggested that the rock will remember the critical stress state during coring
and that the in situ horizontal stress state can be determined by mapping the 3D damage
surface of a core (Kenter et al., 1998). This concept has been demonstrated experimentally
on outcrop and ﬁeld sandstone cores, and it has been supported by analytical and discrete
particle modelling (Pestman et al., 2002).

7.5. Index tests

There is a number of test methods that can be applied to rocks without applying a conﬁning
pressure system. This includes measurements of index properties which can be related in

INDEX TESTS

281

some way to strength or elastic parameters. We shall describe tests which may give infor-
mation about the tensile strength (Point load strength and Brazilian test) and a hardness
test which has been found to give results that correlate with compressive strength. More
recent test methods for correlation with rock mechanical properties based on indentation
and scratching will be presented, and ﬁnally, some tests which may be particularly useful
for studies of shales will be discussed.

Most of the tests discussed below are described in more detail in Brown (Ed.) (1981).

7.5.1. Tensile strength indicators

Direct tensile strength measurements. By gluing both ends of a cylindrical rock specimen
to metal front plates which are ﬁxed to the platens of the load frame, direct measurements
of tensile strength can be obtained. The cement, of course, has to be more resistant to
tensile stress than the specimen itself.

Point load strength. The point load strength index Is is measured using spherically-
truncated, conical platens of a standard geometry (cone angle: 60° and radius of curvature:
5 mm at the tip) (see Fig. 7.14a). The specimen may be in the form of a core (axial/radial),
a cut block or an irregular lump. Hence, no special sample preparation is required. The
index Is is obtained as

Is = Fc
D2
e

(7.23)

where Fc is the load necessary to cause failure. De is “equivalent core diameter”, equal
1
to the thickness in a diametrical test or (4A/π )
2 in the case of axial, block or lump tests.
A is the minimum cross-sectional area of a plane through the platen contact points. Size
corrections can be obtained by multiplying on the right hand side of Eq. (7.23) with a factor
(De/50)0.45 (De is measured in mm).

Fig. 7.14. Simple sketches showing apparatus for a) point load strength test, and b) Brazilian test.

282

MECHANICAL PROPERTIES AND STRESS DATA FROM LABORATORY ANALYSIS

The point load strength index may be used as an indirect measurement of the uniaxial

tensile strength T0:

Is = 0.80T0

(7.24)

The Brazilian test. This test is performed by applying a load with two platens diametri-
cally compressed on a rock cylinder, which is normally shorter than or equal in thickness
(L) to its diameter (D) (see Fig. 7.14b). Failure occurs by an extension fracture in or close
to the loaded diametrical plane.

A plane stress elastic analysis shows that the stresses close to the centre of the sample

are (Jaeger and Cook, 1979)

σh = − 2F
σv = 6F

π DL

π DL

(7.25)

(7.26)

The compressional stress is thus always about three times larger than the tensile stress,
and since the ratio between the compressive strength and the tensile strength is normally
larger than three, the sample will always fail in tension. The tensile strength (in MPa) is
thus given by Eq. (7.25)

T0 = 0.636

Fc
DL

(7.27)

The peak load Fc is given in N and D and L must be given in mm. The Brazilian test
tends to give results which are more reproducible than those obtained by point load strength
measurements.

7.5.2. Hardness measurements

Brinell hardness. The Brinell hardness number NBr follows from the ratio of applied load
F on a spherical indenter to the indentation depth D:
≈ F
π r2
s

NBr = F
2π rD

(7.28)

r is the radius of the sphere and rs is the radius of the indentation surface area. The test
is hence non-destructive. For metals and glasses there is a theoretical relationship between
NBr, the yield stress σyield and Young’s modulus E:

(cid:4)

(cid:5)

NBr =

a + b ln

E

σyield

σyield

(7.29)

a and b are constants, so that if the yield strength increases in proportion with E, then NBr
will be a measure of σyield.

van der Vlis (1970) and later Geertsma (1985) studied the correlation between NBr,
dynamic elastic moduli and the compressive strength of rocks, and for sandstones in par-
ticular. Geertsma found a linear relationship between the Brinell hardness and the dynamic

INDEX TESTS

Young’s modulus for well consolidated sandstones:
Edyn = 77.25NBr

283

(7.30)

He also presented the approximate result that the Brinell hardness equals the yield strength:

NBr ≈ σyield

(7.31)

Other hardness tests. There is a number of other tests whereby material hardness can be
quantiﬁed. They have in common that they are either indentation tests (like the Brinell hard-
ness) or rebound hardness tests (like the Schmidt hammer, for further details, see (Brown
(Ed.), 1981)).

7.5.3. Indentation and scratch tests

Indentation tests. The potential access to more information about rock mechanical prop-
erties from drill cuttings has motivated work to perform indentation tests on cuttings-size
samples (Santarelli et al., 1998; Ringstad et al., 1998). These techniques are based on
casting the samples in rapidly curing material (polyester, resin) which can act as a sample
holder and also facilitate grinding and polishing of the sample surface. In these tests the en-
tire load-displacement curve is normally recorded, and the slope of the linear regime is used
to correlate with rock mechanical properties such as the uniaxial compressive strength.

Again, uncertainties related to sample size, material heterogeneity, ﬂuid effects etc. need

to be considered.

Scratch test. Another technique for determination of mechanical properties is the Scratch
Test (Richard et al., 1998; Schei et al., 2000). The principle of this test method is to scratch
the rock surface with a cutter while monitoring the applied force. The cutting depth is
typically less than 1 mm. Testing of sandstone and carbonates was found to support a
simple force cutting model in the ductile mode

Ft = EA

(7.32)

where Ft is the horizontal component of the cutting force averaged over a few cm of scratch
length, E is the intrinsic speciﬁc energy and A is the cross-sectional area of the cut.

A strong correlation between speciﬁc energy and the uniaxial compressive strength is
well established for several rock types. The possibility to derive information about rock
stiffness from scratch measurements has also been demonstrated (Schei et al., 2000). An
obvious advantage with this method is the potential of continuous measurements along a
core surface, providing continuous, high resolution data at low cost (Suarez-Rivera et al.,
2002).

7.5.4. Speciﬁc shale characterization tests

Some rocks, in particular shales or other clay rich materials, are sensitive to water. It is
thus essential that characteristic parameters that can be related to the water sensitivity are

284

MECHANICAL PROPERTIES AND STRESS DATA FROM LABORATORY ANALYSIS

measured. Such parameters include the water content, the cation exchange capacity (CEC),
speciﬁc surface area and the mineralogy.

Water content is measured by weighing a sample before and after heat drying. The heat-
ing temperature should be kept lower than 105 °C to ensure that only free water is released.
Above this temperature, crystalline water will start to be removed.

CEC can be obtained from several different methods, and since the different methods
can yield quite different results, one should take care when comparing CEC-values from
different sources. A fairly rough and much used method is the so-called methylene blue test
(see API, 1968), where a given amount of rock material is transformed into a slurry with
de-ionized, distilled water. Strong sulphuric acid is then added to exchange all available
cations in the interlayers of clay minerals with H
ions. After this, the slurry is diluted, and
a solution of methylene blue (C16H18N3SCl·3H2O) is added gradually. H
+
ions are then
+
exchanged with NH
4 , and the CEC is obtained from the amount of methylene blue required
to form a blue corona when a suspended drop of the slurry is placed on a ﬁlter paper.

+

Speciﬁc surface area is obtained by adsorption of gas or liquid molecules of known size

onto a surface of a known mass of the rock material (Gregg and Sing, 1967).

Speciﬁc surface area has also been used to correlate between wellsite measurements of
the dielectric constant and the presence of hydratable clays (Leung and Steiger, 1992).
A test kit for the dielectric constant measurement technique was developed, using a small
sample of cuttings.

The mineralogy of a rock may be determined from X-ray diffraction. Since the ﬁnal
numbers result from interpretation of diffractograms, this is not a completely objective
method. Again, comparison of results from different sources should be done with great
care. Note also that only crystalline minerals will appear on the diffractogram. X-ray amor-
phous minerals (e.g. certain opal minerals) will not be detected.

Measuring the activity (the relative humidity) of a shale sample is also frequently used
as an indicator of whether the sample is well preserved and saturated or not. These
measurements are commonly performed under atmospheric conditions. However, under
atmospheric conditions the curved interface between the pore water and the air will im-
mediately reduce the measured activity below the true value (e.g. Carminati et al., 1997).
The amount of this reduction depends on e.g. the pore size distribution of the shale. The
smaller the pores, the greater the error.

As already discussed, it is important that care is taken in sampling, preservation and
handling of water sensitive rocks like shale. This is particularly important when studying
the response of these rocks to ﬂuid contact. Tests to measure swelling and disintegration are
commonly used by the drilling mud industry for screening of mud types and mud additives.
It is critical that laboratory artifacts are avoided (e.g. due to capillary effects), as they may
completely dominate the results (see also Section 7.1.4).

Mechanical properties and insitustresses from ﬁeld data

Knowledge of the mechanical properties and the in situ stresses of the subsurface for-
mations is essential in connection with wellbore stability problems, fracturing operations,
subsidence problems and sand production evaluation.

In this chapter we will look at methods for estimating mechanical properties and in
situ stresses from ﬁeld tests and ﬁeld data. The methods can be grouped into three main
categories: measurements while drilling, wireline logging methods and well tests.

We start by recalling the mechanical parameters and in situ stresses of a formation:

Elastic parameters. For an isotropic medium, there are two independent elastic moduli.
However, these two parameters have a real and an imaginary part, that both will vary
with frequency and with stress level, such that even in the isotropic case the use of two
parameters is clearly a simpliﬁcation.

Strength parameters. We have seen that the strength of a material is dependent on the
stress level, and that failure criteria that describe actual data normally have at least 2–3
adjustable parameters.

In situ stresses. The in situ stresses are given by the three principal stresses and three
parameters giving the orientation of the principal stresses. The stress level determines
whether a rock is critically loaded or not. Additionally, the in situ stresses inﬂuence both
the elastic parameters and the strength parameters.

8.1. Estimation of elastic parameters

The most important method for estimation of elastic parameters is acoustic logging, and in
particular acoustic wireline logs. Acoustic logging while drilling is now also available, but
is still less used.

Acoustic logging tools measure acoustic wave velocities which together with density in-
formation and the appropriate formulae discussed in Chapter 5 provide the dynamic elastic
parameters (Eqs. (5.20)–(5.24)). We repeat here the equations for dynamic Young’s modu-
lus (Edyn) and dynamic Poisson’s ratio (νdyn):

(8.2)

Once the dynamic moduli are known, the problem is to relate them to the static parame-
ters, which is what is needed for most applications. This problem is a difﬁcult one that has
not been fully resolved.

290

MECHANICAL PROPERTIES AND IN SITU STRESSES FROM FIELD DATA

The difference between the static Young’s modulus and the dynamic Young’s modulus
may be quite signiﬁcant, in particular at low stress levels. The dynamic modulus may be
several times larger than the static modulus e.g. in a weak sandstone. The static–dynamic
transition is complicated by the fact that it is not a constant shift, but varies independently
with loading (Fjær, 1999). The main contribution to the difference is the strain amplitude,
which is low in dynamic measurements and large in static measurements. In a porous rock
both pore ﬂuid and cracks can give further contribution to this difference. Empirically
based static–dynamic transition methods are thus of limited validity, and there is still also
a lack of theoretically based methods.

One step in the direction of a more fundamental approach was presented by Fjær (1999).
This approach was developed primarily for weak sandstone, utilizing a large number of
carefully designed laboratory tests (mostly on North Sea cores) with simultaneous static
and dynamic measurements. Further description of this quantitative model was given in
Section 5.6.

The rest of this section will be devoted to various types of acoustic measurements, pri-
marily from downhole measurements, but also from rig measurements. The principles of
acoustic wave propagation around boreholes were described in Section 5.8.

Indirect information which may be useful for evaluation of mechanical parameters can
be obtained from other logging tools, e.g. the gamma, density and neutron logs. These tools
can be used to obtain lithological information.

8.1.1. Acoustic wireline logs

The primary output from acoustic logging tools is the velocities and waveforms of different
waves, such as the compressional-, shear- and Stoneley waves. Note that acoustic logging
tools may be used to generate information about a number of other characteristics of the
formation, such as lithology identiﬁcation, porosity estimates, gas detection, detection of
natural fractures, qualitative evaluation of permeability variations and creation of synthetic
seismograms for comparison with surface seismics.

Full waveform sonic tools

A principle sketch of a full waveform sonic tool is shown in Fig. 8.1. This consists of an
omnidirectional transmitter separated from an array of receivers.

The transmitter creates a pressure pulse in the borehole ﬂuid. This pressure pulse gen-
erates compressional and shear waves in the formation, in addition to borehole waves like
the Stoneley wave. These tools will thus ideally provide compressional and shear velocities
of the formation in addition to the Stoneley wave velocity. However, in slow formations
(poorly consolidated) the shear wave velocity is slower than the ﬂuid waves in the borehole.
Consequently, the shear velocity can not be measured directly.

From a mechanical properties point of view, one is most interested in the shear velocity
in slow formations, since low wave velocities indicate low strength and hence potential

(3 m), while the distance between each receiver is typically 0.5–1 ft (0.15–0.3 m).

stability problems. Direct measurement of both compressional and shear velocities also in
slow formations is possible using dipole or multipole tools.

Typical centre frequency of the transmitter used in full waveform sonic tools is 15 kHz.
However, to strongly excite the Stoneley mode, the source spectrum should include fre-
quencies below 5 kHz. This can be obtained by increasing the bandwidth of the source and
also by varying the excitation frequency of the source, depending on which waveform is
requested.

Multipole sonic tools

The basic concept of this tool is the dipole source transducer. A dipole transducer can in
principle be pictured as two closely spaced monopole transducers driven with opposite
phases. This piston-like effect creates an increase in pressure on one side of the borehole
and a decrease in pressure on the other side of the borehole. This force oriented normal to
the borehole wall induces a ﬂexural motion of the borehole (see Fig. 5.20).

The dipole source operates at low frequencies, typically with a centre frequency of 1–
1.5 kHz. At low frequencies the ﬂexural mode is very little affected by the borehole and
travels at the same speed as the shear wave. Dipole tools can thus provide a direct measure-
ment of the shear velocity even in slow formations. At higher frequencies, the propagation
velocity becomes smaller.

Dipole capabilities are often integrated in monopole tools, with the dipole transmitter
close to the monopole source, see Fig. 8.1. By including two dipole transducers oriented
perpendicular to each other and two receivers at each receiver station, both in-line and
cross-line measurements can be performed. Cross-dipole measurements hence facilitate an
evaluation of different types of anisotropy. It is a well known observation that the acoustic
velocity is faster along the rock bedding than normal to the bedding. This has commonly

292

MECHANICAL PROPERTIES AND IN SITU STRESSES FROM FIELD DATA

been observed when comparing P-wave velocities measured in vertical holes with mea-
surements in highly deviated or horizontal holes in the same formation.

Schlumberger’s Sonic Scanner tool is a combination of 3 monopole and 2 orthogonally
oriented dipole sources, and more than a hundred receivers. The dipole sources may sweep
through a frequency band from 300 Hz to 8 kHz. The tool enables a fairly detailed charac-
terization of the elastic wave velocities in the vicinity of the borehole, as it is sensitive to
axial and azimuthal as well as radial variations.

8.1.2. Acoustic logging while drilling

In recent years, tools for acoustic logging while drilling have also become available. The
tool conﬁguration is similar to that shown in Fig. 8.1, with a transmitter separated a few
feet (typically 4–7 ft) from an array of receivers. The full waveforms are normally recorded
in a downhole memory for later evaluation, but transit times can be transmitted uphole for
real time use: lithology evaluation, porosity determination, pore pressure estimation and
correlation of drill bit position to seismic maps.

Real time access to good estimates of mechanical properties of the rock is obviously use-
ful also for borehole stability evaluation while drilling. By logging while and after drilling
one could possibly monitor changes in the rock response during the openhole period. This
may give an early warning of possible deterioration of rock integrity with time which
eventually results in borehole stability problems. Consistent differences between acoustic
velocities recorded while drilling and from wireline logging have been observed in shales
(e.g. Boonen et al., 1998). However, time-lapse studies investigating this for borehole sta-
bility evaluation have yet not been published.

8.1.3. Acoustic measurements on drill cuttings

Acoustic measurements on drill cuttings may represent a valuable source of information
which can supplement the logging techniques. Alternative techniques are available, both a
sonic pulse technique (Santarelli et al., 1998) and a continuous wave technique (Nes et al.,
1998). For further description, see also Section 7.3.12.

Drill cuttings represent a large source of information which is available without any ad-
ditional cost. If used on the rig, information will be available close to real time. There are,
however, a number of limitations with these techniques, related primarily to the quality
and representativity of the cuttings. How has stress unloading effects, drill bit effects and
effects of the drilling ﬂuid etc. changed the response compared to that of the virgin for-
mation? Other uncertainties relate to possible length scale effects (typically mm-size for
cuttings while typically 30 cm for an acoustic log) and the accuracy in depth determination
of cuttings origin. A bias in sample selection may also be introduced, promoting measure-
ments on the more competent samples in the high-velocity range. The difference in test
conditions (atmospheric for cuttings measurements compared to downhole conditions for
logging tools) may also affect the result.

ESTIMATION OF STRENGTH PARAMETERS

293

Despite all these possible uncertainties, reasonable agreement between logged values
and values derived from cuttings measurements have been reported (Santarelli et al., 1998;
Nes et al., 1998), especially with respect to depth trends. Cuttings measurements thus
represent a promising but not yet fully explored alternative and/or supplement to other
measurements.

8.2. Estimation of strength parameters

There are no direct methods available for determination of the strength parameters in situ.
Hence most of the efforts made to predict strength parameters have been based on empirical
correlations, especially relations between acoustic velocities and strength parameters. This
section will discuss both this and other relations which are being used for estimation of
strength parameters.

8.2.1. Log data (wireline and MWD)

Log data are attractive for prediction of rock mechanical properties since logging is one of
the few downhole measurements available. As presented already, there is a direct relation
between acoustic velocities and dynamic elastic properties. However, rock strength data
can not be inferred directly from logs. The traditional approach has therefore been more or
less empirical, using both log derived acoustic velocities (especially the shear velocity) and
log derived porosity. An obvious disadvantage with such an approach is the need for fre-
quent calibration and checking of the validity of the empirical correlations when entering
a new ﬁeld or area.

The model which was brieﬂy discussed in Section 8.1 (Fjær, 1999) can also be used for
strength prediction (Raaen et al., 1996). This model also uses log data (acoustic velocities
and density), and was developed primarily for prediction of weak sandstone strength. The
fact that this model has a more theoretical basis makes it more robust, and it can thus
be applied in new wells without extensive calibration. This therefore represents a step in
the right direction. However, there is still no universally valid method available which
can predict the strength of different lithologies directly from logs, without any need of
calibration.

The methods for predicting rock strength offered by the service companies are all subject
to the limitations discussed above, being more or less empirical and requiring more or less
calibration.

8.2.2. Drill cuttings measurements

Different types of measurements on drill cuttings have been discussed previously, both
acoustic measurements (Section 7.3.12 and Section 8.1.3) and indentation measurements
(Section 7.5.3). To obtain strength values, correlations have to be established (Santarelli
et al., 1998; Ringstad et al., 1998). Given the previously discussed uncertainties of using

294

MECHANICAL PROPERTIES AND IN SITU STRESSES FROM FIELD DATA

drill cuttings (Section 8.1.3), these methods must at present be considered quite coarse.
However, they should be able to provide at least comparative evaluations, i.e. a “weak”
versus “strong” type of classiﬁcation.

8.2.3. Empirical correlations

The lack of direct downhole strength measurements or other generally applicable theories
for relating rock strength to measurable quantities has motivated considerable efforts to
generate empirical correlations for rock strength prediction. Most of this has been based
on log-measured or log-derived properties, such as acoustic velocities or porosities. Some
examples of such work is Edlman et al. (1998), Farquhar et al. (1994), Mason (1987), Onyia
(1988). Empirical correlations have been generated very much dependent on the need or
the application. Production related problems deal with weak sandstones while stability
problems related to drilling deal with weak shales.

There are some general comments which should be made regarding empirical correla-
tions:
• The correlations are normally based on one speciﬁc type of rock or lithology. A cor-
relation developed in sandstone may not be valid in shale, i.e. empirically based
correlations are not universally applicable.
• Rock strength measurements may be very scarce for some lithologies, such as shales,
because shales are normally not cored and tested. Shale-speciﬁc correlations are
scarce (for exceptions, see Lashkaripour and Dusseault, 1993 and Horsrud, 2001).
• Lack of actual core material has promoted use of outcrop material which may not be
relevant for downhole sedimentary rocks (differences in sedimentation history, stress
history, stress environment, diagenesis etc.).
• Laboratory test procedures or data interpretation procedures may vary, yielding results
which are not fully compatible.
• Even if the correlation is based on real core material from one area, it may not be
applicable to other geographical areas. It is always recommended to check the validity
of correlations when entering new areas and calibrate them if necessary.
• The published correlations are generally biased towards fairly competent rocks, thus
reducing their accuracy with respect to weak rocks which is the primary concern in
all types of stability evaluations.

For these reasons, no speciﬁc correlations will be presented here. These comments
should also be kept in mind when considering or using empirical correlations for strength
prediction.

In general one will ﬁnd that the rock strength increases when the rock is densiﬁed and
cemented, i.e. as depth, age and effective stresses increase. This is further reﬂected in
normal trends of reduced porosity and increased acoustic velocity.

Further discussion of mechanical properties of sedimentary rocks (sandstone, chalk and

shale) is given in Section 3.4, including some examples of empirical correlations.

8.2.4. Drilling data

Intuitively, the response of the drill bit should reﬂect also the mechanical properties of
the rock, under true downhole conditions. Bit response is, however, also dependent on a
number of other parameters. Traditionally, the motivation for rock-bit interaction models
has been to improve bit selection and bit operation procedures. The process of cuttings
generation and cuttings removal is fairly complicated, and most ROP (rate of penetration)
models are therefore empirical or semi-empirical. Although ROP models are available for
several bit types, most of the modelling efforts have been directed towards roller cone bits.
A representative version of an ROP model is (Warren, 1987):
+ cDρμ
Fm

aS2D3
nW 2

(cid:5)−1

+ b

N D

(cid:4)

R =

(8.3)

where R is the rate of penetration, W is weight on bit, N is bit rotary speed, S is rock
strength, D is bit diameter, Fm is modiﬁed jet impact force, ρ is mud density, μ is plastic
viscosity and a, b, c are dimensionless constants.

Additional effects related to bit wear and chip hold down may also be included (e.g.

Hareland and Hoberock, 1993).

Thus one can also solve Eq. (8.3) for the rock strength when the rate of penetration and

the other parameters and functions are known (Hareland et al., 1996).

Determination of all the input parameters and model constants may not be trivial, and
calibration against results from tests under controlled conditions or against previous bit
runs in the same area may be required. Considerable uncertainty in quantitative predictions
should therefore be expected. It is also obvious that such models are not easy to use in a
predictive manner.

It is quite obvious that the drilling process is a response to the properties of the rock
and its state of stress. Information about the rock mechanical properties should therefore
be retrievable from drilling data, but continued efforts to understand and model the drilling
process are required. Combining all measurements while drilling, both drilling data and
log data, may eventually provide a real-time tool for follow-up of the drilling process. This
will be applicable both to borehole stability and drilling efﬁciency, and eventually the two
aspects may be combined into a fully integrated drilling optimization model.

8.3. Estimation of insitustresses

This section will present available methods for estimating in situ stresses from ﬁeld data.
Methods based on core measurements were discussed in Chapter 7 and will not be repeated
here. This section will thus focus on data from well logs and well tests. For a more detailed
description of all available stress measurement methods, see e.g. Amadei and Stephansson
(1997) and Haimson and Cornet (2003). Note that not all these methods are suitable for
petroleum applications.

The presentation given here is based on the common assumption of a vertical-horizontal
stress ﬁeld, i.e. one principal stress is vertical and the two others are horizontal. This is

296

MECHANICAL PROPERTIES AND IN SITU STRESSES FROM FIELD DATA

valid in tectonically inactive areas or areas which have been relaxed from previous tec-
tonic activity. In active areas this assumption may not be valid, and the stress ﬁeld can be
signiﬁcantly distorted. See also Chapter 3.

8.3.1. The density log (overburden stress)

The density tools are active gamma ray tools that use the Compton scattering of gamma
rays to measure the electron density of the formation. By appropriate lithology corrections,
the electron density is converted to mass density with reasonable accuracy.

The density is useful for determining mechanical properties in two manners: ﬁrst, the
density is needed to convert from acoustic velocities to dynamic elastic moduli (see Sec-
tion 8.1). Second, the density integrated over the vertical depth of the well is usually
considered to give a good estimate of the vertical stress, at least in areas of low tectonic
activity. In such areas, the vertical stress is also considered to be a principal stress. When
the density log is available, the problem of determining the full in situ stress ﬁeld is then
reduced to determining the magnitude and orientation of the horizontal stresses.

However, the density log is rarely available in the ﬁrst few hundred metres of a well.
Then it is necessary to make estimates of the density to obtain the total vertical stress. In
areas which have not been subjected to tectonic activity it is common to assume a density in
the range 1.8–2.0 g/cm3. This bulk density corresponds to a porosity in the range 50–38%
in a rock with a mineral density of 2.6 g/cm3.

Offshore Mid-Norway, bulk densities above 2 g/cm3 have been logged at very shallow
depths. One plausible explanation to this unusually high density is that this area has also
been exposed to ice loads. Thus the geological history should be taken into consideration
when making estimates in non-logged intervals. Geotechnical data from site surveys may
in some cases be available and provide additional information.

8.3.2. Borehole logs (horizontal stress directions)

Determination of horizontal stress directions is based on the possibility of failure at the
borehole wall which can be detected by borehole logging tools. To be detectable, the fail-
ures must occur in the period after drilling and prior to logging. In a vertical borehole
which penetrates layers of signiﬁcantly different horizontal stresses (σH > σh), two dis-
tinct failure modes can be detected: compressive and tensile failure. The directions of these
two failure modes in an idealized situation are uniquely given by the directions of the two
principal horizontal stresses, as illustrated in Fig. 8.2. Compressive failure or shear failure
will be induced in the direction parallel with the smallest horizontal stress (σh) if the well
pressure is low enough to induce shear failure. This is commonly referred to as breakouts
in this context and will lead to an ovalization of the borehole. Tensile failure will occur
in the direction parallel with the largest horizontal stress (σH) if the well pressure is large
enough to induce fracturing. See also Chapter 4 for further discussion of stresses around
boreholes.

ESTIMATION OF IN SITU STRESSES

297

Fig. 8.2. Illustration of directions for compressive and tensile failure around a vertical borehole. Since tensile
failure occurs at high well pressures and compressive failure at low pressures, these failure modes are not normally
observed at the same depth. A possible exception is if there has been large variations in the well pressure.

Note that in situations with large variations in equivalent circulating density (ECD) of

the drilling ﬂuid it may be possible to observe both failure modes at the same depth.

Once a failure has occurred on the borehole wall, it is tempting to try to back-calculate
also stress magnitudes, especially the magnitude of the largest horizontal stress by using
elastic theory and appropriate failure criteria. However, a number of assumptions are re-
quired for such analyses, rendering the results uncertain. Such estimates can at best be
considered upper or lower bounds on the stress magnitudes (see also Section 8.3.4). The
large amount of information that can be acquired by new tools, such as the Sonic Scan-
ner (see Section 8.1.1) may eventually reduce some of the uncertainty, and allow for more
reliable estimation of the in situ stresses.

Caliper logs

The caliper log (four-arm) has commonly been used to estimate horizontal stress directions
from breakout orientations. This tool provides two diameters of the borehole cross-section.
To be able to identify stress induced borehole breakouts, a set of identiﬁcation criteria has
to be implemented. We quote here the criteria published by Plumb and Hickman (1985):

1. The tool is rotating above and below a borehole breakout.

2. The rotation stops over the breakout zone.

3. The borehole elongation is clearly seen in the log. One pair of pads must show a

relatively sharp ascent and descent of the borehole diameter.

4. The smaller of the caliper readings is close to bit size, or if the smaller caliper reading

is greater than bit size it should exhibit less variation than the larger caliper.

5. The direction of elongation should not consistently coincide with the high side of the

borehole when the hole deviates from vertical.

The last item in this list reﬂects the problem of differentiating between breakouts and
keyseats.1 This is a major problem, since it is not possible to distinguish between break-
outs and keyseats when using four-arm caliper data. Generally, elongations are regarded
as keyseats if their direction is within ±10°–15° of the hole azimuth. However, this can
categorize a large portion of the elongations as keyseats, even at deviations less than 6°
(Fejerskov and Bratli, 1998). This implies that either a large portion of the data points are
wrongly rejected, or much of the previous work on breakout analysis has to be rejected.

This problem with the caliper log is somewhat reduced as six-arm tools are becoming
industry standard. However, the best results are obtained with tools which can provide a
more complete image of the borehole.

Image logs

Image logs include both electrical (resistivity) and acoustical borehole imaging logs. The
electrical image log operates with a large number of electrodes in contact with the forma-
tion, usually distributed over several pads on independent arms (four or six). This shallow
electrical investigation is well suited for investigation of ﬁne structures like bedding planes,
natural fractures and also drilling induced fractures.

The acoustical imaging tool (often referred to as borehole televiewer, BHTV) is based on
reﬂection of acoustic waves from the borehole wall, recording the travel time and amplitude
of the reﬂected pulses. The pulses are generated by a rapidly rotating piezo-electric crystal,
thus creating a helix-shape logging path with a short distance between each revolution. This
tool is best suited for detection of borehole breakouts, as drilling induced fractures do not
create signiﬁcant changes in borehole radius or reﬂectivity.

Since these tools provide a full image of the borehole wall, it is possible to distinguish
between stress induced breakouts and keyseats. An example of an electrical borehole image
log is shown in Fig. 8.3. Examples of the use of image logs for determination of horizontal
stress directions and magnitudes is given by Brudy (1998).

If drilling induced fractures are found at an inclination with respect to the borehole axis,
this implies that none of the principal stresses are parallel with the borehole axis. This can
be the situation in an inclined borehole, or in a vertical borehole where the vertical stress
is not a principal stress, as for instance close to faults (Brudy et al., 1997).

8.3.3. Fracture tests (horizontal stress magnitudes)

The only fully reliable method for determination of the smallest horizontal stress (σh) is to
fracture the formation and record the pressure at which the fracture closes. This requires
that the fracture has penetrated far enough into the formation to feel only the resistance of
the in situ horizontal stress. In a vertical well this is achieved 2–3 wellbore diameters away
from the borehole. In a deviated wellbore, the fracture may have to travel farther away

1 A keyseat is an enlargement of the borehole in one preferred direction, normally created by the mechanical
action of the drillstring on the borehole wall.

from the borehole, due to the twisting of the fracture and the principal stresses close to
a deviated borehole. Basic principles of the different phases of fracture initiation, growth
and closure will be discussed in Chapter 11.

Determination of the largest horizontal stress (σH) is not trivial, and there is no straight-
forward method available for this. In an idealized linear elastic situation, the largest hori-
zontal stress could be determined from a repeated fracture test. However, in practice, the
fracture initiation pressure can vary considerably, rendering such an approach highly un-
certain (see also Section 11.2). Normally, the fracture initiation pressure is lower than pre-
dicted from linear elastic theory. Investigation of Eq. (11.11) shows that if this is the case,
the largest horizontal stress is overestimated. This is probably the reason why ﬁeld studies
utilizing such an approach consistently predict a strike-slip stress regime (σH > σv > σh).
This section will focus on fracturing methods used for determination of the smallest

horizontal stress.

Leak-off tests and extended leak-off tests

Leak-off tests (LOT) are performed during the drilling phase of a well, in the formation
immediately below each casing shoe. The purpose of this test is to determine the maximum
well pressure the new borehole section can sustain without fracturing and loss of drilling

300

ﬂuid. A traditional leak-off test is therefore not designed to determine the smallest hori-
zontal stress, but to obtain a design value for the mud density in the next borehole section
which is going to be drilled.

After a casing string has been cemented, the casing shoe is drilled out and a few me-
tres of new formation is penetrated. A leak-off test is then performed by pressurizing this
open-hole section. The principle of a leak-off test is shown in the ﬁrst cycle in Fig. 8.4.
The pressure in the hole is increased by pumping at a constant volume rate, typically 50–
250 l/min. This yields a straight line of pressure versus volume (time), with the slope of
the line given by the compressibility of the system (primarily the drilling ﬂuid). The point
where the pressure response starts to deviate from this straight line is deﬁned as the leak-off
point. This is actually the point where a fracture is starting to initiate. Normally, a leak-
off test is stopped shortly after this, even if the pressure continues to increase above the
leak-off pressure.

The slope and the shape of the pressure versus volume line can be affected by a number
of operational aspects (equipment performance, cement channels, pump rate etc.). For a
discussion of how these factors may affect LOT-interpretation, see e.g. Postler (1997).

As discussed in Chapter 11, this leak-off point or fracture initiation point is, however, not
necessarily directly related to the smallest horizontal stress, and is therefore no estimate of
σh. It is also important to note that if the test is stopped shortly after the leak-off point, the
generated fracture is very short, and even if the shut-in phase is recorded (see Fig. 8.4), this
shut-in pressure may signiﬁcantly overestimate the smallest horizontal stress. Examples
given by Raaen and Brudy (2001) and Raaen et al. (2006) demonstrate that using the leak-

casing shoe at 2550 m depth. The ﬁrst cycle is shut in after 14 min of pumping at 75 l/min (1050 l
pumped). The following cycles are shut in after 4.8 min of pumping at 250 l/min (1200 l pumped). The vertical
lines indicate the shut-in point, after which the curves are a function of time, as indicated by the total shut-in
period of each curve.

off pressure as an estimate of the smallest horizontal stress can cause signiﬁcant errors. At
the very best, the smallest horizontal stress will be a lower bound to a large population of
leak-off pressures (Addis et al., 1998).

To make the leak-off test applicable also to stress determination, modiﬁcations have to
be made. This has lead to the so-called extended leak-off test (XLOT, ELOT) (e.g. Kunze
and Steiger, 1992). The main difference from the standard leak-off test is that pumping
continues well beyond the leak-off point and also beyond the breakdown pressure. To get
a reliable stress estimate, pumping should continue until stable fracture growth is obtained
(see third and fourth pump cycle of Fig. 8.4). After shut-in, the shut-in/decline phase should
be recorded. As illustrated by Fig. 8.4, it is recommended to pump several cycles to obtain
repeatable test results.

Since these casing shoe tests are normally performed in low-permeability formations like
shale, and with drilling mud in the hole, very little leak-off from the fracture is expected.
This implies that fracture closure may be slow in a shut-in/decline test, resulting in an
almost ﬂat pressure versus time response. The pressure recorded as the closure pressure
is thus still an upper bound estimate of the smallest horizontal stress. Better estimates can
then be obtained by including a ﬂowback phase in the test.

A schematic illustration of an extended leak-off test with ﬂowback is given in Fig. 8.5.
This ﬁgure illustrates how one can maintain a record of the volumes during the different
phases of the test. This can give information about when and whether the fracture has
actually closed during the test.

The bold, solid line represents the pressure-volume response during pump-in. Vcin repre-
sents the volume change due to compression of the ﬂuid volume in the well. Vfrac represents
the volume pumped into the fracture. This volume is spent creating fracture volume, but
also includes any volume lost to the formation. This volume may be used to check the

length of the fracture and whether this is sufﬁcient to penetrate the near-well region and
into the virgin stress rock. When pumping stops and the well is shut-in, the pressure drops
from pshut to the ﬁnal shut-in pressure (pfsip). This drop in pressure results from removal
of frictional losses, ﬂuid loss to the formation and/or further growth of fracture volume.

The broken line from pfsip to pref represents the ﬂowback phase. If the fracture has not
closed during the shut-in phase, monitoring the ﬂowback phase can provide an estimate of
the smallest horizontal stress as indicated on the ﬁgure. This occurs when the slope of the
ﬂowback curve changes, reﬂecting the large difference in compliance between the system
with an open fracture and with a closed fracture. The last linear slope of the ﬂowback curve
should thus be close to the initial slope during pump-in, reﬂecting the compressibility of
the ﬂuid in the borehole. This volume is denoted as Vcout. If the entire ﬂowback curve
has the same slope as the initial pump-in phase, the fracture has closed during the shut-in
phase. Vreturn is thus the actual volume returned from the fracture, whilst Vlost is the volume
lost to the formation during the test.

A ﬁeld example illustrating the principles outlined in Fig. 8.5 is shown in Fig. 8.6
(Raaen, 2006). Note that in the ﬁrst cycle of this test (dotted line) no change in slope is seen
before formation breakdown. In the second cycle (full line), the slope change takes place at
a signiﬁcantly lower pressure. Thus, the fracture reopening pressure is considerably lower
than the initial formation breakdown pressure.

The dashed lines show that the same closed-fracture slope is observed during pumping
and ﬂowback in both cycles. In cycle 2, the initial open fracture period during ﬂowback is
also well approximated by a straight line (dash-dot line).

In practice, it is convenient to perform the ﬂowback with a ﬁxed choke, which leads
to a time-varying ﬂowback rate. Since the ﬂow rate through a choke is approximately
proportional to the square root of the pressure drop, it is readily shown (Raaen and Brudy,
2001) that a plot of the square root of pressure versus time should give a straight line if
the system stiffness is constant. This is conﬁrmed by Fig. 8.7, which shows a plot of data

ESTIMATION OF IN SITU STRESSES

from cycle 2 of the test in Fig. 8.6. Both the initial open-fracture period and the closed
fracture period are approximated well by the dashed straight lines, and the intercept is in
accordance with that inferred from the pressure versus volume data.

For another ﬁeld example, see Section 11.5, where also other alternatives for improving

the interpretation of fracture tests are included.

To improve the quality of an extended leak-off test, there are thus several recommenda-
tions which should be followed:
• Circulate mud to make sure that the mud column has uniform density and there is no
air in the system.
• Calibrate the surface reading of the mud pressure, or preferably use a downhole pres-
sure gauge.
• Check that the slope prior to leak-off is in reasonable agreement with the expected
ﬂuid compliance. A slope which is signiﬁcantly lower can indicate that there is a
leakage in the system or poor cement integrity. A direct measurement of the com-
pressibility is obtained by performing a casing test (i.e. pressurizing the closed casing
before drilling out the casing shoe).
• Make sure that the volume pumped into the fracture is large enough to create a fracture
of sufﬁcient length (typically 0.5–1 m3). An estimate of the required volume can be
obtained with information about the fracture width, the fracture length and the fracture
height (length of the rathole). The fracture width can be estimated from Eq. (11.19).
The length of each fracture wing should be long enough to penetrate into virgin for-
mation, e.g. 10 wellbore diameters. Note that a longer fracture may be required in a
deviated well. The total volume required for a test is thus given by the fracture vol-
ume in addition to the volume required to compress the ﬂuid in the borehole prior to
fracture initiation.
• Maintain a record of volumes pumped and bled back during ﬂowback, and record the
volumes as a function of time during ﬂowback if possible.

304

MECHANICAL PROPERTIES AND IN SITU STRESSES FROM FIELD DATA

The quality of the test should also be checked against possible operational problems such as
cement channels. If the ﬂuid can leak to shallower formations, the test will not be relevant
for the formation below the casing shoe.

The reluctance to perform extended leak-off tests is partly based on the extra time re-
quired to run this test compared to a conventional leak-off test. However, this may be the
only possibility to obtain reliable stress data in the development of a ﬁeld. Stress data which
can be crucial when designing deviated wells at a later stage.

When using water-based mud, the fractures tend to heal and eventually restore the orig-
inal leak-off pressure. When using oil-based mud, it is often claimed that healing does not
occur. However, no published work on this is known to the authors. Such a difference can at
least partly be attributed to differences in ﬁltrate properties of the two mud systems. Water-
based mud normally has higher spurt loss and ﬁltrate loss. This creates a ﬁlter cake within
the fracture which seals the fracture tip, thus requiring a higher pressure to propagate the
fracture (Onyia, 1991). This difference can be reduced by altering the ﬁltrate properties of
the oil-based mud (Morita et al., 1996). Note that this argumentation rests on the ability of
the rock to accept ﬁltrate, hence this can not explain similar differences between the two
mud systems in low-permeability rocks like shale.

In practice it is therefore often recommended not to perform extended leak-off tests with
oil-based mud if the margin between the leak-off pressure and the smallest horizontal stress
is required for a successful operation. This may be critical in wells with a narrow margin
between the lower and the upper mudweight limit.

When several wells have been drilled in a ﬁeld, it is not uncommon to run formation
integrity tests (FIT) instead of leak-off tests. This test simply consists of increasing the
well pressure up to a pre-deﬁned level which is considered sufﬁcient for drilling of the next
section. Pumping is then stopped, and a constant pressure in the shut-in phase is observed.
Hence this test is normally stopped in the linear part, before leak-off is reached. An FIT
can therefore never be used for stress determination.

Mini-frac tests

As the name suggests, a mini-frac test is a fracture test where a relatively small volume
is injected (typically around 10 m3). Small in this sense relates to conventional fracture
stimulation jobs which commonly involve hundreds or even thousands of cubic metres.
A mini-frac test is normally run prior to a fracture stimulation job, in order to obtain values
for fracturing pressure, closure pressure, ﬂuid loss parameters etc. which are then used in
the design of the fracturing treatment (e.g. Tan et al., 1990). This implies that mini-frac
tests are normally run in reservoir sections which require stimulation. Since the reservoir
section may already be completed, it is not uncommon to run mini-frac tests in cased and
perforated wells.

Again it is recommended to use a downhole pressure gauge to improve the accuracy.
A typical ﬂuid used in a mini-frac test is 2% KCl brine. Gel may be added to reduce ﬂuid
loss and to make the test more similar to the main treatment.

Wireline tools

Wireline tools are also available for performing fracture tests in open holes (Kuhlman et al.,
1993; Thiercelin et al., 1996; Desroches and Kurkjian, 1999). The basic principle here is
to isolate a small section of the hole, typically 1 m, by inﬂating two rubber packers against
the formation. A relatively small volume (typically less than 400 l) of ﬂuid is used during
pumping at rates in the range 1 l/min to 100 l/min. Due to the small volume, these tests
are often referred to as micro-frac tests. The pressure is measured with a downhole gauge.
As with other fracture tests, several cycles are usually performed.

When run in an open hole, good hole quality is essential, i.e. a smooth hole surface
and close to circular shape. Otherwise it will be problematic to obtain good sealing by the
packers. To provide sealing, the packer pressure should exceed the pressure in the isolated
interval. This implies that under certain conditions a fracture will be generated ﬁrst behind
the packer. Referring to Eq. (11.6), this depends on the response of the pore pressure around
the borehole. In a formation which is permeable it will be possible to maintain a sealing
pressure differential. However, in low permeability formations, a fracture may be generated
ﬁrst behind the packer (sleeve fracturing). An alternative procedure in this situation is to do
this deliberately and subsequently move the packers so that the generated fracture is within
the isolated zone and then proceed as in a standard test (Desroches and Kurkjian, 1999).

The azimuthal direction of the fracture and hence also the direction of the horizon-
tal stresses can also be estimated, provided the test is performed in a vertical well. The
method used to obtain the fracture direction varies somewhat with the type of tool, either
using an imaging tool after fracturing or back calculating from measurements of borehole
deformation during fracturing.

Such tools can of course also be used in cased and perforated holes. Problems with hole
quality, packer sealing and sleeve fracturing are then no longer of any concern. The use is
however then limited to producing zones in the reservoir.

Empirical relations

Breckels and van Eekelen (1982) developed empirical correlations for estimation of the
smallest horizontal stress (see also Section 3.1) as a function of depth. These relationships
were based on hydraulic fracture data from different regions around the world. The rela-
tionships for the US Gulf Coast are:

σh = 0.0053D1.145 + 0.46(pf − pfn) (D < 3500 m)
σh = 0.0264D − 31.7 + 0.46(pf − pfn) (D > 3500 m)

(8.4)
(8.5)

where D is depth in metres, pf is the pore pressure in MPa, pfn is the normal pore pressure
and σh is the total smallest horizontal stress in MPa.

The last term in these relations reﬂect abnormal pore pressures. The predicted horizontal

stress will hence reﬂect changes in the pore pressure gradient.

Breckels and van Eekelen argue that these relationships can be used with a fair degree
of conﬁdence also in other tectonically relaxed areas of the world such as the North Sea.

306

MECHANICAL PROPERTIES AND IN SITU STRESSES FROM FIELD DATA

Note that these relations were developed at zero or shallow water depths. These authors’
experience is that the relation for depths down to 3500 m gives fairly good estimates in
most parts of the North Sea (down to about 2500–3000 m), even at water depths up to
approximately 300 m. As the water depth increases, predictions at shallow formation depth
should be avoided. Thus these relations may provide reasonable estimates, but should only
be considered as a ﬁrst estimate and should always be checked and/or calibrated against
proper test data from each ﬁeld.

8.3.4. Other methods

We will ﬁnish this section by brieﬂy mentioning some other methods which have not been
discussed previously (in this chapter or in Chapter 3).

Inversion of leak-off test data has been suggested for back calculating the horizontal
stresses (Aadnøy, 1990). This method uses data from a number of leak-off tests performed
in boreholes of different inclination and azimuth. Assuming the vertical stress and the
pore pressure are known, the magnitude and direction of the horizontal stresses are back
calculated from linear elastic theory.

Since the method is based on leak-off pressures, it suffers from the same basic weak-
nesses as the standard leak-off test, especially the large uncertainty of the leak-off pressure
in relation to the fracture breakdown pressure as deﬁned by elastic theory.

Another source of uncertainty is the potential spatial variation in the horizontal stresses
in a ﬁeld. When having to use test data from several wells which can also cover a wide
depth range, the tests may include compartments of signiﬁcantly different stress regimes.
Further discussion of these uncertainties can be found in Gjønnes et al. (1998).

Rather than trying to give precise numbers for the stresses, one can try to constrain the
stresses (see e.g. Wiprut et al., 1997). This method uses detailed observations of borehole
failures (borehole breakouts, drilling-induced tensile fractures), primarily attempting to
constrain the magnitude and direction of the largest horizontal stress. Especially when
constraining the stress magnitude, it is essential to have information on both the smallest
horizontal stress and rock strength properties.

Drilling data have also been proposed as a potential source for constraining stresses,
especially the smallest horizontal stress (Hareland and Hoberock, 1993). The basis for this
method is drill bit penetration models of the kind discussed in Section 8.2.4. This is used
to predict rock strength which is further related to the ratio of vertical to horizontal stress
in an iterative process.

The stress data predicted from borehole tests and borehole information are point data in
a large rock mass. It is therefore often useful to put this into a large-scale framework of
in situ stresses (see also Chapter 3).

Stability during drilling

309

Borehole instabilities during drilling cause substantial problems in all areas of the world.
A borehole stability problem is an example of what drillers refer to as a “tight hole” or
“stuck pipe” incident. There are many possible reasons for being stuck, but in a majority
of the ﬁeld cases reported, the fundamental reason is mechanical collapse of the borehole
(see e.g. Bol et al., 1994; Gazianol et al., 1995). Most instabilities of practical importance
occur in shale or mudstone; predominantly in the overburden, but sometimes also within
the reservoir. Often mechanical hole collapse is combined with a lack of hole cleaning
ability. It is a common opinion in the industry that such stability problems amount to typi-
cally 5–10% of drilling costs in exploration and production, incorporating loss of time and
sometimes also of equipment. These numbers imply a worldwide cost to the petroleum
industry of hundreds of million dollars per year.

Borehole stability problems have been encountered for as long as wells have been
drilled. Several new challenges have appeared in recent years, making the stability issue
more difﬁcult to handle, but also more important to solve. For example, there has been
an increasing demand by the industry for more sophisticated well trajectories. Highly de-
viated, multilateral and horizontal wells are attractive, since a single production platform
then can drain a larger area, which can reduce the number of platforms required to produce
a given ﬁeld. Stable drilling is however normally more difﬁcult in deviated than in vertical
boreholes. Other situations where borehole stability problems may be expected are during
inﬁll drilling in depleted reservoirs, when drilling in tectonically active areas, and in deep
and geologically complex surroundings. Deep water drilling is a special challenge. Due to
the high costs of drilling in such environments, additional time lost on borehole instability
has an extra high price.

As mentioned above, borehole stability is an operational problem primarily in shale
and mudstone. Problems often occur in shales that are rich in swelling clay minerals, and
are often associated with high pore pressure. Traditionally, the oil industry has looked at
borehole instability as being caused by clay swelling, which can be treated by chemical
additives (e.g. salt) to the drilling mud. The selection of mud weight has been governed
by the pore pressure and the fracture gradient proﬁles: In order to prevent inﬂux of ﬂu-
ids (in particular gas) it has been considered necessary to keep the mud weight above
the pore pressure gradient. In order to prevent loss of mud into fractures (“lost circula-
tion”), it has been found necessary to keep the mud weight below the fracture gradient.
We will show in this chapter how the minimum permitted mud weight may be estimated
from a rock mechanical perspective. We shall see how mud chemistry may affect the me-
chanical integrity of the formation near the well and hence the stability of the borehole.
We will also consider the maximum permitted mud weight, associated with mud loss to
new or existing fractures. This analysis leads to the “mud weight window”; i.e. the range
of permitted mud weights associated with stable drilling. This is key input to well de-
sign.

310

STABILITY DURING DRILLING

Stability evaluation of a well represents a classical rock mechanical problem: The pre-
diction of a rock’s response to mechanical loading. Some special circumstances make
borehole stability evaluation particularly problematic:
• The drill bit may be thousands of metres away and there are no methods available for
visual observation of what is happening (contrary to e.g. tunnel drilling).
• There may be large variations in the formation stresses, for instance when drilling
through a depleted reservoir and non-depleted shale layers in the same well, or when
drilling through faults. Unfortunately, in situ stresses and in particular their variations,
are not measured systematically.
• There are large variations in formation properties. Coring costs are high, and only
limited amounts of material are available for rock mechanics testing. Coring in layers
above the reservoir is scarce.
• Many mechanisms contribute to the onset of borehole instability: mud chemistry, re-
distribution of stresses, temperature changes etc.
• The operational condition of borehole instability does not necessarily coincide with
the rock mechanical deﬁnition of borehole failure.

This illustrates that the reality cannot be exactly described by any model, no matter how
complicated the model is. Based on some ideal assumptions, a stability analysis, however,
can give some guiding limits, which then have to be related to practical conditions.

9.1. Unstable boreholes: Symptoms, reasons and consequences

In this section, we will consider two main types of borehole instabilities; so-called “tight
hole” or “stuck pipe” incidents, which are time-consuming to solve and therefore expen-
sive; and “lost circulation” or “mud loss” problems, which are potentially dangerous, thus
representing a safety risk that has to be avoided. Fig. 9.1 illustrates in a schematic manner
different instability problems that might occur.

UNSTABLE BOREHOLES: SYMPTOMS, REASONS AND CONSEQUENCES

311

9.1.1. Tight hole/stuck pipe

The main causes of tight hole/stuck pipe incidents are:

1. Hole collapse (rock mechanical failure).

2. Inappropriate hole cleaning.

3. Differential sticking.

4. Deviation from ideal trajectory.

Cause 1 Hole collapse means that the formation near the borehole fails mechanically,
most often by shear failure, but occasionally also by tensile failure. The results of such
failures can be divided into two main types:
• Increased borehole size due to brittle failure and caving of the wellbore wall. If the
cavings are not transported away, this represents a potential source of a stuck pipe
situation. This normally takes place in brittle rocks, but the borehole size may also
increase by erosion (hydraulic or mechanical) in a weak rock. In driller’s language,
“sloughing shale” is often used (although not very well deﬁned) to describe frag-
ments or “spallings” generated from the borehole wall. Although often thought to
be of a chemical origin, this is ﬁrst of all a mechanical problem, which to some
extent may be inﬂuenced by shale-ﬂuid interactions (see further below). The case
of excessive hole enlargement is sometimes referred to as a “washout”. A washout
is primarily caused by erosion due to high mudﬂow intensity near the drill bit, or
it may be related to softening of the formation by mechanical failure. While a me-
chanical hole collapse leads to ovalization of the hole (by formation of a breakout;
see Chapter 4), this need not be the case with a washout.
• Reduced borehole diameter may occur in weak (plastic) shales, sandstones and salt.
Some chalk formations can also show such behaviour. This phenomenon requires
repeated reaming, or may even result in a lost drillpipe. The case of very soft (plas-
tic) shale is sometimes referred to as “gumbo shale” (gumbo is a Creolian ﬁsh soup
with rheology and appearance that may give associations to soft shale). Such shale
is often sticky, contains considerable amounts of swelling minerals (montmoril-
lonite), and may cause problems like bit balling and solids accumulation.
• It has traditionally been thought that large hole diameter reductions might be caused
by swelling clays. The potential chemical swelling of a shale in downhole stress
conditions is however very limited, as was pointed out by Santarelli and Carminati
(1995). Large hole deformation is thus a result of primarily plastic shale deforma-
tion. The effect of drilling ﬂuid chemistry on borehole stability is explained in more
detail below.

Cause 2 Inappropriate hole cleaning means that drill cuttings, or in the case of a collapsing
hole, cavings (rock fragments produced by formation failure) cannot be fully removed
by the drilling ﬂuid. Mechanisms 1 and 2 are therefore not independent, but often act
together. Hole cleaning is less problematic in sand than in shale formations, since the
drilling mud can more easily remove sand particles than shale cavings.

312

STABILITY DURING DRILLING

Cause 3 Differential sticking is the only likely reason for stuck pipe in a permeable reser-
voir rock. When differentially stuck, the drilling tool is clamped against the borehole
wall as a result of a differential pressure between the well and the formation (Outmans,
1958). This differential pressure is caused by an overpressure in the borehole, and main-
tained by a mud-cake. Since shales have extremely low permeabilities, and mud-cakes
do not form on shales, this mechanism is not possible in shale zones.

Cause 4 Deviation from ideal trajectory may result in a stuck pipe situation. Such devi-
ations may be caused by non-ideal hole shape. In deviated wells the lower side of the
drilling tool may dig into the bottom of the hole and create what is known as a “key-
seat”. The tool may also be guided by washouts and breakouts. Furthermore, if the hole
trajectory has a too sharp bend (“dog leg”), the tool may be stuck. The problems de-
scribed here are typical for deviated holes. Hole collapse in general occurs more easily
in deviated holes as can be seen from the mechanical stability analysis in Chapter 4,
and discussed further below. Hole cleaning is also more difﬁcult in deviated holes, in
particular at intermediate angles in the range 40°–60°.

The main consequences of tight hole/stuck pipe situations are loss of time during
drilling, since the remedial actions usually are reaming or sidetracking. Instabilities may
also cause considerable problems to later operations in the borehole. It may become dif-
ﬁcult to run wireline logs, and in particular to interpret the logs, since log interpretation
is usually based on the assumption of a gauge hole with known size. Irregular borehole
shape also leads to large uncertainty in the required cement volume. Poor cementing of
the casing can lead to problems for perforation, sand control, production and stimulation.
Finally, instabilities may trigger new instabilities.

Good well design is the key to stable drilling. When a well is designed, mud weight
and composition, casing setting depths, and well trajectory (including deviation and az-
imuthal orientation) are selected. The well design serves many purposes: First of all, the
target reservoir needs to be penetrated in a way that assures optimum drainage during pro-
duction. Furthermore, the drilling speed must be satisfactory. A central part of well design
is however to assure safe and stable drilling. If an unexpected instability occurs during
drilling, then the mud is more or less the only adjustable factor. It is important to underline
that the solution to a borehole stability problem depends on the cause, which means there
is a strong need for diagnostic tools. If for example the reason for the instability is hole
collapse, then the standard solution is to increase the mud weight (as will be seen below).
If, however, differential sticking is the cause of the problem, the solution is usually to de-
crease the mud weight. Thus, if the diagnosis is wrong, the selected solution may have a
destabilizing effect on the borehole.

Some elements of a diagnostic analysis are shown in Table 9.1. The table shows how
ﬁeld observations can be linked to the three major causes for stuck pipe. Note that it may
be difﬁcult to distinguish hole collapse from hole cleaning problems.

9.1.2. Lost circulation

Lost circulation means that a signiﬁcant amount of drilling ﬂuid is lost into the formation.
This implies that a fracture has been created (see Chapter 11), or that mud is lost into an

existing fracture. This is an operational problem, partly because the mud is expensive, and
partly because there is a limit to the amount of mud available on the rig. The mud loss
may also lead to a temporary pressure drop in the well, since a part of the mud column is
disappearing into the formation. As a consequence, pore ﬂuid may ﬂow into the well from
permeable layers higher up. In the presence of gas, this may lead to a rapid increase in well
pressure (“kick”) and a high risk of a blowout. This is a potentially dangerous situation that
may result in loss of lives and equipment.

The main solution is to keep the mud weight sufﬁciently low that ﬂuid loss does not
occur; i.e. below the limit for fracture initiation and growth in non-fractured formations,
and below the fracture reopening pressure in naturally fractured formations. If the margins
are small enough, then the equivalent circulating density (ECD) may be sufﬁcient to exceed
the fracturing pressure. The ECD (or dynamic mud weight) equals the static mud weight
plus a term proportional to the pressure drop in the annulus.

This is an argument to keep the mud weight well below the critical limit. In some cases,
fractures may initiate, but the stress conditions may not permit fracture growth. We will
come back to this below, but we will keep in mind that in a previously unfractured for-
mation, fracture growth is necessary in order to lose signiﬁcant amounts of drilling ﬂuid.
In cases when hole cleaning is not done properly, for instance in relation to hole collapse,
pack-off during backreaming may lead to lost circulation. This shows the need for good di-
agnostics: an apparent loss problem may have been initiated by hole collapse and enhanced
by insufﬁcient cleaning.

Mud loss prevention additives (lost circulation material; LCM) is commonly used to
heal fractures created during loss situations. This treatment has a better effect in permeable
rocks than in low-permeability rocks like shale, because leak-off from a fracture in shale
is very slow. The requirement not to induce ﬂuid loss situations sets an upper limit to the
mud density, with an associated strong impact on the entire well design.

314

STABILITY DURING DRILLING

Particles may also be used in a preventive manner, by including a speciﬁc concentration
of particles (e.g. graphite and calcium carbonate) in the drilling ﬂuid while drilling. The
purpose is to arrest drilling-induced fractures at an early stage, before signiﬁcant losses
occur. The particles are supposed to bridge off the fracture opening and reduce ﬂuid loss
to the fracture, to the extent that the fracture pressure drops and fracture growth stops.
Used successfully (Aston et al., 2004; Davison et al., 2004), the fracture pressure can
be increased relative to drilling with a mud without particles. Such an approach may ex-
tend drilling in depleting reservoirs, by maintaining a positive mud weight window. Other
potential applications include deep water drilling, where the window between the pore
pressure and the fracture gradient is often initially low, and drilling into cooled reservoir
sections (due to cold water injection), where cooling has reduced the fracture pressure
signiﬁcantly.

9.2. Rock mechanics analysis of borehole stability during drilling

Formations at a given depth in the Earth are exposed to vertical and (generally aniso-
tropic) horizontal compressive stresses, as well as a pore pressure (Chapter 3). When a
hole is drilled, the surrounding rock must carry the load that previously was carried by the
removed rock. Chapter 4 presents the theoretical basis of stresses around boreholes. In a
rock that behaves linearly elastic, this leads to a stress concentration near the well as shown
in Fig. 9.2. If the rock is sufﬁciently weak, this stress concentration can lead to failure of
the borehole.

In drilling of a deep well, such as in petroleum ﬁelds, the well is ﬁlled with mud. The
mud serves two main purposes: One is to prevent ﬂow of pore ﬂuid into the well and hole
instabilities. The other purpose of the mud is to transport drill cuttings from the hole to the
surface. The mud density ρw controls the pressure in the well:

pw = ρwgD

(9.1)

g is the acceleration due to gravity, and D is the vertical depth. In oil well drilling language,
one usually refers to mud weight (in density units) and gradients of stress or pressure (also
measured in equivalent density units) instead of pressures. We shall however perform the
theoretical analysis of borehole stability using the actual stresses and pressures, and then
in the next section translate to oilﬁeld language. Circulation of the mud implies that the
effective (dynamic) mud pressure in the well is higher than the static pressure expressed
by Eq. (9.1). As mentioned above, the dynamic well pressure is often referred to as an
equivalent circulating density (ECD). The difference may be in the order of 5–10%. Under
normal drilling operations, the pressure will vary between the static and the dynamic values
(see Sections 9.7.4 and 9.6).

The mud will carry part of the stress concentration. We shall now use rock mechanics
to analyse how the mud weight controls the mechanical stability of the borehole, building
mainly on the theory outlined in Chapter 4.

To begin with, we assume linearly elastic rock behaviour and look at the deformation of
the hole resulting from drill-out. Eq. (4.47) tells us that a vertical borehole will contract
proportionally to the difference between the total horizontal stress and the well pressure,

and inversely proportional to the shear modulus of the formation:

= |σh − pw|

2Gfr

Rw

(9.2)

This equation produces a relatively small change in borehole radius: With a shear mod-
ulus Gfr of 1 GPa (representative of very soft shale), a difference of 5 MPa between
horizontal stress and well pressure leads to a 0.5 mm shrinkage of a 10 cm radius borehole.
This is practically insigniﬁcant for the stability of the hole, since such small displacements
will not lead to a tight hole. An operational problem would only occur if the shear modulus
of the formation becomes orders of magnitude lower. For shale at depth this means that the
shale will have to be taken beyond the elasticity limit, and into a state of brittle failure or
plastic deformation. For analyzing borehole stability, it is therefore more fruitful to focus
on criteria for borehole failure.

As was seen in Chapter 4, there are two basic types of borehole failure (illustrated in
Fig. 9.1): Shear (or compressive) failure, and tensile failure. In the case of linear elasticity,

316

STABILITY DURING DRILLING

the maximum deviatoric stress occurs at the borehole wall, so this is where shear failure
will occur. We will use this criterion for borehole collapse, which means that borehole
failure is regarded as perfectly brittle (that is; a complete loss of load-bearing capacity once
failure occurs). The shear failures most critical to the stability of a borehole are failures
where either the tangential (hoop) stress or the axial stress along the borehole axis is the
maximum, and the radial stress (= well pressure) is the minimum (these are referred to as
cases a and b in Table 4.1). For the vertical hole, we can write the solutions for critical well
pressure in a borehole with impermeable wall conditions as follows (see Eqs. (4.124) and
(4.125)):

In shale, where the permeability is very low (nanoDarcy or so), an impermeable borehole
wall corresponds to the situation during or shortly after drilling, when no pore pressure
penetration occurs. An impermeable wall may also be an appropriate boundary condition
in a permeable formation, when a perfect mud cake is formed at the borehole wall. A mud
cake in a traditional meaning can not be established on shale, although in case of a non-
wetting drilling ﬂuid or a ﬂuid that contains molecular species (e.g. polymers) that block
the shale surface, the impermeable wall approach may be valid also after initial drill-out.

We see from Eqs. (9.3) and (9.4) that the limiting well pressure may be larger or smaller
than the in situ pore pressure pfo, depending on in situ stresses, and on the strength para-
meters of the rock. Only one of the conditions (a) or (b) represents a valid solution to the
hole stability problem, so when the limiting well pressure has been calculated, one needs to
check that the borehole wall stresses are in agreement with the assumed conditions. These
types of borehole failure result in the formation of a breakout (e.g. as shown in Figs. 4.15
and 9.4). As discussed in the preceding situation, this may cause a stuck pipe situation. The
reason is then obviously that the mud weight is too low.

The lower permitted value of the mud weight is limited not only by the criterion for

shear failure, but also by the condition for radial tensile failure (see Fig. 9.3), i.e.

(cid:2)

(9.5)

Since the tensile strength of shale is low, this means that if the borehole pressure is lower
than the pore pressure (underbalanced drilling), there is a risk of tensile failure. This failure
mode leads to blade-shaped cavings and may cause a tight hole. Since the new free surface
generated will be exposed to exactly the same effect, this is a process that is not self-
stabilizing. Being in underbalance is also risky from the point of view of pressure control,
since kicks may occur from permeable layers. In pure shale there is however no risk of ﬂuid
inﬂux to the well, since the shale permeability is extremely low (typically nanoDarcy; see
Chapter 3). All in all, the risks of generating borehole instabilities by being in underbalance
have to be weighted against the possible beneﬁts of higher drilling rate and less formation
damage by mud ﬁltrate inﬂux.

In practice, the lower mud weight limit is associated with the maximum of the critical
well pressures calculated from shear and tensile failure criteria in Eqs. (9.3)–(9.5) above.

Fig. 9.4. Illustration of compressive failure direction around a vertical borehole with unequal horizontal stresses.

If the well pressure has to be in overbalance (by regulations, or to reduce the risk of kicks),
then the minimum permitted mud weight is only controlled by hole collapse if the collapse
limit is above the pore pressure gradient.

Although shear failure may also occur if the well pressure is high (e.g. case c in
Table 4.1), this situation is not thought to give rise to signiﬁcant drilling problems. In ad-
dition, the limit for this shear failure mode is normally very close to the limit for hydraulic
fracturing by tensile failure (see Fig. 4.13). For the case of an impermeable borehole wall
fracture initiation is given by:

pfrac
w,max

= 3σh − σH − pfo + T0

provided the minimum horizontal stress is the minimum principal rock stress. In case the
vertical stress is the minimum, then a fracture is initiated if σ

= −T0.

It should be noted that in order for a hydraulic fracture to create a drilling problem (i.e.
for signiﬁcant mud loss to occur), the fracture needs not only to be initiated, but also to

(cid:2)
v

318

propagate beyond the near well region. A hydraulic fracture will propagate if the pressure
in the fracture exceeds the minimum principal stress, plus an additional term depending on
the conditions for fracture growth at the tip, leakage from the fracture to the formation etc.
Often mud loss into pre-existing fractures may be a problem. This will occur if the well
pressure is high enough to permit reopening of such a fracture. In practice, therefore, the
well pressure should not exceed the fracture closure pressure (minimum principal (usually
horizontal) stress), plus an additional contribution pexp to be quantiﬁed on the basis of
operational experience; i.e.

fracprop

w,max > σ3 + pexp

p

(9.7)

The shear failures described by cases d–f in Table 4.1 all imply that the well pressure
is higher than the axial stress along the borehole. For a vertical well, this means that the
well pressure exceeds the vertical stress, which is not a common practical situation. In
horizontal or deviated wells, such a high well pressure would always exceed the fracturing
limit. In borehole stability analysis, these cases are therefore not considered.

The stability of boreholes drilled along horizontal principal stress directions can easily
be analysed using the same mathematical framework as above. One has to remember that
the far ﬁeld stresses controlling the tangential stress (and hence the shear failure criterion
(a) at the borehole wall) are the stresses acting in the plane perpendicular to the borehole, so

In summary, the lower mud weight limit in the case of a linearly elastic formation un-
dergoing perfectly brittle failure is found from Eqs. (9.1), (9.3), (9.4) and (9.6) and the
possible additional requirement of overbalanced drilling. The upper limit is estimated us-
ing Eq. (9.7), and a conservative limit is obtained by assuming pexp = 0. By further
inspection of Eqs. (9.3) and (9.4), one ﬁnds that the risk of borehole instability with re-
spect to mechanical hole collapse becomes high (high critical well pressure) if
• The formation strength is low. This is as one intuitively would expect.
• The failure angle is low. This is usually the case in shale, where β often is 50°–55°,
compared to 60° or more in sandstones (see Chapter 3).
• The pore pressure is high. This is often the case in shales above the reservoir (see also
Chapter 3), as well as in some reservoir sections prior to depletion.

These results are all in good agreement with operational experience, indicating the va-

lidity of a rock mechanics approach to handle borehole stability.

Furthermore, from Eqs. (9.3), (9.4) and the discussion above we see that the lower mud

weight limit increases with (3σ
high stress level and high stress anisotropy perpendicular to the well. A high stress level
will reduce the risk of mud losses, however; high stress anisotropy may facilitate fracture
initiation.

max⊥ − σ
(cid:2)

Given an elastic and isotropic rock, the most unfavourable direction for a borehole with
respect to initiation of hole instability will be parallel to the intermediate principal stress.
The most favourable direction for a borehole will normally be along the largest principal
stress direction. This illustrates the importance of knowing in situ stresses and principal
stress directions. A brief remark is added here: Zheng (1998) found that if one is able to
handle the initial formation of the instability, then a hole drilled along the intermediate
stress may in fact be beneﬁcial, since the breakout geometry may give a better post-failure
stability.

When a deviated borehole is drilled along a general inclination (relative to vertical)
and at a general azimuthal direction in the horizontal plane, the stability analysis has to
account for shear stresses at the borehole wall; since the tangential and axial stresses are
not principal stresses in general. The principal stresses and their orientations have to be
computed ﬁrst, and then inserted into the failure criteria. The equations for a generally
deviated well are given in Section 4.3. These calculations are most conveniently carried
out as iterative loops in a computer program, due to the complexity of the equations. The
results depend on the stress regime, and it is difﬁcult to generalize.

Fig. 9.5 illustrates a case with a normal in situ stress situation (the vertical stress is
the major principal stress), showing the required minimum mud weight to prevent hole

izontal stresses, where all parameters are kept the same as above, except the maximum horizontal stress 28 MPa.

collapse as a function of hole deviation. The maximum permitted mud weight may con-
servatively be taken as the minimum horizontal stress, in this case 25 MPa corresponding
to a mud density of 1.70 g/cm3. For isotropic horizontal stresses, the stable range is nar-
rowed continuously as the inclination increases towards horizontal, in particular from 30°
until 60°. If the horizontal stresses are anisotropic, the stability of a vertical hole becomes
signiﬁcantly reduced.

The critical mud weight for a deviated well depends both on inclination and azimuthal
direction. For a horizontal well parallel to the minimum horizontal stress, the collapse limit
is improved when compared to the case with horizontal stress isotropy, because the stress
anisotropy perpendicular to the hole is reduced.

9.3. Time-delayed borehole failure

9.3.1. Establishment of pore pressure equilibrium

In the ﬁeld, it is often observed that initial drilling may be stable, but that tight hole/stuck
pipe situations occur during tripping or logging runs, typically several days after drill-out.
The model we presented in Section 9.2 above does not account for time-dependent bore-
hole stability. One limitation of the analysis above was the assumption of an impermeable
borehole wall. As pointed out, this is only true if a perfect mud cake is established, or if the
rock is impermeable. Shale has a very low (nanoDarcy) but still ﬁnite permeability, which
means that impermeable wall conditions are valid only during drilling. After drilling, the
pore pressure close to the borehole wall will gradually approach the well pressure. Eventu-
ally, if the formation is exposed to the mud pressure for sufﬁciently long time, steady state
pore pressure equilibrium is reached.

The stress ﬁeld under permeable wall conditions is given in Chapter 4. Applying Mohr–
Coulomb’s failure criterion to a piece of rock at the borehole wall, the minimum permitted
well pressure (analogous to Eqs. (9.3) and (9.4) above) for a vertical borehole is given by
one of the two cases (a) and (b) (see Eqs. (4.120) and (4.121)):

When the hole is drilled along one of the horizontal principal stress directions, one has to
replace the principal stresses with the appropriate ones, as was done in Eqs. (9.8) and (9.9)
above.

The time τD it takes to reach pore pressure equilibrium after a hole is drilled in unbal-

anced conditions is based on consolidation theory (Section 1.9), which states that:

TIME-DELAYED BOREHOLE FAILURE

321

Fig. 9.6. Illustration of how the Mohr circle representing the borehole stress ﬁeld moves from time t = 0 (drillout)
to time t → ∞ (pore pressure equilibrium), creating a more unstable situation with respect to shear failure (hole
collapse).

Here lD is a characteristic length and CD is the diffusion coefﬁcient deﬁned in
Eq. (1.242). CD is proportional to the permeability. Taking lD ∼ borehole radius ∼10 cm
and the shale permeability ∼1 nanoDarcy, we ﬁnd that the characteristic time typically is
5–10 days. This corresponds to the time period after which instabilities occur in practice.
If the well is kept in overbalance, the pore pressure near the borehole wall will increase,
resulting in reduced hole stability with time. This is illustrated in Fig. 9.6, which shows the
displacement of the Mohr circle in the direction of the shear failure criterion from short
time (t = 0) to long time (t = ∞). The reason is that the effective conﬁnement (minimum
effective principle stress) approaches zero as pore pressure equilibrium is established. For
the case described for a vertical well in Fig. 9.5 above, the minimum permitted well pres-
sure increases with time to 26 MPa (corresponding to mud density 1.77 g/cm3), which
means that the horizontal stress is exceeded, and stable drilling no longer is permitted. On
the other hand, if the well is drilled in underbalance, the pore pressure will decrease and
stability with respect to hole collapse will improve with time.

Two practical implications can be drawn from the above: The likelihood of stability
problems (at least during overbalanced drilling) will be reduced the sooner one is able to
leave a well section behind by setting casing. Furthermore, maintaining an impermeable
boundary condition is a way to stabilize the hole over time. Solutions to this challenge are
being sought in terms of oil-based or polymer-containing drilling ﬂuids (see Section 9.4).

9.3.2. Temperature effects

Consolidation (or establishment of pore pressure equilibrium) as described in the preceding
section, is not the only possible explanation of time delayed borehole failures. The drilling
ﬂuid is usually (at t = 0) colder than the formation to be drilled, since it has surface
temperature when circulation starts. The ﬂuid and formation temperatures will gradually

322

STABILITY DURING DRILLING

adjust, depending on the circulation rate. After a stop in the circulation, the formation near
the well will gradually heat up. Maury and Sauzay (1987) found that this could explain
delayed failure. Shortly after drilling the borehole is stable. However, as the temperature
increases, the tangential and axial stresses at the borehole wall will both increase by the
same amount.

The thermoelastic stresses induced at an impermeable borehole wall are given by
Eqs. (4.69)–(4.71). If the borehole ﬂuid is colder than the formation, the tangential and
axial stresses are reduced proportionally to the temperature difference between formation
and borehole ﬂuid. This acts as a strengthening of the borehole with respect to collapse.
Deliberate cooling of the mud can therefore be a practical approach to mitigate stabil-
ity problems. This was applied with success in the ﬁeld (Guenot and Santarelli, 1989;
Maury and Guenot, 1995). The thermal effect is proportional to rock stiffness, which means
that it is more signiﬁcant in hard than soft rocks. It is also proportional to the thermal ex-
pansion coefﬁcient.
−5 K

There is not a lot of data on thermal expansion on sedimentary rocks, but typically αT
−1 (see Appendix A). This gives a typical thermal stress contribution
is around 10
of a few MPa, which reduces the lower mud weight limit by 5–10% compared to a situ-
ation with no thermal effect. However, since cooling reduces the tangential stress, it not
only reduces the risk of shear failure, but it also promotes fracturing, and may hence be a
destabilizing factor with respect to lost circulation problems. The extent of the cold zone
is however limited, and this may limit the growth of the fracture.

Cooling of a low permeability rock like shale will also inﬂuence the pore pressure, due to
a larger thermal expansion coefﬁcient for the ﬂuid than for the solid parts of the rock. Thus,
cooling reduces the pore pressure, which in general improves stability. Rock properties
(strength, stiffness) may be altered as a result of temperature changes: Normally strength
and stiffness will increase with decreasing temperature. Finally, mud properties are also
temperature dependent: Cooling the mud will lead to a slight mud density increase due
to thermal contraction, again resulting in improvement of stability with respect to hole
collapse conditions.

Note that if one drills into a reservoir that is cooled by waterﬂooding, the in situ stresses
may have been altered in a way that makes mud loss and fracturing more likely than un-
der initial normal temperature conditions. Field evidence for this phenomenon is given by
Hettema et al. (2004).

9.3.3. Creep

When discussing time dependent borehole stability, it is obvious that creep may cause a
borehole to collapse with time. Since creep tests are complicated and time-consuming,
there are very few reliable tests of this kind in the literature. It is however general knowl-
edge that a material that is brought above its yield point, may creep to failure. Translating
to the borehole situation, this means that if the mud weight is kept marginally above the
lower limit for long enough time, the borehole may collapse as a result of creep. The risk
of high (accelerating) creep rates increases with increasing temperature. Although truly
constant stress conditions over time never occur during drilling, the intrinsic time depen-
dent properties of the formation may still have an inﬂuence on stability. In practice, this is

INTERACTION BETWEEN SHALE AND DRILLING FLUID

323

difﬁcult to distinguish from other time dependent effects, like consolidation, thermal and
chemical effects.

9.4. Interaction between shale and drilling ﬂuid

In the previous section, three sources of time dependent borehole stability were considered:
Consolidation, mud cooling, and creep. One more mechanism will be discussed in this
section, namely chemical interaction between the drilling ﬂuid and the formation. This is
however not just a source of time delayed hole collapse, but may be used to improve shale
stability, in particular in cases where instabilities occur in shales with high contents of
swelling clay minerals.

It is often observed that oil-based mud gives better stability than water-based mud. To
start out, let us consider the (somewhat academic) example of drilling with pure oil (or
another ﬂuid that is completely non-wetting to the shale). The capillary pressure for oil (or
other non-wetting ﬂuid) in contact with a water-wet shale is:

pcp = 2γ

r

(9.13)
Here γ is the surface tension; γoil–water = 50 · 10
−3 N/m. r is the pore size, which in
shale typically is 10 nm. From that we ﬁnd the capillary entry pressure for pure oil to enter
a water-saturated shale to be ∼10 MPa. Thus, an overbalance of 10 MPa is required for
oil (or another non-wetting ﬂuid with similar surface tension) to penetrate into intact shale.
This means that for lower mud overbalance, the borehole wall will remain impermeable,
and the t = 0 stability will prevail.
Oil-based muds usually give better hole stability than water-based muds, but the latter
are preferred for environmental reasons. Oil-based muds are however not pure oils. They
contain a water phase, and the chemistry of the water phase has an inﬂuence on the hole
stability. Various mud additives have been introduced in water-based systems to help main-
tain impermeable borehole wall conditions over time (see Section 9.3.1):
• Sodium silicate (van Oort et al., 1996).
• Long-chained molecules (glycol; polymers etc.) that are thought to build molecular
ﬁlter cakes on shale surface (see e.g. Twynam et al. (1994) and Reid et al. (1995)).

The operational experience with such systems is too limited to draw any ﬁrm conclusion

at this stage.

We shall now discuss chemical mechanisms that may lead to interaction between shale
and drilling ﬂuid. Let us ﬁrst consider osmosis. The basis for osmosis is the existence of a
semi-permeable membrane that permits water molecules to pass but prevents ions to enter
the shale. The membrane may be thought of in two different ways:

1. Oil-based mud may act as a semi-permeable membrane. Ions associated with salts

are prevented to move between the water phase of the mud and the formation.

2. The shale is often regarded as a semi-permeable membrane when contacted by water-
based mud. Because the clay minerals have surface charge, the movement of ions is
thought to be hampered, giving rise to membrane properties.

STABILITY DURING DRILLING

The osmotic potential Π (from e.g. Marine and Fritz, 1981) is:

Π = RT

Vw

ln

aw,df
aw,sh

(9.14)

Here R is the molar gas constant (8.31 J/(mol K)), and Vw is the molar volume of water
(0.018 l/mol). aw,df is the chemical activity of water in the drilling ﬂuid, and aw,sh is the
chemical activity of pore water in the shale. The activity denotes the effective concentration
of water in a solution, so that aw = 1 for fresh water, while aw < 1 for salt water. For
ideal solutions, activity is directly given by the salt concentration. For non-ideal solutions
with approximately 0.1 M salt concentration, the difference between activity and water
concentration may be 10–50%, depending on type of ion (Mahan, 1975).

Mody and Hale (1993) implemented osmotic theory into a rock mechanics model for
borehole stability. They added the osmotic potential through a stress term equivalent to the
poroelastic contribution seen in Eqs. (4.58)–(4.60):

Adding salt to the drilling ﬂuid so that aw,df < aw,sh sets up an osmotic potential
Π < 0, which will tend to drive water out of the shale and hence acts as an effective
pore pressure reduction. This has an instantaneous stabilizing effect on the borehole.

It is well established that ions do move through shale (e.g. Ballard et al., 1994). This
means that the osmotic membrane is leaky, which is handled by introducing a membrane
efﬁciency σ < 1. The membrane efﬁciency reduces the osmotic potential:

Π = σ

RT

Vw

ln

aw,df
aw,sh

(9.18)

The membrane efﬁciency depends on ionic diffusivity, and will hence in general de-
pend both on clay type and on the type of ions present in the drilling ﬂuid (for more
elaborate analysis, see Marine and Fritz, 1981; Bailey et al., 1991; Sherwood, 1994;
Heidug and Wong, 1996; Lomba et al., 2000a, 2000b; Sherwood and Craster, 2000). Exper-
iments (Chenevert, 1970; van Oort et al., 1996; Ewy and Stankovich, 2002; Schackelford
et al., 2003; and others) seem to indicate that for shales σ is in the range 0.05–0.30. The
osmotic potential may however still be several MPa, which means that reducing drilling
ﬂuid activity by adding salt may improve borehole stability signiﬁcantly, at least during
the initial phase. The effect will however, due to membrane leakiness, decay with time af-
ter drillout. In case of very low activity drilling ﬂuid, one may expect damage as a result of
reduced tangential and/or axial stresses at the borehole wall.

There is also experimental evidence that ionic exchange may occur within the shale
when it is exposed to brine (Steiger, 1982; Denis et al., 1991; Horsrud et al., 1998). In par-
ticular, exposure of smectite-rich shale to KCl causes signiﬁcant shrinkage (Fig. 9.7), even
when the potassium concentration is so small that osmotic swelling would be expected.
The rate of exchange depends on the ion concentration, whereas the maximum shrinkage

5 MPa, and at 80 °C (from Horsrud et al., 1998).

depends on the amount of available sites in the shale; i.e. on the diffusing ion type, and
on the amount of swelling clay minerals and their exchange capacity. Physically, shrink-
age happens because the potassium ion ﬁts more easily into the clay mineral crystal lattice
than the sodium ion, which is the dominant native ion in shales. The chemically induced
shrinkage strain can be looked at in analogy with the thermal cooling effect. This means
that it may be modelled similarly; see Eqs. (4.69)–(4.71):

σr = pw
σθ = 2σh − pw − Efr
1 − νfr
σz = σv − Efr
1 − νfr

(9.19)

(9.20)

(9.21)

Ionic exchange affects shale properties as well. Apparently, KCl exposure enhances plas-
ticity, which is beneﬁcial for borehole stability. The shrinkage effect leads to improved
stability with respect to the lower mud weight limit, but if the chemical strain is high, ten-
sile or shear failure may be induced. To what extent this may trigger instabilities is not
yet known. There are indications from the literature that ionic exchange effects may also
be important for other ions than potassium, and that the type of anion also plays a role
(Carminati et al., 1999; Sønstebø and Holt, 2001).

9.5. Borehole stability analysis for well design: Incorporating effects

of nonlinear elasticity, plasticity and rock anisotropy

In practical situations, boreholes are often found to be more stable than predicted by sim-
ple linearly elastic theory and perfectly brittle failure mechanics analysis, as used in the
previous sections. There may be a number of reasons for this, which we will discuss fur-
ther below. Let us however have in mind that a fundamental challenge in borehole stability

326

STABILITY DURING DRILLING

analysis is to deﬁne failure in practical terms. The driller is only concerned with stability
problems that interfere with the drilling operation. Rock fragments breaking loose from
the borehole wall, or a minor reduction in the wellbore diameter due to plastic ﬂow, is not
necessarily equivalent to drilling problems. Guenot (1990) pointed out the need for a new
“failure criterion” which can account for these practical aspects.

Such a criterion has to bridge ﬁeld experience with fundamental rock mechanics knowl-
edge. The industry learns from previous failures, and may use their experience in future
drilling operations. The approach may be purely empirical, but in order to have predictive
power, it must at some stage line up with rock mechanics analysis. What we can do, with
rock mechanics as our main tool, is to reﬁne the theory to deal in a better way with the
shortcomings identiﬁed in the ﬁeld.

As said above, initiation of failure is not necessarily going to lead to a borehole stabil-
ity problem. However; the brittle failure theory that we have used, predicts instability as
soon as the Mohr–Coulomb criterion is violated at the borehole wall. The calculations of
minimum well pressure (minimum mud weight) thus implicitly assume that the rock loses
its entire load bearing capacity once the Mohr–Coulomb limit is reached. The estimated
minimum mud weight is therefore likely to be too low. A simple way to try to compensate
for this is to increase the rock strength with a “fudge factor” > 1 which is calibrated on
basis of ﬁeld experience, and then use the analytical approach that was presented in the
preceding sections.

Alternatively, which is of course more satisfactory from the theoretical viewpoint, the
rock mechanics models may be improved to describe the constitutive behaviour of the
rock in a more correct manner. One obvious modiﬁcation is to account for the post-failure
behaviour of the rock. Strong rocks tend to be more brittle, with little ability to deform
and carry load after the peak stress has been passed. The brittleness tends to decrease with
increasing conﬁning pressure. Weaker rocks are normally more ductile, i.e. they have larger
ability to deform and carry load beyond their elastic limit. The brittle-ductile transition
depends on the stress level. Reaching peak stress is of course more critical if the rock
is brittle. If the rock is ductile, then the failure limit may be exceeded without dramatic
operational consequences.

To take care of the factors discussed above, models incorporating plasticity and/or non-
linear elasticity must be applied. This represents no fundamental problem, but makes the
calculations more cumbersome, especially for deviated holes. When plasticity effects are
taken into consideration, this gives rise to a so-called plastic zone near the borehole wall
(as outlined in Chapter 4). This is a weakened zone, but shields the rock beyond and to
some extent improves stability. The stability limit is set either as an upper limit to the plas-
tic deformation, or to the extent of the plastic zone. This gives results that are numerically
more realistic for the actual well failure situation than the simple elastic model. Such a
failure criterion has however to be speciﬁed on the basis of experience; be it from ﬁeld
operations, or controlled hollow cylinder failure tests performed in the laboratory.

Santarelli and Brown (1987) incorporated a pressure-dependent elastic modulus into the
analytical model for borehole failure. Triaxial testing shows that the elastic modulus tends
to increase with the conﬁning pressure (see also Chapter 4). With this model, much of the
discrepancy between a linear elastic model and results from hollow cylinder tests could be
accounted for. It can also explain why failure can occur at some distance behind the wall,

BOREHOLE STABILITY ANALYSIS FOR WELL DESIGN

327

and not at the wellbore wall surface where the stress concentration should be maximum
according to constant-modulus theory.

We have based our borehole stability analysis on the Mohr–Coulomb criterion for shear
failure. This has many advantages, including the fact that analytical calculations are fa-
cilitated. The Mohr–Coulomb criterion does however not account for the experimentally
observed effect of the intermediate principal stress on rock strength. The stress state in the
vicinity of the borehole wall is true triaxial, and this can be accounted for by using failure
criteria that depend on the intermediate principal stress, like the Drucker–Prager criterion;
see Chapter 2), or the Mogi–Coulomb approach (Al-Ajmi and Zimmerman, 2006).

When more complex material models are used, more extensive rock characterization
is also required. This is often difﬁcult due to lack of core material. In addition, the rock
properties can change signiﬁcantly over short distances. One should therefore in each case
consider whether using more complex models is worthwhile. This should not prevent the
use of such models for studying phenomenological problems and for sensitivity analyses.
One aspect of borehole stability not considered in the analysis presented so far is the
role of rock anisotropy. Shale is normally anisotropic due to textural alignment of clay
minerals (Chapter 3), and therefore exhibits anisotropic strength, stiffness, and permeabil-
ity. Combining the weak plane model for rock strength (Section 2.9) with the borehole
failure criterion, one may incorporate the effect of strength anisotropy in the modelling of
hole collapse.

Fig. 9.8 shows an example of such a calculation, using the same input parameters as
in the isotropic stress case displayed in Fig. 9.5, except that the shale strength and friction
angle both are reduced in the horizontal plane. The result is a signiﬁcantly reduced stability
with respect to collapse for inclinations above 30°. For this particular case, stable drilling
becomes impossible with further increase in hole angle, since the mud weight correspond-

ing to the collapse limit rapidly exceeds the fracture gradient (given by the minimum in
situ stress). By adding plasticity, the stability is signiﬁcantly improved. One should how-
ever be aware that buckling of bedded shale when drilling along or near the symmetry
plane (Økland and Cook, 1998) may be an additional cause of instability not caught by the
analysis presented here.

Fig. 9.9 sketches the procedure of complete borehole stability analysis. The input data
required are rock properties, earth stresses and pore pressure, plus the planned hole trajec-
tory. For a simple analysis, only parameters listed in the ﬁrst row of boxes are required. For
a more advanced level of sophistication, chemical, thermal, plastic, anisotropic and time
dependent features are added. In most cases the effects are simply added by superimposing
poroelastic, thermoelastic and osmotic contributions to the borehole stresses. This may be
satisfactory for most purposes, but implies that coupling between chemical and thermal
processes are neglected.

The result of the analysis is the mud weight window; i.e. the minimum well pressure
permitted to prevent hole collapse (or ﬂuid inﬂux) and the maximum well pressure per-
mitted to prevent loss of ﬂuid to the formation by ﬂow into existing or induced fractures.
When these limits are known, the well may be designed.

Well design is of course more than a question of borehole stability. The purpose of the
well is to reach a certain target to ensure optimum drainage of a reservoir or reservoir zone.
The suggested hole trajectory required to reach the target then has to be evaluated in order
to see if it is drillable, and then the drilling process has to be optimized to reduce costs by
drilling fast, and by using as few casing strings as possible. At large depths, this is crucial:
The number of casing strings has to be kept low, since the casing diameter decreases for
each new string.

Fig. 9.10 illustrates the role of wellbore stability analysis in well design. Because it is
not possible to drill the entire section shown with one mud weight, a casing has to be set

the lower part. This illustrates the two main tools available to drill stable boreholes: The
mud weight and the casing program.

9.6. Use of pressure gradients

9.6.1. Introduction

So far we have largely used pressure in our stability calculations. However, since this has to
be related to a mud weight or mud density, it is customary to convert the different pressures
at a given depth to a density value. This is often referred to as an equivalent mud weight
or a pressure gradient. Note that the term gradient is not entirely correct, since it is not the
slope of the pressure curve at a given depth, but rather a secant value from surface to the

330

given depth, i.e.

STABILITY DURING DRILLING

ρ = p

gD

(9.22)

where p is the pressure at depth D, g is the acceleration of gravity and ρ is the equivalent
mud weight or pressure gradient. Common units for ρ is g/cm3 or SG (speciﬁc gravity
relative to water).

In SI-units we have

ρ(SG) =

p (MPa)

0.00981D (m)

(9.23)

Any relevant stress or pressure parameter, e.g. pore pressure, horizontal stress, overburden
stress and fracture pressure may be represented as a gradient, as exempliﬁed in Fig. 9.10.

9.6.2. Depth reference and depth corrections

The use of Eq. (9.22) introduces the need of a depth reference level, i.e. a surface reference
level. Since the well pressure gradient is related to the mud column, it is natural to use the
same depth when calculating the other pressure gradients. The surface reference level will
then obviously be the drill ﬂoor or rotary table (RT), i.e. the top of the mud column. When
drilling an onshore well it is then quite clear that D is essentially measured from the earth
surface. When drilling an offshore well, D is however made up of several depth elements:

D = Dformation + Dwater + Dairgap

(9.24)

where Dairgap is the air gap or the height from the sea to the drill ﬂoor, Dwater is the water
depth and Dformation is the formation depth (from the sea ﬂoor to the depth of investigation).
When comparing gradients from different wells in a ﬁeld it is therefore essential to keep
track of the reference depth. In the exploration phase the variation in Dairgap is normally
small (typically less than 5 m), as these wells are normally drilled from semisubmersible
rigs with Dairgap typically ranging from 23 to 28 m.

Dairgap in production wells depends on how the ﬁeld is developed. If a ﬁxed platform
is installed, Dairgap may be signiﬁcantly larger. Thus there is a need to be able to convert
from one drill ﬂoor level to another. The pressure at the same depth underground must be
the same, so that

ρ1gD1 = ρ2gD2

where the subscripts represent different reference levels. This yields

ρ2 = ρ1

D1
D2

To avoid keeping track of different rig ﬂoor elevations, it is convenient to use a more
general reference level for the different pressure gradients, e.g. the mean sea level (MSL).
This is a convenient approach when collecting and comparing data from different drilling
rigs, data that will be the basis of a model that is going to be used for planning of production
drilling from a platform.

Having established the different pressure gradients used as input for a stability analysis,
one must always refer back to the same reference level as the mud column (the rotary
table). When planning a speciﬁc well one must therefore remember to convert back to a
depth that includes the air gap (Dairgap) of that speciﬁc well.

9.7. Beyond simple stability analysis

9.7.1. Field cases: The borehole stability problem in complex geology

In this paragraph we will present a few ﬁeld cases from the literature, which illustrate how
rock mechanics analysis can be applied to borehole stability problems.

Case 1: Drilling-induced lateral shifts along pre-existing fractures (Meillon St. Faust
Field, France)

The Meillon St. Faust is a gas ﬁeld, located in the southwest of France. For a more de-
tailed description, the reader is referred to Maury and Zurdo (1996). Severe casing failures
occurred in a fault zone above the reservoir during early gas production. These failures
could be interpreted by migration of gas or water from abnormally pressured zones at
depth through damaged cement and into uphole faults or bedding joints. This increased
pore pressure led to reduced effective normal stress on the faults, which triggered shear
displacement and thus casing collapse.

It is likely that pressure increase in pre-existing fractured rock mass may also cause
stuck pipe situations during drilling by a similar mechanism (Santarelli et al., 1992). If the
well is drilled with too high overbalance (like in high pressure cycles during surge-swab;
see further below), and the mud does not create an efﬁcient cake towards the fracture, then
pressure may build up in the fractures, and the normal effective stress decreases, leading
to shear displacements that may reach a few cm. There are cases where tight hole occurred
with no indication of cavings, and where the problem could not be solved by mud weight
increase. Other symptoms of this failure mode is that tight hole problems occur at the same
depth, together with problems to run in and pull out of hole, abnormal localized torques,
deviation of trajectories, and possible drillstring failures. The remedies to solve problems
of this kind are to keep the mud weight low (but still above the collapse criterion for the
intact rock), and to increase the sealing capacity of the mud. In the ﬁeld case reported here,
this was done by adding asphalt-type products associated with inert colloidal particles.

Case 2: Drilling in a complex geological setting with high tectonic stresses (Cusiana
Field, Colombia)

The Cusiana ﬁeld is located in the foothills of the Andes Mountains in Colombia. Major
borehole stability problems (amounting to several millions of dollars per well) have been
encountered (a brief summary was published by Last et al. (1996); see also Willson et al.
(1999)). They report hole enlargement as the cause of the majority of problems, resulting

332

STABILITY DURING DRILLING

in large amounts of cavings, hole cleaning and stuck pipe, poor cementing and necessary
side-trackings. The most difﬁcult formation was an alternating sand-shale sequence, where
mud losses and tight hole occurred in the sandy and hole enlargements in the shaly units. It
was found that increasing the mud weight to limit hole enlargements did not work, because
it led to signiﬁcant mud losses.

A borehole stability task force established by the operator acquired a large amount of
data. Stress measurements were done, downhole borehole images and 4-arm caliper data
were collected, shale core tests were performed in addition to characterization and moni-
toring of cavings at surface and MWD surveys. An important result was the determination
of the in situ stress state, which proved the maximum principal stress to be (sub-) horizontal
and much larger than the vertical stress, and the minimum principal stress to be horizontal
(parallel to the mountains) and much smaller than the vertical stress. In addition, the sand-
shale sequence mentioned above turned out to be fractured throughout the entire ﬁeld. It
was concluded that borehole mechanical instabilities occurred as a result of shear failure
in weak fractured siltstones and shales, and that lost circulation occurred when the mud
pressure exceeded the minimum (horizontal) stress. Further, mud invasion contributed to
weakening of the fractured rock (by the same mechanism as explained in the preceding
paragraph). An important consequence of these mechanisms was that the permitted mud
weight window was shrinking to zero, since the minimum mud weight in the shale sections
exceeded the lost circulation threshold in the sands. The challenge was then not to ﬁnd a
way to drill a stable hole, but rather to ﬁnd a way to drill a hole that is inherently unstable.
Compromises were made by using mud weights that were too high for the sands and too
low for the shales, and then try to manage the instabilities by efﬁcient drilling practices.
This included improvement of mud sealing capacity and optimization of hole cleaning,
and having lost circulation pills available in case of loss in the sands. The bit was permit-
ted to seek its own trajectory where possible, and drilling was performed as smooth and
fast (minimizing reaming, back-reaming and vibrations, increasing bit life) as possible. In
addition, hole conditions (including caving rates) were carefully monitored.

Case 3: The Heidrun Field, Norwegian Sea

The Heidrun ﬁeld offshore Mid-Norway experienced persistent hole stability problems in
Tertiary shale formations. A high KCl content drilling ﬂuid was used, in order to handle
possible reactive clay formations above the reservoir. The majority of the wells are ex-
tended reach wells with inclination angles in the range 55°–70°. The problems manifested
themselves mainly as cavings, pack-offs and lost circulation, and were handled by increas-
ing the mud weight. This did however in several cases not reduce the caving production
problem. The details of this case are reported by Stjern et al. (2000).

The operator expected the drilling problems to occur mainly in a low-density and high
porosity zone. Extensive data collection was performed, including logging (6-arm caliper,
sonic and density, temperature), shale coring and laboratory testing, and sampling and
measurements of sonic velocities on cuttings. In addition, the stress ﬁeld was evaluated
using extended leak-off tests.

As a result of the systematic data collection, it was found that the problem zone was
not the originally assumed low-density zone, but rather a normal density but fractured

BEYOND SIMPLE STABILITY ANALYSIS

333

zone. This led to the conclusion, like in the preceding cases, that the mud density could be
reduced. At the same time, the salt concentration in the mud was reduced, which apparently
also improved stability. It was also concluded that hole cleaning had to be optimized by
using low viscosity mud and provide close to turbulent ﬂow. The authors point out that the
borehole stability study performed has given a cost reduction of close to 2.5 million dollars
per well in pure saving on ﬂat time during drilling.

9.7.2. Drilling in depleted reservoirs

A particularly difﬁcult situation is inﬁll drilling in depleted reservoirs, where the pore
pressure may still be the initial one in shale zones, or in the cap rock right above. This is due
to the very low permeability of shales, which means that the time required to establish pore
pressure equilibrium in a shale zone of tens of metre thickness may be several years, and
easily may exceed reservoir lifetime. In the permeable reservoir zones, the reduced pore
pressure is established almost instantaneously (except for possible undepleted pockets).
Thus, the high pore pressure in the shale requires that the mud weight is kept above the
initial collapse limit to avoid shale instabilities. In neighbouring reservoir sand zones, this
mud weight may be too high, since the reduced pore pressure also has caused reduced
horizontal stresses (reduced fracture gradient, see Chapter 12). Thus, drilling with initial
mud weight may lead to mud losses. Normally one does not know while drilling which
zones are depleted and which zones are at original pore pressure: This requires a coupling
to reservoir management and reservoir monitoring by e.g. time-lapse (4D) seismics.

9.7.3. Drilling below deep water

When drilling below deep water, the water depth contributes to reducing both the hole col-
lapse and the fracturing gradients. The well pressure is given by Eq. (9.1), where the total
depth includes water depth from the top of the mud column (neglecting the air gap). This
means that the critical mud density ρw,crit for hole collapse as well as for fracturing will be
given by the corresponding critical mud densities in absence of water (ρ0
w,crit) and by the
water depth (Dwater) and the depth measured from the sea-ﬂoor (Dformation) as follows:

ρw,crit = ρ0

(9.27)

w,critDformation + ρwaterDwater

Dformation + Dwater

As can be seen from this equation and from Fig. 9.11, a main effect of the water is to
shrink the mud weight window at shallow depth within the formation. At the sea ﬂoor
(Dformation = 0) there is no mud weight window, since both the upper and lower limits are
given by the water density (effective stresses are = 0). At shallow depth below the sea-
ﬂoor, the effect of water depth still dominates, so that both the upper and lower mud weight
limits are lower than they would have been if drilling took place onshore, or in shallow
water. The consequences of instability in deep water are however much more severe.

A potential solution to the drilling problems is so-called dual gradient or dual density
drilling. The basic idea is to use only seawater above the seaﬂoor, and the heavier mud

334

sea-ﬂoor in case of deep water.

from the seaﬂoor and down into the formations. This is achieved by using a separate mud
lift system to take care of the return mud and cuttings from the borehole.

In some areas, a special drilling problem known as shallow water ﬂow (Alberty et
al., 1997; Furlow, 1998) has occurred, with high resulting costs. This problem occurs in
uncemented and overpressured sands, so the main cause of the sand collapse is an underbal-
anced situation. This problem is as such more related to sand production (see Chapter 10).

9.7.4. Surge and swab effects

When the drill string is pulled out or run into the hole, this will cause cyclic loading of
the rock near the borehole. The string acts as a piston in the hole because the mud cannot
ﬂow without restriction, and hence the well pressure changes. How large this effect will
be, depends on the tripping speed and the mud viscosity. Bourgoyne et al. (1986) have
presented equations needed to calculate this effect.

The effects of cyclic loading on boreholes in shale have not been studied in detail. One

may foresee the following effects:

1. The failure stress is directly exceeded on a low pressure cycle. The duration and
magnitude of the low pressure cycle will inﬂuence the severity of the failure. This
could apply both to pressure cycles causing failure in underbalance or shear failure
in overbalance.

2. Even when the well pressure oscillates within the failure limits, the delayed pore
pressure response could lead to an increased failure tendency from cycle to cycle.
Although initially within its failure limits, the borehole may fail due to pore pressure
increase near the borehole wall.

3. Stress cycling may also lead to rock fatigue, depending on the amplitude and the

number of cycles.

9.7.5. Hole cleaning

As mentioned in Section 9.1, hole cleaning and borehole stability problems may often be
difﬁcult to distinguish from each other. Hole cleaning problems may be caused by borehole
instabilities, leading to production of noticeable amounts of cavings. Formation fragments
(both cuttings and cavings) will tend to accumulate in hole enlargements, because of re-
duced ﬂow rate in such places. These fragments may fall or migrate back into the hole,
especially when pumps are stopped. This will cause restrictions in the mud ﬂow and may
also stick the drill string if the fragments are large enough. The depth where the string gets
stuck may thus be in gauge sections below the unstable zone, and not at the depth of fail-
ure. We have seen above that although increasing the mud weight appears to be the most
obvious solution, this may in practice not always be recommendable.

High rheology mud (high viscosity; high yield point (YP)) together with high annular
velocities (AV) has in general been accepted as the correct philosophy for cleaning of near-
vertical wells. Cleaning high angle wells is, however, not straightforward, and the same
philosophy does not readily apply to this situation. Shaw and Sutherland (1988) report
the use of low-viscosity sweeps (using sea-water) together with frequent wiper trips of
varying length as an appropriate approach in deviated wells. Seawater goes into turbulence
at lower velocity than normal mud, thus picking up cuttings at lower annular velocity. This
also minimizes hole washouts in weaker formations. In large diameter holes, larger drill
pipe has been used, allowing higher ﬂow rate with the same injection pressure. Of course,
a problem here may be that low mud weight is detrimental to borehole stability.

Both experimental studies and ﬁeld experience indicate (e.g. Sewell and Billingsley,
2002) that hole cleaning problems are most severe around intermediate inclination angles
(40°–60°). It is important to minimize caving production due to borehole instability. If that
problem can be overcome, hole cleaning can be satisfactorily obtained by using appropri-
ate operational procedures. Essentials here are: mud rheology, casing programme, string
rotation, ﬂow rate and general drilling practices. Use of low/high viscosity pills should
be considered with respect to the effect on the equivalent circulation density (ECD), the
effects on surge/swab pressures, and eventually the effect on borehole stability.

9.7.6. Amount and quality of input data

There is an increasing number of reported examples of practical application of stability
predictions to ﬁeld cases. In addition to those reported above (Section 9.7.1), some ap-
propriate references are Maury and Sauzay (1987), Fuh et al. (1988), McLean and Addis
(1990), Fleming et al. (1990) and Woodland (1990). Almost all examples show that in prac-
tical use, it is difﬁcult to acquire the data needed to perform an analysis with sophisticated
models. This is probably the reason why most analyses are still based on linear elastic the-
ory. The user should however be aware of the limitations given by the elastic analysis and
be able to evaluate the importance of these in relation to the rock type, its strain character-
istics etc. Given the limitations of the model and the available data, one possible approach
is to calibrate the model with ﬁeld results.

The input data required for borehole stability analysis are shown in Fig. 9.9. These
include earth stresses, pore pressure, and rock properties. When a well is drilled in an un-

336

STABILITY DURING DRILLING

explored area, there is virtually no information available that may permit estimation of the
required parameters. From regional geological knowledge, seismic data, and experienced
trends of variation in rock parameters and stresses with depth, it may still be possible to es-
tablish a ﬁrst guess of the stability limits. When a few wells are drilled, additional sources
of information also become available, and one may try to design a ﬁeld scale mechanical
earth model. Clearly, the more data are collected; the better will be the quality of the stabil-
ity prediction. Data collection is however time consuming and expensive, and the possible
gain is often not considered during ﬁeld planning. Ideally, cores should be taken, and the
failure envelope determined experimentally. For shales, this requires tedious tests, like the
CU triaxial tests described in Chapter 7. Furthermore, extended leak off tests (Chapters 8
and 11) should be performed so that the horizontal stress ﬁeld (including orientation) is
known. Finally, pore pressure needs to be estimated, which is very difﬁcult in shale sec-
tions. One has to rely on identiﬁcation of abnormal pressures by studying deviations from
expected trends in MWD or log data. The accuracy of the existing pore pressure prediction
procedures may be questioned. High pore pressures ahead of the bit may in principle be
identiﬁed from seismic or sonic while drilling measurements. This is however currently
emerging technology.

If less than required data are available, borehole stability analysis needs to be based on
educated parameter guessing. For this purpose, systematic analysis of available core and
log data may be used to establish correlations between mechanical properties and more
easily measurable index properties. For instance; shale strength shows good correlation to
porosity, to sonic wave velocities, and to hardness by indentation (Horsrud, 2001; see also
Chapter 3). To obtain these parameters, one may use drill cuttings or caving fragments
for more rapid—possibly rig-site—measurements (Santarelli et al., 1998; Nes et al., 1998)
and estimation of shale strength. Held together with drilling parameters and pressure while
drilling (PWD) measurements, and fed into an appropriate model, better estimates of the
mud weight limits for borehole stability may be obtained in quasi-real time.

Solids production

341

When hydrocarbons are produced from a reservoir, solid particles sometimes follow the
reservoir ﬂuid into the well. This unintended byproduct of the hydrocarbon production is
called solids production.

The amount of solids produced can vary from a few grams per cubic metre of reservoir
ﬂuid, which usually represents a minor problem, to catastrophic amounts possibly leading
to complete ﬁlling of the borehole. It is estimated that seventy percent of the world’s hy-
drocarbon reserves are contained in reservoirs where solids production is likely to become
a problem at some point in time. The problem is most pronounced in sand reservoirs, hence
sand production has attracted most attention. However, it may also be a problem in chalk
and coal reservoirs.

There is a large variation in the way solids production has been handled—from not con-
sidering it as a problem at all, to not accepting anything but insigniﬁcant amounts of solids.
The latter attitude has been spurred by the observation that sand production may result in
serious accidents. However, methods to control solids production involves additional costs
and usually results in reduced production, so that in later years a more relaxed tolerance for
solids production is sometimes considered. When dealing with heavy oil, solids production
is even deliberately provoked in some cases.

We shall here ﬁrst take a look at some operational aspects related to solids production.
Mechanisms that may cause sand production are then described, followed by discussions
on how to predict sand production. Chalk production is discussed more brieﬂy—which
reﬂects that the public literature is rather limited on this subject.

10.1. Operational aspects of solids production

10.1.1. Consequences of solids production

Solids production causes a series of problems to the petroleum production. The main types
of problems are:

1. Erosion of the production equipment. This is primarily a safety problem, as well as an
economical one. It is also a typical sand production problem, due to the abrasiveness
of the quartz grains. The erosion caused by a given amount of sand depends strongly
on the velocity of the ﬂuid in the pipeline; typically the amount of eroded material
is proportional to (velocity)n, where n is a number between 2 and 3 (Haugen et al.,
1995). Consequently, the amount of acceptable sand production is much smaller for
a gas well—where the ﬂuid velocity is high—than for an oil well.

342

SOLIDS PRODUCTION

2. Instability of the production cavities and the wellbore itself, which may in extreme
cases result in a complete ﬁlling of the borehole (“sand up”) so that the well has to
be abandoned.

3. The necessity to handle large amounts of polluted solids at the rig.

On the other hand, solids production sometimes has the positive effect that it enhances
the productivity of the well (Geilikman et al., 1994). In a production technique known as
CHOPS (Cold Heavy Oil Production with Sand) solids production is actually encouraged,
since the heavy oil is otherwise very hard to produce (Geilikman and Dusseault, 1997;
Dusseault and El-Sayed, 2000).

10.1.2. Well completion and solids control

After a well has been drilled, it is prepared for hydrocarbon production. This process is
called completion. Completion methods which do not involve speciﬁc equipment to prevent
or reduce the consequences of solids production are called natural (or barefoot) comple-
tions. Instead, the potential for solids production is carefully evaluated prior to completion,
and care is taken to stay within the limits of solids free production. Natural completion is
cheap and attractive since it does not impair the productivity of the well. However, the
required restrictions on the production in order to avoid solids may prevent economical
production. The use of special equipment in order to prevent solids from being released
from the formation, or to prevent produced solids from following the hydrocarbon ﬂow to
the surface, is called active solids control.

Well completion can be done in many different ways. We shall here restrict our attention

to the most common ones.

The hole may be left open, without casing and cement, which allows the hydrocarbons
to ﬂow freely into the well through the wellbore wall. The inﬂow area is equal to the
circumference of the borehole times the length of the open hole section within the reservoir.
This simple completion technique requires that the formation is relatively strong and stable.
If not, some support for the borehole wall can be obtained by placing gravel in the hole
(gravel packing). The hydrocarbons are then produced through the gravel, which may also
act as a ﬁlter for produced solids. Screens, which are ﬁnely meshed metal nets placed in the
open hole, may alternatively be used as ﬁlters. The use of screens or gravel packs increases
the completion costs and reduces the productivity of the well. Clogging of these ﬁlters
may also be a problem. Other methods for solids control include chemical consolidation—
where the formation is strengthened by a resin injected into the rock.

In weak formations, casing is usually set and cemented to the formation in order to
stabilize the borehole. The casing is then perforated in the reservoir zones, so that the
hydrocarbons can ﬂow into the well (Fig. 10.1). Each perforation is created by a charge
ﬁred through the casing into the formation. This typically generates a cylindrical hole, 1–
2 cm in diameter and 20–50 cm long. The size and shape of the perforations may however
vary considerably with the type of charge used, the formation properties, and the well
pressure relative to the pore pressure in the formation at the time the perforation is created.
It is normally recommended to perforate in underbalance (that is, the well pressure is
lower than the pore pressure—typically a few MPa) in order to clean up the perforations

and to avoid too large reduction of the near-well permeability. Too large underbalance
during the perforation operation may however result in a rapid growth of the perforation
cavities. The inﬂow area for a perforated zone is equal to the surface area (circumference
times length) of each perforation, times the number of perforations, which is usually in the
order of 10–40 per metre. Gravel packs may also be used in cased and perforated holes, as
ﬁlters for produced solids.

A third alternative for well completion is to generate a fracture from the well into the for-
mation, and to ﬁll the fracture with proppants. This technique, called frac packing, creates
a highly permeable slit in the formation, through which the hydrocarbons can be produced.
The technique is particularly useful in low permeability formations, as the effective inﬂow
area can become very large. It is also used in weak formations, as the large inﬂow area
allows for production with smaller pressure gradients and correspondingly lower risk for
sand production. Frac packing is extensively used in some regions (like the Gulf of Mex-
ico), while the use is limited in other regions, partly due to the costs involved, and partly
due to the risk and uncertainty involved in the fracturing operation.

10.2. Sand

Observations of sand production can be classiﬁed in three types:

1. Transient sand production, where a burst of sand is followed by a continuous produc-
tion of sand with declining rate under constant conditions. Transient sand production
is frequently observed right after a perforation job, after a change in the production
conditions (usually a reduction in the well pressure), and after water breakthrough.

2. Continuous sand production, where sand is continuously produced at a relatively

constant rate.

3. Catastrophic sand production, where sand is produced at such a high rate that the

well is choked.

344

SOLIDS PRODUCTION

Continuous sand production, even only a few grams per m3, may add up to amounts in
the order of hundreds of kilos per metre of the well after several years of production. The
removal of such amounts of sand obviously changes the size and shape of the producing
cavities. For instance, perforations that are initially formed more or less as separate, cylin-
drical holes (Fig. 10.1), may eventually merge and form larger cavities behind the casing.

10.2.1. Necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for sand production

It is generally accepted that sand production can not occur from intact rock, even if it is
poorly consolidated, since a ﬂowing ﬂuid does not normally provide sufﬁcient force to
pull sand grains out of an intact rock. This is illustrated by a model example in the next
section. Sand production may thus occur only if the rock in the vicinity of the producing
cavity is unconsolidated, or has been damaged. Such damage may be caused by the stress
concentrations that occur around open holes in a stressed rock, as described in Chapter 4.
Onset of sand production is therefore closely related to stress induced damage of the rock.
Criteria for failure of the rock around production cavities are discussed in Section 10.2.3.
Although unconsolidated or damaged rock is a necessary condition for sand production,
it is not necessarily a sufﬁcient condition. Post failure stabilization of a production cavity
may occur after some initial sand production, due to for instance a change in the cavity
shape or increased permeability in the damaged region. It has also been shown that dam-
aged rock may sometimes form stable sand arches that allow for sand free production at
signiﬁcantly higher drawdowns than the rock failure conditions indicate. Criteria describ-
ing the stability of sand arches are described in Section 10.2.4. When the conditions exceed
the stability limit for the sand arches, sand will deﬁnitively be produced into the well.

Monitoring of sand production is usually based on measurements or observations at
the surface. However, the produced sand will only reach the surface if the well ﬂow is
sufﬁciently strong to carry the sand grains all the way up through the well. Thus, sand
transport in the well is also a signiﬁcant part of the sand production problem, however that
part will only be discussed brieﬂy here (Section 10.2.6).

Prevention of sand production problems is most effective if it is done or planned during
well completion. Thus it is essential to be able to predict possible sanding problems before
the well completion starts. To an increasing extent, this also involves prediction of the rate
of produced sand in the cases where sand free production is unachievable or economically
unfavourable. A model describing sand rate is described in Section 10.2.5, while sand
prediction is discussed in Section 10.2.7.

10.2.2. Forces on a sand grain

Consider a sand grain of diameter dg squeezed in between its neighbouring grains at the
wall of a cylindrical cavity, as illustrated schematically in Fig. 10.2. The force Fr that
is needed to remove the grain can be estimated as the sum of the shear forces needed to
induce shear failure in the four contact planes at the side of the grain, (given by for instance
the Mohr–Coulomb criterion) plus the force needed to induce tensile failure in the contact

(cid:2)

The hydrodynamic forces pulling on the grain are caused by the ﬂuid ﬂowing through
the rock. An estimate of the forces can be obtained as follows: The force F acting on a
volume element of the rock due to a ﬂuid ﬂowing through it is F = −Apf, where A is
the cross-sectional area through which the ﬂuid is ﬂowing, x is the length of the volume
element, and pf is the pore pressure drop over x. From Darcy’s law (Eq. (1.229)) we
derive that F = −Apf = (ηf/ k)Qx. An expression for the permeability k of a porous
rock is given by the Kozeny–Carman equation (Carman, 1956; see also Dullien, 1992; an
alternative version of this equation is given in Eq. (12.63)):

The number N of grains in this volume element is roughly given as the volume of solid
material in the element which is (1− φ)Ax, divided by the volume of one grain which is

(As the grain we are considering is placed at the surface of the rock, we might alternatively

(1997), is somewhat different, however the following conclusion is the same. See also
Vardoulakis, 2004.)
Fig. 10.3 compares the forces on a grain in a very weak rock (S0 = 1 MPa). It is assumed
that the grain is only attached by cohesional forces (which is probably the case for some
of the grains). The ﬁgure shows that the hydrodynamic forces Fh increase with the ﬂuid

ﬂux Q/A, however for the typical range shown here, they remain for the most part several
orders of magnitude smaller than the force Fr needed to pull the grain away. Thus, the
hydrodynamic forces are not able to destroy a competent rock and induce failure on their
own. The major role for the hydrodynamic forces is to remove grains from unconsolidated
or damaged rock, and to transport loose material into the well.

10.2.3. Critical drawdown for cylindrical cavities

As the ﬂuid ﬂow is normally not able to destroy the rock and induce sand production, a nec-
essary condition for sand production is that the rock is unconsolidated or has been damaged
by some other mechanism. Such damage is usually caused by the effective stresses in the
vicinity of the producing cavity. These depend on several factors, in particular the far-ﬁeld
in situ stresses, the pore pressure, and the geometry of the producing cavity. Since the stress
ﬁeld around a cavity is not homogeneous, the effective stresses in the vicinity of the cavity
may also depend on the rock properties.

We shall in this paragraph take a look at the criteria for sand failure around a producing
opening, caused by the in situ stresses. We shall restrict our attention to cylindrical holes—
which may be seen as representative for a perforation or an open hole (that is, a well with
no casing), and to (semi-)spherical holes—which may represent a perforation after some
sand has been produced. A semispherical hole may also represent the tip of a cylindrical
perforation.

SAND

347

When working with production, it is often convenient to use drawdown rather than well
pressure to describe the pressure conditions in the well. Drawdown pd is deﬁned as the
difference between the pore pressure pfo far from the well and the well pressure pw, that is

pd = pfo − pw

(10.4)

When the well pressure has been reduced so much that the well starts to produce sand, we
have reached the critical drawdown pc
d for sand production in the well. Some expressions
for the critical drawdown are derived and discussed in this paragraph.

Shear failure

The condition for shear failure at the wall of a cylindrical hole can be derived from ex-
pressions for the stresses at the cavity wall combined with a failure criterion, as shown in
Chapter 4.
(cid:2)
Consider ﬁrst the simple case where the stress (σ
h) is isotropic. During production, the
pore pressure at the cavity wall is pf(Rc) = pw, the smallest principal stress is σr (Rc) =
pw, and the largest principal stress is (see Eq. (4.118))
σθ (Rc) = 2σh − pw − 1 − 2νfr
1 − νfr
σθ (Rc) − pf(Rc) = C0 −(cid:13)

Failure according to the Mohr–Coulomb failure criterion, Eq. (2.22), requires that

Solution of these equations in terms of pw gives us the lower well pressure limit (pw,min)
where failure is initiated.

d for the cavity is deﬁned as

Assuming that the rock is sufﬁciently soft so that the Biot constant α ≈ 1, the solution of
Eqs. (10.5) and (10.6) can be expressed as:

Here we have introduced σ
Eq. (10.8) is essentially the same as Eq. (4.120), only that the failure condition is expressed
in terms of pc

d rather than pw,min.

Fig. 10.4 illustrates the shear failure criterion Eq. (10.8) graphically. Although it is based
on a very simpliﬁed model, the picture is qualitatively in agreement with observations. It
shows that a minimum formation strength is required in order to prevent failure of the rock
during production. It also shows that the critical drawdown depends on the effective stress
far from the well, in such a way that pc
d is reduced when the reservoir is depleted, that is
when pfo is reduced. This implies that the probability for sand production increases as the
reservoir is being produced under constant drawdown.

Consider next a situation where the principal in situ stresses are all different. The stabil-
ity of the producing cavity (whether it is an open hole or a perforation) now depends on

the orientation of the cavity relative to the in situ stresses. The stresses at the cavity wall
for a non-ﬂow situation can be obtained from Eqs. (4.76)–(4.88), while Eq. (4.59) tells us
to subtract (pfo − pw)((1− 2νfr)/(1− νfr))α from the tangential stress in order to account
for the pore pressure gradient. Introducing these expressions into a failure criterion, for
instance the Mohr–Coulomb criterion (2.22), assuming that α ≈ 1, and following the same
procedure as described in Chapter 4, we obtain the critical drawdown for any orientation
of the cavity.

In general, the result can not be expressed on an explicit form. However, if the cavity is

parallel to one of the principal in situ stress directions, the result may be written as:

one to use at any time. Note however that criterion (10.11) is unlikely to be the relevant
one except for rather special stress conditions, and that this criterion has no relevance if
(cid:2)
νfr (cid:3) 0 (except for the situation that C0 < σ

As a rule of thumb, we can say that stress anisotropy in the plane normal to the cavity
axis reduces the critical drawdown. Consider as an example a vertical well in a formation
where σv > σH > σh. For a cavity parallel to σH (inclination i = 90°, azimuth a = 0) we
have according to Eq. (10.9)

(10.14)
We see that pc
d is largest for the cavity parallel to σh, which has the smallest stress
anisotropy in the plane normal to the cavity axis. Thus, from a vertical well it is preferable
to orient the perforations parallel to σh in order to obtain the largest critical drawdown.
Furthermore, Eqs. (10.9) and (10.10) tell us that from a horizontal well parallel to σh it
is preferable to perforate vertically, provided that σv > σH. The examples are plotted in
Fig. 10.5.

A complicating factor considering the stability of perforations is that the presence of the
well itself disturbs the stress ﬁeld at the perforation. Note in particular that the perfora-
tions we identiﬁed as the most preferable ones in order to obtain largest critical drawdown
for the vertical well (Fig. 10.5) are positioned in the parts of the borehole wall where we
may expect to ﬁnd breakouts around the well, if the conditions for such failure have been
fulﬁlled at some stage (see Section 4.5.3). If we have reasons to believe that such break-
outs have been formed, the perforations should preferably be placed outside the breakout
sectors.

In addition, the presence of other nearby cavities may affect the stress ﬁeld to some
extent and reduce the stability of a perforation. A minimum distance between perforations
is therefore recommended.

In Chapter 4 it was shown that plastic deformation of the rock tends to stabilize a hole,
so that it can take larger loads than the purely elastic solutions predict. To see how this
affects the critical drawdown, we assume that the material behaves according to a linear
elastic/perfectly plastic model as described in Chapter 4, and that failure occurs when the
plastic strain λ reaches a critical limit λc. Although this model is obviously a simpliﬁcation
of the true rock behaviour, it captures fairly well the characteristics of soft rocks. Based on

Fig. 10.5. Examples of preferred orientation for perforations, in a formation where σv > σH > σh. Perforations

expression (4.162) for λ, and the assumption that λc is so small that we can ignore higher

Note that Eq. (10.15) does not become exactly equal to Eq. (10.8) when λc = 0. This is
because Eq. (10.8) is based on the Mohr–Coulomb criterion, while Eq. (10.15) is based on
the Tresca criterion.

We may combine the results obtained above into a generalized equation for critical draw-

(10.17)

where A1 is a non-dimensional parameter depending on the Poisson’s ratio and the failure
criterion, while A2 is a parameter with the dimension of stress, depending on the plasticity
of the rock. In practice A1 and A2 may be empirical constants. It has been shown (van den
Hoek et al., 2000a, 2000b, 2000c) that A2 also depends on the size of the cavity. Due to
the increasing difﬁculty in rotating sand grains at the cavity wall for larger grain diameter-
to-cavity diameter ratios, the smaller cavities can take larger plastic strains before failing,
and therefore A2 is larger for the smaller cavities.

An alternative approach is to apply strength data from thick-walled cylinder tests (TWC)
rather than the unconﬁned compressive strength (C0) in the critical drawdown criterion.
The philosophy of this approach is that nonlinear elasticity and plasticity are implicitly
included in the TWC results (Veeken et al., 1991). The critical drawdown can still be
computed from Eq. (10.17), with the modiﬁcation that
→ sCTWC

cavity were given. From these results, in combination with the Mohr–Coulomb failure

This expression corresponds to Eq. (10.8) for a cylindrical cavity. Both expressions are
illustrated graphically in Fig. 10.6. We see that the spherical cavity is more stable than
the cylindrical cavity, which tells us that the cylindrical shape typically created by the
perforation charge need not be the most stable one. Thus it is possible for a cavity that
starts to produce sand at a given drawdown, to obtain a more stable shape and eventually
stop producing sand at this drawdown level. This is one possible explanation for a typi-
cal observation of transient sand production, where sand production is initiated when the
drawdown is increased, and subsequently stops when the drawdown has been kept constant
for a while.

Tensile failure

Another possible failure mode is tensile failure. At the cavity wall, the radial stress and
the pore pressure are both equal to the well pressure, which implies that the effective ra-
dial stress is zero at the cavity wall. If the pore pressure gradient is larger than the radial
stress gradient at the cavity wall, the effective radial stress will become negative, and the
condition for tensile failure may be fulﬁlled at some point inside the wall. Thus, a mini-
mum criterion for tensile failure to occur is that the pore pressure gradient is larger than
the radial stress gradient at the cavity wall, that is

If the tensile strength is larger than zero, this criterion may not be sufﬁcient for tensile
failure to occur.

where Rc is the radius of the cavity. The critical drawdown pressure gradient gc

the largest possible normalized drawdown pressure gradient without sand failure, thus

Again we consider the simple case of a cylindrical cavity in a formation where the stress

By combining Eqs. (4.62) and (10.22) we may ﬁnd an expression for gpn during stable
production. The results shows that it is highly unlikely that gpn will reach the critical limit
(10.23).

Van den Hoek et al. (2000a) concluded—based on modelling accounting for strain lo-
calization and grain rotations—that tensile failure may only occur in small holes like
perforations, not in open holes. The reason for this is that shear failure will always pre-
cede tensile failure for a large cavity like an open hole. Due to the size effect, a small
cavity like a perforation has a much higher threshold for shear failure, hence tensile fail-
ure may occur ﬁrst, however even for small cavities it will only just precede shear failure.
Van den Hoek et al. (2000a) found support for their conclusion in laboratory experiments
showing no correlation between the (non-)occurrence of sand production and the ﬂow rate
(which controls the pore pressure gradient).

However, in a transient period when pw is reduced, the pore pressure gradient at the
cavity wall can be much larger. During start-up of the production the well pressure is
lowered, and the pore pressure gradient at the cavity wall will be signiﬁcantly larger for
a period until stable conditions are established. Thus there may be a critical rate for well
pressure reduction in order to prevent sand production in the start-up period (Santarelli,
1994).

To ﬁnd an expression for the critical well pressure reduction rate, we need to consider
the pore pressure distribution around the cavity, which is given by the pressure diffusion
equation

= CD∇2pf

∂pf
∂t

(10.25)

CD is the diffusion constant (see Eq. (1.241)). The boundary conditions are given by pw
and pfo. A complete solution of this equation is somewhat complicated. However, for the
situation where the ﬂuid pressure at the cavity wall is changed abruptly from pfo to pw at
time t = 0, a rough approximation for the transient time range 0 < t < R2
c /CD is given
by

Here we have introduced the approximate expression (1.246) for the diffusion con-
stant CD. Note that the critical value for to is proportional to the inverse of the permeability,
hence the lower the permeability is, the longer the start-up period should be in order to
avoid stability problems. The critical value for to is also proportional to R2
c , hence this
problem is more of a concern for open holes than for perforations.

We now have two criteria, one related to drawdown (Eqs. (10.8)–(10.15)) and one re-
lated to the pore pressure gradient which limit the range for sand free production. The
conditions are illustrated graphically in Fig. 10.7. This ﬁgure is an elementary version of a
sand production stability diagram (Morita et al., 1989a, 1989b).

In addition to the failure mechanisms discussed above, a different mechanism has been
observed in laboratory tests on sandstones with porosity above 20 per cent. This mecha-
nism involves the formation of a slitlike failure zone that grows from the tip of the initial
shear failure zone (Fig. 10.8). The growth of such a failure zone may be explained as fol-
lows: At the tip of the slit the material fails in compression (see Chapter 2). If the material
is contractant, which may be the case for high porosity rocks, the failed material takes up

less space than it did before failure. The failed material is therefore only loosely attached
and may easily be washed away by the ﬂowing ﬂuid. When the failed material is washed
away, the condition for such failure is maintained at the tip of the slit. The slit may there-
fore grow rapidly, resulting in signiﬁcant sand production. The formation of such slitlike
failure zones has been associated with compaction bands, which are zones of localized
compactive failure (Haimson and Kovacich, 2003). The importance of this mechanism in
ﬁeld situations is however still unclear.

The formation of a stable, yet continuously growing “wormhole”, may take place under
special conditions, for instance at the interface between soft sand and a shale layer (van
den Hoek et al., 2000c). This mechanism implies improved productivity and reduced sand
production, however it can only take place in the presence of a stronger, supporting rock.

10.2.4. Stability and collapse of sand arches

Observations have shown that it is possible to maintain stable sand arches while producing
from unconsolidated sand (Hall and Harrisberger, 1970; Bratli and Risnes, 1981). Sand
arches may be formed when damaged rock or loose sand is pushed towards a small opening
like the perforated holes in the casing. Highly damaged rock which is still able to form a
stable structure around a cavity—possibly assisted by capillary forces—also represents a
sand arch.

Eventually, even the sand arches may fail, however. Sand production in the form of
collapse of thin inner shells around cavities in wet, unconsolidated sand was observed by
Bratli and Risnes (1981). They concluded that the sand production was initiated when
the criterion for tensile failure, Eq. (10.21), was fulﬁlled at the cavity wall. We shall here
outline the derivation of Bratli and Risnes for a spherical cavity. The model they studied is
shown schematically in Fig. 10.9.

Although the partial saturation gives the sand a ﬁnite cohesion (see Section 2.6.2) the
material surrounding the cavity can be considered to be in a plastiﬁed state. The radial
stress gradient can be derived from one of the equations of equilibrium in spherical coor-
dinates (Eq. (4.167)) giving

We further assume that the yield criterion is deﬁned by the Mohr–Coulomb criterion, which
implies that the radial and tangential stresses are related by (Eq. (2.22)):

σθ − pf = C0 + (σr − pf) tan2 β
At the cavity wall, pf = pw = σr, thus according to Eq. (10.31)

σθ − σr = C0

Combining Eqs. (10.30) and (10.32), we have at the cavity wall

By introducing Eq. (10.33) into Eq. (10.23) we ﬁnd that the critical pressure gradient gc

This is essentially the Bratli and Risnes’ (1981) stability criterion.

The corresponding criterion for a cylindrical cavity is (Risnes et al., 1982)

which again shows that spherical cavities are more stable than cylindrical ones.

Eq. (10.34) is often expressed in terms of drawdown rather than ﬂow rate. This is a valid
approach in a situation with stable production, as drawdown and pore pressure gradient are
then closely related. By combining Eq. (4.178) with Eqs. (10.22) and (10.4), we ﬁnd that
Eq. (10.34) can be expressed as

This is the critical drawdown for tensile failure of a spherical sand arch under stable pro-
duction. The right part of Eq. (10.36) is derived from the relation between cohesion, friction

356

SOLIDS PRODUCTION

angle and unconﬁned strength (Eq. (2.21)), and has been included since this form of the
criterion is frequently used.

Note the line of arguments used in the derivation of Eq. (10.34) (and Eq. (10.36)): First,
the material near the cavity is assumed to be in a plastiﬁed state due to shear failure. Next,
sand production is provoked by tensile failure of the plastiﬁed material at the cavity wall.
Thus, Eq. (10.36) describes the stability limit for a spherical sand arch, formed by plas-
tiﬁed rock. Beyond this limit, sand will be produced. Note that Eq. (10.20), which predicts
a lower critical drawdown than Eq. (10.36), only describes the onset of shear failure for
a spherical cavity surrounded by intact rock. Beyond that limit, sand may be produced
from a cavity of this shape, since rock failure is a necessary, but not necessarily sufﬁcient
requirement for sand production.

For a gas producing cavity, the pore pressure distribution is somewhat different since
gas is a highly compressible ﬂuid. This affects the pore pressure gradient at the cavity wall,
and hence it also affects the critical drawdown. Weingarten and Perkins (1995) derived a
generalized version of Eq. (10.36) which includes the effect of ﬂuid compressibility. The
generalized equation can only be expressed on implicit form:

(10.37)

The exponent m speciﬁes the relation between the ﬂuid density and the ﬂuid pressure:

ρf = γpm

f

(10.38)

where the gas density coefﬁcient γ is a constant. For an incompressible ﬂuid, which we
here can assume for water or oil, m = 0 and Eq. (10.37) reduces to Eq. (10.36). For an
ideal gas, m = 1 and Eq. (10.37) becomes

(cid:29)

= 2C0 + pfo −

pc
d

+ p2

fo

4C2
0

(10.39)

We notice that ﬂuid compressibility reduces the critical drawdown.

The expressions above are based on the assumption that the ﬂuid ﬂow is following
Darcy’s law (Eq. (1.229)). This assumption do not hold for ﬂow into high rate gas wells,
due to the high ﬂow rates. Ong et al. (2000) derived an expression corresponding to
Eqs. (10.36) and (10.37) for non-Darcy ﬂow. The somewhat complicated expression is
shown in Appendix D.4.1. It is found that non-Darcy ﬂow reduces pc
d signiﬁcantly, hence
it can be overly optimistic to neglect the inﬂuence of this effect in high rate gas wells.

Note that the in situ stresses do not appear at all in the stability criteria for sand arches
(Eqs. (10.34) and following). This is due to the plastiﬁed state of the material, which re-
laxes the stresses near the cavity wall. Although the in situ stresses are still important for
inducing plastiﬁcation, they obviously play a less important role for the onset of sand pro-
duction according to these criteria than shear failure criteria like Eq. (10.17) indicate. For
wells in HPHT reservoirs, this difference could be signiﬁcant, as the conventional models
based on shear failure alone tend to be overly conservative in their estimates of the onset
of sanding under such conditions (Vaziri et al., 2002).

SAND

The impact of water

357

The sand in a hydrocarbon reservoir will normally be partly water saturated and waterwet-
ting, while the remaining pore space is ﬁlled with hydrocarbons. This implies that the sand
will have an additional cohesion due to capillary forces, as described in Chapter 2. Thus,
even unconsolidated sand reservoirs may have sufﬁcient strength to build stable arches and
resist the drag forces of the ﬂowing ﬂuid.

Water breakthrough into a well changes the water saturation of the rock near the well.
This tends to reduce the capillary forces and thereby also the strength of the partially
water-saturated reservoir sand. Consequently, the conditions for sand failure may become
fulﬁlled. This may explain the common observation that sand production accompanies wa-
ter breakthrough (Morita et al., 1989b).

It has been claimed, however (Skjærstein et al., 1997), that sand production following
water breakthrough is typically a temporary problem, and that the well may even produce
sand free at a larger drawdown some time after water breakthrough than it did before. Pos-
sible explanations of such observations could be that the water breakthrough only releases
loose sand that has been trapped in the cavities by capillary forces, or that the cavities may
obtain a more stable shape after the production of some sand.

Other observations (Willson et al., 2002) indicate that sand production increases with
water cut up to about 50%, and declines towards the initial (no water) level when the water
cut approaches 100%.

10.2.5. Rate of produced sand

Even when the conditions for sand production are fulﬁlled, the sand may be produced at
such a low rate that it is still acceptable from an operational point of view. It is therefore of
interest to be able to predict not only the conditions for onset of sand production, but also
the rate of sand production given that it occurs.

Based on a qualitative analysis, Morita (1994) stated that the rate of sand production
depends on three factors: (1) how much the well pressure is reduced below the critical
sand production pressure, (2) ﬂuid ﬂow rate and viscosity, and (3) cementation.

Since then, various numerical models have been developed for the prediction of sand
production rate. The topic is still under development, however. We shall here present a
simpliﬁed, analytical model (Fjær et al., 2004) for continuous sand production, based on
a numerical model by Papamichos et al. (2001). The model is describing sand production
from the rock around a cavity that has been brought beyond the onset of sand production.
Consider a volume element of the rock in the vicinity of the cavity. If sand is being pro-
duced from this element, the porosity increases. Mathematically this relation is described
as

∂msand

∂t

= ρs

∂φ

∂t

(10.40)

Here msand represents the (cumulative) mass of the sand being produced per unit volume
of rock, and ρs is the density of the sand grains.

358

SOLIDS PRODUCTION

We now assume that the erosion is driven by the ﬂowing ﬂuid in such a way that the rate
of produced sand ∂msand/∂t is proportional to the hydrodynamic forces (Eq. (10.3)) acting
on the grains. This implies that the rate of produced sand is proportional to ηf(1−φ)φ
−3qﬂ,
where qﬂ = Q/A is the ﬂuid ﬂux. We may also assume that a minimum force is required
in order to uphold the erosion process, hence no sand is produced if the ﬂuid ﬂux is lower
than some critical limit qcr
ﬂ . Thus, we have established a general equation for sand erosion:

The sand production coefﬁcient λsand has the dimension of s/m3. The combination of
Eqs. (10.40) and (10.41) gives us a differential equation for the porosity of the eroding
rock. The solution is a little complicated, so we settle here for the approximate solution

this approximation does not obey the restriction φ (cid:3) 1 for sufﬁciently large values of
t − to, however the process will be truncated before this becomes a problem, as will be
seen below.)

Next, we need to identify the volume of the rock that is in a state where it will produce
sand. Considering a cylindrical cavity, we assume that the rock can be described by a
simple linear elastic/perfectly plastic model as described in Sections 4.6.1 and 10.2.3. The
plastic strain at a point r from the cavity centre can be expressed as (Eq. (4.162)):

The erosional process that gradually increases the porosity of the sand producing zone
will also reduce its ability to carry load. We shall here account for this erosional-mechanical
coupling by simply assuming that the load carrying ability of the zone remains constant
until the porosity has reached a critical value φcr. At that point, the zone collapses and the
remaining solids in the zone are produced in one burst.
The time tcr, from the erosional process starts until φ = φcr and the zone collapses,
can be found from Eq. (10.42) and may be written as:

The inﬂow area A = 2π LRc is the surface area of the cavity, and Q = Aqﬂ is the ﬂuid ﬂow

The collapse of the sand producing zone implies that the radius of the cavity increases,
from Rc to (1 + a)Rc, where a can be found from Eq. (10.45):

The stresses around the cavity are now redistributed, and the situation is the same as it was

and the repeated collapses of the sand producing zone (Eqs. (10.46) and (10.47)), are illus-
trated in Fig. 10.11. It is seen that the predicted sand production is a cyclic process, where

˙Msand has the dimension of kg/s and corresponds to the slope of the dashed curve shown

in Fig. 10.11. This simpliﬁed model reproduces several of the features of sand production
observed in laboratory tests (Papamichos et al., 2001):
• Sand is typically produced in bursts—only on a longer time scale the sand production
appears as continuous.
• The average sand production rate increases with increasing ﬂow rate.
• The average sand production rate increases with increasing drawdown, above the crit-
ical drawdown limit.

We also notice that the model largely conﬁrms the predictions of Morita (1994) (listed
d, (2)Q and ηf

at the beginning of this section) as ˙Msand explicitly depends on (1) pd − pc
(through τs), and (3) C0.

Note that the sand production rate changes with time, since Rc increases as the cavity
wall is eroded away. We may estimate the long term development of ˙Msand by establishing
an expression for the development of Rc.
We assume that the drawdown pd is kept constant. Note that the surface area A =
2π LRc also increases with time. On the other hand, Q which is proportional to A/Rc
(see Eqs. (4.61) and (4.62)) is approximately constant as pd remains constant. By taking
the change in Rc during one erosion cycle—which is Rc = aRc—and divide by the time

The time development of the sand rate ˙Msand is illustrated in Fig. 10.12. It is here as-

sand produced, the model predicts that sand production will appear either as a time lim-
ited event (transient sand production), as a stable process with a relatively constant sand
production rate (continuous sand production), or as an accelerating process reaching dis-
astrous proportions (catastrophic sand production). Note that a—which depends on the
drawdown—affects the time scale, while b—which depends on the ﬂow rate—affects the
total amount of sand produced.

The cumulative amount of sand produced up to a given point in time can be found by
integration of Eq. (10.57). The total amount of sand (MT

Hence the total amount of produced sand depends only on the ﬂow rate. Remember
however that pd > pc
d is still a necessary requirement for sand to be produced at all. Note
in particular that pc
d may increase with time as a result of changing shape of the cavity,
or some other form of post failure stabilization. This slows down the erosion process and
reduces the sand production rate. If pc
d becomes equal to pd at some point in time, the sand
production stops.

There is no known procedure for independent measurement of τs (or of λsand and φcr)
and it is not clear to what extent these parameters depend on for instance cementation. For
practical applications the model therefore needs calibration, either from ﬁeld observations
or from sand production tests in the laboratory.

10.2.6. Sand transport

Sand production in the reservoir zone does not necessarily imply that the sand ultimately
appears at the surface. For this to happen, the ﬂuid ﬂow must be strong enough to wash
the sand up the entire well. Otherwise, the sand will remain in the well, and possibly be
washed out at a later time if the ﬂow rate is increased. This effect complicates the analyses
of sand production in a well: no sand at the surface does not necessarily imply that no
sand is being produced from the reservoir. Similarly, if sand appears at the surface, it may
be difﬁcult to tell whether this sand has just been produced from the reservoir under the
current conditions, or was produced earlier under different conditions.

Sand transport by a ﬂowing ﬂuid is a rather complex problem to describe in general (see
for instance Gerhart et al. (1992), for an introduction to ﬂuid mechanics), and we shall here

SAND

only take a brief look at some basic effects. Consider a spherical grain with diameter dg
and density ρs. Gravity and buoyancy produces a net, downward pointing force Fg on this
particle

Fg = π
6

g (ρs − ρf)g
d3

(10.60)

where g is the acceleration of gravity. In a stationary ﬂuid, this force causes the grain to
sink. As the grain is moving in the ﬂuid, the motion is counteracted by the viscous drag
force Fd, which is given as

Fd = π
8

d2
g ρfU 2Cdr

(10.61)

where U is the velocity of the grain and Cdr is the dimensionless drag coefﬁcient. The drag
coefﬁcient is a (rather complicated) function of the so-called Reynolds number, deﬁned as

Re ≡ dgρf(U/ηf)
(10.62)
where ηf is the ﬂuid viscosity. For values of Re < 105 (typically, for a non-smooth sphere),
(cid:9)
we may use the approximate expression
Cdr ≈ (24/Re)

1 + 0.2Re + 0.0003Re2

(10.63)

For values of Re > 105, Cdr drops to about 0.1.
Eventually, the velocity of the grain will reach a value Ut (called the terminal settling
velocity) where Fd = Fg so that no net force is acting on it, and the velocity will remain
constant. By equating Eqs. (10.60) and (10.61) we ﬁnd that the terminal settling velocity
is given as

(cid:28)

Ut = 2

dgg(ρs − ρf)

3ρfCdr

(10.64)

The ﬂuid’s ability to move the sand is closely linked to the ratio of the velocity of the
ﬂuid to the terminal settling velocity. As an approximation, we may say that the terminal
settling velocity indicates the ﬂow velocity required to move the sand grain along with the
ﬂowing ﬂuid. If the terminal settling velocity is low the grains are easily carried away by
the ﬂuid, while a high terminal settling velocity requires a higher ﬂow velocity to move the
grains.
For sufﬁciently small grains, Re < 1 and the drag coefﬁcient can be approximated by
Cdr ≈ 24/Re. This gives

Ut ≈ d2
g g
18ηf

(ρs − ρf)

(10.65)

This expression is often referred to as Stokes’ law. The general relation between terminal
settling velocity, grain diameter and ﬂuid viscosity—based on Eqs. (10.64) and (10.63)—is
illustrated graphically in Fig. 10.13.

These considerations tell us that larger grains have a much higher terminal settling ve-
locity than smaller grains, and hence the larger grains are more likely to be trapped in the
well. It also shows that low viscosity ﬂuids require a much higher ﬂow velocity to be able

to carry the same amount of sand as compared to high viscosity ﬂuids. As the ﬂow ve-
locity may vary along the well, the conditions for sand transport may also vary. Note that
sand may be trapped at the lower end of the production zone, due to the low ﬂuid velocity
down there. Also note that sand that has been trapped in the well while the ﬂuid veloc-
ity was relatively low, may be mobilized and washed to the surface if the ﬂuid velocity is
increased.

These results clearly show that there is not necessarily a one-to-one relationship between
the amount of sand observed at the surface, and the sand production in the reservoir. This
effect obviously makes it difﬁcult to evaluate the validity of sand prediction, and compli-
cates sand management. It also illustrates the need for reliable downhole sand detectors.

10.2.7. Sand prediction

Prediction of possible sand production is an important part of the development phase for
a sandstone reservoir. Accurate predictions for where and under which conditions sand
production will occur assist in the design of an optimal development plan and completion
strategy for the wells in the reservoir.

Reliable sand prediction requires good, relevant models for sand production, as well as
a complete set of input data for the models. It is a general opinion that the models for sand
production available today are able to predict the onset of sanding with reasonable accu-
racy, while models for predicting the amount of produced sand are still under development.
The relatively simple analytical models for onset of sand production described in Sec-
tion 10.2.3 show that two groups of data are required for sand prediction: rock properties
(primarily strength) and formation conditions (in situ stresses and pore pressure). A com-

CHALK

365

plete foot-by-foot coverage of such data is rarely available however, and simpler tools for
sand prediction are therefore frequently used.

The simplest possible tool is a criterion stating that sand control is not needed below a
certain depth. This critical depth is established from ﬁeld experience, and varies from one
region to another. The criterion may have a physical bearing in that rock strength usually
increases with depth. Other tools relate the critical drawdown directly to the sonic transit
time (compressional, shear, or both), which can be argued for as there is some correlation
between the sonic transit time and rock strength (see Section 8.2.3).

Models based on expressions like Eq. (10.17) may be used once a suitable calibration has
been established for the actual formation, and some estimate of C0 (alternatively CTWC;
cf. Eq. (10.18)) is available.

Some companies use ﬁnite element modelling assuming linear elastic behaviour to ob-
tain a better description of the stress state around the cavities. The predictions from such
modelling may be calibrated with strength data from TWC tests on material from the actual
formation. This technique is based on the philosophy that nonlinear elasticity and plastic-
ity are implicitly included in the TWC results, and that linear elasticity may therefore be
assumed for the ﬁnite element modelling of the stress state around the perforation.

Even more advanced numerical models are based on elasto-plastic modelling, like the
highly recognized sand prediction model of Morita (Morita et al., 1989a, 1989b). The
kinematic hardening model describing the rock (see Raaen, 1998) is quite extensive in this
case, and requires several core tests for calibration.

For prediction of sand volume, additional parameters are needed, and the challenge to
obtain relevant data is even larger. The model described in Section 10.2.5 requires for
instance the sand production coefﬁcient λsand, a parameter that so far can only be derived
from sand production tests (Papamichos et al., 2001). Also the ﬂow rate per cavity (Q) is
seen to be of large importance for the rate of sand production, hence rock permeability and
ﬂuid viscosity are implicitly involved and need to be evaluated.

The choice of parameters is somewhat different among other models for prediction of
sand volume, like the semi-empirical model of Willson et al. (2002), and the coupled nu-
merical model of Chin and Ramos (2002) which links the amount of produced sand directly
to the plastic deformation of the rock. The basic elements of the models appears to be the
same, however.

10.3. Chalk

Solids production can be a serious problem also in chalk reservoirs. The mechanisms
causing chalk production have however not been as well described as those causing sand
production. Prediction and control of chalk production can therefore be more problematic.
In some cases chalk is produced slowly at a relatively constant rate. Massive chalk pro-
duction sometimes occur as sudden, rather unexpected events. In such situations large
amounts of chalk enter into the well, occasionally enough to kill the well. Although the
mechanisms causing these events are not fully understood, it is known that sudden changes
in the well conditions, like quick closure or opening of the ﬂuid ﬂow, may trigger such
instabilities.

366

SOLIDS PRODUCTION

We may expect that the mechanisms believed to cause sand production also could cause
chalk production under corresponding conditions. A couple of effects related to the nature
of chalk versus that of sandstone make the situation somewhat different however. First, the
matrix permeability in chalk is usually quite low, typically of the order 1 milliDarcy. This
may imply that the conditions for tensile failure are more likely to be fulﬁlled for chalk.
However, reservoir chalks are usually extensively fractured. This enhances the effective
permeability while at the same time it implies that the ﬂuid pressure distribution may be
rather complicated on a small scale. It may therefore be questioned whether expressions
like Eqs. (10.24) and (10.29) are valid for chalks. Second, the collapse pressure for high
porosity chalks is quite low so that this type of failure has to be considered in addition to
shear failure and tensile failure. Collapse of the rock surrounding a producing cavity may
have a devastating effect on the productivity of the cavity, even if it does not result in solids
production.

When a rock collapses, the pore volume is largely reduced (see Section 2.4). This in-
duces an abrupt increase in pore pressure which takes some time to dissipate in a low
permeable material as chalk. The result may be a signiﬁcant pore pressure build-up lead-
ing to tensile effective mean stress and liquefaction conditions. This process may explain
observed chalk production in the ﬁeld and in laboratory tests where the chalk is seen to
ﬂow like toothpaste (Raaen and Renlie, 1990; Andersen, 1995; Kristiansen and Meling,
1996).

Papamichos (1998) points out that chalk has a relatively low cohesion, often provided
primarily by capillary forces that exist only when the water saturation is low. Collapse,
with subsequent liquefaction and extensive chalk production may thus be induced by wa-
ter ﬂooding. A numerical model describing this effect was also presented by Papamichos
(1998).

Mechanics of hydraulic fracturing

369

Hydraulic fracturing in rocks takes place when the ﬂuid pressure within the rock exceeds
the smallest principal stress plus the tensile strength of the rock. This results in tensile
failure or splitting of the rock. A hydraulic fracture may be initiated by natural, geological
processes in the earth whereby the ﬂuid pressure increases and/or the smallest principal
stress decreases. Artiﬁcial or man-made hydraulic fractures in petroleum activities are
normally initiated by increasing the ﬂuid pressure in the borehole to the point where the
smallest principal stress at the borehole becomes tensile. Continued pumping at an elevated
pressure causes the formation to split and the fracture will grow in the direction of least
resistance. Some distance away from the borehole the fracture will always propagate in the
direction normal to the smallest principal stress in that speciﬁc formation.

As the least principal stress often is in a horizontal direction, the resulting fractures will
be vertical. If we consider a vertical open hole, the picture will be as indicated in Fig. 11.1.
As the ﬁgure shows, two symmetric fracture wings develop perpendicularly to the least
principal stress.

Hydraulic fracturing has been used commercially as a stimulation technique in the petro-
leum industry since the early ﬁfties. Such fracturing jobs are designed to stimulate produc-
tion from reservoirs with low permeability. This often involves pumping large amounts of
ﬂuid and solids (proppants), thus creating long fractures ﬁlled with proppants. A massive
hydraulic fracturing (MHF) job may exceed one thousand cubic metres of ﬂuid and one
million kilograms of proppant. The fracture thus creates a high-permeability ﬂow channel
towards the wellbore which has a large drainage area towards the low-permeability forma-
tion. If the fracture was not ﬁlled with solid material, it would close when the ﬂuid pressure
drops.

Unintentional fracturing may occur during drilling operations, often referred to as lost
circulation, see also Section 9.1.2. This is a potentially hazardous situation, since the hy-
draulic support of the ﬂuid column in the wellbore is reduced. The wellbore pressure may
drop below the pore pressure in the formation and if the formation is permeable, formation

370

MECHANICS OF HYDRAULIC FRACTURING

ﬂuids may start to ﬂow into the wellbore in an uncontrolled manner. In the worst case, a
blowout can be the result.
Today, hydraulic fracturing has several applications, such as:
• “Frac and pack” operations in weak sandstone reservoirs. These are relatively short
and wide proppant-ﬁlled fractures, designed to penetrate near-well damaged zones
and thus reduce the pressure drop close to the borehole and hence also the sanding
potential of the well.
• Fractures can be created also during water injection in reservoirs. Injectivity may be
reduced with time due to partial plugging of the formation around the injector to
the point where the injection rates can only be maintained if the injection pressure
is raised above the fracture pressure. Fracturing during injection can occur also at
constant injection pressure. This occurs during water injection when the water is con-
sistently colder than the formation. Cooling causes the formation to shrink, thus the
stresses are reduced below the initial fracturing pressure.
• Massive hydraulic fracturing jobs are normally preceded by a fracture test with a small
injection volume (mini-frac) to determine the smallest stress in the formation and thus
the required treating pressure and other design parameters of the fracturing job.
• In drilling operations, leak-off tests are performed to determine the fracture gradient
of the formation below a casing shoe and thus the maximum allowable well pressure
to prevent lost circulation. If a sufﬁciently large volume is pumped, this will create a
small fracture around the borehole.
• An extended leak-off test is essentially a standard leak-off test where pumping contin-
ues long enough to ensure that a fracture is created. By monitoring the shut-in phase
and the ﬂowback phase, the smallest principal stress can be estimated.
• Hydraulic fracturing can be used for subsurface deposition of waste. In the petroleum
industry, reinjection of contaminated drill cuttings is one example. In this application
it is important to have a permeable formation at or somewhere above the injection
point which can act as a recipient and pressure reducer. If this condition is not present,
the pressure will remain high due to very slow leak-off and the fracture created during
injection may eventually penetrate all the way to the surface.

This chapter will discuss basic processes related to hydraulic fracturing, while hydraulic
fracturing applied as a technique for stress determination is discussed further in Chapter 8.
Some aspects of hydraulic fracturing related to borehole stability (lost circulation) is treated
in Chapter 9. Details concerning design, operation and interpretation of hydraulic fractur-
ing for stimulation has been treated extensively in the literature and will not be discussed
further here. The reference list includes some key references also in this ﬁeld.

11.1. Conditions for tensile failure

From a macroscopic point of view, fracturing is related to tensile failure. Generally, when
considering a test specimen of solid material, tensile failure will occur when the traction
exceeds the tensile strength T0. Following the usual convention that stresses are positive in

CONDITIONS FOR TENSILE FAILURE

371

Fig. 11.2. Hydraulic fracturing of a porous and permeable rock.

compression, this condition reads:

σ < −T0

(11.1)

For porous materials the total stress should be replaced by the effective stress, and the

condition will then be:

σ − pf < −T0

(11.2)

where pf is the pressure in the pores. Note that the relevant effective stress coefﬁcient here
is equal to 1, because fracturing is a state of failure for the rock (see Section 1.6.3 and
2.6.1). This will be used throughout this chapter for all fracturing conditions.

For porous materials it is however worthwhile to consider the condition above more in
detail. Assume that we have a plug of porous and permeable material in a triaxial cell as
sketched in Fig. 11.2. The plug is subjected to an external stress σ . The pore pressure pf
can be varied. A conﬁning pressure may be applied, but this will however not affect the
argumentation.

Consider ﬁrst that the grains are cemented to each other and that the plug is glued to
the pistons. Along the dashed lines the bonds are however broken, thus forming a closed
fracture. The force tending to close this fracture will obviously be given by the difference
between the applied pressure σ and the pore pressure pf in the fracture. The condition for
opening of the fracture will thus be:

σ − pf < 0

(11.3)

This condition can of course be reached either by increasing the internal pressure pf
or by reducing the external stress σ . In a short plug like the one indicated in Fig. 11.2
the internal pressure pf will be constant throughout. But if we consider a long plug with
much smaller permeability, the same way of reasoning makes it clear that the pressure pf
in Eq. (11.3) is the pressure in the fracture, not the average pressure in the plug.

Another way of reasoning to obtain the same result is to assume that the two sides of
the fracture are covered by an impermeable ﬁlm, and that a ﬂuid of pressure pf is injected

372

MECHANICS OF HYDRAULIC FRACTURING

between the ﬁlms. The condition for opening of the fracture will be given by Eq. (11.3) as
before. The internal pore pressure in the sample does not play any role as long as it remains
below σ and pf.

Next we may introduce bonding between the grains that were forming the fracture. The
force needed to split the two halves apart will by deﬁnition be given by the tensile strength
T0 and the condition for fracturing will again be like Eq. (11.2):

σ − pf < −T0

(11.4)

pf is the pressure in the fracture or in the pores where the fracture is formed.

In conclusion to this discussion we may say that Eq. (11.4) represents the general cri-
terion for tensile splitting of the material, while Eq. (11.3) represents the criterion for
reopening of existing fractures.

11.2. Fracture initiation and formation breakdown

The basics of borehole failure (in shear and tension) was discussed in Section 4.5, with
which we assume that the reader is familiar.

To illustrate the concepts of fracture initiation and formation breakdown let us consider
the following idealized situation: A vertical borehole penetrates a stress ﬁeld with isotropic
horizontal stresses, i.e. σv > σH = σh. The rock is assumed isotropic and homogeneous,
obeying Hooke’s law of linear elastic behaviour. We for now further assume an imperme-
able borehole wall, implying that the pore pressure in the formation remains constant and
unaffected by the wellbore pressure. As the well pressure pw is increased, the tangential
stress σθ will be reduced correspondingly (Eq. (4.111)), see Fig. 11.3.

The condition for initiation of a hydraulic fracture is thus reached when

σθ − pf = −T0

or

pfrac
w,max

= 2σh − pf + T0

The pressure response in the borehole will then be as illustrated in Fig. 11.4.

FRACTURE INITIATION AND FORMATION BREAKDOWN

373

Fig. 11.4. Idealized borehole pressure response during hydraulic fracturing of a vertical wellbore. Two pressure
cycles are included.

The ﬁrst linear part represents the elastic deformation of the system in and around the
borehole, primarily compression of the ﬂuid in the borehole. The peak represents the frac-
ture initiation condition, i.e. the creation of a vertical fracture on the borehole wall. The
well pressure drops instantaneously at this point. This implies a situation of unstable frac-
ture growth, whereby the volume of the fracture is growing at a higher rate than the rate
of ﬂuid injection. Continued pumping will eventually result in stable fracture growth, rep-
resented by the constant well pressure level. In this idealized case the point of fracture
initiation and formation breakdown are thus identical.

The second curve in Fig. 11.4 shows the response which would occur if a second pres-
sure cycle was run. Then the only resistance to fracture initiation and formation breakdown
would be the stress concentration around the borehole. The tensile strength is now zero,
since the fracture already exists. The difference between the ﬁrst and the second peak
would thus ideally be a direct measure of the tensile strength of the formation. In practice,
however, the presence of the fracture may make the effective stress concentration smaller
in the repeat cycle than in the ﬁrst, meaning that the difference is not only related to the
tensile strength.

If the borehole is assumed to be fully permeable, and the pressurization rate was slow
enough to ensure steady-state conditions during pumping, the tangential stress at the bore-
hole wall is given by Eq. (4.59)

σθ = 2σh − pw − (pfo − pw)

that the pore pressure near the borehole and the well pressure now are equal, the fracture

(11.9)

Eq. (11.6) represents the upper limit for the fracture initiation pressure and Eq. (11.8)
the lower limit for the fracture initiation pressure. The upper limit is often referred to
as the “fast” pressurization limit, and the lower limit as the “slow” pressurization limit
(Detournay and Carbonell, 1997). In a real situation the fracture initiation pressure will
usually be somewhere between these two limits, depending on several factors:
• There may be cracks and ﬂaws at the borehole wall, so that the effective tensile
strength of the rock is essentially zero, even if the tensile strength of the intact forma-
tion may be signiﬁcant.
• There may be some time-dependent transfer of pressure between the wellbore and the
formation. This will depend on the permeability of the formation, the ability of the
fracture ﬂuid to build a ﬁlter cake prior to fracture initiation and also the pump rate.

Considering the effect of pump rate on pore pressure evolution alone, this effect is only
signiﬁcant for very low rock permeabilities and/or if a low-permeability ﬁlter cake is es-
tablished. Detournay and Cheng (1992) showed that for a ﬂuid like water, the permeability
of the rock would have to be lower than 1 µDarcy before any effects of rate would be expe-
rienced. Above this value the rock could be assumed fully permeable, and the lower limit
of fracture initiation would apply (Eq. (11.8)).

In a real situation, the time-pressure curves may be quite different from that shown
in Fig. 11.4. Fig. 11.5 illustrates more general curves. The curve to the left has a distinct
breakdown or initiation pressure, whereas the curve to the right does not. Sometimes a leak-
off point (deﬁned in the ﬁgures, see also Section 8.3.3) is clearly visible before breakdown,
while in other cases there is less difference. The exact reasons for these different features
are not known, but some probable causes may be listed randomly: ﬁlter cake efﬁciency,
plastiﬁcation, stress dependent elastic properties, temperature effects, leakage behind the
casing shoe, etc. Note that the leak-off point is usually interpreted as the deviation from a
straight line. Hence it is difﬁcult to give this point a clear physical meaning, as it may be
affected by all the phenomena listed above.

Let us assume that cracks or fractures exist at the borehole wall such that the inherent
tensile strength of the rock is broken. We further assume that the tangential stress is trans-
mitted across the fracture, but that the well pressure can penetrate into the fracture without
progressing further into the formation. This would require a sealing mud cake around the
fracture. Such a scenario is possible when repressurizing a previously fractured borehole
in a sandstone. Referring to Eq. (11.6) this would give

pw = σh

(11.10)

FRACTURE INITIATION AND FORMATION BREAKDOWN

375

This would hence imply a fracture initiation pressure equal to the smallest horizontal stress.
This situation is however not automatically detectable in the pressure-volume response,
especially if the fractures are small, because there is still resistance to fracture growth
at the tip. It is not until this fracture tip resistance is overcome and the fracture starts to
grow that a deviation from linearity in the pressure-volume response can be observed.
Deviation is most likely to be observed at a lower pressure in a shale than in a sandstone,
as the discussion below explains. This difference between shale and sandstone is however
independent of whether fractures already exist or not.

It has been observed experimentally that a fracture initiated on a borehole wall can grow
signiﬁcantly (several cm) before it becomes unstable (Morita et al., 1996). This is explained
by an internal ﬁlter cake in the fracture which protects the fracture tip from the pressure in
the rest of the fracture. This implies that a certain overpressure in the fracture is required
before the pressure at the tip is large enough to cause breakdown and unstable growth of
the fracture. This behaviour is only possible in a permeable rock like a sandstone, and
can thus explain why there is apparently less difference between fracture initiation and
breakdown in a sandstone than a shale. For this type of behaviour, the slope of the curve
will remain almost constant also after fracture initiation, until ﬂuid is actually beginning
to ﬂow into the fracture. Another factor which can contribute to this apparent difference
between sandstone and shale is the much larger permeability of a sandstone. In a sandstone
a ﬁlter cake is built which helps seal the wellbore wall, and there will be much less effect
of borehole pressurization on the pore pressure near the borehole.

In some cases a distinct breakdown pressure is not observed (see right hand curve in

Fig. 11.5). In that case the fracture growth is stable throughout.

If the horizontal stresses are different, then the stress distribution is modiﬁed. The basic
formulae have been presented in Chapter 4 and will not be repeated here. If we assume
σh to be the smallest principal stress and σH the intermediate principal stress, then the

Fig. 11.5. Realistic borehole pressure response during hydraulic fracturing of a vertical wellbore. The example
to the left has a distinct breakdown pressure, while this is not the case in the example to the right.

376

MECHANICS OF HYDRAULIC FRACTURING

fracture initiation pressure for the impermeable or fast pressurization case in a vertical
well is given as

pfrac
w,max

= 3σh − σH − pf + T0

(11.11)
Note that this expression can be obtained from Eq. (11.6) by simply substituting 2σh by
(3σh− σH). Similarly, the same substitution can be made in Eq. (11.8) to get the expression
for the lower limit of fracture initiation pressure. Since σH by deﬁnition is larger than σh,
this also implies that in this case of anisotropic horizontal stresses the fracture initiation
pressure is lower than if the horizontal stresses are equal.
Consider Eq. (11.9) with ν = 0.5 and a negligible tensile strength. This yields

pfrac
w,max

= σh

(11.12)

Thus the fracture will initiate at a pressure which is equal to the pressure required to propa-
gate the fracture (neglecting any other effects on the fracture propagation pressure). In this
case there will hence be no stress concentration effect around the borehole on the fracture
initiation pressure.

If we again consider the same equation (Eq. (11.9)), but now with the substitution which

reﬂects anisotropic horizontal stresses, the result is

pfrac
w,max

= 3σh − σH

2

(11.13)

(11.14)

or

pfrac
w,max

= σh + σh − σH

2

This simply shows that in this special case the fracture will initiate at a pressure which
is in fact lower than the smallest principal stress in the formation (σh). Thus the fracture
initiation pressure is lower than the propagation pressure, and an increase in the borehole
pressure would be required to make the fracture propagate. Similar effects can be observed
in deviated boreholes, also in formations with isotropic horizontal stresses, since the stress
anisotropy then is induced by the difference between the vertical stress and the horizontal
stress.

Again it should be emphasized that the above expressions are based on idealized con-
ditions. The real fracture initiation pressure will depend on stress conditions, borehole
direction and inclination, rock properties (e.g. tensile strength, permeability), borehole
ﬂuid properties and operational procedures.

11.3. Fracture orientation, growth and conﬁnement

So far we have only considered a vertical hole for which a vertical fracture normal to the
smallest horizontal stress will always be the result when σv > σH > σh. For deviated and
horizontal holes the situation is much more complicated and thus difﬁcult to generalize.

For illustration let us consider a horizontal hole in a stress ﬁeld where σv > σH > σh. In
this situation it is obvious that the fracture initiation pressure depends also on the azimuthal

FRACTURE ORIENTATION, GROWTH AND CONFINEMENT

direction of the borehole. Consider two situations:

1. Borehole parallel with σH: pfrac
2. Borehole parallel with σh: pfrac

w,max

w,max

= 3σh − σv − pf + T0
= 3σH − σv − pf + T0

377

(11.15)

(11.16)

Obviously, the fracture initiation pressure is larger in case 2 than in case 1. The direction
of the fracture relative to the borehole will also be different in the two cases. In case 1
the smallest in situ stress is normal to the borehole, and the fracture will be parallel with
the borehole (Fig. 11.6 left). In case 2 the fracture will hence be normal to the borehole
(Fig. 11.6 right).

In cases where the borehole is not aligned with any of the principal stress directions the
situation is further complicated. This will always be the situation in a deviated borehole
in a vertical/horizontal stress ﬁeld. The fracture will start to grow in the direction of least
resistance and with some type of nonplanar characteristics. This direction may, however,
not coincide with the direction of the smallest principal stress in situ. Hence the fracture
may start to grow in one direction, and then twist to eventually align itself normal to the
smallest in situ principal stress.

In the normal stress regime assumed above, a fracture will always tend to initiate along
the wellbore at the high and low side of the wellbore, even in deviated wellbores drilled
at an angle to the horizontal stresses. Abass et al. (1992) showed experimentally that even
in a horizontal hole along the smallest horizontal stress both a transverse fracture and a
fracture along the wellbore was created, forming a T-shaped fracture. The longitudinal
fracture would however disappear, resulting in propagation of only the transverse fracture.
At intermediate angles, Abass et al. (1992) also found that multiple fractures could form at
the wellbore.

In perforated wells the orientation and density of the perforations may complicate this
picture further, resulting in both multiple fractures and nonplanar geometries. Recommen-
dations for perforation design to obtain successful hydraulic treatments have been given by

Fig. 11.6. Illustration of different fracture directions, parallel to the borehole (left) and normal to the borehole
(right).

MECHANICS OF HYDRAULIC FRACTURING

Fig. 11.7. Well conﬁguration effects on fracture growth: Casing shoe (a); Perforations (b); Gravity (c).

e.g. El Rabaa (1989) and Abass et al. (1992). A theoretical study for prediction of fracture
initiation (pressure, orientation) both in open and perforated holes has been presented by
Hossain et al. (2000).

When one of the horizontal stresses is smallest, the generated fracture will always end
up as a vertical fracture. One can of course also imagine the special situation where the
vertical stress is smallest, and the generated fracture should then be horizontal. This may
be the case in areas of extensive tectonic activity or in areas which have been uplifted
without release of the horizontal stresses. As long as the rock is reasonably homogeneous
and isotropic, a fracture will propagate normal to the least principal stress, whatever that
direction may be. In areas of tectonic activity the principal stresses may be tilted from the
vertical/horizontal direction. Then a fracture will also end up as tilted.

A fracture expanding from a point source in an isotropic rock in a homogeneous stress
ﬁeld will expand equally in all directions in the fracture plane, thus forming a circular or
“penny-shaped” fracture. When a fracture is initiated in a well, the geometry may be modi-
ﬁed by the well conﬁguration, as indicated in Fig. 11.7. There is a tendency for the fractures
to grow upwards as sketched in Fig. 11.7c, as the gravitational stresses are reduced in this
direction.

Although the overburden stress normally increases monotonously with depth, the hor-
izontal stresses may depend also on lithology or type of formation. An investigation by
Warpinski et al. (1985) showed that in shale layers the horizontal stresses could approach
lithostatic stress conditions, while sandstones showed signiﬁcantly lower values of hori-
zontal stress. It should however be noted that lithological differences may occur simply
because of the way a test is performed (see Section 11.5).

This contrast in horizontal stresses is important when considering conﬁnement of frac-
tures in layered formations. Differences in elastic properties and strength may also affect
the propagation of a fracture from one layer to another, but contrasts in in situ stresses are
more efﬁcient.

Fracturing of a sandstone layer with over- and underlying shale formations can be il-
lustrated as in Fig. 11.8. The difference in least horizontal principal stresses is indicated
in part (a) of the ﬁgure. This difference may be large enough to prevent the fracture from
propagating into the shale layers. This will result in a fracture with elliptical wings, as

illustrated in part (b). To extend such a fracture, the walls must be forced outwards, in-
creasing the width of the fracture (c). As the fracture is conﬁned at the top and bottom, this
will result in a more curved fracture wall, and a higher pressure in the fracture is needed to
achieve this. It is a characteristic feature of this type of fracture that the fracture propaga-
tion pressure will increase with fracture length. The pressure required to extend the fracture
can thus conceptually be divided in three parts:

1. Pressure required to keep the fracture open towards the minimum stress.

2. Pressure required to ﬂow ﬂuid through the fracture.

3. Pressure required to overcome the resistance at the fracture tip and thus create new

fracture volume.

or

pe = p(σh) + p(ﬂow) + p(tip)

(11.17)

The ﬁrst term thus represents both the minimum in situ stress and the additional pressure
required to maintain a fracture aperture. For small, narrow fractures with a low viscosity
ﬂuid, the extension pressure will remain reasonably constant. For larger fractures using
viscous ﬂuids (or ﬂuids with proppant), especially the ﬂuid resistance will increase and
thus also the pressure required to propagate the fracture.

For extension of fractures of circular shape, the extension pressure will remain rela-
tively constant. On the other hand, for larger fracturing jobs, the fracture may also become
conﬁned in the vertical direction as illustrated in Fig. 11.8, and the extension pressure in-
creases with fracture growth. The ﬁrst term of Eq. (11.17) will then start to increase, since
the fracture walls are bent outwards and the aperture thus increases. Eventually the exten-
sion pressure becomes larger than the horizontal stress in the conﬁning layers. Then the
fracture will start to penetrate into these high stress regions. Contrasts in in situ stresses
thus represent barriers to fracture propagation, but not in an absolute sense. In the case of
alternate layers of shale and sand, a fracture induced in one layer may break through to an-
other sand formation and extend there. This will result in a complicated fracture geometry.
A still more complicated geometry will result if hydraulic fractures are introduced in
naturally fractured reservoirs (Warpinski and Teufel, 1987). This will result in combina-

tions of opening of existing fractures linked with hydraulically induced fractures, and the
resulting fracture pattern will be extremely difﬁcult to predict.

It is quite obvious that the minimum in situ stress is an important design parameter for
fracture stimulation jobs. Equally important is the understanding of the pressure response
during fracturing. A comprehensive discussion of fracturing pressures has been given by
Nolte (1988a, 1988b). For conﬁned fractures it can be shown that there will be a power law
relation between net fracturing pressure (pe) and time when the injection rate is constant.
The exponent will however be small, between 1/8 and 1/4. In a log–log plot of the net
fracturing pressure versus time, the extension of such a fracture will plot as a straight line.
This is illustrated in Fig. 11.9 (left) as the ﬁrst part of the curve. The second part of the
curve corresponds to extension of a fracture that grows in all directions, also in height. This
type of behaviour could however also be caused by increased ﬂuid loss to the formation.
This pressure level may therefore be regarded as the maximum pressure capacity of the
formation. The third part of the curve would correspond to fracture extension into a low
stress zone, leading to a kind of runaway condition.

In Fig. 11.9 (right) the pressure curve indicates pressure increase above the normal frac-
ture extension pressure. This is often observed in actual fracturing jobs when proppants
are pumped into the fracture. An increasing pressure of approximately unit slope is char-
acteristic of restricted ﬂow into the fracture wings caused by proppant bridging. The effect
could also be caused by excessive ﬂuid viscosity. If one of the wings subsequently becomes
blocked, this will result in a doubling of the log–log slope.

11.4. Fracture size and shape

Modelling of fracture geometry (width, length, height) has been a topic of investigation
for several decades, again primarily in the interest of hydraulic fracturing as a stimulation
technique. Again the reader is referred to other published material for details on this topic
(for a starting point, see e.g. Valkó and Economides (1995) and Gidley et al. (1989)).

FRACTURE SIZE AND SHAPE

381

Fig. 11.10. Illustration of fracture shapes for the PKN and KGD models.

In this section we will only brieﬂy describe some basic principles of fracture geometry
modelling and some analytical expressions which can be used to get estimates of fracture
geometry. The motivation is that when performing stress tests in open boreholes it is also
necessary to know approximately what volume to pump (see Sections 11.5 and 8.3).

Classical analytical modelling of two-dimensional fractures starts with the solution of a
line crack in an inﬁnite elastic plane. Note that already at this point there is a potentially
serious deﬁciency in the model, as fracturing is a failure process which requires that the
material is already outside the elastic regime. Combining this with ﬂuid mechanics for ﬂow
in the fracture and possibly also leak-off to the formation, the principle of mass balance
can be used to derive analytical expressions for fracture length, width and internal fracture
pressure.

The classical models for fracture geometry in two dimensions are the so-called PKN
(Perkins–Kern–Nordgren) and KGD (Kristianovitch–Geertsma–de Klerk) models. Both
these models assume plane strain conditions: the KGD-model assumes strain to be conﬁned
to the horizontal plane, while the PKN-model assumes vertical plane strain. A schematic
illustration of the two models is given in Fig. 11.10. Further assumptions in common for
the two models are:
• The fracture height is constant and independent of the fracture length.
• The net pressure at the fracture tip is zero (again, this assumption is clearly a simpli-
ﬁcation, since a net pressure is required to overcome the tip resistance and make the
fracture propagate).

The applicability of the two models has been a matter of extensive discussion. It is
however generally accepted that the PKN-model is most appropriate for length/height ra-
tios much larger than one, while the KGD-model is most appropriate for small length to
height ratios (less than one). This implies that the PKN-model is more used in conven-
tional hydraulic fracture modelling where the fracture is long compared to the fracture
height. However, for open hole stress tests the fracture is normally short compared to the
height, and hence the KGD-model should give a better approximation.

is in the GPa
range, it is immediately clear from Eq. (11.18) that fracture width is much smaller than
fracture length. The net pressure depends on the ﬂow resistance in the fracture (including
that caused by leak-off to the surrounding formations) and therefore on viscosity and injec-
tion rate. It further depends on the mechanical breakdown processes at the fracture tip. See
e.g. Valkó and Economides (1995) for a comprehensive overview of various approaches to
model this, analytically and numerically. See also Detournay (2004) for a discussion of the
relative importance of ﬂuid (viscous) and fracture tip (mechanical) processes.

The equation for the maximum width in the PKN-model is found by simply substituting

Eq. (11.19) above may hence be used to design the volume required for stress testing in

an open hole below a casing shoe. This principle is explained further in Section 8.3.3.

11.5. Fracture closure

The fracture closure phase is of interest because it provides an opportunity to get an esti-
mate of the smallest principal in situ stress (σ3). If the fracture has penetrated beyond the
inﬂuence zone of the wellbore and into virgin formation, it is clear from the discussion in
Section 11.1 that the fracture will close when the ﬂuid pressure in the fracture equals the
stress acting normal to the fracture (σ3). In most cases it is assumed that this closure stress
equals the smallest horizontal stress in the formation (σh).

However, as we shall see in the next two sections, interpretation of the minimum in
situ stress from fracture closure is not straightforward. This uncertainty in interpretation of
the closure pressure is due to the fact that fracture closure is not instantaneous. Fracture
closure is gradual, from the moment of ﬁrst physical contact between the two fracture faces,
until there is no further deformation of the fracture faces. Tests with downhole tiltmeters
(Warpinski et al., 1998) have indeed shown that the fracture closure process is characterized
by smoothly decreasing deformation, without evidence of well-deﬁned fracture closure.
The minimum in situ stress is of course passed at some point on the pressure decline curve,
but it is not obvious that this point can be accurately determined by recording the pressure
in the wellbore.

FRACTURE CLOSURE

383

Fig. 11.11. Illustration of well pressure versus volume during a ﬂowback test. After Raaen et al. (2001). An open
fracture is indicated to represent the ﬁrst linear part and a closed fracture to represent the ﬁnal linear part.

This can be illustrated further by considering the pressure versus volume during a ﬂow-
back test in Fig. 11.11. The ﬁrst linear part represents the stiffness of the open fracture.
Then there is a gradual transition towards the ﬁnal linear part, representing the stiffness of
the borehole system, i.e. after fracture closure. This transition period is signiﬁcant, span-
ning more than 50 bar. Following the argumentation of Raaen et al. (2001), mechanical
closure is associated with the pressure where the system stiffness starts to deviate from the
ﬁrst linear part. This change in system stiffness must be a result of reduced fracture size,
i.e. the pressure is equal to or less than the smallest principal stress in some part of the
fracture. The transition period thus represents further fracture closure, and eventually there
is no hydraulic communication between the fracture and the wellbore.

As mechanical closure is considered to represent the in situ stress, the interpretation of
the smallest principal stress would be in the upper part of this range. However, there is
still considerable uncertainty related to picking of an exact value for the smallest principal
stress, as the discussion in the next two sections will demonstrate.

11.5.1. Estimation of σ3 from shut-in/decline tests

When the pumps are stopped and the fracture is shut-in, the pressure required for fracture
opening and the pressure required for ﬂuid ﬂow in the fracture immediately drop to zero
(Eq. (11.17)). This implies that the pressure in the fracture is equal to the smallest principal
stress plus whatever additional pressure is left in the fracture. If the viscosity of the fracture
ﬂuid is low (e.g. water) and the fracture is small and unpropped, the additional pressure in
the fracture may be small. This implies that under these conditions the pressure measured
immediately after shut-in is a reasonable approximation to the smallest in situ principal
stress (σ3). This is commonly referred to as the instantaneous shut-in pressure (ISIP).

384

MECHANICS OF HYDRAULIC FRACTURING

Fig. 11.12. Illustration of well pressure response after shut-in.

This situation is illustrated in Fig. 11.12. Shown in this ﬁgure is also the stress where
the surplus pressure has bled off and the fracture is actually closing. This is denoted as the
closure pressure (pc) and is always the best estimate of σ3.

However, the instantaneous shut-in pressure may be signiﬁcantly higher than the closure
pressure. This depends on several factors such as ﬂuid viscosity, leak-off into the formation
and pump rates. The best estimate of σ3 is then obtained by waiting until the fracture
closes. The instantaneous shut-in pressure is thus always an upper bound for the σ3 value,
but the difference between the shut-in pressure and the σ3 value may be signiﬁcant, and
this difference will vary from one test to another. The instantaneous shut-in pressure may
in some cases be difﬁcult to identify on the decline curve, for instance if the rock has very
low permeability, and bleed-off from the fracture to obtain closure thus is extremely slow.
Then it may also be impractical to wait for fracture closure.

Accurate identiﬁcation of the closure pressure may not be easy, since fracture closure
happens gradually rather than instantly. When physical contact between the two fracture
faces is established, the ﬂuid in the fracture may still be free to ﬂow. The two fracture faces
may also have been distorted relative to each other. For the ideal case of instant closure,
there should be a distinct change in the response, indicating the start of rapid pressure drop.
This is caused by the drastic increase of the system stiffness as the fracture closes. The real
response will depend on the nature of the fracture ﬂuid, the permeability of the rock and
the stiffness of the system.

To assist in the interpretation of fracture pressure response, a number of different plotting
methods can be used (square root of time, log time, log pressure vs log time etc.). This
originates from the similarity to pressure transient analysis in reservoir engineering. An
example plotting decline pressure versus square root of shut-in time is shown in Fig. 11.13.
The curve approaches a linear trend as long as the fracture remains open. When the
fracture closes, the pressure curve will depart from this linear trend. The change may be in
either direction depending on fracture and formation properties. If the change is dominated
by the increase in system stiffness, then the slope increases. However, the slope may also

FRACTURE CLOSURE

decrease. This can occur if the fracture pinches off near the wellbore and the leak-off rate
to the formation decreases. This implies that the closure pressure may be difﬁcult to detect
in certain cases.

A number of more or less elaborate methods have been proposed for interpretation of
shut-in/decline data. See e.g. Guo et al. (1993) for an overview of some methods and Nolte
(1989) for an in-depth treatment. Raaen et al. (2001) proposed a method applicable for tests
with mud, where a pressure drop across a tight mud cake may dominate leak-off signature.
In formations with very low permeability (e.g. shales), these classical methods for testing
and interpretation may not be applicable. Leak-off from the fracture will then be too slow
to close the fracture. This implies that the ISIP is poorly deﬁned and/or the time to reach
closure is too long. A pressure decrease may still be observed after shut-in, but this can
also be a result of fracture extension due to energy stored in the fracture. To obtain more
precise estimates of the smallest principal stress, both in shales and more permeable rocks,
a pump-in/ﬂowback test is recommended.

11.5.2. Estimation of σ3 from ﬂowback tests

In a pump-in/ﬂowback test a volume of ﬂuid is injected at fracturing rates. The well is then
allowed to ﬂow back until closure has been detected. A plot of pressure versus time will
show an inﬂection point at the closure pressure. This is the upper inﬂection point shown
in Fig. 11.14. The physical reason for this change is the increase in system stiffness as the
fracture closes.

An alternative interpretation was presented by Shlyapobersky et al. (1988), utilizing the
lower inﬂection point (see Fig. 11.14). This is based on the assumption that mechanical
closure occurs when the fracture storage equals zero.

Plahn et al. (1997) suggest to use the intersection point between two straight lines drawn
through the upper and lower inﬂection points as illustrated in Fig. 11.14. They support

386

this procedure with numerical modelling of the ﬂowback and rebound process, using both
KGD (Khristianovitch–Geertsma–de Klerk) and PKN (Perkins–Kern–Nordgren) fracture
models (Gidley et al., 1989). If the ﬂowback test is idealized to an impermeable rock and
inviscid ﬂuid, the closure pressure corresponds to the intersection of two uniquely deﬁned
lines. In a more realistic case (viscous ﬂuid), a unique point which corresponds to the
closure pressure can not be found. However, they ﬁnd that the intersection point is always
closer to the closure pressure than either of the two inﬂection points.

More recently, an alternative approach was presented by Raaen et al. (2001, 2006). In
this approach the ﬂowed back volume is measured, and the change of system stiffness as
the fracture closures is directly observed. See Section 8.3.3 for further discussion and a
ﬁeld example.

With reference to Fig. 11.14, it is evident that both the methods of Plahn et al. (1997) and
Raaen et al. (2001) provide estimates of the closure pressure which are closer in numerical
value to the upper inﬂection point.

It has traditionally been assumed that it is necessary to have a constant ﬂowback rate in
an appropriate range to be able to get a distinct and interpretable response. However, the
data and interpretations provided by Raaen et al. are based on constant choke setting during
ﬂowback, and they also provide detailed recommendations for the design of such a job.

The pump-in/ﬂowback test may be further extended to include recording of the pressure
after the ﬂowback phase. This phase is sometimes characterized by pressure build-up or
rebound, which may be an indication of near-borehole fracture pinch-off.

When withdrawing ﬂuid from the fracture during ﬂowback, the fracture will tend to close
near the wellbore, isolating the remaining part of the fracture which is still open (Plahn
et al., 1997), especially if ﬂowback is rapid. After ﬂowback, the fracture will continue
to produce back to the wellbore, thus creating this pressure rebound effect. The appear-
ance of a rebound effect has been used to conﬁrm the existence of a fracture (Desroches
and Kurkjian, 1999). It has also been proposed to use the maximum pressure during the
rebound phase as an estimate of the closure stress, especially in impermeable or very

low-permeability formations (Desroches and Kurkjian, 1999). Note, however, that this ex-
perience is based on testing with very small volumes, in packer isolated zones. Such an
approach may not be applicable to testing where the entire hole volume is active.

11.6. Thermal effects on hydraulic fracturing

Thermal effects on hydraulic fracturing were brieﬂy mentioned in the introduction to this
chapter. Thermally induced fracturing is normally observed during water injection, espe-
cially when there is a large temperature difference between the (cold) injection water and
the (hot) reservoir. Typical response is a sudden increase in injectivity after a signiﬁcant
period of stable injection (see e.g. Wright et al., 1991). This reﬂects that the reservoir rock
has been gradually cooled during injection of the cold water. The reservoir rock shrinks
due to cooling, and eventually the smallest in situ stress is reduced to a level below the
bottom hole injection pressure. This results in the creation of a fracture which provides
a much larger contact area with the formation and hence a dramatic increase in injectiv-
ity. The length of the fracture is limited by the extent of the cooled zone. This process is
normally referred to as thermally induced fracturing (TIF).

In the early days of cold water injection this was an unexpected and in some cases
unwanted effect. Today, however, this effect is taken into consideration in the planning
process and is used actively. This possibility has to be designed for with respect to well
placement, pump capacities, ﬂuid displacement pattern etc.

This process differs from conventional hydraulic fracturing jobs in several ways, pri-
marily with respect to the viscosity of the ﬂuid and the time scale of the process. Simul-
taneously, the fracturing pressure is also affected by changes in the pore pressure in the
reservoir. Modelling injectivity is therefore a relatively complex matter which should also
include a number of other factors (damage due to particles in the water, reservoir hetero-
geneities, variation in ﬂuid properties, well interaction etc.). Ideally the modelling of this
process requires a fully coupled fracture and reservoir simulation model (e.g. Clifford,
1989). Simpliﬁed models have however also been introduced, such as the partially de-
coupled model of Settari and Warren (1994) and the analytical approach of Detienne et al.
(1998).

For further details on injectivity modelling the reader is referred to the above and other
references. Here we shall restrict ourselves to a brief look at the purely mechanical aspect
of this problem.

Perkins and Gonzalez (1984) gave analytical expressions for the stress change resulting
from a cylindrical cooled zone of arbitrary height. In the limit of small diameter to height
ratio (d/ h → 0), they found

σr (T ) = σθ (T ) =

E

2(1 − ν)

αT (Tcool − To)

(11.20)

where To represents the initial temperature of the formation, and Tcool is the temperature
of the cooled region.

388

MECHANICS OF HYDRAULIC FRACTURING

For the opposite limiting case (d/ h → ∞) which is applicable to the situation after
some time when the cooled region has grown considerably into the reservoir, the result is

σr (T ) = σθ (T ) = E
1 − ν

αT (Tcool − To)

(11.21)

Note that for this case the stress change is a factor 2 larger. For typical sandstone val-
ues (E = 5 GPa, ν = 0.3, αT = 1.5 · 10
−5/°C) Eq. (11.21) gives a stress change of
0.1 MPa/°C.

Perkins and Gonzalez (1985) considered thermal fracturing, where the presence of the
fracture leads to a non-circular temperature distribution. They modelled this as an elliptical
cooled zone, and, based on numerical modelling, gave approximate analytical expressions
for the stress change in cooled regions as a function of height and ellipticity.

As seen above, the stresses reduce considerably as a result of cooling, thereby facilitating
fracture growth. In addition, depending on the aspect ratio of the ellipse, the stress ﬁeld
orientation may be altered: The reduction in the initially major horizontal stress will be
larger than in the initially minor horizontal stress. Perkins and Gonzalez suggested that
the directions of the principal stresses may ﬂip, leading to possible generation of fractures
orthogonal to the initial ones.

A pore pressure change also inﬂuences the reservoir stresses (see the discussion of the
reservoir stress path in Section 12.2.3). From the correspondence between thermoelasticity
and poroelasticity (see Section 1.6.6)

pf ↔ T
(1 − 2ν)α ↔ EαT

(11.22)
(11.23)

the general expressions of Perkins and Gonzalez (1985) may also be used for a homoge-
neous pressure change within an elliptical region.

Using Eqs. (11.22) and (11.23), and the numbers above, we see that for 5 °C cooling of
the rock, the thermally induced stress reduction is compensated by approximately 1 MPa
increase in the cooled zone pressure. This implies that for certain cases (low thermal ex-
pansion coefﬁcient, low elastic stiffness) the pore pressure induced stress may dominate
over the thermally induced stress (Eltvik et al., 1992).

During injection of a hot or cold ﬂuid, heat transport is primarily by convection. In
addition, thermal conduction to/from over- and underlying formations, and to a smaller
extent, thermal conduction in the direction of ﬂuid movement, contributes.

If thermal conduction can be neglected, a sharp temperature front results. Inside the
front, the temperature is that of the injection ﬂuid, while outside it is the original reservoir
temperature. The position of the front can be estimated from energy balance considerations.

30–50% of the speed of the ﬂuid front.

Reservoir geomechanics

391

The probably best-known examples of rock mechanical effects on reservoir scale behaviour
are reservoir compaction and associated surface subsidence. Operational problems related
to subsidence are environmental concerns, like risk of ﬂooding in land operations, or plat-
form safety concerns in offshore production. A majority of compaction-induced problems
are associated with casing collapse within or adjacent to the compacting reservoir. It is on
the other hand well established that compaction may be a prominent drive mechanism in
relatively soft oil reservoirs.

Pore pressure depletion leads to changes in Earth stresses—not only in effective stress,
but also in the total stresses. These stress changes control not only compaction and sub-
sidence, but may also lead to changes in the ﬂuid ﬂow performance of the reservoir.
Permeability may change, and the directions of preferred ﬂow may be altered. In some
cases, the stress changes within and near the reservoir triggers seismicity during reservoir
depletion. This dynamic nature of petroleum reservoirs also affects the stability of wells to
be drilled and produced during the lifetime of the reservoir. Last but not least, geomechan-
ical alteration of the reservoir and its surroundings may be observed in time-lapse (4D)
seismic surveys. Reservoir geomechanics is thus becoming an increasingly important part
of reservoir management.

12.1. Compaction and subsidence

When oil or gas is produced from a reservoir in the underground, the ﬂuid pressure will
generally decline. Reduced pore pressure in the reservoir rock will increase the effective
stress and thereby cause the rock itself to shrink, and thus the reservoir will compact. Reser-
voir compaction may then in turn cause subsidence at the surface as sketched in Fig. 12.1.

Fig. 12.1. Compaction and subsidence.

392

RESERVOIR GEOMECHANICS

Most oil and gas reservoirs will experience only a small degree of compaction, and the
corresponding subsidence at the surface will be negligible. In order to see a considerable
degree of subsidence, one or several of the following conditions must be present:
• The reservoir pressure drop must be signiﬁcant. Pressure maintenance by e.g. water
ﬂooding is likely to counteract compaction.
• The reservoir rock must be highly compressible. Compaction is more likely to be
important in soft rocks.
• The reservoir must have a considerable thickness. However, the whole depleted zone
must be considered. An adjacent aquifer will contribute to compaction, and so may
part of the overburden if drained to the reservoir.
• In order for subsidence to occur, the reservoir compaction must be signiﬁcant, and in
addition, not shielded by the overburden rock. The degree of shielding depends on the
depth and the geometry of the reservoir, and on the contrast in mechanical properties
between the reservoir and its surroundings.

Considering the conditions above, we would expect only a few reservoirs to cause severe
subsidence problems. This is also the case, but the often severe consequences of subsidence
makes it necessary for the industry to predict possible subsidence and compaction upfront,
so that platforms and casings are designed properly, and in order to decide on an appropri-
ate scheme for inﬁll drilling, placement of injector wells, well completion strategy etc.

The ﬁrst report on ground subsidence is from the Goose Creek ﬁeld in Texas, and is
dated back in the late 1910s. Later in the 1920s the Bolivar oil ﬁeld in Venezuela showed
the same behaviour. A well-known case is the Wilmington ﬁeld in Long Beach, California,
where subsidence of almost 9 metres was detected. More recent examples are the Ekoﬁsk
and Valhall reservoirs in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea, and the Groningen gas
ﬁeld onshore and offshore the Netherlands.

In the following, we will present an overview of how we can model compaction and
subsidence. The models presented here are largely analytical, which means that several
simplifying assumptions need to be made. A key assumption is to consider the reservoir as
a homogeneous medium. In reality, the geology is complex, and we are dealing with the
behaviour of a composite and inhomogeneous medium. The modelling needs to account
for that: The reservoir needs to be divided into compartments with different properties and
maybe also different depletion schemes. This requires numerical modelling, and a detailed
knowledge of the geology and associated rock properties. Often, however, simple models
like those presented below may be sufﬁcient to give an idea of the possible severity of
compaction and subsidence in a given ﬁeld case. Based on a simple analysis, one may then
decide whether a further and more reﬁned analysis is necessary.

12.2. Modelling of reservoir compaction

12.2.1. Uniaxial reservoir compaction

In this section we will calculate reservoir compaction in a simple basic case. We assume
linear poroelasticity, and consider a homogeneous reservoir consisting of isotropic rock.

h = −εvh

εh = εH = 0

(12.5)

MODELLING OF RESERVOIR COMPACTION

The deformation of the reservoir can then be expressed by Hooke’s law from Eqs. (1.102)–
(1.104) in terms of changes in effective Earth stresses, using the initial stress state (i.e. start
of production) as reference for the strains:

The change in reservoir thickness, h, is given by the vertical strain εv and the reservoir
thickness h, i.e.

Compaction of the reservoir thus corresponds to a negative h.

In order to compute the compaction, we need to know how the stresses evolve. We
shall here make the most common approach used within the industry, and then in a later
paragraph discuss possible reﬁnements.

Two assumptions are made: First, since the lateral extent of a reservoir normally is much
larger than its thickness, it is reasonable as a ﬁrst assumption to neglect the lateral strain:

Thus, the reservoir is assumed to compact only vertically, and we refer to this as uniaxial
compaction. This is the same deformation mode as in an oedometer or Ko test as described
in Section 7.3.8.

In order to maintain uniaxial vertical compaction during depletion, the effective hori-

zontal stresses have to increase. Inserting Eq. (12.5) into Eqs. (12.1)–(12.2) we ﬁnd

σ

= νfr
1 − νfr

(cid:2)

σ

(12.6)

Secondly, we assume that the total vertical stress acting on the reservoir remains constant
during production, which means that the full weight of the overburden is sensed by the
reservoir at all times as the pore pressure is reduced (σv = 0). Thus, stress arching
(or shielding of stress by the overburden) is neglected. This gives

(cid:2)
v

σ

= σv − αpf = −αpf

(12.7)

We can then insert for all three principal stress changes in Eq. (12.3), and arrive at the
following compaction formula:

= 1
Efr

(1 + νfr)(1 − 2νfr)

(12.8)

The compaction resulting from a certain pore pressure depletion can now be estimated from
Eq. (12.8), provided the elastic properties (Efr and νfr), the poroelastic coefﬁcient (α), and
the reservoir thickness (h) are known.

We may deﬁne a compaction coefﬁcient or uniaxial compressibility Cm as

= Cmαpf

h

(12.9)

394

RESERVOIR GEOMECHANICS

The uniaxial compressibility relates to different frame moduli of the rock, and is equal to
the inverse of the uniaxial compaction modulus:

1 − νfr

Note that the uniaxial compaction modulus corresponds to the plane wave modulus (see
Section 1.3). Since the modulus in Eq. (12.10) is a framework modulus, it means that the
P-wave modulus must be measured in dry conditions (or corrected to, through the Biot–
Gassmann equation, Eq. (1.155)). Furthermore, because dynamic moduli are often larger
than static moduli (see Section 5.6), a direct estimate of compaction from sonic data is
likely to provide a minimum estimate of the true compaction.

In applying the compaction formula, Eq. (12.10), a main problem is to obtain reasonable
values for the parameters involved. Normally, the pressure distribution will not be uniform,
nor will the mechanical properties. If, for instance, we are interested in the compaction in
the centre of the reservoir, we have to look for typical values in that area. Averages for the
total reservoir may in that case give misleading results.

12.2.2. The depleting sphere

As another basic example we will consider a depleting sphere, with radius Ro, in which the
pore pressure is reduced uniformly. This may also be seen as a limiting (although somewhat
unrealistic) case of a depleting reservoir.

To compute the deformation and stresses we need the equilibrium equation for spheri-

cally symmetrical displacement in spherical coordinates, as discussed in Section 4.7.

The general solution of the displacement equation (Eq. (4.171)), is

u(r) = C1r + C2
r2

(12.11)

where the integration constants must be determined by boundary conditions.
The radial displacement should vanish at inﬁnity, and remain ﬁnite at r = 0, and both
the radial displacement and the radial stress must be continuous at r = R0, the border
between the depleted region and the surroundings.

The result is that the radial stress change is constant within the depleted region, and

given by

σr = 2
3

1 − 2νfr
1 − νfr

αpf = 4
3

ηpf

where η is the poroelastic stress coefﬁcient deﬁned in Eq. (4.54).

The volumetric strain in the depleted region is

εvol = − αpf
λfr + 2Gfr

= −Cmαpf

(12.12)

(12.13)

Observe that depletion leads to a decrease in the total stress, but an increase in the effective
stress and hence a positive (compressive) strain.

MODELLING OF RESERVOIR COMPACTION

395

Eq. (12.13) may at ﬁrst glance be slightly surprising, one might be inclined to expect
α/Kfr instead of αCm. The reason why this is not so, is the stress concentration which
develops around the sphere, which shields it partly from the external stress and makes it
appear stiffer than it otherwise would.

12.2.3. Reservoir stress path

During uniaxial reservoir compaction (described in Section 12.2.1), the vertical stress
remains constant, while the horizontal stresses change according to Eq. (12.6) during de-
pletion. In general, the stress evolution during depletion (the reservoir stress path) may be
deﬁned by the stress path coefﬁcients, as introduced by Hettema et al. (2000):

pf

γv = σv
γH = σH
γh = σh

pf

pf

(12.14)

(12.15)

(12.16)

The coefﬁcient γv is called the arching coefﬁcient, and is zero when the vertical stress
remains constant as the pore pressure is changed. The coefﬁcients γh and γH describe the
change in the horizontal stress ﬁeld. Assuming full rotational symmetry in the horizontal
plane, γh = γH. Remember that for a depleting reservoir the pressure drop is negative,
so that positive values of the stress path coefﬁcients imply reductions in total vertical and
horizontal stresses.

Stress path coefﬁcients may also be similarly deﬁned in terms of the effective stresses.

It is straightforward to show that the relation between the stress path coefﬁcients γ
effective stresses and the coefﬁcients deﬁned above is

This has more or less been the default assumption within the petroleum industry for
decades. It was through the analysis of compaction and subsidence in the Ekoﬁsk ﬁeld
(Teufel et al., 1991) that the relevance of the stress path concept was conceived. In that
case, stress measurements during reservoir depletion showed that the effective horizontal
stress increase was much lower than expected from laboratory data (being close to 0.2 in
the ﬁeld, while a value of approximately 0.5 was measured on cores). This has had pro-
found impact on the entire Ekoﬁsk ﬁeld development, and has led to increased focus on the
reservoir stress path for many other ﬁelds.

From Hooke’s law (Eqs. (12.1)–(12.3)) and Eqs. (12.4), (12.14) and (12.16) elastic reser-

voir compaction can now be calculated for a general stress path. The result is:

The values of γv and γh depend on the geometry of the depleting reservoir zone, but also on
the elastic contrast between the reservoir and its surroundings: For example, if the reser-
voir is soft, stress will be concentrated in the stiffer surroundings and shielded from the
depleting zone.

The horizontal stress path coefﬁcient γh depends on the boundary conditions at the sides
of the reservoir. In Section 12.2.1 we assumed uniaxial compaction based on the argument
that horizontal strain is negligible because the lateral extent of the reservoir is normally
much larger than its thickness. This underlines the importance of the geometry of the de-
pleting reservoir zone.

As an example of the effect of geometry, consider the analytical solution for the stress
ﬁeld within a depleting sphere, as given in Eq. (12.12). This shows that for a spherical reser-
voir embedded in an elastic medium with properties identical to those of the surroundings,
the horizontal and vertical stress path coefﬁcients are equal (in contrast to Eqs. (12.21) and
(12.22) above):

The ellipsoidal reservoir

Rudnicki (1999) modelled the stress path coefﬁcients analytically for a more general case.
Building on the theory of Eshelby (1957) (see also Chapter 6), the reservoir is considered
as an ellipsoidal poroelastic inclusion embedded in an inﬁnite solid medium. “Inﬁnite”
here means that the inﬂuence of the free surface is neglected, which limits the validity of
the results to reservoirs at depths greater than their lateral extents. The depleting part of the
reservoir is oriented with the short principal axis in the vertical direction. In the derivation,
the strain occurring in a depleting stress-free reservoir is calculated ﬁrst. Then, the stresses
required to restore the original reservoir shape are calculated, and ﬁnally these stresses

MODELLING OF RESERVOIR COMPACTION

are added to the initial in situ stresses. Rudnicki’s model also permits contrast in elastic
properties between the reservoir and its surroundings.

The resulting coefﬁcients depend, as expected, on the thickness to diameter ratio (also
called aspect ratio) e, and on the elastic contrast between the reservoir and its surroundings.
If we assume that all elastic moduli are the same within the reservoir and in the surrounding

rock, the coefﬁcients can be calculated using the following expressions:

In the limit e → 0, the stress path coefﬁcients are identical to the expressions found
above (Eqs. (12.21) and (12.22)) for uniaxial compaction. The horizontal stress path coef-
ﬁcient decreases as the shape of the depleting zone is changed from inﬁnitely ﬂat towards
spherical (e → 1), whereas the vertical (arching) coefﬁcient increases with increasing as-
pect ratio. In the limit e → 1 (spherical inclusion), the arching coefﬁcients become equal,
in agreement with Eq. (12.24).

from Rudnicki’s model for the case of no elastic contrast. The stress path coefﬁcients have been normalized by
dividing with γh for uniaxial strain conditions, see Eq. (12.21). The dashed lines show the linearization from
Eqs. (12.27) and (12.28).

RESERVOIR GEOMECHANICS

Note that from Eqs. (12.25) and (12.26) it follows that
1 − 2νfr
1 − νfr

γv + 2γh = 2α

(12.29)

Thus, for an ellipsoidal reservoir, when the surroundings have the same elastic properties
as the reservoir, the sum γv + 2γh is independent of the aspect ratio e.
The volumetric compaction of the reservoir can be expressed in terms of the stress path

coefﬁcients, by introducing the deﬁnitions into Hooke’s law. The result is

For an ellipsoidal reservoir with no contrast to the elastic properties of the surroundings,
this means (combining Eqs. (12.10) and (12.29)) that the volumetric deformation of the
depleting reservoir is always given by the uniaxial compaction modulus, i.e.

εvol = −αCmpf

(12.31)

This is a direct consequence of stress arching. It also implies that the pore compressibility
is independent of the stress path (but it is different from the basic deﬁnition in Eq. (1.178)),
see Section 12.4.1.
If we compare the vertical compaction of the reservoir calculated from Eq. (12.23) with
the simple case of uniaxial compaction (e = 0, Eq. (12.8)), we ﬁnd that the compaction
is maximum for uniaxial deformation. The physical explanation of this is that arching (for
e > 0) will redistribute the stresses such that the reservoir is partly shielded from the
overburden stress. When the reservoir approaches spherical shape (e = 1), the compaction
drops to 1/3 of the uniaxial compaction case. This also follows directly from the volumetric
strain being independent of the reservoir shape, see Eq. (12.31).

Elastic contrast

The effect of elastic contrast between the reservoir and the surroundings can be studied
using the full equations in Rudnicki’s article (1999), or based on ﬁnite element (FEM)
simulations (Morita et al., 1989; Mulders, 2003). In all cases it is found that arching is
promoted if the stiffness of the depleting reservoir is signiﬁcantly lower than of the sur-
rounding rock.

Morita et al. (1989) argued from FEM simulations with a disk shaped reservoir that if the
ratio between the shear modulus of the reservoir and the overburden rock is between 0.2
and 1.5, and if the aspect ratio of the reservoir is less than 0.05, the resulting compaction
is essentially uniaxial.

Similar conclusions can be drawn from Rudnicki’s model, which shows an increase both
in γv and also to some extent in γh compared to the elastically matched case (Holt et al.,
2004). For a ﬁnite aspect ratio, both stress path coefﬁcients approach 1 in the limit of inﬁ-
nite elastic contrast. On the other hand, a stiff reservoir in soft surroundings will have lower
stress path coefﬁcients, approaching zero in the case of inﬁnite contrast. Note that the value

MODELLING OF RESERVOIR COMPACTION

399

of γv + 2γh which controls volumetric compaction (see Eq. (12.30)) and also pore com-
pressibility (see Section 12.4.1 below) does not remain constant for all aspect ratios, and
decreases with increasing ratio between the stiffness of the reservoir and the surroundings.

Non-ellipsoidal reservoirs

Mulders (2003) compared numerical FEM simulations of stress path coefﬁcients for a disk
shaped reservoir with those calculated by Rudnicki’s model. The assumption of ellipsoidal
geometry by Rudnicki causes the stress path coefﬁcients to be homogeneous over the entire
depleted zone.

For a disk shaped reservoir, Mulders found that the stress path coefﬁcients near the
centre of the reservoir agree with the analytical approach. However, γv increases and γh
decreases towards the edge of the reservoir. From FEM simulations one may inspect the
effect of reservoir depth and tilt with respect to the vertical. In particular, tilt is found to
enhance arching.

Thermoelastic effects may be added to this model (Rudnicki, 1999; Segall and Fitzger-
ald, 1998). This has relevance for recovery of hydrocarbon reserves by injection of cold
water or hot steam.

12.2.4. Beyond simple elastic theory

So far we have considered the reservoir (and its surroundings) to behave linearly elastic.
A reservoir may however develop plastic deformation during production, and eventually
reach a state where faults are generated, or where pre-existing faults are triggered. Faulting
may also occur outside the reservoir, in particular near the edges, where the stress con-
centration resulting from stress arching in the surrounding rock is particularly large (see
Section 12.3.2).

For a reservoir rock being intact (non-fractured and in an elastic state) before produc-
tion starts, non-elastic processes may occur during depletion, if the stress path brings the
rock past yield and in the direction of its failure surface. Failure processes may take place
from the grain scale to the scale of large heterogeneities, and the compaction behaviour
gradually becomes plastic. Laboratory experiments, where synthetic sandstone was formed
under stress (Holt et al., 2000) showed that after an initial phase with largely elastic defor-
mation, permanent (plastic) deformation gradually takes over as the material compacts. In
uniaxial strain conditions, this led to approximately a doubling of the compaction rate, and
it also led to enhanced lateral stress development (corresponding to a reduction of the γh
coefﬁcient) after onset of plasticity.

Plastic behaviour also implies that if water or gas is injected to raise the pore pressure
and counteract compaction, one may not expect to recover the compaction that has occurred
(Santarelli et al., 1998). Depending on the stress path, and on the constitutive behaviour of
the reservoir rock, one may also reach a stress state that permits development of localized
deformation bands, or activation of existing faults.

Fig. 12.3 illustrates schematically how the stress paths will evolve towards the failure
surface in the case of a perfectly linear elastic material. One sees that arching directs the

400

arching, while the dashed arrow indicates how arching may redirect the stress path.

path more in direction of the end cap, while lack of arching apparently may lead towards a
shear failure (faulting) situation.

The development of plasticity after the rock reaches its yield point may however redirect
the stress path, as shown in Fig. 12.4. These examples are taken from laboratory tests with
a high porosity sandstone. They show that, depending on the initial stress state, a uniaxial
compaction path may lead to various scenarios: In one case (curve a; low initial shear
stress), the stress path turns parallel to the shear failure limit and eventually reaches failure
near the end cap, while in the other case (curve b; high initial shear stress), strain softening
occurs after the rock has reached the failure surface.

An initially faulted and fractured reservoir in a tectonically active environment may be
assumed to be in a continuous failure state (Addis, 1997). Then, a failure criterion (such as
Mohr–Coulomb) should apply at all stages during depletion. In a normally faulted stress
regime, where the vertical stress is the largest principal stress, this gives (see Eq. (2.22)):

The stress path coefﬁcient κ is thus

κ = 1
tan2 β

where β is the failure angle and ϕ is the angle of internal friction (see Section 2.3.1).
Provided the total vertical stress remains constant (no arching), it follows from Eq. (12.19)
that

12.2.5. Time delayed reservoir compaction

It is observed in several ﬁeld cases that compaction and/or subsidence occurs with some
delay with respect to change in pore pressure (Hettema et al., 2002). Time dependent defor-
mation (Section 1.9) is normally due to consolidation; i.e. establishment of pore pressure
equilibrium, or it is associated with creep.

In a homogeneous high-permeability reservoir, pore pressure equilibration is a reason-
ably rapid process, taking place within hours or days. Longer time constants must be
associated with very low permeability rock, such as shale, which may be present as lenses
or layers within the reservoir section. For instance, it would take about 100 years to reach
pore pressure equilibrium within a 10 m thick shale layer with 1 nanoDarcy permeability.
Thus, shales continue to compact as their pore pressure approaches equilibrium with that
of the reservoir rock.

Reservoir depletion occurs over a time scale of 50 years or so, which means that the
deformation rate is considerably faster than during natural compaction on a geological
time scale. Most geomaterials are viscoelastic (they creep), which means that increased
loading rate will cause increased stiffness at a given stress level (see Fig. 12.5) (de Waal
and Smits, 1988) (see also Section 1.9.2). A slow initial transient compaction followed

402

by an increased compaction rate is then expected, in accord with ﬁeld observations. This
model however also predicts that reservoir rocks would be more compliant than laboratory
cores, because the loading rate (test duration: hours or days) employed in the laboratory is
much higher than in the ﬁeld. This appears to be in disagreement with most observations.
Delayed compaction and subsidence may also originate from the drainage pattern of
the reservoir: If the pore pressure is reduced only within a zone of limited lateral extent,
then stress arching is enhanced (as seen in Section 12.2.3), and compaction is reduced
accordingly, compared to what it would be if the entire reservoir was drained uniformly.
As the drainage radius increases, stress arching is reduced, and compaction accelerates and
eventually reaches the level it would have for uniform drainage.

A transition from elastic to plastic behaviour may also be interpreted as a time-delayed
compaction, because the compaction rate would increase with increasing pore pressure
depletion. This is however not a time delayed compaction effect as such (although plastic
strain often involves creep).

Above we have listed mechanisms that may lead to time-delayed compaction and hence
time-delayed subsidence with respect to pore pressure depletion. In addition, subsidence
may be delayed with respect to compaction. In order to see this in ﬁeld data, separate
compaction and subsidence measurements are required. Such data are usually not available.
Time-delayed stress alteration and creep in the cap rock may contribute to time-delayed
subsidence (Christensen et al., 1988).

12.3. From compaction to subsidence

12.3.1. Geertsma’s nucleus of strain model

To get a more precise picture of the subsidence, we shall take a look at how the deforma-
tion of the compacting reservoir propagates through the overburden. A simple approach is
the so-called nucleus of strain model, presented by Geertsma (1973a, 1973b). The idea is
to calculate the subsidence resulting from the compaction of a small sphere, and then to

FROM COMPACTION TO SUBSIDENCE

403

calculate the total subsidence by adding the inﬂuence of many such spheres, assuming that
superposition is allowable.

Geertsma’s model is limited to the case where there is no contrast in elastic properties

between the reservoir and the surroundings.

Considering the region outside the depleting sphere (of radius R0), and denoting the
radial displacement at the surface of the depleting sphere by u0, the radial displacement at
a distance r from the centre of the sphere is (see Eq. (12.11))

u(r) = u0

R2

(12.35)

u0 may be related to the volume change of the depleted region by (remember the sign
convention, displacements point in the opposite direction of the coordinate axes, see e.g.

V = −4π R2

which describes the displacement ﬁeld outside a depleting sphere in an inﬁnite medium.

Note that the magnitude of the displacement ﬁeld is governed by the product V pf. This
means that we get the same displacement ﬁeld outside R0 for a sphere of half the volume if
pf is doubled. This is similar to gravitation theory, in which we get the same gravitational
ﬁeld outside the Earth if we assume all the mass to be situated at the centre of the Earth.

This principle is, as we shall see, important for the Geertsma theory.

The effect of the free surface

Eq. (12.38) has one major shortcoming—it does not take the surface properly into account.
At the surface, the vertical stress must be zero. This problem was solved by Geertsma,
who used known solutions from thermoelasticity (Mindlin and Cheng, 1950a, 1950b; Sen,
1951) to arrive at the corrected expression:

zero vertical stress at z = 0. It is a straightforward, but admittedly tedious job to compute
the strain components from Eq. (12.39), and to insert them into Hooke’s law to show that
σz = 0 atz = 0.
It is easy vector algebra (observe from Fig. 12.6 that (cid:5)R2 + 2Dˆz = (cid:5)R1) to show that at
the surface, (cid:5)u points in the (cid:5)R1 direction, and that the displacement is given by

Thus, the presence of the free surface enhances the displacement by typically a factor

The size of the subsidence bowl

From Eq. (12.40) we may compute the volume of the subsidence bowl, Vsubs by integrat-
ing the vertical deformation over the entire surface.

Eq. (12.41) shows that the volume of the subsidence bowl is related to the volume re-

duction of the compacting reservoir (Vcomp) by

(12.43)
As an example, for ν = 0.25, the volume of the subsidence bowl is 50% larger than the
volumetric reservoir compaction.

Vsubs = 2(1 − ν)Vcomp

Since the subsidence for an arbitrary shaped reservoir is found by integrating the result
from many nuclei, it is clear that this ratio is generally valid (within the assumptions of the
model, i.e. elastic deformation and no contrast between the reservoir and the surroundings).

Subsidence above a disk shaped reservoir

Given Eq. (12.40) it is in principle straightforward to compute the subsidence for an arbi-
trarily shaped reservoir by numerical methods. This is however of limited interest, since
the method is based on constant elastic properties. When one turns to numerical modelling,
one should also include a more realistic model of the surrounding formations including the
layers below the reservoir.

There exist, however, analytical solutions for a disk-shaped reservoir which give a gen-
eral insight into the subsidence problem, which is useful even though the method is not
suited for precise calculations.

We shall ﬁrst consider the vertical displacement along the centre line through a disk-
shaped reservoir. From Eq. (12.39) we extract the vertical component of the displacement,
and integrate over the reservoir. In our calculations, we use a set of strain nuclei situated at
z = D, and multiply by the reservoir height h to get the ﬁnal result. The integrals involved
are similar to Eq. (12.42), and the ﬁnal result is

An important question to resolve is how much error we introduce by assuming the com-
paction to be localized at z = D. We remember from the discussion following Eq. (12.38)
that for a sphere, we may assume all compaction to take place at the centre, and still get
the correct answer outside the reservoir. Thus, if we modelled a reservoir consisting of a
distribution of spheres, we would get correct answer. Now, since a disk can not be fully ap-
proximated by spheres, we expect some deviation, but it might seem reasonable to expect
that it will be small.

By inserting numbers, one will see that difference between the two calculations is only a

Eq. (12.44) may be integrated to give the exact result for a reservoir of a ﬁnite thickness.
The result is shown in Fig. 12.7 where the exact result is compared with the approximate
result, for reservoir properties given in Table 12.1 (page 409), but for a large reservoir
thickness of h = 1000 m. Again it is seen that outside the reservoir, the Geertsma solution
is very close to the exact result.

Geertsma (1973a) also gave solutions for off-centre positions. He showed that the dis-
placements and stresses can be expressed in terms of integrals of Bessel functions, which
in turn can be expressed via elliptic integrals. He also included tables of numerical values
of the necessary integrals. These tables are of less relevance today, since modern mathe-
matical program systems include functions to compute the elliptic integrals and hence the
tables can be quickly reproduced.

We have included an overview of Geertsma’s main formulas in the formula appendix,

on page 470.

Some example results

The Geertsma solutions are useful for getting an overview of what happens during com-
paction and subsidence. From Eq. (12.44) one may compute the vertical displacement at

voir size to depth ratios R/D. The full line applies to a reservoir with radius equal to the
depth. One observes that the reservoir top subsides while the reservoir bottom rises. This
results in a subsidence that is smaller than the reservoir compaction.

On the other hand, for the case shown by the dashed line, which applies to a wide reser-
voir with radius three times the depth, both the reservoir top and bottom subside, and the
Geertsma model predicts a subsidence which is larger than the reservoir compaction.

Fig. 12.9 shows the ratio of subsidence to reservoir compaction as a function of reservoir

radius scaled by the reservoir depth. For very wide reservoirs, the ratio approaches 1.5.

One observes that at the central parts of the reservoir, the displacement is essentially
vertical, in accordance with the assumption of uniaxial compaction. However, at the outer
radius, the dominant displacement is horizontal. It is clear that the assumption of uniax-
ial vertical compaction is a simpliﬁcation relative to the predictions of the purely elastic
Geertsma model, which is of course again a simpliﬁcation of the true behaviour.

given in Table 12.1, which corresponds to a reservoir with radius equal to the depth.

12.3.2. Stress alteration in the overburden

Geertsma’s model, as presented in the preceding paragraph, tells us that the stress state
will change within the rock masses surrounding a depleting reservoir. Since reservoir com-
paction leads to surface subsidence, and since the vertical displacement at the surface is
usually smaller than at the top of the reservoir (see Figs. 12.7 and 12.8), the overburden
above the central part of the reservoir will deform with an extensional vertical strain. Thus,
the vertical stress is reduced in this region, as illustrated in Fig. 12.13.

and is expected to be inaccurate close to the reservoir edges.

1.1 are in black. The plot is not valid inside the reservoir, and is expected to be inaccurate close to the reservoir
edges.

At the same time, the horizontal stress is increased. This is an expression of stress arch-
ing, occurring unless the reservoir has inﬁnite lateral extent (e = 0). Near the edge of the
reservoir, the opposite trend is evident from the ﬁgure: The vertical stress increases, while
the horizontal stress decreases. Furthermore (not shown in the ﬁgure), a difference between
the radial and tangential stress component arises in the overburden outside the depleting
region.

We may extend the deﬁnition of the stress path coefﬁcients introduced in Section 12.2.3
beyond the reservoir by considering the stress changes outside the reservoir while main-
taining that the pore pressure change pf in Eqs. (12.14)–(12.16) shall be interpreted as
the pore pressure change in the depleting reservoir zone. The vertical stress is continuous

FROM COMPACTION TO SUBSIDENCE

411

across the boundary between top or bottom of the reservoir and the surroundings. Thus,
the vertical stress path coefﬁcient is also continuous across the boundary. The horizontal
stress may on the other hand be discontinuous at the horizontal boundaries.

Segall and Fitzgerald (1998) found that the horizontal stress will increase above and
below a depleting ellipsoidal inclusion with low aspect ratio e (having elastic proper-
ties identical to those of the surroundings) according to the following equation (valid for
small e):

σ exterior

(12.47)

At the edge of the depleting zone, the horizontal stress is the same outside and inside,
while the vertical stress is increasing by ∼α(−pf). This increase can be large, and may
eventually lead to faulting or fault reactivation.

Note that in the rock surrounding the reservoir (usually shale), the permeability is very
low. There is hence limited possibility for ﬂuid ﬂow, so that the pore pressure response is
that of an undrained case. The pore pressure change depends on the constitutive behaviour
of the shale, and is controlled by the Skempton coefﬁcients (see Section 1.6.5). Because
the volume change outside the reservoir is small, the pore pressure change will also be
small. The effective stress changes are therefore close to the changes in the total stresses.
The stress evolution around a depleting zone can be calculated from the analytical model
of Geertsma (1973b), as outlined in the preceding paragraph. Figs. 12.15a and b show the
resulting stress path coefﬁcients along a vertical line through the centre of the depleting
zone for depleting reservoir radius equal to 1000 m (a) and 500 m (b). The reservoir is
disk shaped and centred at 3000 m depth. The two plots illustrate that the arching effect
decreases as the extent of the depleting zone increases. Furthermore, one sees that γv +
2γh ≈ 0 (constant mean stress; hence no volumetric strain, and pure shear loading), and
that the region inﬂuenced by the depleting zone extends more than 1000 m above and
below the depleting reservoir. The vertical extent increases with increasing radius of the
depleting zone.

Fig. 12.15c shows a similar plot of the stress path coefﬁcients for the case deﬁned by the
parameters in Table 12.1. In this case, the reservoir is more shallow (centred at 2000 m),
and the aspect ratio is relatively low (0.05). This leads to low values of the arching coef-
ﬁcients, but the vertical extent of arching is large enough to cause inﬂuence by the free
surface: We see that there is horizontal compression at the surface, and that the mean stress
is no longer constant.

Fig. 12.16 shows the vertical and horizontal stress path coefﬁcients as functions of the
depleting zone radius for various depths above a reservoir at 2000 m depth, and with prop-
erties as given by Table 12.1 (except the radius which is varied in the plot).

This analytical model is, as pointed out several times above, limited to an assumption of
homogeneous elastic properties, i.e. no elastic contrast between reservoir and surrounding
rocks. The reservoir is disk shaped, and there is no tilt. In a real case, one should apply nu-
merical techniques, such as the Finite Element Method (FEM) to obtain realistic answers.
Adding elastic contrast by making the surroundings much stiffer than the reservoir rock
promotes further arching. This leaves the rock above and below the reservoir in a state of
shear loading as well as volumetric expansion. If the reservoir also is tilted, the arching
effect can be very large.

In this section we have addressed stress paths associated with depleting reservoirs. The
analysis is general and thus relevant also for other cases of ﬂuid withdrawal from under-
ground strata. As long as the rocks behave elastically, one may also use the same formalism
when an isolated layer within the Earth ﬂuid is pressurized by ﬂuid injection, except that
the stress path coefﬁcients then will change sign because pf is positive. However, as com-
mented in Section 12.2.4 above, any plasticity will make the response to inﬂation different
from that of depletion.

Non-elastic effects may also be of signiﬁcance in the rocks surrounding the reservoir.
The strong stress concentration near the edges of a depleting reservoir may trigger pre-
existing faults and be a source of seismicity. It may also lead to faulting by itself. This
mechanism is illustrated by physical modelling through the so-called trap-door experiment
(Papamichos et al., 2001; based on an original experiment by Terzaghi, 1936).

A container with a transparent front plate is ﬁlled with sand. At the bottom of the con-
tainer is a trap door, which is lowered to mimic the compaction of a reservoir. Initially,
selected ﬂat layers of black painted sand were inserted for each 10 mm, in order to vi-
sualize the displacement pattern during lowering of the trap door. Examples of observed

patterns are shown in Fig. 12.17. Shear bands are seen to originate from the ﬂanks of the
“reservoir”. When the reservoir is shallow, i.e. trap door depth/width is smaller than one,
the shear bands immediately reach the surface and compaction is directly transferred to
subsidence. For deep reservoirs, the shear bands meet each other before they reach the
surface. Additional shear band formation eventually leads to surface subsidence also in
this case, with a time delay with respect to reservoir compaction. The subsidence bowl
observed in these experiments is concentrated directly above the reservoir.

12.4. Geomechanical effects on reservoir performance

So far, we have focused on the purely mechanical aspects of reservoir geomechanics. Hav-
ing the problems associated with subsidence and compaction in mind, it appears as if the
geomechanical inﬂuence on the economy of the petroleum industry is largely negative.
However, compaction may also act as a drive mechanism for petroleum production, just
like water is expelled by squeezing a sponge. In addition, the stress changes associated with
pore pressure depletion will also affect porosity, permeability and permeability anisotropy,
which will have further effects on recovery.

12.4.1. Compaction drive

The basic deﬁnition of pore volume compressibility was discussed in Section 1.6.4. There
Eq. (1.178) gives the pore volume compressibility with respect to pore pressure provided
the stresses are constant. However, it was seen in Section 12.2.3 above, that the stresses
change during reservoir depletion. Hence, the expression in Eq. (1.178) does not apply
directly to a depleting reservoir.

GEOMECHANICAL EFFECTS ON RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE

To ﬁnd the appropriate pore volume compressibility, we must take into account how σp

in Eq. (1.176) depends on the pore pressure pf.
From the basic deﬁnitions of the stress path parameters, Eqs. (12.14)–(12.16) we have
(assuming γh = γH)

σp = 1

(γv + 2γh)pf = ¯γ pf

As a result of a pore pressure decrease the produced ﬂuid volume (at reservoir condi-

tions) is:

Vprod = −Vp(Cf + C

γ

(12.53)

The compressibility of the pore ﬂuid is denoted by Cf, and is the inverse of the bulk mod-
ulus (Cf = 1/Kf).
This illustrates that in particular for a soft rock which has low stiffness and therefore high
pore compressibility, production will be enhanced by compaction of the pores. This is what
we call compaction drive. In case of high stiffness (low compressibility), the production
drive will be dominated by the pore ﬂuid compressibility.
As an example, if the pore ﬂuid is oil with bulk modulus of 1 GPa, and the rock is soft
with bulk modulus ∼1 GPa, porosity ∼25%, and Poisson’s ratio ∼0.30, the compaction
term in Eq. (12.53) contributes about 2.5 times as much as the ﬂuid compressibility to the

416

production. On the other hand, if the rock is stiff with bulk modulus ∼10 GPa, porosity
∼10%, and Poisson’s ratio ∼0.20, the contribution from compaction is only about half of
that of the ﬂuid.
Gas has negligible compressibility above the bubble point, when it is dissolved in the
pore liquid. Below the bubble point Cgas ≈ 1/pf, and in that case gas drive will completely
dominate.

12.4.2. Stress effects on porosity

In this section, we will describe how porosity, based on the linear poroelastic theory,
changes with stress and pore pressure. One objective is to evaluate porosity changes during
depletion of a reservoir. Another objective is to be able to correct core based porosity data
to in situ conditions.

Porosity change during depletion

Porosity change associated with a stress change can be expressed in terms of pore and bulk
strains as shown in Eq. (1.179):

The latter part of the equation above simply states the effective stress principle for porosity
(cf. Eq. (1.180)).
For an ellipsoidal reservoir (including the uniaxial compaction case) we may replace ¯γ
from Eq. (12.50):

The maximum pf is typically a few tens of MPa, while Kfr is in the GPa range. Hence,
for most practical examples, porosity reduction as a result of depletion is small—typically
less than one per cent unit. In reality, porosity change would also be heterogeneous, partly
because of rock heterogeneity, and partly because of localized deformation.

Overburden correction of laboratory measured porosity

In order to estimate hydrocarbon reserves as accurately as possible, a reliable estimate of
the in situ porosity is required. Cores represent a source for direct measurement of porosity.
In principle, the core should be reloaded to the in situ stress state in a true triaxial setup,
with pore pressure (and temperature) control. The test would have to be performed on a
core which is properly oriented with respect to the Earth stresses. If both pore volume
change (from the volume of expelled ﬂuid from the core) and bulk volumetric strain is
measured, then Eq. (12.54) above directly gives the porosity change as the core is reloaded.
Such tests are too complicated to be performed on a routine basis at an acceptable price;
thus, simpliﬁed procedures are required (Teeuw, 1971; Nieto et al., 1994; Holt et al., 2003).
Core measurements of porosity are usually done in drained loading experiments, where
the external stress is increased hydrostatically and the pore pressure kept at atmospheric
level. Since porosity change is associated with change in pore and bulk volumes, it is,
as long as the core behaves linearly elastic, responding to the mean stress: The conﬁning
pressure applied to the core should therefore be raised to the mean effective in situ stress.
It was shown in Section 1.6.4 that porosity is a function of an effective stress that does not
depend on the Biot coefﬁcient, i.e.

The core should thus be loaded to a conﬁning pressure equal to:

φ = φ (¯σ − pf)
(cid:2) = σh + σH + σv

¯σ

3

− pf

(12.58)

(12.59)

The porosity change as shown by Eq. (12.54) depends on the change in the bulk volume
and the pore volume. Usually, however, one does not measure both pore and bulk volume
changes.

Since the pore and bulk volume changes in a drained experiment are related through the

Biot coefﬁcient (see Eq. (1.171)) as follows

Often Biot’s α is set to 1 in these equations. The error introduced by doing so is larger
in the case when only bulk strain is measured than when pore strain is recorded. One may
improve the reliability of the estimated porosity change by inserting a realistic value for α,
for instance by calculating the bulk frame modulus from the data and assuming a solid
grain bulk modulus based on knowledge of the mineralogy.

RESERVOIR GEOMECHANICS

Fig. 12.18. Porosity reduction for a ﬁeld sandstone core as a result of mean effective stress increase, using 3 dif-
ferent stress paths, isotropic (full line), uniaxial compaction (dashed line), proportional loading (dotted line). The
resulting porosity is practically stress path independent (after Holt et al., 2003, with permission form SPWLA).
The porosity reduction at in situ conditions is read at the mean in situ effective stress (which was close to 25 MPa).

The basis for the analysis above was linear poroelasticity. When a core is retrieved from
the Earth, microcracks have developed as a result of stress release, and the subsequent
core reloading is highly nonlinear, often with large strains (see Chapter 7). The underlying
assumptions can therefore be discussed. Using physical model simulations (cementing syn-
thetic rocks under stress) and discrete particle simulations, plus experiments with natural
ﬁeld sandstone cores, Holt et al. (2003) demonstrated that the porosity reduction during
reloading was largely stress path insensitive; i.e. the use of an isotropic stress may still be
valid in overburden correction. This is shown in Fig. 12.18. Cases where this is not likely to
be valid are for instance in high porosity rocks, where core damage may cause a permanent
porosity reduction as a result of coring and subsequent reloading in the laboratory (Holt et
al., 2000).

12.4.3. Stress effects on permeability

The rate of production from a reservoir as a result of a certain amount of depletion is largely
controlled by reservoir rock permeability. Likewise, the ability of an injected ﬂuid (water,
gas) to displace hydrocarbons is also linked to permeability. Because of the heterogeneous
distribution of rocks within a reservoir, and because of fractures and faults, permeability
may vary considerably over the reservoir volume. This variability, resulting in barriers,
ﬂow channels and compartments of rock bodies within the reservoir, controls how ﬂuid
is drained from the reservoir during depletion and during enhanced recovery operations.
Furthermore, permeability anisotropy implies that there will be preferred ﬂow directions
in situ, even within homogeneous layers.

We know from the preceding sections of this chapter that stresses are changing during
production. The question we address here is how Earth stress changes may affect perme-
ability and permeability anisotropy, and thereby reservoir drainage.

GEOMECHANICAL EFFECTS ON RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE

419

Flood directionality in the ﬁeld

An extensive study of well test data was performed by Heffer and Dowokpor (1990) and
Heffer et al. (1994). They showed (as can be seen in Fig. 12.19) that the preferred horizontal
ﬂow direction, seen from well tests in a majority of fractured as well as non-fractured
reservoirs, is parallel to the maximum in situ horizontal stress. This implies that stress
anisotropy leads to permeability anisotropy. The relevance of this to reservoir engineering
can be illustrated by considering water injection from a vertical well: If the producing
well is placed in the direction of maximum permeability, early water-breakthrough and
low recovery would be the result. The injector must hence be placed with respect to the
producer by careful consideration of the in situ stress ﬁeld. Thus; identiﬁcation of principal
in situ stress directions may be of importance for the reservoir drainage strategy.

Permeability changes under isotropic stress conditions

Experimentally one ﬁnds that permeability is reduced with increasing isotropic stress. The
relative reduction of permeability is generally larger in low permeability and low porosity
rocks, where permeability is mainly due to cracks or narrow pores which are easily closed
by an applied stress, than in high permeability and high porosity rocks. As an example,
data on sandstones (Yale, 1984; Kilmer et al., 1987; Holt, 1990; Schutjens et al., 2004)
show that for milliDarcy or lower permeabilities, a conﬁning pressure increase of 30 MPa
may cause a permeability decrease of 50% or more. For porosities above 15–20% and
permeabilities above 1 milliDarcy, the permeability reduction caused by a similar stress
increase is usually of the order 20% or less.
From a microscopic viewpoint, permeability is controlled by the following parameters:
• porosity (φ),
• pore size/grain size (and size distribution),
• pore shape/grain shape,
• tortuosity (T ).
The Kozeny–Carman equation (see e.g. Dullien, 1992) is based on a simple network

model, where the pores are considered as pipes:

k = d2
g
κ0T 2

φ3

(1 − φ)2

(12.63)

Here dg is the grain diameter (assuming spherical grains), and κ0 is a modifying factor
introduced to account for realistic pore shapes. When stress is increased, as long as the
rock remains elastic, the main factor changing in the equation above is the porosity. This
is illustrated in Fig. 12.20, where measured permeability change during hydrostatic load-
ing of a sandstone core (24% porosity) from 4 to 35 MPa is compared to permeability
change predicted from the Eq. (12.63) above, using strain recordings during the test to
calculate porosity changes according to the theory presented in the preceding section. In
this case a convincing agreement was obtained. Flornes (2005) found from hydrostatic

The value of the proportionality factor χ was found to be between 4 and 10 for the different
rocks studied, with an average near 7.

In low permeability rocks, the ﬂow is more controlled by thin aspect ratio pores and
cracks. In this case, the stress sensitivity is much larger than expected from the porosity
based Kozeny–Carman model. This is primarily due to crack closure. Ganghi (1978) has
derived a simple model for stress dependent fracture permeability:

σ

σ0

(cid:25)

k = k0

1 −

(12.65)

Here σ0 is a constant relating to the stiffness of the fracture, whereas m is an exponent
(0 < m < 1) that describes the asperity distribution within the fracture. k0 is the perme-
ability at zero stress. Note that σ is the stress acting normal to the fracture plane. Fig. 12.21
shows the rapid decline of permeability according to this model. In case of shear stress ap-
plied to the fracture, the permeability may increase slightly during initial shearing if the
fracture dilates. If asperities are torn off and gouge produced within the fracture, signiﬁcant
permeability reductions (2 or more orders of magnitude) have been observed (Makurat and
Gutierrez, 1996).

Pore pressure reduction is the main driving force of petroleum production. The stress
effect on permeability is a combined effect of increasing external stresses and decreas-
ing pore pressure. One may anticipate that permeability is functionally dependent on an

effective stress

(cid:2) = σ − αkpf

σ

(12.66)

This effective stress is not the same as the effective stress governing the elastic be-
haviour. The coefﬁcient αk is a poroelastic coefﬁcient for permeability. Experiments with
Berea sandstone (Zoback and Byerlee, 1975) gave αk-values between 2 and 4, which of
course is very different from the conventional assumption (αk = 1). Flornes (2005) found
values close to 1 for high porosity sandstones. This is in agreement with the observa-
tion that permeability change under hydrostatic loading is primarily controlled by porosity
change: The effective stress for porosity is equal to the net stress (conﬁning minus pore
pressure). However, if the solid phase is heterogeneous (as pointed out by Berryman, 1992),
the effective stress coefﬁcient for permeability may deviate signiﬁcantly from αk = 1.
Zoback and Byerlee (1975) argued that if soft clay is coating the pore walls, the pore pres-
sure will have larger inﬂuence on the permeability than the external stress. Further work is
required in order to reach a better understanding of the effective stress law for permeability.

Permeability changes under anisotropic stress conditions

Reservoir stresses and stress changes during production are anisotropic. One would there-
fore also expect permeability and permeability changes to be anisotropic (cf. the ﬁeld
observation by Heffer et al., referred previously). There are few tests published in the liter-
ature where permeability anisotropy has been directly measured by monitoring both prin-
cipal components of the permeability tensor in the same test. Morita et al. (1984) showed,
using Berea sandstone, that permeability perpendicular to the direction of maximum stress
would decrease whereas permeability along this direction would remain constant during
the main part of a triaxial test. Close to failure, the rock became dilatant, and both perme-
abilities showed slight increases.

Khan and Teufel (2000) performed experiments where permeability along the core axis
was measured in comparative triaxial compression and extension tests performed on a low
(12%) porosity and low (0.1 milliDarcy) permeability sandstone, applying different stress
paths. They conclude that for decreasing stress path coefﬁcient κ (increasing γh), the per-
meability anisotropy is increasing. The permeability was always higher in the direction
along the maximum principal stress. Whereas in hydrostatic tests, the permeability evolu-
tion was essentially isotropic, the ratio between the maximum and minimum permeability
was close to 3 when κ = 0 (uniaxial load increase). The permeability along the maximum
principal stress was seen (like in the tests of Morita et al.) to increase towards the end of
the applied loading as a result of dilatancy.

There is evidence from borehole measurements in highly fractured and faulted crys-
talline rocks that indicate that the permeability of critically stressed faults can be much
higher than that of faults being far from failure (Barton et al., 1995).

On the other hand, there are several observations in the literature that permeability drops
during rock yielding and failure (Holt, 1990; Bruno, 1994; Sarda et al., 1998). This is most
often seen in high porosity and high permeability materials, and at relatively high conﬁning
pressures. Fig. 12.22 shows an example, where a triaxial test was performed with the same
(24% porosity) sandstone used for isotropic loading as shown in Fig. 12.20 at a conﬁning
pressure of 40 MPa. Again the permeability evolution correlates extremely well with the
porosity change as determined from the volumetric strain, but only until strain localization
takes place near rock failure. Then the measured permeability starts to drop at a much
higher rate than before, while the core is actually dilating. This is probably explained by
the formation of a shear band and associated crushing of grains, creating a barrier to ﬂuid
ﬂow. A most dramatic example is the observation by Holcomb and Olsson (2003), who
detected a permeability drop of 3–4 orders of magnitude when a Castlegate sandstone core
at very high conﬁnement was strained axially by 10% in a triaxial test. They interpreted

424

RESERVOIR GEOMECHANICS

the permeability drop by the formation and propagation of a horizontal compaction band
containing crushed grains.

Boutéca et al. (2000) and Schutjens et al. (2004) both summarize the behaviour of per-
meability in stress space by distinguishing between an elastic or near-elastic regime, where
permeability changes are small, and probably related mainly to porosity change. Then, as
shear stress is increased, inelastic deformation takes over gradually, and the rock eventually
fails. The permeability may then be enhanced or reduced, depending on the stress path, on
the porosity and initial permeability of the rock, and on its constitutive behaviour.

12.4.4. Geomechanics in reservoir simulation

The evolution of reservoir geomechanics calls for an implementation of geomechanical
concepts into reservoir simulation. There are two fundamentally different ways of per-
forming this:

Weakly coupled technique

A conventional reservoir simulator is used to calculate the pore pressure distribution within
the reservoir. Such a model needs as input within each cell (105–106 cells in a total simula-
tion): rock properties (porosity, the 3 components kx, ky and kz of the permeability tensor
plus pore compressibility), ﬂuid properties (saturation of oil, gas and water, viscosities and
densities for the 3 ﬂuid components), and combined rock-ﬂuid parameters (relative perme-
abilities, capillary pressure curve). In addition, well information must be included. Usually
the permeability and mechanical properties are thought to be constant over the lifetime of
the reservoir.

A large-scale geomechanical (usually ﬁnite element) model is then used to calculate the
stress changes and mechanical compaction and subsidence as a result of the pore pres-
sure reductions found by the reservoir simulation. Permeability and pore compressibility
changes can be calculated if their stress sensitivities are known, and these data can be fed
back to the reservoir simulator, which is then updated, etc. One problem here is that a
geomechanical model needs to account for the overburden, plus the rock to the sides and
underneath the reservoir. This in practice usually limits the reservoir to be represented by
104–105 elements, i.e. on a much coarser grid than in the reservoir simulation above.

Fully coupled simulation

The coupling between stresses and ﬂuid ﬂow goes back to Biot’s poroelastic theory in Sec-
tion 1.6. The idea is to use a single set of coupled governing equations that contain both the
mechanical and the ﬂuid ﬂow aspects. The beneﬁt is that a fully coupled approach is likely
to be more correct. The problem is that such a simulator is computationally more compli-
cated and hence more time-consuming. One should also have in mind that the existing Biot
theory might need modiﬁcation to account correctly for multi-phase ﬂuid saturation and
ﬂow.

GEOMECHANICAL EFFECTS ON RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE

425

More detailed descriptions of such models and their development can be found in e.g.
Lewis and Schreﬂer (1998), Osorio et al. (1998), Koutsabeloulis et al. (1994), Gutierrez
and Lewis (1998), Settari and Walters (1999), and Stone et al. (2001).

12.4.5. Seismic reservoir monitoring

Seismic reservoir monitoring (time-lapse, or “4D”-seismics) has become a powerful tool
to monitor reservoir performance. Results of repeated seismic surveys are compared, and
differences over time indicate the presence of dynamic processes in the subsurface. Such
alterations may be observed as changes in two-way travel time or as a change in a reﬂectiv-
ity of a certain reﬂector (e.g. at bottom and/or top of the reservoir). Travel time is associated
with seismic wave velocities (vp, vs), whereas seismic reﬂectivity (see Section 5.7) is re-
lated to contrast in acoustic impedance (ρvp, ρvs).

The most important sources of observable time lapse effects associated with producing
reservoirs are:
• Fluid substitution; i.e. hydrocarbons have been replaced by water due to drainage, or
replaced by an injected ﬂuid.
• Changes in temperature as a result of a cold (water) or hot (steam) injection front.
• Changes in pore pressure and reservoir stresses.

Fluid substitution

The P-wave velocity of a ﬂuid-saturated isotropic rock is given by the Biot theory. The
result in the low frequency limit, Eq. (5.39), can be written as

*+++, Hfr + Kf

vp =

φ

α2
1+ Kf
ρdry + ρfφ

φKs (α−φ)

(12.67)

Pore ﬂuid characteristics affect velocity and hence travel time through the ﬂuid bulk
modulus Kf and the ﬂuid density ρf. If oil is replaced by water, both the plane wave mod-
ulus in the numerator and the density in the denominator increase. The net effect is not
obvious and depend on the other rock parameters involved, such as the plane wave mod-
ulus Hfr of the dry frame and the porosity. Typically, brine has a bulk modulus (Kf) of
2.5 GPa, while Kf for live oil is near 0.5 GPa. The densities are approximately 1.0 and
0.6 g/cm3, respectively. In general, the ﬂuid substitution effect will be more prominent in
high than in low porosity rock, because a high porosity rock has a low Hfr, making the
ﬂuid contribution to the plane wave modulus more signiﬁcant. In such a case, the P-wave
velocity of the reservoir layer will increase if oil is replaced by water (see Fig. 5.2).

The effect of ﬂuid substitution on the reﬂection coefﬁcient (Eq. (5.82)) is larger and
more consistent, because the acoustic impedance depends on the product of the modulus

426

RESERVOIR GEOMECHANICS

and the density, which both are increased as a result of water replacing oil:
(ρdry + ρfφ)

Zp = ρvp =

Hfr + Kf

(cid:5)

*++,(cid:4)

α2
1 + Kf
(α − φ)

(12.68)

Again the effect of ﬂuid substitution is larger in high-porosity than in low-porosity reservoir
rocks.

Changes in temperature

The ﬁrst published example of successful seismic reservoir monitoring was done in con-
nection with a steam injection operation (Nur et al., 1984). In this case, the high tempera-
ture of the injection ﬂuid compared to the reservoir rock strongly promoted the observed
contrast. Also, when cold water is injected into a reservoir, thermal effects will inﬂuence
the observed response.

The effects of a temperature change are two-fold: It affects rock and ﬂuid properties, and
it leads to thermal stresses, which may alter the state of stress underground and thereby, the
velocities. These effects may be large: Water-injection often results in thermally induced
fracturing which is beneﬁcial for the EOR operation. Clearly, such changes will lead to
prominent changes in seismic behaviour. In most rocks, velocities are found in laboratory
investigations to decrease with increasing temperature; typically 5–10% when the rock is
heated from room temperature to around 100 °C. Because oil is more temperature sensitive
than brine, the effect is expected to be larger in oil than water saturated regions.

Changes in pore pressure and reservoir stresses

When a reservoir is depleted, the effective stresses are increased, as outlined in Sec-
tion 12.2.3 above. One would expect this to cause an increase in wave velocities in the
reservoir zone, since velocities in most rocks are found from laboratory experiments to
increase with increasing effective stress.

There is however a number of indications from 4D ﬁeld data (The Leading Edge, 2005)
that this effect is much smaller than anticipated. One probable reason for this is that reser-
voir rock in situ is less stress sensitive than it appears from core measurements, because
cores have been altered as a result of the coring process (Section 7.1.2). Stress release
leads to existence of microcracks in the unloaded cores. These cracks are closing during
reloading, but crack closure is unlikely to be complete and hence perfect re-establishment
of in situ behaviour can not be expected.

Intuitively, one would anticipate that a well-cemented rock in the Earth is relatively
stress insensitive. In situ stress dependence is then mainly associated with pre-existing or
evolving cracks or fractures within the reservoir. If the rock is poorly cemented so that
a number of grain contacts are not welded, stress-dependence occurs as a result of the
nonlinear (Hertzian) behaviour of these grain contacts. Also, a soft reservoir rock under-
going large depletion may compact with large porosity reduction, causing wave velocities
to increase.

WELL PROBLEMS AND RESERVOIR GEOMECHANICS

427

One should also remember that pore pressure itself affects the properties of the saturat-
ing ﬂuid independent of stress changes. The bulk modulus of oil is reduced typically with
0.01 GPa per MPa pore pressure reduction, while the bulk modulus for brine is reduced
slightly less, depending on temperature. This effect counteracts the increase in P-wave
velocity caused by effective stress increase. For a stress insensitive frame, the velocity
reduction with reducing pore pressure is in the range 0.1–0.3% per MPa, being more sig-
niﬁcant for soft rock than for hard rock, and more signiﬁcant for high than for low gas to
oil ratios (GOR).

As was also seen in Section 12.2.3, the stress evolution as a result of pore pressure
change is anisotropic, and may cause non-elastic behaviour of the reservoir rock and
even fault activation/initiation. This would clearly affect wave velocities, leading to stress-
induced anisotropy. If the pore pressure is increased (e.g. as a result of water-injection), the
effective stress is decreasing anisotropically, and non-elastic behaviour may occur for rela-
tively modest pore pressure changes: Initiation of microcracking by tensile bond breakages
may happen and lead to velocity reduction, in accord with ﬁeld observations (Landrø et al.,
2005).

We saw in Section 12.3 that stress changes and strains associated with depletion also
occur in the rock surrounding the reservoir. For the overburden above the centre of the
reservoir the vertical stress is reduced and the horizontal stress increased by stress arching
as a result of reservoir depletion. This may lead to a reduction of wave velocity for a
vertically propagating seismic wave, increasing its two-way travel time, and altering the
reﬂectivity associated with top of the reservoir. The inﬂuence zone of stress alteration is
thick—in Fig. 12.15 close to 1000 m above the reservoir—which magniﬁes the effect on
two way travel time compared to that caused by a similar velocity change in the reservoir.
There is signiﬁcant ﬁeld evidence that depletion-induced stress changes in the overburden
cause observable 4D effects (Hatchell and Bourne, 2005). Field data from Valhall (Barkved
and Kristiansen, 2005) demonstrate increased S-wave splitting associated with the stress
concentration above the edges of the reservoir. Thus, seismic observations of stress-arching
can be used to identify depleting reservoir zones and to distinguish between sealing and
non-sealing faults.

Reservoir monitoring can also be done in a passive mode, by detecting seismicity origi-
nating from within the reservoir or in the cap rock immediately above or near the reservoir
edge (Maxwell et al., 1998; Kristiansen et al., 2000). This type of monitoring is aimed at
interpreting the compaction and subsidence mechanisms and does not directly give infor-
mation about ﬂuid movements. Another technique is to monitor surface deformation with
a very high resolution using precision laser levelling. The result is inverted mathematically
(e.g. using Geertsma model described above) to ﬁnd reservoir deformation, and relate it to
mechanisms responsible for the deformations seen (e.g. thermal recovery, waste or massive
ﬂuid injection) (Dusseault and Rothenburg, 2002).

12.5. Well problems and reservoir geomechanics

There is evidence from ﬁeld operations world wide that the stability of boreholes drilled or
wells being produced are affected by stress changes described in the previous paragraphs.

428

RESERVOIR GEOMECHANICS

For example, as was pointed out in Chapter 9, stable drilling of inﬁll wells may become
difﬁcult as the producing reservoir zones are depleted. This is related to the strong decrease
of horizontal stress (and hence fracture pressure) in permeable layers, at the same time
as the pore pressure (and hence the collapse pressure) remains unchanged in ultra low
permeability shale layers within or just above the top of the reservoir. The mud weight
window eventually closes at a critical amount of pore pressure reduction.

Sand failure is also affected by the changing stress ﬁeld during depletion, as was dis-
cussed in Chapter 10. Onset of shear failure in the perforation cavities or in an open
producing hole is controlled by the rock strength and by the far ﬁeld effective stress
(Eq. (10.8)). The increase in far ﬁeld effective stress caused by pore pressure reduction
enhances the risk of sand production. Pressure maintenance by water injection may re-
sult in reduction of formation strength and therefore also lead to increased risk of particle
production as the reservoir is being produced.

12.5.1. Casing damage

A most signiﬁcant well problem associated with a compacting reservoir is casing damage.
Several examples have been documented in the literature, such as from the Ekoﬁsk Field
and the Valhall Field, North Sea, and from the Belridge Field and the Wilmington Field,
California (Schwall et al., 1996; Kristiansen et al., 2000; Fredrich et al., 1998; Dusseault et
al., 2001). Casing damage becomes an operational problem when the casing is deformed
or bent (by creation of dog-legs) so much that it prevents workovers and recompletions
(Cernocky and Scholibo, 1995). This necessitates costly drilling of a side-track well.

The main mechanisms responsible for casing damage are compressional, shear, tensile
and bending deformations (Veeken et al., 1994; Cernocky and Scholibo, 1995; Fredrich et
al., 1998; Dusseault et al., 2001). The mechanisms are illustrated in Fig. 12.23.

In a compacting zone, the casing strain in a vertical well is assumed to be equal to the
formation strain. This is based on an assumption of no axial slip, and uniform reservoir
compaction. If the well is deviated, the casing strain equals the component of formation
strain along the well direction. Thus, a deviated well is preferable to a vertical well in order
to reduce compressive casing damage. The risk of casing buckling is highest in unsupported
intervals, for instance near sand producing perforations where the pressure drawdown is
also most severe, wherever the cement gives poor support, or at connections. Based on
analytical and numerical modelling, Cernocky and Scholibo (1995) found that 0.5–0.75%
casing strain may be thought of as an upper limit for an unsupported 10 ft section. Bruno
(2002) argued that casing compaction of 1% or less is unlikely to impair casing integrity.
Deformation of the casing cross-section due to non-uniform lateral loading is referred
to as “crushing” (Cernocky and Scholibo, 1995). This is mainly a problem in reservoir
zones with large depletion, and where the formation is very soft. In their ﬁnite element
simulations, Cernocky and Scholibo) chose a “crushing limit” (i.e. the maximum tolerable
decrease of the inner diameter) of 0.3
(7.5 mm), based on ﬁeld experience. They found
that a low diameter : thickness ratio of the casing (say 10 or thereabout) is a key to reduce
crushing risk in highly compactive sands. If a large diameter : thickness ratio is used (say
20 or so), the crushing risk is much higher for a horizontal or deviated well than for a
vertical one. For a low diameter : thickness ratio, the well angle plays a minor role.

Fig. 12.23. Casing damage scenarios (after Veeken et al., 1994).

Casing damage by shear is caused by high shear stresses within the rock (Dusseault
et al., 2001). Most often casing shear occurs near lithology interfaces (shale-sand) in the
overburden, along faults, or at the top of production and injection intervals inside the reser-
voir. In the overburden, shear damage to the casing most likely takes place near the ﬂanks
of the reservoir, where the vertical stress is increased and the horizontal stress decreased
as a result of depletion, leading to possible fault reactivation. An example was given in
Section 9.7.1 (Maury and Zurdo, 1996). Casing shear may also occur in the crestal region
above the reservoir, where the vertical stress is reduced and the horizontal stress increased
as a result of stress arching.

The decrease in vertical stress above a depleting reservoir also may lead to tensional
casing damage. As for compaction strain, tensile strain is also transferred directly to
the casing. Several cases of tensile casing damages were observed in the Belridge ﬁeld
(Fredrich et al., 1998). Thermal expansion due to steam injection may also be a cause of
tensile casing failures.

Casing bending may occur at locations of non-uniform compaction, such as in a deviated

well near the top or bottom of a depleting reservoir zone.

Mitigation of casing failure ﬁrst of all requires a good picture of the stress and strain
evolution within and outside the reservoir, and in particular to locate possibly reactivated
faults and sites of massive particle production. Hence, geomechanical simulations are nec-
essary. These may be used to select well positions and well angles that reduce the risk of
casing damage as much as possible. Dusseault et al. (2001) recommends in particular to
increase the compliance of the wellbore–casing system (increased casing diameter, use of
highly ductile cement) as a remedy against casing shear damage, while casing strength ap-
pears to be of minor importance. Kristiansen et al. (2000) found that events located from
microseismic monitoring in the Valhall Field, North Sea, were spatially correlated with
locations of casing collapse. They used this information to achieve optimum casing design
in the highest risk areas.

RESERVOIR GEOMECHANICS

12.5.2. Reservoir geomechanics as a tool to optimize drilling and production

strategies

This section has demonstrated that well problems associated with drilling and production
are strongly linked to the geomechanical response of the reservoir. Drilling instabilities,
sand production and casing damage are triggered by depletion. This calls for a geomechani-
cal analysis predicting stress changes and strain evolution within and outside the reservoir,
based on different production scenarios. Such analyses will provide information like at
what time and where inﬁll wells have to be drilled in order to minimize stability problems,
and where casing damage mitigation is required.

Stress arching in general reduces reservoir compaction and associated well problems
within the reservoir. On the other hand, the stress changes within and around the reser-
voir become more pronounced, which leads to more well failures in the overburden. Stress
arching may however to some extent be controlled by the order in which reservoir compart-
ments are produced, by pressure maintenance, or by thermal stresses generated as a result
of ﬂuid injection. This opens up possibilities to use geomechanics actively—and through
4D and microseismic monitoring—interactively, as a part of reservoir management.

Appendix A

Rock properties

435

The following tables are included in this appendix:
• Table A.1—Static mechanical properties for some common rock types and materials.
• Table A.2—Static mechanical properties for some speciﬁc rocks.
• Table A.3—Density, elastic moduli and sound velocities for some common materials.
• Table A.4—Sound velocities for some common rock types.
• Table A.5—Thermal properties for some rocks and materials.
The data are compiled from the sources given in the list below. Elastic moduli are from

tests under unconﬁned or near unconﬁned (low conﬁning pressure) conditions.

Note: For most rocks, material properties such as elastic moduli, strength parameters
and sound velocities vary from rock sample to rock sample, in addition to being depen-
dent on measurement conditions (stress, temperature, saturation). Also, material properties
are often anisotropic. We have therefore chosen to indicate expected intervals (Tables A.1
and A.4) for the properties. In Tables A.2, A.3 and A.5, when some speciﬁc materials are
referred to, the values are taken from a speciﬁc experiment and need not be representative
for other experiments with the same type of rock.

There may also be slight variations in the numbers given by different sources.

Appendix C

Mathematical background

C.1. Introduction

When using the ﬁrst edition of this book as a basis for a course in Petroleum Related Rock
Mechanics, we have repeatedly had the request for a refreshment of some mathematical
background material, in particular linear algebra. This appendix is an attempt to respond
to these requests.

This appendix is not a full tutorial, and we do not attempt to provide full mathematical
rigour in the presentation. Still, we hope that this appendix may be useful for readers that
need a repetition of some central mathematical methods. We also hope that this appendix
may make it easier to read some of the literature in the ﬁeld.

C.2. Matrices

A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers or other mathematical objects. The elements of
a matrix are normally referred to by two indices. The ﬁrst index refers to the rows and the
second to the columns.
An example of a 3 × 3 matrix is thus

C.2.1. The transpose of a matrix

The transpose of a matrix is the matrix found by interchanging the rows and columns of a
matrix. The transpose of a is often denoted by aT. The transpose of the matrix in Eq. (C.1)
is

the diagonal:

MATHEMATICAL BACKGROUND

In component notation this may be written as

aij = aj i

(C.4)

C.2.3. Diagonal matrix

A diagonal matrix is a square matrix in which only the diagonal elements are nonzero.
Sometimes the following notation is used:

diag(a, b, c) =

C.2.4. Matrix addition

Two matrices of the same size are added by adding corresponding elements. As an example,
for two 2 × 2 matrices we have

(cid:4)

a11 + b11
a21 + b21

a12 + b12
a22 + b22

a + b =

C.2.5. Multiplication by a scalar

A matrix is multiplied by a scalar by multiplying all elements with the scalar. For example

(cid:4)

ka = k

C.2.6. Matrix multiplication
The product of an n× l matrix a and an l × m matrix b is a matrix in which the ij element
is given by

(cid:6)

Thus, for two 2 × 2 matrices we get

(cid:4)

a11b12 + a12b22
a21b12 + a22b22
Matrix multiplication is non-commutative, i.e. in general we have

MATRICES

Matrix multiplication is associative, i.e.

a(bc) = (ab)c = abc

Matrix multiplication is distributive, i.e.

a(b + c) = ab + ac

C.2.7. The identity matrix

447

(C.11)

(C.12)

A square matrix with all diagonal elements equal to 1 and all other elements equal to 0 is
called the identity matrix, and is often denoted by I.

We see that we must have

aI = Ia = a

(C.13)

Note that on component form the identity matrix can be written using the Kronecker δ (see
page 460):

Iij = δij

(C.14)

C.2.8. The inverse matrix
A square matrix (n × n matrix) a is said to be non-singular if an inverse matrix, denoted
by a

−1 exists. The inverse matrix is deﬁned by the following relations

(C.15)

(C.16)

(C.17)

The inverse of a 2 × 2 matrix is

a13a21 − a11a23
a11a22 − a12a21

where the determinant |a| of the matrix is deﬁned by Eq. (C.21) below.

C.2.9. The trace of a matrix

The trace of a square matrix is deﬁned as the sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix.
On component form we thus may write

(cid:6)

tr(a) =

aii

i

(C.18)

448

MATHEMATICAL BACKGROUND

The trace of a matrix product is independent of the order of the factors

tr(ab) = tr(ba)

(C.19)

Sometimes the trace of a matrix is denoted by Sp(a), from the German word Spur.

C.2.10. Determinants

The determinant is another characteristic number associated with a square matrix a, and is
denoted by |a| or det(a). We shall not discuss determinants in general here, but note that
for a 2 × 2 matrix the determinant is given by

(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8) a11
(cid:3)

a21

a12

(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8) = a11a22 − a21a12

and for a 3 × 3 matrix by

(cid:2)

The determinant of the product of two matrices is equal to the product of the determi-

nants, i.e.

|ab| = |a||b|

From this equation and Eq. (C.15) it follows that

since |I| = 1.
It is clear from Eqs. (C.20) and (C.21) that

|a

−1| = 1|a|

|aT| = |a|

(C.27)

(C.24)
for 2 × 2 and 3 × 3 matrices. This relation is valid in general.
From Eq. (C.17) we see that the 3 × 3 matrix is singular (the inverse does not exist) if
the determinant is zero. This is also a generally valid property.

C.2.11. Systems of linear equations

Matrices form an efﬁcient way of writing a system of linear equations. For instance, we
may write the system

a11x1 + a12x2 = b1
a21x1 + a22x2 = b2

as

ax = b

MATRICES

where a is the 2 × 2 matrix

while x and b are the column vectors (or 2 × 1 matrices)

Assuming a to have an inverse, the solution of Eq. (C.27) may be written as

x = a

−1b

Homogeneous systems

If all bi are zero, we have a homogeneous system:
ax = 0

449

(C.28)

(C.29)

(C.30)

(C.31)

Then the formal solution (C.30) assuming a to be invertible only allows the trivial solution
x = 0, which is normally not useful.
To get non-trivial solutions for a homogeneous system, the matrix a must thus be singu-

lar, i.e. its determinant must be zero:

|a| =0

(C.32)

C.2.12. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors

The equation

ax = λx

(C.33)
where a is an n × n matrix, x is a column vector (or n × 1 matrix) and λ is a scalar (i.e. a
number, in general complex), is called the eigenvalue equation for the matrix a. The values
of λ for which Eq. (C.33) has non-trivial solutions for x are called the eigenvalues of the
matrix.

We see from Eq. (C.32) that we may ﬁnd the eigenvalues by solving the determinant

equation

(C.34)
Eq. (C.34) is used to determine the principal stresses and strains in Eqs. (1.31) and (1.81).
An n × n matrix has n eigenvalues λi, some or all of which may coincide. If we insert
an eigenvalue, e.g. λ1 into (C.33), we get the equation

|a − λI| =0

ax = λ1x

(C.35)

450

MATHEMATICAL BACKGROUND

which has a non-trivial solution for x. The solution is called the eigenvector corresponding
to λ1. There are n eigenvectors for an n× n matrix. The eigenvectors are (or can be chosen
to be) linearly independent (orthogonal). Eqs. (1.32)–(1.34) are an example of the use of
Eq. (C.35).

It can be shown that the eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix with real elements are real.

C.2.13. Similarity transforms and orthogonal transforms

If we have a non-singular matrix S, the transform

−1

SaS

(C.36)

is called a similarity transform of a.

We see that since

|SaS

−1 − λI| = |SaS

−1 − SλIS

−1| = |S||a − λI||S

−1| = |a − λI|

(C.37)

the eigenvalues are unchanged by a similarity transform. It can also be shown that the trace
and the determinant of the matrix are left unchanged by the similarity transform. (We leave
this to the reader as a simple exercise, use Eqs. (C.19) and (C.22).)

A matrix O which fulﬁls

−1 = OT

O

(C.38)

is called an orthogonal matrix.
It follows from I = OOT that
δik =

(cid:6)

j

Oij (OT)j k =

(cid:6)

j

Oij Okj

(C.39)

which shows that the row vectors of O (i.e. the vectors formed by the rows of O) are
orthogonal, and that their length is 1. From I = OTO one may show that the same applies
to the column vectors (the vectors formed by the columns of O).

It is clear that an orthogonal transform, deﬁned by

OaOT

(C.40)

is a subset of the similarity transforms, and thus preserves the trace, the determinant and
the eigenvalues.

Any symmetric matrix with real elements can be diagonalized, i.e. transformed to a

diagonal matrix, by an orthogonal transformation.

VECTORS AND COORDINATE TRANSFORMS

451

From I = OOT and Eq. (C.24) it follows that |O| = ±1. We will see below that a
rotation of the coordinate system corresponds to an orthogonal transform. A matrix with
|O| =1 corresponds to a proper rotation, which preserves the “handedness” of the coordi-
nate system. If |O| = −1 a reﬂection is involved, indicating that the transform is taking a
right-handed coordinate system into a left-handed, or vice versa.

C.3. Vectors and coordinate transforms

A vector is a geometric object, independent of the coordinate system we use. We can
visualize a vector as an arrow with a given direction and length, which makes the previous
statement obvious.

Let us assume that we have a vector in some coordinate system xyz, and want to express
rotated relative to the ﬁrst one. This may be

it in some other coordinate system x

y

z

(cid:2)

Since both the starting coordinate system and the ﬁnal coordinate system are orthogonal,
and the length of a vector is the same in both systems, we may infer some conditions on the
transformation matrix a. One will see that the column vectors must all have length unity,
and they are orthogonal. The same applies to the row vectors.

The matrix a is thus an orthogonal matrix. The conditions imposed reduce the number
of independent elements in a to 3, which means that it takes 3 parameters to specify an
arbitrary rotation in space.

To transform from the new coordinate system back to the old, we must use the inverse

matrix. Since the matrix is orthogonal, we have

the direction cosines used e.g. in Section 1.1.5 on page 8 and Section 4.3.1 on page 146:

C.4. Tensors and coordinate transforms

Like vectors, tensors are geometric objects that have a meaning independent of coordinate
systems. Unlike vectors, we do not have an intuitive picture of what the tensor object is.

One possible picture is to view a second order tensor as a machine that accepts one
vector as input, and returns an other. For example, the stress tensor may be seen as an
object that given a unit vector in space computes the force per unit area in that direction.

Let us denote a second order tensor by T, and the vectors it relate by f and r. We thus

have

f = Tr

(C.48)

If we now transform the coordinate system according to the orthogonal matrix a, we

have

(cid:2) = af = a(Tr) = aT(aTa)r = (aTaT)r
f
which shows that the second order tensor transforms according to

(cid:2)

(cid:2) = aTaT
T

(C.49)

(C.50)

which is an orthogonal transform.

If we write this equation on component form, we ﬁnd

A tensor is an object that transforms as a vector in each of its indices.
Without further discussion, we state that higher order tensors transform according to the

same rule. For example, the 4th order stiffness tensor transforms according to

C.5. Eigenvalues, eigenvectors and diagonalization

We have seen that a real symmetric matrix has real eigenvalues, and that any real symmetric
matrix can be diagonalized by an orthogonal transformation. We have further seen that
an orthogonal transformation of a second order tensor may be seen as a rotation of the
coordinate system.

ROTATION OF THE COORDINATE SYSTEM: THE EULER ANGLES

453

We have also observed that an orthogonal transformation does not change the eigenval-
ues of a matrix. Since it is easy to see that the eigenvalues of a diagonal matrix are the
diagonal elements themselves, it is clear that there is a connection between the eigenvalues
and the diagonalization process: By diagonalizing a matrix, we get the eigenvalues as the
diagonal elements.

To make the picture complete, we now need to clarify the connection between the eigen-

vectors and the orthogonal transformation matrix.

By diagonalizing a second order tensor, we change to a new coordinate system in which
it is diagonal. The eigenvectors give the directions of the new coordinate axes referred
to the initial coordinate system. The length of the eigenvectors is not speciﬁed by the
eigenvalue equation (multiplying x by a number obviously does not invalidate Eq. (C.33)).
However, by scaling the eigenvector to unit length, we see that its components can be
identiﬁed with the direction cosines. If we write

for the normalized eigenvector associated with the ﬁrst eigenvalue, and similarly for the
other eigenvectors, we may use Eq. (C.47) to write down the orthogonal transformation
matrix as

C.6. Rotation of the coordinate system: The Euler angles

We discussed above that to specify an arbitrary rotation of the coordinate system in space,
3 parameters are required.

There are many ways to specify a rotation of the coordinate system, one option is the di-
rection cosines used for instance in Section 1.1.5 on page 8 and Section 4.3.1 on page 146.
We saw from Eq. (C.47) on page 452 how the direction cosines, specifying the orienta-
tion of the new coordinate axes, constitute the elements of the orthogonal transformation
matrix. Since there are 9 direction cosines, they are obviously not independent.

A convenient choice if we want 3 independent parameters are the Euler angles φ, θ

and β, which one will often see in the literature.

One must be aware that there are several conventions for the deﬁnition of the Euler
angles. Here we shall use the one adopted by Rose (1957), which deﬁnes the angles in the
following way
• a rotation φ about the original z-axis,
• a rotation θ about the new y-axis,
• a rotation β about the new z-axis.

454

MATHEMATICAL BACKGROUND

It will be seen that φ and θ specify the direction of the new z-axis in conventional spherical
coordinates, while β speciﬁes the rotation of the x–y axes relative to the starting position
resulting from the rotations given by φ and θ.
The same ﬁnal rotation may be obtained by the following rotations about the initial axes:
• a rotation β about the original z-axis,
• a rotation θ about the original y-axis,
• a rotation φ about the original z-axis.
To build the rotation matrix for a full Euler rotation, we thus need the matrices for
(cid:2)
(cid:2)

rotations about the y-axis and the z-axis. These are

(C.56)

Rz(β) is found by exchanging φ with β in Rz(φ).

The signs have been chosen such that multiplying these matrices with a vector in the old
system, one ﬁnds the coordinates of that vector in the rotated system. To ﬁnd the direc-
tion of the axes of the new system expressed in the old system, one must use the inverse
matrices, which are the same as the transposed matrices since the matrices are orthogonal.
By using the matrices in sequence, it is now simple to ﬁnd the rotation matrix corre-

sponding to a rotation speciﬁed by the three Euler angles. The result is

(cid:2)

R(φ, θ, β) = Rz(β)Ry (θ )Rz(φ)
cos θ cos φ cos β − sin φ sin β

are invariants of linear, quadratic, cubic and quartic degree. It is obvious how 5th and higher
order invariants are constructed in the same way. It should however be noted that only the
ﬁrst three invariants are truly independent, the higher invariants may be expressed as a sum
of combinations of the three ﬁrst.

In rock mechanics, these invariants are not used directly, except for the ﬁrst. The standard
rock mechanical invariants are deﬁned by writing the third degree equation resulting from
Eq. (1.31) as

σ 3 − I1σ 2 − I2σ − I3 = 0

(C.71)

Since the solution of the equation are the principal stresses, it is obvious that the coefﬁ-
cients are invariants. (Beware that sometimes Eq. (C.71) is written with a +-sign in front
of the I2-term, leading to the opposite sign for I2.)

By expanding Eq. (1.31), and comparing with Eq. (C.71), the expressions (1.39) to (1.41)
follow. The relations between the rock mechanical invariants and those derived in this

C.9. Some trigonometric formulas

In computations with stresses and strains, trigonometric formulas are used extensively.
Here we repeat some of the basic formulas:

cos(α ± β) = cos α cos β ∓ sin α sin β
sin(α ± β) = sin α cos β ± sin β cos α

cos 2θ = cos2 θ − sin2 θ = 2 cos2 θ − 1 = 1 − 2 sin2 θ

C.10. The Voigt notation spelled out

Since the stress and strain tensors are symmetrical, they may be mapped into 6 component
vectors. Similarly, because of the symmetries of the stiffness and compliance tensors, they
may be mapped into symmetric 6 × 6 matrices.
One way to do this is to use the Voigt notation (Voigt, 1910). This method is the com-
monly adopted, in spite of the fact that it has some theoretical short-comings. (See e.g.
Helbig, 1994, 1995.)

The Voigt mapping for the stiffness tensor was introduced on page 39, in this section we

treat it in more detail.

458

MATHEMATICAL BACKGROUND

The Voigt notation is the mapping in which pairs of indices are mapped into a single

index according to

11 → 1
22 → 2
33 → 3
23 → 4
31 → 5
12 → 6

(C.86)

(C.88)
(C.89)
(C.90)
(C.91)

For the stress tensor and the stiffness tensor, the mapping is direct, whereas for the strain

and the compliance tensors, some numerical constants are necessary, as shown below.

C.11. The Einstein summing convention and other notation

conventions

In this book we have attempted to use as explicit notation as possible, to minimize the risk
for confusion.

There exist, however, a number of notation conventions that are so widely used that they
are not always deﬁned in books and papers that use them. Such conventions make equations
more compact (and actually easier to read when one is accustomed to them), and include
the Einstein summing convention and operator and comma notation for partial derivatives.
If one tries to read a work using these conventions without being familiar with them,
many equations may appear quite confusing. To make it easier for the reader to understand
such papers, we include a short overview of these notation conventions here.

C.11.1. The Einstein summing convention

The Einstein summing convention states that when an index is repeated in certain expres-
sions, a summation is implied. For example, if we assume that the index runs from 1 to 3,
we have

(C.96)

(C.97)

aii = a11 + a22 + a33

aii

def= 3(cid:6)
def= 3(cid:6)

i=1

j=1

and

aij bj k

aij bj k = ai1b1k + ai2b2k + ai3b3k

The expression may be a single quantity with multiple indices, or a product. A summa-

tion over i is thus not implied in a sum like the following

ai = bi + ci

(C.98)

460

MATHEMATICAL BACKGROUND

C.11.2. Kronecker’s delta

A symbol that one will often encounter, both in conjunction with the summing convention
and otherwise, is Kronecker’s δ. It is deﬁned by

(cid:31)

(C.99)

(C.100)

It is easy to see that

(cid:6)

i

def=

δij

1 if i = j
0 if i (cid:8)= j

δii = δ11 + δ22 + δ33 = 3

C.11.3. Comma notation for partial derivatives

A partial derivative is sometimes denoted by a subscript preceded by a comma, i.e. (f is a
scalar)

f,j

def= ∂f
∂xj

(C.101)

A second order derivative is indicated in a similar way (gi is here component i of a vector)

gi,j k

def= ∂2gi
∂xj ∂xk

(C.102)

In this notation, the volumetric strain (see Eq. (1.76)) will be written as (we here also use
the summing convention)

εvol = ui,i

and the equation of equilibrium (Eq. (1.17)) as

σj i,j + ρXi = 0

Sometimes, differentiation with respect to time is shown in a similar way, e.g.

ui,t t

def= ∂2ui
∂t 2

(C.103)

(C.104)

(C.105)

An example of a central reference using this notation is Detournay and Cheng (1993).

C.11.4. Operator notation for partial derivatives

Sometimes, an operator notation is used for partial derivatives:

def= ∂xi f

∂i f

def= ∂f
∂xi

(C.106)

D.3.1. Stresses at a crack tip

A crack tip may experience three types of loading, commonly denoted Mode I (opening),
Mode II (in-plane shear) and Mode III (out-of-plane shear), respectively. The three loading
modes are illustrated in Fig. D.1.

For an elliptical crack, the stresses at the crack tip can be expressed as

σij = KM√
2π r

f (M)
ij

(D.58)
where M = I, II or III, and KM represents the stress intensity factor of mode M. KM de-
pends on the farﬁeld stress and the crack length (as shown in Eq. (6.64) for KI).

The functions f (M)

These solutions approach the linear solutions given in Section 6.4.1 for low concentra-
tions of inclusions. Berryman also showed that if the material contains non-solid inclu-
sions, the effective shear modulus vanish at a critical concentration of that inclusion. The
critical concentration depends on the shape of the inclusions.

F (α|m) and E(α|m) are elliptic integrals of the ﬁrst and second kind of parameter m,
respectively. K(m) = F ( π
|m) are complete elliptic integrals of the

When working with elliptic integrals, it is important to be aware that there exist many
different conventions for the deﬁnitions of the arguments, even for the order of the argu-
ments. In the convention used here, the integrals are given by

The elliptic integrals are available in modern integrated mathematics computer pro-
grams, like Maple or Mathematica and others. Given the availability of such a program,
it is an easy and quick task to code and study the consequences of Geertsma’s equations.

In Table D.1 we give some numerical values for the integrals, to make it easy to check

an implementation. Full tables of the integrals are found in Geertsma (1973).
