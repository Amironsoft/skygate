9610011v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/9610011v1	1996	The Non-Organic Theory of the Genesis of Petroleum	Samar Abbas	  Recent advances in interdisciplinary fields as diverse as astrophysics, cosmogeophysics, nuclear geology, etc. have led to interesting developments in the non-organic theory of the genesis of petroleum. This theory, which holds that petroleum is of an abiogenic primordial origin, provides an explanation for certain features of petroleum geology that are hard to explain within the standard organic framework. If the non-organic theory is correct, then hydrocarbon reserves would be enormous and almost inexhaustable.

The theoretical basis of both approaches is shortly outlined before showing a laboratory and a field application.

Typically, this is done using spatial interpolation methods or by reproducing patterns from a reference image. However, these algorithms fail to produce realistic patterns and do not exhibit the wide range of uncertainty inherent in the prediction of geology. In this paper, we show how semantic inpainting with Generative Adversarial Networks can be used to generate varied realizations of geology which honor physical measurements while matching the expected geological patterns. In contrast to other algorithms, our method scales well with the number of data points and mimics a distribution of patterns as opposed to a single pattern or image. The generated conditional samples are state of the art.

Firstly we shall construct a model in which $2^{\aleph_{\omega_1}}=2^{\aleph_{\omega_1+1}}=\aleph_{\omega_1+3}$ but there is a jointly universal family of size $\aleph_{\omega_1+2}$ of graphs on $\aleph_{\omega_1+1}$. We take a supercompact cardinal $\kappa$ and will use Radin forcing with interleaved collapses to change $\kappa$ into $\aleph_{\omega_1}$. Prior to the Radin forcing we perform a preparatory iteration to add functions from $\kappa^+$ into Radin names for what will become members of the jointly universal family on $\kappa^+$. The same technique can be used with any uncountable cardinal in place of $\omega_1$.   Secondly we explore various topics in set-theoretic geology. We begin by showing that a class Easton support iteration of $\mathrm{Add}(\kappa,1)$ at $\kappa$ regular results in a universe that is its own generic mantle. We then consider set forcings $\mathbb{P}$, $\mathbb{Q}$, $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{S}$ with respective generics $G$, $H$, $I$ and $J$ such that $V[G][I]=V[H][J]$ and show that $V[G]$ and $V[H]$ must have a shared ground via $(|\mathbb{R}|+|\mathbb{S}|)^+$-cc forcing. This allows a similar analysis of the related situation when $\mathbb{P}$ is replaced by a class iteration and $V[H]$ by a generic ground of $V[G]$. We conclude with a simple characterisation of the mantle of a class forcing extension, and an investigation of the possibilities for a version of the intermediate model theorem that applies to class forcing.

It can represent a valuable tool for science education, not only for teaching geography and geology, but also physics. Here we suggest that Google Earth can be used for introducing in an attractive way the physics of waves.

Roe	  The densities passed through for neutrinos going from Fermilab to Sanford lab are obtained using two recent density tables, crustal [1] and Shen-Ritzwoller[2], as well as the values from an older table PEMC[3]. 	
0507003v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/q-bio/0507003v1	2005	The Mediterranean deep-sea fauna: historical evolution, bathymetric   variations and geographical changes	Christian Emig|Patrick Geistdoerfer	  The deep-water fauna of the Mediterranean is characterized by an absence of distinctive characteristics and by a relative impoverishment. Both are a result of events after the Messinian salinity crisis (Late Miocene). The three main classes of phenomena involved in producing or recording these effects are analysed and discussed: - Historical: Sequential faunal changes during the Pliocene and thereafter in particular those during the Quaternary glaciations and still in progress. - Bathymetric: Changes in the vertical aspects of the Bathyal and Abyssal zones that took place under peculiar conditions, i.e. homothermy, a relative oligotrophy, the barrier of the Gibraltar sill, and water mass movement. The deeper the habitat of a species in the Mediterranean, the more extensive is its distribution elsewhere. - Geographical: There are strong affinities and relationships between Mediterranean and Atlantic faunas. Endemic species remain a biogeographical problem. Species always become smaller in size eastward where they occupy a progressively deeper habitat. Thus, the existing deep Mediterranean Sea appears to be younger than any other deep-sea constituent of the World Ocean. 	
1001.4158v4	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1001.4158v4	2011	On the Correct Use of Statistical Tests: Reply to "Lies, damned lies and   statistics (in Geology)"	D. Sornette|V. Pisarenko	  In a Forum published in EOS Transactions AGU (2009) entitled "Lies, damned lies and statistics (in Geology)", Vermeesch (2009) claims that "statistical significant is not the same as geological significant", in other words, statistical tests may be misleading. In complete contradiction, we affirm that statistical tests are always informative. We detail the several mistakes of Vermeesch in his initial paper and in his comments to our reply. The present text is developed in the hope that it can serve as an illuminating pedagogical exercise for students and lecturers to learn more about the subtleties, richness and power of the science of statistics. 	
1603.03625v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.03625v1	2016	Mineralogy and Geology of asteroid (4) Vesta from Dawn Framing Camera	Guneshwar Thangjam	  This thesis presents insights into the surface compositional heterogeneity and geology of asteroid Vesta. Lithologic mapping using Framing Camera onboard the NASA Dawn spacecraft revealed that the majority of the surface is howarditic in composition (Thangjam et al. 2013). An important outcome of this thesis is identification of olivine-rich exposures for the first time using FC color data (Thangjam et al., 2014). Another significant contribution from this thesis is an innovative three-dimensional approach of spectral analysis that could be used to study surface compositional heterogeneity of Vesta (Thangjam et al., 2016). The three band parameter space with defined polyhedrons is more advanced and robust compared to the generally used two-dimensional spectral analysis i.e., two band parameter space. A revised petrologic evolution model is presented to explain the ongoing problem of missing olivine-rich mantle of Vesta and also the petrogenesis of HED meteorites (howardite, eucrite, diogenite clan of stony achondrites). 	
1607.05068v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.05068v1	2016	Numerical modelling of shaking effects due to strong motions on the   tiber alluvial deposits in Rome (Italy)	Fabian Bonilla|Francesca Bozzano|Céline Gelis|Anna Chiara Giacomi|Luca Lenti|Salvatore Martino|Maria Paola Santisi d'Avila|Jean-François Semblat	  A multidisciplinary approach is proposed for evaluating the effects of shaking due to strong motions on the Tiber river alluvial deposits in Rome's historical centre. At this aim, a detailed 3D geological model of the Tiber river alluvial deposit has been constructed and a numerical analysis of site response was performed along two geological sections across the historical centre of Rome. The numerical models were performed in both 1D and 2D configurations assuming linear and nonlinear conditions, by applying a three component seismic input. The results show that the maximum shear strains are strongly conditioned by the layer geometries (i.e. 2D or 1D conditions) and by the soil heterogeneity. Moreover, the reliability of the maximum strains obtained by numerical modeling is discussed comparing these values respect to both the volumetric and the degradation dynamic thresholds of the considered soils.

Jorge	  Low oil prices have motivated energy executives to look into cost reduction in their supply chains more seriously. To this end, a new technology that is experimentally considered in hydrocarbon exploration is data mining. There are two major categories of geoscientific problems in which data mining is applied: structural geology and reservoir property-issues. This research overviews these categories by considering a variety of interesting works in each of them. The result is an understanding of the specific geoscientific problems studied in the literature, along with the relative data mining methods. This way, this work tries to lay the ground for a mutual understanding on oil and gas exploration between the data miners and the geoscientists. 	
9701104v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9701104v1	1997	The "human" statistics of terrestrial impact cratering rate	Lauri Jetsu	  The most significant periodicities in the terrestrial impact crater record are due to the human-signal: the bias of assigning integer values for the crater ages. This bias seems to have eluded the proponents and opponents of real periodicity in the occurrence of these events, as well as the theorists searching for an extraterrestrial explanation for such periodicity. The human-signal should be seriously considered by scientists in astronomy, geology and paleontology when searching for a connection between terrestrial major comet or asteroid impacts and mass extinctions of species.

Mohanty	  Clumped dark matter arises naturally within the framwork of generic cosmological dark matter models. Invoking the existence of dark matter clumps can also solve may unexplained mysteries in astrophysics and geology or geophysics, eg. the galactic gamma-ray halo and the periodic terrestrial flood basalt volcanic episodes. Clumped dark matter is dynamically stable to friction and will not heat the disk. Such clumps may have already been discovered in the form of dwarf spheroidals, and further searches are encouraged by the results of this paper. 	
0507173v4	http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0507173v4	2005	Sorption heat engines: simple inanimate negative entropy generators	Anthonie W. J. Muller|Dirk Schulze-Makuch	  The name 'sorption heat engines' is proposed for simple negative entropy generators that are driven by thermal cycling and work on alternating adsorption and desorption. These generators are in general not explicitly recognized as heat engines. Their mechanism is applicable to the fields of engineering, physics, chemistry, geology, and biology, in particular the origin of life. Four kinds of sorption heat engines are distinguished depending on the occurrence of changes in the adsorbent or adsorbate during the thermal cycle. 	
0804.0308v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/0804.0308v1	2008	On the Truncated Pareto Distribution with applications	Lorenzo Zaninetti|Mario Ferraro	  The Pareto probability distribution is widely applied in different fields such us finance, physics, hydrology, geology and astronomy. This note deals with an application of the Pareto distribution to astrophysics and more precisely to the statistical analysis of mass of stars and of diameters of asteroids. In particular a comparison between the usual Pareto distribution and its truncated version is presented. Finally a possible physical mechanism that produces Pareto tails for the distribution of the masses of stars is suggested. 	
0811.3136v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/0811.3136v1	2008	Geological flows	Yu. N. Bratkov	  In this paper geology and planetology are considered using new conceptual basis of high-speed flow dynamics. Recent photo technics allow to see all details of a flow, 'cause the flow is static during very short time interval. On the other hand, maps and images of many planets are accessible. Identity of geological flows and high-speed gas dynamics is demonstrated. There is another time scale, and no more. All results, as far as the concept, are new and belong to the author. No formulae, pictures only.

We were surprised to find bentonite clay as the major constituent of the bangle shard. Also we have used knowledge of the mineralogical structure determined through X-ray diffraction and results of thermal analysis to predict value of firing temperature of the bangle shard.

Ferraro	  In this chapter first the statistics of the standard and truncated Pareto distributions are derived and used to fit empirical values of asteroids diameters from different families, namely, Koronis, Eos and Themis, and from the Astorb database. A theoretical analysis is then carried out and two possible physical mechanisms are suggested that account for Pareto tails in distributions of asteroids diameter. 	
1310.3732v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.3732v1	2013	Geo-neutrinos	G. Bellini|A. Ianni|L. Ludhova|F. Mantovani|W. F. McDonough	  We review a new interdisciplinary field between Geology and Physics: the study of the Earth's geo-neutrino flux. We describe competing models for the composition of the Earth, present geological insights into the make up of the continental and oceanic crust, those parts of the Earth that concentrate Th and U, the heat producing elements, and provide details of the regional settings in the continents and oceans where operating and planned detectors are sited. Details are presented for the only two operating detectors that are capable of measuring the Earth's geo-neutrinos flux: Borexino and KamLAND; results achieved to date are presented, along with their impacts on geophysical and geochemical models of the Earth. Finally, future planned experiments are highlighted. 	
1401.0508v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.0508v1	2014	The Giza "written" landscape and the double project of King Khufu	Giulio Magli	  In recent years, different scientific disciplines, from Physics to Egyptology, from Geology to Archaeoastronomy, evidenced a series of clues pointing to the possibility that the original project of the pyramid complex of Khufu at Giza included also the project of the second pyramid complex at the same site, that of Khafra. The aim of the present paper is to discuss this issue in a systematic fashion and to explore its consequences on the way the ancient Egyptians conceived and built monuments and entire landscapes during the Old Kingdom. 	
1506.05216v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.05216v1	2015	The k-NN algorithm for compositional data: a revised approach with and   without zero values present	Michail Tsagris	  In compositional data, an observation is a vector with non-negative components which sum to a constant, typically 1. Data of this type arise in many areas, such as geology, archaeology, biology, economics and political science among others. The goal of this paper is to extend the taxicab metric and a newly suggested metric for compositional data by employing a power transformation. Both metrics are to be used in the k-nearest neighbours algorithm regardless of the presence of zeros. Examples with real data are exhibited. 	
1507.00225v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.00225v1	2015	Modeling Compositional Regression with uncorrelated and correlated   errors: a Bayesian approach	Taciana K. O. Shimizu|Francisco Louzada|Adriano K. Suzuki|Ricardo S. Ehlers	  Compositional data consist of known compositions vectors whose components are positive and defined in the interval (0,1) representing proportions or fractions of a "whole". The sum of these components must be equal to one. Compositional data is present in different knowledge areas, as in geology, economy, medicine among many others. In this paper, we introduce a Bayesian analysis for compositional regression applying additive log-ratio (ALR) transformation and assuming uncorrelated and correlated errors. The Bayesian inference procedure based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo Methods (MCMC). The methodology is illustrated on an artificial and a real data set of volleyball. 	
1705.01145v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.01145v1	2017	Stochastic modelling of non-stationary financial assets	Joana Estevens|Paulo Rocha|Joao Boto|Pedro Lind	  We model non-stationary volume-price distributions with a log-normal distribution and collect the time series of its two parameters. The time series of the two parameters are shown to be stationary and Markov-like and consequently can be modelled with Langevin equations, which are derived directly from their series of values. Having the evolution equations of the log-normal parameters, we reconstruct the statistics of the first moments of volume-price distributions which fit well the empirical data. Finally, the proposed framework is general enough to study other non-stationary stochastic variables in other research fields, namely biology, medicine and geology. 	
1707.05132v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.05132v1	2017	The downward directed grounds hypothesis and very large cardinals	Toshimichi Usuba	  A transitive model $M$ of ZFC is called a ground if the universe $V$ is a set forcing extension of $M$. We show that the grounds of $V$ are downward set-directed. Consequently, we establish some fundamental theorems on the forcing method and the set-theoretic geology. For instance, (1) the mantle, the intersection of all grounds, must be a model of ZFC. (2) $V$ has only set many grounds if and only if the mantle is a ground. We also show that if the universe has some very large cardinal, then the mantle must be a ground. 	
0907.1067v4	http://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.1067v4	2010	Cometary airbursts and atmospheric chemistry: Tunguska and a candidate   Younger Dryas event	Adrian L. Melott|Brian C. Thomas|Gisela Dreschhoff|Carey K. Johnson	  We find agreement between models of atmospheric chemistry changes from ionization for the 1908 Tunguska airburst event and nitrate enhancement in GISP2H and GISP2 ice cores, plus an unexplained ammonium spike. We then consider a candidate cometary impact at the Younger Dryas onset (YD). The large estimated NO_x production and O_3 depletion are beyond accurate extrapolation, but the ice core peak is much lower, possibly because of insufficient sampling resolution. Ammonium and nitrate spikes have been attributed to biomass burning at YD onset in both GRIP and GISP2 ice cores. A similar result is well-resolved in Tunguska ice core data, but that forest fire was far too small to account for this. Direct input of ammonia from a comet into the atmosphere is adequate for YD ice core data, but not Tunguska data. An analog of the Haber process with hydrogen contributed by cometary or surface water, atmospheric nitrogen, high pressures, and possibly catalytic iron from a comet could in principle produce ammonia, accounting for the peaks in both data sets. 	
1003.4347v3	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1003.4347v3	2011	Extraterrestrial Solar Neutrino Physics	W-Y. Pauchy Hwang|Jen-Chieh Peng	  We advocate the extraterrestrial solar neutrino physics (etSNP) as a means of investigating solar neutrino physics (SNP). As we already know, the dominant and subdominant (vacuum) oscillation lengths would be approximately one kilometer and one hundred kilometers. On the other hand, we know so far that the matter-enhanced oscillations take place only in the core of the Sun. Thus, the etSNP, i.e. solar neutrino physics that could be extracted outside the Earth, would assume a special unique role. The etSNP experiments include (1) a satellite (detector) around the Earth or around the Jupiter or others (to provide the shadow, for the matter-enhanced neutrino oscillations), (2) during the Sun-Venus-Earth eclipse or similar, and (3) the chemical compositions of the geology type (as in the Jupiter or in the Venus, to study the origins of these planets). To be specific, we note that the reactions induced by the ^8B solar neutrinos, in view of the sole high energy nature (E_\nu^{max}=14.03 MeV), would be most interesting in the solar environment. Moreover, the experiments such as the chemical compositions of the geology type (on the Venus or Jupiter) and the matter-enhanced oscillations when the Sun-Venus-Earth eclipse, or the Sun-Mercury-Earth eclipse, may also be interesting. 	
9911450v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9911450v1	1999	Some selected comments on cosmic radioactivities	M. Arnould|G. Meynet|N. Mowlavi	  Radionuclides with half-lives ranging from some years to billions of years presumably synthesized outside of the solar system are now recorded in `live' or `fossil' form in various types of materials, like meteorites or the galactic cosmic rays. They bring specific astrophysical messages the deciphering of which is briefly reviewed here, with special emphasis on the contribution of Jerry Wasserburg and his collaborators to this exciting field of research. A brief mention is also made to $\gamma$-ray line astrophysics. It provides an interesting information on live short-lived radionuclides in the present interstellar medium, and thus complements in a very important way the study of extinct radionuclides in meteorites. 	
0302023v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0302023v1	2003	On the carriers of the celestial infrared vibrational bands and their   excitation mechanisms	Renaud Papoular	  The recent influx of high-quality infrared spectroscopic data has prompted an extensive reassessment of various laboratory models in comparison with the observed UIBs (Unidentified Infrared Bands). As a result, significant modifications were brought to the original paradigms. The focus here is on the correction of the coal model, characterized by: 1) a shift towards less aromatic materials of the same family (kerogens; the composition, structure and IR spectrum of these materials are extensively documented in the geology literature); 2) the introduction of a new excitation mechanism (chemiluminescence), based on the capture of hydrogen atoms by carbonaceous dust. The fundamental characters of this model, viz. chemical and structural disorder, and diversity of chemical bondings, naturally point to ways of further tailoring, in order to fit particular observations more closely. 	
0307398v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0307398v1	2003	A Survey of 10-Micron Silicate Emission from Dust around Young Sun-Like   Stars	Eric Gaidos|Christopher Koresko	  We obtained low resolution (R = 100) mid-infrared (8-13 micron wavelengths) spectra of 8 nearby young main sequence stars with the Keck 1 telescope and Long-Wavelength Spectrometer (LWS) to search for 10 micron silicate (Si-O stretch) emission from circumstellar dust. No stars exhibited readily apparent emission: Spectra were then analyzed by least-squares fitting of a template based on a spectrum of Comet Hale-Bopp. Using this technique, we were able to constrain the level of silicate emission to a threshold ten times below what was previously possible from space. We found one star, HD 17925, with a spectrum statistically different from its calibrator and consistent with a silicate emission peak of 7% of the photosphere at a wavelength of 10 microns. Excess emission at 60 microns from this star has already been reported.

Ernst	  A Cahn-Hilliard-type theory for hydrodynamic fluctuations is proposed that gives a quantitative description of the slowly evolving spatial correlations and structures in density and flow fields in the early stages of evolution of freely cooling granular fluids. Two mechanisms for pattern selection and structure formation are identified: unstable modes leading to density clustering (compare spinodal decomposition), and selective noise reduction (compare peneplanation in structural geology) leading to vortex structures. As time increases, the structure factor for the density field develops a maximum, which shifts to smaller wave numbers. This corresponds to an approximately diffusively growing length scale for density clusters. The spatial velocity correlations exhibit algebraic decay $\sim r^{-d}$ on intermediate length scales. The theoretical predictions for spatial correlation functions and structure factors agree well with molecular dynamics simulations of a system of inelastic hard disks. 	
0601660v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0601660v2	2006	Wet Granular Materials	Namiko Mitarai|Franco Nori	  Most studies on granular physics have focused on dry granular media, with no liquids between the grains. However, in geology and many real world applications (e.g., food processing, pharmaceuticals, ceramics, civil engineering, constructions, and many industrial applications), liquid is present between the grains. This produces inter-grain cohesion and drastically modifies the mechanical properties of the granular media (e.g., the surface angle can be larger than 90 degrees). Here we present a review of the mechanical properties of wet granular media, with particular emphasis on the effect of cohesion. We also list several open problems that might motivate future studies in this exciting but mostly unexplored field.

Calaprice	  Detecting the antineutrinos emitted by the decay of radioactive elements in the mantle and crust could provide a direct measurement of the total abundance of uranium and thorium in the Earth. In calculating the antineutrino flux at specific sites, the local geology of the crust and the background from the world's nuclear power reactors are important considerations. Employing a global crustal map, with type and thickness data, and using recent estimates of the uranium and thorium distribution in the Earth, we calculate the antineutrino event rate for two new neutrino detectors. We show that spectral features allow terrestrial antineutrino events to be identified above reactor antineutrino backgrounds and that the uranium and thorium contributions can be separately determined.

Popescu|Ragnar Hellborg|Kristina Stenström|Mikko Faarinen|Per Persson|Bengt Erlandsson|Göran Skog|Emilian Alexandrescu	  A fossil bone from the archaeological site Malu Rosu Giurgiu, in Romania has been analyzed by accelerator mass spectrometry to estimate its age by determining its $^{14}$C content. The radiocarbon age of the bone is in agreement with the date obtained by the method for age determination, based on fluorine content. This is the first radiocarbon dating for the final Neolithic period, for this archaeological settlement in the Romanian region. 	
0606234v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0606234v1	2006	Focusing inversion techniques applied to electrical resistance   tomography in an experimental tank	G. Pagliara|G. Vignoli	  We present an algorithm for focusing inversion of electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) data. ERT is a typical example of ill-posed problem. Regularization is the most common way to face this kind of problems; it basically consists in using a priori information about targets to reduce the ambiguity and the instability of the solution. By using the minimum gradient support (MGS) stabilizing functional, we introduce the following geometrical prior information in the reconstruction process: anomalies have sharp boundaries. The presented work is embedded in a project (L.A.R.A.) which aims at the estimation of hydrogeological properties from geophysical investigations. L.A.R.A. facilities include a simulation tank (4 m x 8 m x 1.35 m); 160 electrodes are located all around the tank and used for 3-D ERT. Because of the large number of electrodes and their dimensions, it is important to model their effect in order to correctly evaluate the electrical system response. The forward modelling in the presented algorithm is based on the so-called complete electrode model that takes into account the presence of the electrodes and their contact impedances. In this paper, we compare the results obtained with different regularizing functionals applied on a synthetic model. 	
0609252v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0609252v1	2006	Variable selection based on entropic criterion and its application to   the debris-flow triggering	Chien-chih Chen|Chih-Yuan Tseng|Jia-Jyun Dong	  We propose a new data analyzing scheme, the method of minimum entropy analysis (MEA), in this paper. New MEA provides a quantitative criterion to select relevant variables for modeling the physical system interested. Such method can be easily extended to various geophysical/geological data analysis, where many relevant or irrelevant available measurements may obscure the understanding of the highly complicated physical system like the triggering of debris-flows. After demonstrating and testing the MEA method, we apply this method to a dataset of debris-flow occurrences in Taiwan and successfully find out three relevant variables, i.e. the hydrological form factor, numbers and areas of landslides, to the triggering of observed debris-flow events due to the 1996 Typhoon Herb.

The AFM tip was used not only for imaging but presumably to remove mechanically large patches of the outer cell wall after appropriate chemical treatment, which typically leaves the bacteria alive. The surface exposed after such a surgery revealed ca. 26 nm thick twisted strands within the cell wall. The structure and location of the observed strands are consistent with the glycan backbone of peptidoglycan fibers that give strength to the cell wall. The found structural organization of these fibers has not been observed previously.

Farrugia|Jens Ormo|Javier Gomez-Elvira|Jose Antonio Rodriguez-Manfredi|Enrique Diaz-Martinez|Helge Ritter|Robert Haschke|Markus Oesker|Joerg Ontrup	  We have used a simple camera phone to significantly improve an `exploration system' for astrobiology and geology. This camera phone will make it much easier to develop and test computer-vision algorithms for future planetary exploration. We envision that the `Astrobiology Phone-cam' exploration system can be fruitfully used in other problem domains as well.

Moskovitz|Samuel Lawrence|Robert Jedicke|Mark Willman|Nader Haghighipour|Schelte J. Bus|Eric Gaidos	  We present visible and near-infrared reflectance spectra and interpreted surface mineralogy for asteroid 10537 (1991 RY16). The spectrum of this object is without precedent amongst the Main Belt asteroids. A unique absorption band centered at 0.63 microns could be attributed to one of several mineralogies. Pronounced 1- and 2-micron absorption bands suggest that the composition of 10537 is a mixture of pyroxenes and olivine and that it originated from a parent body that was partially or fully differentiated. The closest available analog is the large Main Belt asteroid 349 Dembowska but 10537 may be an isolated fragment from a completely eroded parent body.

This is so, even when it is widely recognized that astronomy is an integral discipline, at the crossroads of advances in physics, geology, chemistry, etc. In this project we aim at contributing with the situational diagnosis in topics of astronomy of preservice elementary teachers, and to try and develop didactic tools that better collaborate with their formal education. We work with an open written questionnaire, designed to put in evidence some of the most frequently used models on a few basic astronomical notions. We here describe the main questions included in the test, and show our first results and some conclusions after having addressed the questionnaire to a number of preservice elementary teachers.

Learned	  The detection of electron anti-neutrinos from natural radioactivity in the earth has been a goal of neutrino researchers for about half a century. It was accomplished by the KamLAND Collaboration in 2005, and opens the way towards studies of the Earth's radioactive content, with very important implications for geology. New detectors are operating (KamLAND and Borexino), building (SNO+) and being proposed (Hanohano, LENA, Earth and others) that will go beyond the initial observation and allow interesting geophysical and geochemical research, in a means not otherwise possible. Herein we describe the approaches being taken (large liquid scintillation instruments), the experimental and technical challenges (optical detectors, directionality), and prospects for growth of this field. There is related spinoff in particle physics (neutrino oscillations and hierarchy determination), astrophysics (solar neutrinos, supernovae, exotica), and in the practical matter of remote monitoring of nuclear reactors.

A Multispectral Image Processing of Spot and TM Landsat data permits to understand the behaviour of the past land cover dynamics; a multi-temporal analysis of Normalized Difference Vegetation and Hydric Stress index, most informative RGB (according to statistical criteria) and Principal Components, points out the importance and the direction of environmental impacts. We gain from the Remote Sensing images new environmental criteria (distance from roads, oil pipe-line, DEM, etc.) which influence the spatial allocation of predicted land cover probabilities. We are comparing the results of different prospective approaches (Markov Chains, Multi Criteria Evaluation and Cellular Automata; Neural Networks) analysing the residues for improving the final model of future deforestation risk.

Stoev	  Max-stable random fields play a central role in modeling extreme value phenomena. We obtain an explicit formula for the conditional probability in general max-linear models, which include a large class of max-stable random fields. As a consequence, we develop an algorithm for efficient and exact sampling from the conditional distributions. Our method provides a computational solution to the prediction problem for spectrally discrete max-stable random fields. This work offers new tools and a new perspective to many statistical inference problems for spatial extremes, arising, for example, in meteorology, geology, and environmental applications.

Their goal is to have visitors come to the site, feel comfortable and stay a while and try to know completely about the running organization. As educational system increasingly requires data mining, the opportunity arises to mine the resulting large amounts of student information for hidden useful information (patterns like rule, clustering, and classification, etc). The education domain offers ground for many interesting and challenging data mining applications like astronomy, chemistry, engineering, climate studies, geology, oceanography, ecology, physics, biology, health sciences and computer science. Collecting the interesting patterns using the required interestingness measures, which help us in discovering the sophisticated patterns that are ultimately used for developing the site. We study the application of data mining to educational log data collected from Guru Nanak Institute of Technology, Ibrahimpatnam, India. We have proposed a custom-built apriori algorithm to find the effective pattern analysis. Finally, analyzing web logs for usage and access trends can not only provide important information to web site developers and administrators, but also help in creating adaptive web sites.

Based on three sets of fractal dimensions, the geographical space is divided into three types: real space (R-space), phase space (P-space), and order space (O-space). The real space is concrete or visual space, the fractal dimension of which can be evaluated through digital maps or remotely sensed images. The phase space and order space are both abstract space, the fractal dimension values of which cannot be estimated with one or two maps or images. The dimension of phase space can be computed by using time series, and that of order space can be determined with cross-sectional data in certain time. Three examples are offered to illustrate the three types of spaces and fractal dimension of geographical systems. The new space theory can be employed to explain the parameters of geographical scaling laws, such as the scaling exponent of the allometric growth law of cities and the fractal dimension based on Horton's laws of rivers.

Marvin Herndon	  Earth's interior, I posit, is like one of the rare, oxygen-starved "enstatite chondrite" meteorites (and unlike a more-oxidized "ordinary chondrite" as has been believed for seventy years). Laboratory-analyzed enstatite-chondrite samples are comparable to having-in-hand impossibleto- gather deep-Earth samples. Enstatite-chondrite formation in oxygen-starved conditions caused oxygen-loving elements to occur, in part, as non-oxides in their iron-alloy. Observations, consistent with solar abundance and behavior of chemical elements, lead me to a new interpretation of: (1) Earth's early formation as a Jupiter-like gas-giant, (2) its decompressionpowered surface geology, (3) Earth's internal composition, and (4) a natural, planetocentric nuclear-fission reactor as source of both the geomagnetic field and energy channeled to surface "hot-spots". I present a unified vision of Earth formation and concomitant dynamics that explains in a logical and causally related way: (1) fluid Earth-core formation without wholeplanet melting, and (2) the myriad measurements and observations, previously attributed to "plate tectonics", but without necessitating mantle convection.

Joel David Hamkins	  The dream solution of the continuum hypothesis (CH) would be a solution by which we settle the continuum hypothesis on the basis of a newly discovered fundamental principle of set theory, a missing axiom, widely regarded as true. Such a dream solution would indeed be a solution, since we would all accept the new axiom along with its consequences. In this article, however, I argue that such a dream solution to CH is unattainable.   The article is adapted from and expands upon material in my article, "The set-theoretic multiverse", to appear in the Review of Symbolic Logic (see arXiv:1108.4223). 	
1204.1225v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1204.1225v1	2012	Distributed computing of Seismic Imaging Algorithms	Masnida Emami|Ali Setayesh|Nasrin Jaberi	  The primary use of technical computing in the oil and gas industries is for seismic imaging of the earth's subsurface, driven by the business need for making well-informed drilling decisions during petroleum exploration and production. Since each oil/gas well in exploration areas costs several tens of millions of dollars, producing high-quality seismic images in a reasonable time can significantly reduce the risk of drilling a "dry hole". Similarly, these images are important as they can improve the position of wells in a billion-dollar producing oil field. However seismic imaging is very data- and compute-intensive which needs to process terabytes of data and require Gflop-years of computation (using "flop" to mean floating point operation per second). Due to the data/computing intensive nature of seismic imaging, parallel computing are used to process data to reduce the time compilation.   With introducing of Cloud computing, MapReduce programming model has been attracted a lot of attention in parallel and distributed systems [1, 2] to execute massive processing algorithms such as Bioinformatics[3], Astronomy[4], Geology[5] and so on. In this report, we will investigate and discuss current approaches to fit seismic algorithms to MapReduce programming model.

Adrian L. Melott|Richard K. Bambach|K. D. Petersen|John M. McArthur	  We find that the marine 87Sr/86Sr record shows a significant periodicity of 59.3 \pm 3 Myr. The 87Sr/86Sr record is 171{\deg} \pm 12{\deg}out of phase with a 62 (\pm 3) Myr periodicity previously reported in the record of marine-animal diversity. These periodicities are close to 58 (\pm 4) Myr cycles found for the number of gap-bounded sedimentary carbonate packages of North America We propose that these periodicities reflect the operation of a periodic "pulse of the Earth" in large-scale, Earth processes. These may be linked to mantle or plate-tectonic events, possibly uplift, which affects Earth's climate and oceans, and so the geochemistry, sedimentation, and biodiversity of the marine realm. Alternately, they may be linked to oscillation of the solar system normal to the plane of the galaxy. 	
1302.7291v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.7291v2	2013	The arrow of time and the nature of spacetime	George F R Ellis	  This paper extends the work of a previous paper [arXiv:1208.2611] on the flow of time, to consider the origin of the arrow of time. It proposes that a `past condition' cascades down from cosmological to micro scales, being realized in many microstructures and setting the arrow of time at the quantum level by top-down causation. This physics arrow of time then propagates up, through underlying emergence of higher level structures, to geology, astronomy, engineering, and biology. The appropriate space-time picture to view all this is an emergent block universe (`EBU'), that recognizes the way the present is different from both the past and the future. This essential difference is the ultimate reason the arrow of time has to be the way it is.

Losert	  Despite their very low surface gravities, asteroids exhibit a number of different geological processes involving granular matter. Understanding the response of this granular material subject to external forces in microgravity conditions is vital to the design of a successful asteroid sub-surface sampling mechanism, and in the interpretation of the fascinating geology on an asteroid. We have designed and flown a Taylor-Couette shear cell to investigate granular flow due to rotational shear forces under the conditions of parabolic flight microgravity. The experiments occur under weak compression. First, we present the technical details of the experimental design with particular emphasis on how the equipment has been specifically designed for the parabolic flight environment. Then, we investigate how a steady state granular flow induced by rotational shear forces differs in varying gravitational environments. We find that the effect of constant shearing on the granular material, in a direction perpendicular to the effective acceleration, does not seem to be strongly influenced by gravity. This means that shear bands can form in the presence of a weak gravitational field just as on Earth.

Marvin Herndon	  Neither plate tectonics nor Earth expansion theory is sufficient to provide a basis for understanding geoscience. Each theory is incomplete and possesses problematic elements, but both have served as stepping stones to a more fundamental and inclusive geoscience theory that I call Whole-Earth Decompression Dynamics (WEDD). WEDD begins with and is the consequence of our planet's early formation as a Jupiter-like gas giant and permits deduction of:(1) Earth's internal composition, structure, and highly-reduced oxidation state; (2) Core formation without whole-planet melting; (3) Powerful new internal energy sources - proto-planetary energy of compression and georeactor nuclear fission energy; (4) Georeactor geomagnetic field generation; (5) Mechanism for heat emplacement at the base of the crust resulting in the crustal geothermal gradient; (6) Decompression driven geodynamics that accounts for the myriad of observations attributed to plate tectonics without requiring physically-impossible mantle convection, and; (7) A mechanism for fold-mountain formation that does not necessarily require plate collision. The latter obviates the necessity to assume supercontinent cycles. Here, I review the principles of Whole-Earth Decompression Dynamics and describe a new underlying basis for geoscience and geology.

This sedimentary basin is 3000m wide and 350m deep. Since the seismic hazard is significant in this area, the depth of the basin and the strong impedance ratio raise the need for an accurate estimation of seismic motion amplification. Various experimental investigations were performed in previous studies to characterize site effects. The Boundary Element Method is considered herein to assess the parameter sensitivity of the amplification process and analyse the prevailing phenomena. The various frequencies of maximum amplification are correctly estimated by the BEM simulations. The maximum amplification level observed in the field is also well retrieved by the numerical simulations but, due to the sensitivity of the location of maximum amplification in space, the overall maximum amplification has to be considered. The influence of the wave-field incidence and material damping is also discussed. 	
1309.4860v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.4860v1	2013	Modeling complex spatial dynamics of two-population interaction in   urbanization process	Yanguang Chen|Feng Xu	  This paper is mainly devoted to lay an empirical foundation for further research on complex spatial dynamics of two-population interaction. Based on the US population census data, a rural and urban population interaction model is developed. Subsequently a logistic equation on percentage urban is derived from the urbanization model so that spatial interaction can be connected mathematically with logistic growth. The numerical experiment by using the discretized urban-rural population interaction model of urbanization shows a period-doubling bifurcation and chaotic behavior, which is identical in patterns to those from the simple mathematical models of logistic growth in ecology. This suggests that the complicated dynamics of logistic growth may come from some kind of the nonlinear interaction. The results from this study help to understand urbanization, urban-rural population interaction, chaotic dynamics, and spatial complexity of geographical systems.

Based on the propagation process, we present a simple method to uncover the network topology. The numerical simulation on artificial networks shows that our method enjoys a high accuracy in inferring the network topology. We find the infection rate in the propagation process significantly influences the accuracy, and each network is corresponding to an optimal infection rate. Moreover, the method generally works better in large networks. These finding are confirmed in both real social and nonsocial networks. Finally, the method is extended to directed networks and a similarity measure specific for directed networks is designed.

A key component of the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) is the Davis Campus, which is in operation at the 4850-foot level (4300 m.w.e) and currently hosts three projects: the LUX dark matter experiment, the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR neutrinoless double-beta decay experiment and the CUBED low-background counter. Plans for possible future experiments at SURF are well underway and include long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments, future dark matter experiments as well as nuclear astrophysics accelerators. Facility upgrades to accommodate some of these future projects have already started. SURF is a dedicated facility with significant expansion capability. 	
1401.3790v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.3790v1	2014	Detection of Phase Shift Events	William Marshall|Paul Marriott	  We consider the problem of change-point estimation of the instantaneous phase of an observed time series. Such change points, or phase shifts, can be markers of information transfer in complex systems; their analysis occurring in geology, biology and physics, but most notably in neuroscience. We develop two non-parametric approaches to this problem: the cumulative summation (CUSUM) and phase derivative (PD) estimators. In general the CUSUM estimator has higher power for identifying single shift events, while the PD estimator has better temporal resolution for multiple ones. A system of weakly coupled Rossler attractors provides an application in which there are high levels of systematic and time-dependent noise. Shift identification is also performed on beta-band activity from electroencephalogram recordings of a visual attention task, an unsupervised application which requires high temporal resolution. 	
1410.5011v6	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.5011v6	2017	A Dirichlet Regression Model for Compositional Data with Zeros	Michail Tsagris|Connie Stewart	  Compositional data are met in many different fields, such as economics, archaeometry, ecology, geology and political sciences. Regression where the dependent variable is a composition is usually carried out via a log-ratio transformation of the composition or via the Dirichlet distribution. However, when there are zero values in the data these two ways are not readily applicable. Suggestions for this problem exist, but most of them rely on substituting the zero values. In this paper we adjust the Dirichlet distribution when covariates are present, in order to allow for zero values to be present in the data, without modifying any values. To do so, we modify the log-likelihood of the Dirichlet distribution to account for zero values. Examples and simulation studies exhibit the performance of the zero adjusted Dirichlet regression.

Geim	  Adsorbed layers of water are ubiquitously present at surfaces and fill in microscopic pores, playing a central role in many phenomena in such diverse fields as materials science, geology, biology, tribology, nanotechnology. Despite such importance, the crystal structure of nanoconfined water remains largely unknown. Here we report high-resolution electron microscopy of mono- and few- layers of water confined between two graphene sheets, an archetypal example of hydrophobic confinement. Confined water is found to form square ice at room temperature - a phase with symmetry principally different from the conventional tetrahedral geometry of hydrogen bonding. The square ice has a high packing density with a lattice constant of 2.83 angstrom and during TEM observation assembles in bi- and tri- layer crystallites exhibiting AA stacking. Our findings are important for understanding of interfacial phenomena and, in particular, shed light on ultrafast transport of water through hydrophobic nanocapillaries. Our MD simulations show that square ice is likely to be common inside hydrophobic nanochannels, independent of their exact atomic makeup. 	
1510.06604v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.06604v1	2015	Internal structure of Pluto and Charon with an iron core	A. Aitta	  Pluto has been observed by the New Horizons space probe to have some relatively fresh ice on the old ices covering most of the surface. Pluto was thought to consist of only a rocky core below the ice. Here I show that Pluto can have an iron core, as can also its companion Charon, which has recently been modelled to have one. The presence of an iron core means the giant impact origin calculations should be redone to include iron and thus higher temperatures. An iron core leads to the possibility of a different geology. An originally molten core becomes solid later, with contraction and a release of latent heat. The space vacated allows the upper rock layers to flow downwards at some locations at the surface of the core, and some of the ice above the rock to descend, filling the spaces left by the rock motion downwards. These phenomena can lead to the forces recently deforming the icy surface of Pluto, and in a lesser way, of Charon.

Data of this type arise in many areas, such as geology, archaeology, biology, economics and political science amongst others. The goal of this paper is to propose a new, divergence based, regression modelling technique for compositional data. To do so, a recently proved metric which is a special case of the Jensen-Shannon divergence is employed. A strong advantage of this new regression technique is that zeros are naturally handled. An example with real data and simulation studies are presented and are both compared with the log-ratio based regression suggested by Aitchison in 1986.

Our method consists in fitting the weighted radial distribution functions obtained from the ab initio data with the ones obtained from simulations with the effective potential, and using the parameters of the latter as fitting variables. As a case study, we consider the example of amorphous silica, a material that is highly relevant in the field of glass science as well as in geology. Our approach is able to obtain an effective potential that gives a better description with respect to structural and thermodynamic properties than the potential proposed by van Beest, Kramer, and van Santen, and that has been very frequently used as a model for amorphous silica. In parallel, we have also used the so-called "force matching" approach proposed by Ercolessi and Adams to obtain an effective potential. We demonstrate that for the case of silica this method does not yield a reliable potential and discuss the likely origin for this failure. 	
1605.01146v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.01146v1	2016	A note on Bayesian wavelet-based estimation of scaling	Minkyoung Kang|Brani Vidakovic	  A number of phenomena in various fields such as geology, atmospheric sciences, economics, to list a few, can be modeled as a fractional Brownian motion indexed by Hurst exponent $H$. This exponent is related to the degree of regularity and self-similarity present in the signal, and it often captures important characteristics useful in various applications. Given its importance, a number of methods have been developed for the estimation of the Hurst exponent. Typically, the proposed methods do not utilize prior information about scaling of a signal. Some signals are known to possess a theoretical value of the Hurst exponent, which motivates us to propose a Bayesian approach that incorporates this information via a suitable elicited prior distribution on $H$.   This significantly improves the accuracy of the estimation, as we demonstrate by simulations. Moreover, the proposed method is robust to small misspecifications of the prior location. The proposed method is applied to a turbulence time series for which Hurst exponent is theoretically known by Kolmogorov's K41 theory.

Lobanov|Vitali B. Prakapenka|Eran Greenberg	  Synchrotron X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy have been used to study chemical reactions of molecular hydrogen (H2) with sulfur (S) at high pressures. We find theoretically predicted Cccm and Im-3m H3S to be the reaction products at 50 and 140 GPa, respectively. Im-3m H3S is a stable crystalline phase above 140 GPa and it transforms to R3m H3S on pressure release below 140 GPa. The latter phase is (meta)stable down to at least 70 GPa where it transforms to Cccm H3S upon annealing (T<1300 K) to overcome the kinetic hindrance. Cccm H3S has an extended structure with symmetric hydrogen bonds at 50 GPa and upon decompression it experiences a transformation to a molecular mixed H2S-H2 structure below 40 GPa without any apparent change in the crystal symmetry.

Caridad|Christoph Stampfer|Gaetano Galogero|Nick Papior|Mads Brandbyge	  The electron microscope has been a powerful, highly versatile workhorse in the fields of material and surface science, micro and nanotechnology, biology and geology, for nearly 80 years. The advent of two-dimensional materials opens new possibilities for realising an analogy to electron microscopy in the solid state. Here we provide a perspective view on how a two-dimensional (2D) Dirac fermion-based microscope can be realistically implemented and operated, using graphene as a vacuum chamber for ballistic electrons. We use semiclassical simulations to propose concrete architectures and design rules of 2D electron guns, deflectors, tunable lenses and various detectors. The simulations show how simple objects can be imaged with well-controlled and collimated in-plane beams consisting of relativistic charge carriers. Finally, we discuss the potential of such microscopes for investigating edges, terminations and defects, as well as interfaces, including external nanoscale structures such as adsorbed molecules, nanoparticles or quantum dots.

We adopt a semiparametric approach and tackle the situations where the location of the symmetry axis is either specified or unspecified. For each problem, we define two tests and study their asymptotic properties under very mild conditions. We introduce two new classes of directional distributions that extend the rotationally symmetric class and are of independent interest. We prove that each test is locally asymptotically maximin, in the Le Cam sense, for one kind of the alternatives given by the new classes of distributions, both for specified and unspecified symmetry axis. The tests, aimed to detect location-like and scatter-like alternatives, are combined into a convenient hybrid test that is consistent against both alternatives. A Monte Carlo study illustrates the finite-sample performances of the tests and corroborates empirically the theoretical findings. Finally, we apply the tests for assessing rotational symmetry in two real data examples coming from geology and proteomics.

Okur|Sylvie Roke	  The interfacial structure and dynamics of water in a microscopically confined geometry is imaged in three dimensions and on millisecond time scales. We developed a 3D wide-field second harmonic microscope that employs structured illumination. We image pH induced chemical changes on the curved and confined inner and outer surfaces of a cylindrical glass micro-capillary immersed in aqueous solution. The image contrast reports on the orientational order of interfacial water, induced by charge-dipole interactions between water molecules and surface charges. The images constitute surface potential maps. Spatially resolved surface pKa,s values are determined for the silica deprotonation reaction. Values range from 2.3<pKa,s<10.7, highlighting the importance of surface heterogeneities. Water molecules that rotate along an oscillating external electric field are also imaged. With this approach, real time movies of surface processes that involve flow, heterogeneities and potentials can be made, which will further developments in electrochemistry, geology, catalysis, biology, and microtechnology.

Bouwman|Ad A. van Well|Catherine Pappas	  We describe theoretical and practical aspects of spin-echo modulated small-angle neutron scattering (SEMSANS) as well as the potential combination with SANS. Based on the preliminary technical designs of SKADI (a SANS instrument proposed for the European Spallation Source) and a SEMSANS add-on, we assess the practicability, feasibility and scientific merit of a combined SANS and SEMSANS setup by calculating tentative SANS and SEMSANS results for soft matter, geology and advanced material samples that have been previously studied by scattering methods. We conclude that lengths from 1 nm up to 0.01 mm can be observed simultaneously in a single measurement. Thus, the combination of SANS and SEMSANS instrument is suited for the simultaneous observation of a wide range of length scales, e.g. for time-resolved studies of kinetic processes in complex multiscale systems.

To develop simple, precise, and versatile atom interferometers for inertial sensing, we demonstrate an atom interferometer measuring acceleration, rotation, and inclination by pointing Raman beams toward individual faces of a pyramidal mirror. Only a single diode laser is used for all functions, including atom trapping, interferometry, and detection. Efficient Doppler-sensitive Raman transitions are achieved without the velocity selecting the atom sample, and with zero differential AC Stark shift between the cesium hyperfine ground states, increasing signal-to-noise and suppressing systematic effects. We measure gravity along two axes (vertical and 45$^\circ$ to the vertical), rotation, and inclination with sensitivities of 6$\,\mu$m/s$^2/\sqrt{\rm Hz}$, 300$\,\mu$rad/s/$\sqrt{\rm Hz}$, and 4$\,\mu$rad/$\sqrt{\rm Hz}$, respectively. This work paves the way toward deployable multiaxis atom interferometers for geodesy, geology, or inertial navigation.

Wong	  Statistical analyses of directional or angular data have applications in a variety of fields, such as geology, meteorology and bioinformatics. There is substantial literature on descriptive and inferential techniques for univariate angular data, with the bivariate (or more generally, multivariate) cases receiving more attention in recent years. However, there is a lack of software implementing inferential techniques in practice, especially in the bivariate situation. In this article, we introduce BAMBI, an R package for analyzing bivariate (and univariate) angular data using Bayesian methods. In this R package, we implement three bivariate (viz., bivariate wrapped normal, von Mises sine and von Mises cosine) and two univariate (viz., univariate wrapped normal and von Mises) angular distributions. BAMBI provides Bayesian methods for modeling angular data using finite mixtures of these distributions. We also provide functions for visual and numerical diagnostics and Bayesian inference for the fitted models. In this article, we first provide a brief review of the distributions and techniques used in BAMBI, then describe the capabilities of the package, and finally conclude with demonstrations of mixture model fitting using BAMBI on the two real datasets included in the package, one univariate and one bivariate.

Arias	  Quantum-chemical processes in liquid environments impact broad areas of science, from molecular biology to geology to electrochemistry. While density-functional theory (DFT) has enabled efficient quantum-mechanical calculations which profoundly impact understanding of atomic-scale phenomena, realistic description of the liquid remains a challenge. Here, we present an approach based on joint density-functional theory (JDFT) which addresses this challenge by leveraging the DFT approach not only for the quantum mechanics of the electrons in a solute, but also simultaneously for the statistical mechanics of the molecules in a surrounding equilibrium liquid solvent. Specifically, we develop a new universal description for the interaction of electrons with an arbitrary liquid, providing the missing link to finally transform JDFT into a practical tool for the realistic description of chemical processes in solution. This approach predicts accurate solvation free energies and surrounding atomic-scale liquid structure for molecules and surfaces in multiple solvents without refitting, all at a fraction of the computational cost of methods of comparable detail and accuracy. To demonstrate the potential impact of this method, we determine the structure of the solid/liquid interface, offering compelling agreement with more accurate (but much more computationally intensive) theories and with X-ray reflectivity measurements.

The Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) includes two main campuses at the 4850-foot level (4300 m.w.e.) -- the Davis Campus and the Ross Campus -- that host a range of significant physics projects: the LUX dark matter experiment, the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR neutrinoless double-beta decay experiment and the CASPAR nuclear astrophysics accelerator. Furthermore, the BHUC Ross Campus laboratory dedicated to critical material assays for current and future experiments has been operating since Fall 2015. Research efforts in biology, geology and engineering have been underway at SURF for 10 years and continue to be a strong component of the SURF research program. Plans to accommodate future experiments at SURF are well advanced and include geothermal-related projects, the next generation direct-search dark matter experiment LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) and the Fermilab-led international Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) at the Long Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF). SURF is a dedicated research facility with significant expansion capability, and applications from other experiments are welcome.

These geological objects and phenomena are described as containing statistically selfsimilar patterns often modeled with fractal geometry. Fractal geometry has been used extensively to characterize pore space and fracture distribution of both carbonate and clastic rocks as well as the transport properties of porous media and fluid flow in reservoirs. The fractal properties are usually estimated from thin-section photomicrograph images or scanning electron microscope images. For complex rock such as carbonate rocks, automatic feature detection methods are often inaccurate. In addition, the rocks may be have been subjected to facies selective diagenesis which preferentially affect some of the rock fabric, thus increasing the difficulty in automatic detection of certain features. We present an interactive program, GeoBoxCount, for analyzing thin-section images and calculating the fractal dimension interactively. The program relies on the geologists insight in interpreting the features of interest; this significantly improves the accuracy of feature selection. The program provides two options for calculating the fractal dimension: the Hausdorff and the Minkowsi-Bouligand box-counting methods.

Chaikin|Don E. Wilhelms	  NASA's New Horizons spacecraft has revealed the complex geology of Pluto and Charon. Pluto's encounter hemisphere shows ongoing surface geological activity centered on a vast basin containing a thick layer of volatile ices that appears to be involved in convection and advection, with a crater retention age no greater than $\approx$10 Ma. Surrounding terrains show active glacial flow, apparent transport and rotation of large buoyant water-ice crustal blocks, and pitting, likely by sublimation erosion and/or collapse. More enigmatic features include tall mounds with central depressions that are conceivably cryovolcanic, and ridges with complex bladed textures. Pluto also has ancient cratered terrains up to ~4 Ga old that are extensionally fractured and extensively mantled and perhaps eroded by glacial or other processes. Charon does not appear to be currently active, but experienced major extensional tectonism and resurfacing (probably cryovolcanic) nearly 4 billion years ago. Impact crater populations on Pluto and Charon are not consistent with the steepest proposed impactor size-frequency distributions proposed for the Kuiper belt.

B. Guenther|Linghuai Li|Frank J. Robinson	  The space telescope MOST is now providing us with extremely accurate low frequency p-mode oscillation data for the star Eta Boo. We demonstrate in this paper that these data, when combined with ground based measurements of the high frequency p-mode spectrum, can be reproduced with stellar models that include the effects of turbulence in their outer layers. Without turbulence, the l=0 modes of our models deviate from either the ground based or the space data by about 1.5-4.0 micro Hz. This discrepancy can be completely removed by including turbulence in the models and we can exactly match 12 out of 13 MOST frequencies that we identified as l=0 modes in addition to 13 out of 21 ground based frequencies within their observational 2 sigma tolerances. The better agreement between model frequencies and observed ones depends for the most part on the turbulent kinetic energy which was taken from a 3D convection simulation for the Sun.

Sornette	  In the standard rebound theory of earthquakes, elastic deformation energy is progressively stored in the crust until a threshold is reached at which it is suddenly released in an earthquake. We review three important paradoxes, the strain paradox, the stress paradox and the heat flow paradox, that are difficult to account for in this picture, either individually or when taken together. Resolutions of these paradoxes usually call for additional assumptions on the nature of the rupture process (such as novel modes of deformations and ruptures) prior to and/or during an earthquake, on the nature of the fault and on the effect of trapped fluids within the crust at seismogenic depths. We review the evidence for the essential importance of water and its interaction with the modes of deformations. Water is usually seen to have mainly the mechanical effect of decreasing the normal lithostatic stress in the fault core on one hand and to weaken rock materials via hydrolytic weakening and stress corrosion on the other hand. We also review the evidences that water plays a major role in the alteration of minerals subjected to finite strains into other structures in out-of-equilibrium conditions. This suggests novel exciting routes to understand what is an earthquake, that requires to develop a truly multidisciplinary approach involving mineral chemistry, geology, rupture mechanics and statistical physics. 	
0209030v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0209030v1	2002	Extremal Optimization: an Evolutionary Local-Search Algorithm	Stefan Boettcher|Allon G. Percus	  A recently introduced general-purpose heuristic for finding high-quality solutions for many hard optimization problems is reviewed. The method is inspired by recent progress in understanding far-from-equilibrium phenomena in terms of {\em self-organized criticality,} a concept introduced to describe emergent complexity in physical systems. This method, called {\em extremal optimization,} successively replaces the value of extremely undesirable variables in a sub-optimal solution with new, random ones. Large, avalanche-like fluctuations in the cost function self-organize from this dynamics, effectively scaling barriers to explore local optima in distant neighborhoods of the configuration space while eliminating the need to tune parameters. Drawing upon models used to simulate the dynamics of granular media, evolution, or geology, extremal optimization complements approximation methods inspired by equilibrium statistical physics, such as {\em simulated annealing}. It may be but one example of applying new insights into {\em non-equilibrium phenomena} systematically to hard optimization problems. This method is widely applicable and so far has proved competitive with -- and even superior to -- more elaborate general-purpose heuristics on testbeds of constrained optimization problems with up to $10^5$ variables, such as bipartitioning, coloring, and satisfiability. Analysis of a suitable model predicts the only free parameter of the method in accordance with all experimental results.

McGuire|Javier Gomez-Elvira|Jose Antonio Rodriguez-Manfredi|Eduardo Sebastian-Martinez|Jens Ormo|Enrique Diaz-Martinez|Helge Ritter|Markus Oesker|Robert Haschke|Joerg Ontrup	  We present results from the first geological field tests of the `Cyborg Astrobiologist', which is a wearable computer and video camcorder system that we are using to test and train a computer-vision system towards having some of the autonomous decision-making capabilities of a field-geologist. The Cyborg Astrobiologist platform has thus far been used for testing and development of these algorithms and systems: robotic acquisition of quasi-mosaics of images, real-time image segmentation, and real-time determination of interesting points in the image mosaics. The hardware and software systems function reliably, and the computer-vision algorithms are adequate for the first field tests. In addition to the proof-of-concept aspect of these field tests, the main result of these field tests is the enumeration of those issues that we can improve in the future, including: dealing with structural shadow and microtexture, and also, controlling the camera's zoom lens in an intelligent manner. Nonetheless, despite these and other technical inadequacies, this Cyborg Astrobiologist system, consisting of a camera-equipped wearable-computer and its computer-vision algorithms, has demonstrated its ability of finding genuinely interesting points in real-time in the geological scenery, and then gathering more information about these interest points in an automated manner.

Hartle	  If a cat, a cannonball, and an economics textbook are all dropped from the same height, they fall to the ground with exactly the same acceleration under the influence of gravity. This equality of gravitational accelerations of different things is one of the most accurately tested laws of physics. That law, however, tells us little about cats, cannonballs, or economics. This lecture expands on this theme to address the question of what features of our world are predicted by a fundamental ``theory of everything'' governing the regularities exhibited universally by all physical systems. This may consist of two parts: a dynamical law governing regularities in time (e.g superstring theory) and a law of cosmological initial condition governing mostly regularities in space (e.g. Hawking's no-boundary initial condition). The lecture concludes that: (1) ``A theory of everything'' is not a theory of everything in a quantum mechanical universe. (2) If the laws are short enough to be discoverable then they are probably too short to predict everything. (3) The regularities of human history, economics, biology, geology, etc are consistent with the fundamental laws of physics but do not follow from them. (Public lecture given at The Future of Theoretical Physics and Cosmology: Stephen Hawking 60th Birthday Symposium.)

They are among the most ancient lavas of the Earth following the 3.8 Ga pillow basalts at Isua and they represent some of the oldest ultramafic magmatic rocks preserved in the Earth's crust at 3.5 Ga. This fact, linked to their particular features (high magnesium content, high melting temperatures, low dynamic viscosities, etc.), has attracted the community of geoscientists since their discovery in the early sixties, who have tried to determine their origin and understand their meaning in the context of the terrestrial mantle evolution. In addition, it has been proposed that komatiites are not restricted to our planet, but they could be found in other extraterrestrial setting in our Solar System (particularly in Mars and Io). It is important to note that komatiites may be extremely significant in the study of the origins and evolution of Life on Earth. They not only preserve essential geochemical clues of the interaction between the pristine Earth rocks and atmosphere, but also may have been potential suitable sites for biological processes to develop. Thus, besides reviewing the main geodynamic, petrological and geochemical characteristics of komatiites, this paper also aims to widen their investigation beyond the classical geological prospect, calling attention to them as attracting rocks for research in planetology and astrobiology. 	
0605239v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0605239v2	2006	Amplification and Increased Duration of Earthquake Motion on Uneven   Stress-Free Ground	Armand Wirgin|Jean-Philippe Groby	  When a flat stress-free surface (i.e., the ground in seismological applications) separating air from a isotropic, homogeneous or horizontally-layered, solid substratum is solicited by a SH plane body wave incident in the substratum, the response in the substratum is a single specularly-reflected body wave. When the stress-free condition, equivalent to vanishing surface impedance, is relaxed by the introduction of a {spatially- constant, non- vanishing surface impedance}, the response in the substratum is again a single reflected body wave whose amplitude is less than the one in the situation of a stress-free ground. When the stress-free condition is relaxed by the introduction of a a {spatially-modulated surface impedance}, which simulates the action of an uneven (i.e., not entirely-flat) ground, the frequency-domain response takes the form of a spectrum of {plane body waves} and {surface waves} and {resonances} are produced at the frequencies of which one or several surface wave amplitudes can become large. It is shown, that at resonance, the amplitude of one, or of several, components of the motion on the surface can be amplified with respect to the situation in which the surface impedance is either constant or vanishes. Also, when the solicitation is pulse-like, the integrated time history of the square of surface displacement and of the square of velocity can be larger, and the duration of the signal can be considerably longer, for a spatially-modulated impedance surface than for a constant, or vanishing, impedance surface.

It is one of the core instruments on New Horizons, NASA's first mission to the Pluto/Charon system and the Kuiper Belt. Ralph combines panchromatic and color imaging capabilities with IR imaging spectroscopy. Its primary purpose is to map the surface geology and composition of these objects, but it will also be used for atmospheric studies and to map the surface temperature. It is a compact, low-mass (10.5 kg), power efficient (7.1 W peak), and robust instrument with good sensitivity and excellent imaging characteristics. Other than a door opened once in flight, it has no moving parts. These characteristics and its high degree of redundancy make Ralph ideally suited to this long-duration flyby reconnaissance mission.

Stereoscopic analysis of pairs of SEM images yielded a digital elevation model of the surface of the microstylolites. Fourier analyses of these microstylolites reveal a self-affine roughness (with a roughness exponent H of 1.2). Coupled with observations of close interactions between dissolution pits and stylolitic peaks, these data illustrate a possible mechanism for stylolite formation. The complex geometry of stylolite surfaces is imposed by the interplay between the development of dissolution peaks in preferential locations (fast dissolution pits) and the mechanical properties of the solid-fluid-solid interfaces. Simple mechanical modeling expresses the crucial competition that could rule the development of microstylolites: (i) a stress-related process, modeled in terms of the stiffness of springs that activate the heterogeneous dissolution rates of the solid interface, promotes the deflection. In parallel, (ii) the strength of the solid interface, modeled in terms of the stiffness of a membrane, is equivalent to a surface tension that limits the deflection and opposes its development. The modeling produces stylolitic surfaces with characteristic geometries varying from conical to columnar when both the effect of dissolution-rate heterogeneity and the strength properties of the rock are taken into account. A self-affine roughness exponent (Hz1.2) measured on modeled surfaces is comparable with natural stylolites at small length scale and experimental microstylolites.

The 1D signals obtained were statistically analyzed to determine the scaling behavior and calculate a roughness exponent, also called Hurst exponent. Statistical methods based on the characterization of a single Hurst exponent imply strong assumptions on the mathematical characteristics of the signal: the derivative of the signal (or local increments) should be stationary and have finite variance. The analysis of the measured stylolites show that these properties are not always verified simultaneously. The stylolite profiles show persistence and jumps and several stylolites are not regular, with alternating regular and irregular portions. A new statistical method is proposed here, based on a non-stationary but Gaussian model, to estimate the roughness of the profiles and quantify the heterogeneity of stylolites. This statistical method is based on two parameters: the local roughness (H) which describes the local amplitude of the stylolite, and the amount of irregularities on the signal (\mu), which can be linked to the heterogeneities initially present in the rock before the stylolite formed. Using this technique, a classification of the stylolites in two families is proposed: those for which the morphology is homogeneous everywhere and those with alternating regular and irregular portions.

The sorption isotherm, i.e. the log As(III) vs. log [As(OH)3 degrees / Assat] plot is S-shaped and has been modelled on an extended version of the surface precipitation model. At low concentrations, As(OH)3 degrees is adsorbed by complexation to surface Ca surface sites, as previously described by the X-ray standing wave technique. The inflexion point of the isotherm, where As(OH)3 degrees is limited by the amount of surface sites (ST), yields 6 sites nm-2 in good agreement with crystallographic data. Beyond this value, the amount of sorbed arsenic increases linearly with solution concentration, up to the saturation of arsenic with respect to the precipitation of CaHAsO3(s). The solid solutions formed in this concentration range were examined by X-ray and neutron diffraction. The doped calcite lattice parameters increase with arsenic content while c/a ratio remains constant. Our results made on bulk calcite on the atomic displacement of As atoms along [0001] direction extend those published by Cheng et al., (1999) on calcite surface. This study provides a molecular-level explanation for why As(III) is trapped by calcite in industrial treatments.

Dye|Sandip Pakvasa	  The science potential of a 10 kiloton deep-ocean liquid scintillation detector for ~1 MeV energy scale electron anti-neutrinos has been studied. Such an instrument, designed to be portable and function in the deep ocean (3-5 km) can make unique measurements of the anti-neutrinos from radioactive decays in the Earth'.s mantle. Ths information speaks to some of the most fundamental questions in geology about the origin of the Earth, plat e tectonics, the geomagnetic field and even somewhat indirectly to global warming. Measurements in multiple locations will strengthen the potential insights. On the particle physics side, we have identified a unique role in the study of anti-neutrinos from a nuclear power complex, at a range of 55-60 km off shore. Not only can precision measurements be made of most neutrino mixing parameters, including $\theta_{13}$ (depending on magnitude), but the neutrino mass hierarchy can be determined in a method not heretofore discussed, and one which does not rely upon matter effects. This detector is under active study on paper, in the laboratory, and at sea. An interdisciplinary and international collaboration is in formation, and plans are in motion for a major proposal, to be followed by construction over several years.

The aim the study is to analyse the part of heave induced by the soil swelling. First, the swell potential was determined by flooding the soil specimen in an oedometer under its in-situ overburden stress. On the other hand, in order to assess the swell induced by the excavation undertaken during the construction of the railway, a second method was applied. The soil was first loaded to its in situ overburden stress existing before the excavation. It was then flooded and unloaded to its current overburden stress (after the excavation). The swell induced by this unloading was considered. Finally, the experimental results obtained were analyzed, together with the results from other laboratory tests performed previously and the data collected from the field monitoring. This study allowed estimating the heave induced by soil swelling. Subsequently, the part of heave due to landslide could be estimated which corresponds to the difference between the monitored heave and the swelling heave. 	
1001.2866v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1001.2866v2	2011	Earthquake Forecast via Neutrino Tomography	Bin Wang|Ya-Zheng Chen|Xue-Qian Li	  We discuss the possibility of forecasting earthquakes by means of (anti)neutrino tomography. Antineutrinos emitted from reactors are used as a probe. As the antineutrinos traverse through a region prone to earthquakes, observable variations in the matter effect on the antineutrino oscillation would provide a tomography of the vicinity of the region. In this preliminary work, we adopt a simplified model for the geometrical profile and matter density in a fault zone. We calculate the survival probability of electron antineutrinos for cases without and with an anomalous accumulation of electrons which can be considered as a clear signal of the coming earthquake, at the geological region with a fault zone, and find that the variation may reach as much as 3% for $\bar \nu_e$ emitted from a reactor. The case for a $\nu_e$ beam from a neutrino factory is also investigated, and it is noted that, because of the typically high energy associated with such neutrinos, the oscillation length is too large and the resultant variation is not practically observable. Our conclusion is that with the present reactor facilities and detection techniques, it is still a difficult task to make an earthquake forecast using such a scheme, though it seems to be possible from a theoretical point of view while ignoring some uncertainties. However, with the development of the geology, especially the knowledge about the fault zone, and with the improvement of the detection techniques, etc., there is hope that a medium-term earthquake forecast would be feasible.

Chubakov|Alexander I. Plekhanov	  The efficiency of photodesorption of Rb atoms previously collected on polymer organic film has been studied in detail. This study was carried out in a Pyrex glass cell of which the inner surface was covered with (poly)dimethylsiloxane (PDMS) film and illuminated by a powerful flash lamp. The desorption dynamic of the Rb atoms density in the cell caused by the illumination and percentage of desorbed atoms was studied by using of Rb resonance lamp and free running diode laser as sources of probing light. It was determined that 85 percent collected chemical active Rb atoms and stored during 16 seconds in the closed cell, 75 percent in the pumped cell can be desorbed by single flash of the lamp. The number of stored atoms decays with a characteristic time of 60 min in isolated cell and with a time 12.4 minutes in a pumped cell. We believe that this efficient method of collection and fast realization of atoms or molecules could be used for enhancement of sensitivity of existed sensors for the trace detection of various elements (including toxic or radioactive ones) which is important to environmental applications, medicine or in geology. The effect might help to construct an efficient light-driven atomic source for a magneto-optical trap in a case of extremely low vapor density or very weak flux of atoms, such as artificial radioactive alkali atoms.

By considering the high drilling cost and the potential improvement in well productivity, well placement decision is an important issue in field development. Considering complex reservoir geology and high reservoir heterogeneities, stochastic optimization methods are the most suitable approaches for optimum well placement. This paper proposes an optimization methodology to determine optimal well location and trajectory based upon the Covariance Matrix Adaptation - Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) which is a variant of Evolution Strategies recognized as one of the most powerful derivative-free optimizers for continuous optimization. To improve the optimization procedure, two new techniques are investigated: (1). Adaptive penalization with rejection is developed to handle well placement constraints. (2). A meta-model, based on locally weighted regression, is incorporated into CMA-ES using an approximate ranking procedure. Therefore, we can reduce the number of reservoir simulations, which are computationally expensive. Several examples are presented. Our new approach is compared with a Genetic Algorithm incorporating the Genocop III technique. It is shown that our approach outperforms the genetic algorithm: it leads in general to both a higher NPV and a significant reduction of the number of reservoir simulations. 	
1101.4165v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1101.4165v1	2011	Differentiation of Planetesimals and the Thermal Consequences of Melt   Migration	Nicholas Moskovitz|Eric Gaidos	  We model the heating of a primordial planetesimal by decay of the short-lived radionuclides Al-26 and Fe-60 to determine (i) the timescale on which melting will occur; (ii) the minimum size of a body that will produce silicate melt and differentiate; (iii) the migration rate of molten material within the interior; and (iv) the thermal consequences of the transport of Al-26 in partial melt. Our models incorporate results from previous studies of planetary differentiation and are constrained by petrologic (i.e. grain size distributions), isotopic (e.g. Pb-Pb and Hf-W ages) and mineralogical properties of differentiated achondrites. We show that formation of a basaltic crust via melt percolation was limited by the formation time of the body, matrix grain size and viscosity of the melt. We show that low viscosity (< 1 Pa-s) silicate melt can buoyantly migrate on a timescale comparable to the mean life of Al-26. The equilibrium partitioning of Al into silicate partial melt and the migration of that melt acts to dampen internal temperatures. However, subsequent heating from the decay of Fe-60 generated melt fractions in excess of 50%, thus completing differentiation for bodies that accreted within 2 Myr of CAI formation (i.e. the onset of isotopic decay). Migration and concentration of Al-26 into a crust results in remelting of that crust for accretion times less than 2 Myr and for bodies >100 km in size. Differentiation would be most likely for planetesimals larger than 20 km in diameter that accreted within ~2.7 Myr of CAI formation. 	
1107.4776v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1107.4776v2	2014	Set-Theoretic Geology	Gunter Fuchs|Joel David Hamkins|Jonas Reitz	  A ground of the universe V is a transitive proper class W subset V, such that W is a model of ZFC and V is obtained by set forcing over W, so that V = W[G] for some W-generic filter G subset P in W . The model V satisfies the ground axiom GA if there are no such W properly contained in V . The model W is a bedrock of V if W is a ground of V and satisfies the ground axiom. The mantle of V is the intersection of all grounds of V . The generic mantle of V is the intersection of all grounds of all set-forcing extensions of V . The generic HOD, written gHOD, is the intersection of all HODs of all set-forcing extensions. The generic HOD is always a model of ZFC, and the generic mantle is always a model of ZF. Every model of ZFC is the mantle and generic mantle of another model of ZFC. We prove this theorem while also controlling the HOD of the final model, as well as the generic HOD. Iteratively taking the mantle penetrates down through the inner mantles to what we call the outer core, what remains when all outer layers of forcing have been stripped away. Many fundamental questions remain open.

The model pre- dictions and the natural data for the Austroalpine of the Western Alps agree very well in terms of P-T peak conditions, relative chronology of peak and exhumation events, P-T-t paths, thermal gradients and the tectonic evolu- tion of the continental rocks. These findings suggest that a pre-collisional evolution of this domain, with the burial of the continental rocks (induced by ablative subduction of the overriding Adria plate) and their exhumation (driven by an upwelling flow generated in a hydrated mantle wedge) could be a valid mechanism that reproduces the actual tectono-metamorphic config- uration of this part of the Alps. There is less agreement between the model predictions and the natural data for the Austroalpine of the Central-Eastern Alps. Based on the natural data available in the literature, a critical discus- sion of the other proposed mechanisms is presented, and additional geological factors that should be considered within the numerical model are suggested to improve the fitting to the numerical results; these factors include varia- tions in the continental and/or oceanic thickness, variation of the subduction rate and/or slab dip, the initial thermal state of the passive margin, the oc- currence of continental collision and an oblique convergence. 	
1211.0645v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1211.0645v1	2012	Project G.N.O.S.I.S.: Geographical Network Of Synoptic Information   System	Pietro Oliva	  Everybody knows how much synoptic maps are useful today. An excellent example above all is Google Earth: its simplicity and friendly interface allows every user to have the Earth maps ready in just one simple layout; nevertheless a crucial dimension is missing in Google Earth: the time. This doesn't mean we simply aim to add history to Google Earth (though it could be already a nice goal): the main idea behind GNOSIS project is to produce applications to "dress up" the Globe with a set of skin-maps representing the most various different kind of histories like the evolution of geology, genetics, agriculture, ethnology, linguistics, musicology, metallurgy and so forth, in time. It may be interesting in the near future to have such a possibility to watch on the map the positions and movements of the armies during the battles of Waterloo or Thermopylae, the spreading of the cultivation of corn in time, the rise and fall of Roman Empire or the diffusion of Smallpox together with the spread of a religion, a specific dialect, the early pottery techniques or the natural resources available to pre-Columbian civilizations on a Google-Earth-map-like, that is to say to have at one's hand the ultimate didactic-enciclopedic tool. To do so we foresee the use of a general-purpose intermediate/high level programming language, possibly object-oriented such C++ or Java.

Claudin	  In nature, barchan dunes typically exist as members of larger fields that display striking, enigmatic structures that cannot be readily explained by examining the dynamics at the scale of single dunes, or by appealing to patterns in external forcing. To explore the possibility that observed structures emerge spontaneously as a collective result of many dunes interacting with each other, we built a numerical model that treats barchans as discrete entities that interact with one another according to simplified rules derived from theoretical and numerical work and from field observations: (1) Dunes exchange sand through the fluxes that leak from the downwind side of each dune and are captured on their upstream sides; (2) when dunes become sufficiently large, small dunes are born on their downwind sides (`calving'); and (3) when dunes collide directly enough, they merge. Results show that these relatively simple interactions provide potential explanations for a range of field-scale phenomena including isolated patches of dunes and heterogeneous arrangements of similarly sized dunes in denser fields. The results also suggest that (1) dune field characteristics depend on the sand flux fed into the upwind boundary, although (2) moving downwind, the system approaches a common attracting state in which the memory of the upwind conditions vanishes. This work supports the hypothesis that calving exerts a first-order control on field-scale phenomena; it prevents individual dunes from growing without bound, as single-dune analyses suggest, and allows the formation of roughly realistic, persistent dune field patterns.

Losert	  Despite their very low surface gravities, the surfaces of asteroids and comets are covered by granular materials - regolith - that can range from a fine dust to a gravel-like structure of varying depths. Understanding the dynamics of granular materials is, therefore, vital for the interpretation of the surface geology of these small bodies and is also critical for the design and/or operations of any device planned to interact with their surfaces. We present the first measurements of transient weakening of granular material after shear reversal in microgravity as well as a summary of experimental results recently published in other journals, which may have important implications for small-body surfaces. Our results suggest that the force contact network within a granular material may be weaker in microgravity, although the influence of any change in the contact network is felt by the granular material over much larger distances. This could mean that small body surfaces are even more unstable than previously imagined. However, our results also indicate that the consequences of, e.g., a meteorite impact or a spacecraft landing, may be very different depending on the impact angle and location, and depending on the prior history of the small body surface.

Abascal|C. Valeriani	  Among all the freezing transitions, that of water into ice is probably the most relevant to biology, physics, geology or atmospheric science. In this work we investigate homogeneous ice nucleation by means of computer simulations. We evaluate the size of the critical cluster and the nucleation rate for temperatures ranging between 15K and 35K below melting. We use the TIP4P/2005 and the TIP4P/Ice water models. Both give similar results when compared at the same temperature difference with the model's melting temperature. The size of the critical cluster varies from $\sim$8000 molecules (radius$ = 4$nm) at 15K below melting to $\sim$600 molecules (radius$ = 1.7$nm) at 35K below melting. We use Classical Nucleation Theory (CNT) to estimate the ice-water interfacial free energy and the nucleation free energy barrier. We obtain an interfacial free energy of 29(3)mN/m from an extrapolation of our results to the melting temperature. This value is in good agreement both with experimental measurements and with previous estimates from computer simulations of TIP4P-like models. Moreover, we obtain estimates of the nucleation rate from simulations of the critical cluster at the barrier top. The values we get for both models agree within statistical error with experimental measurements. At temperatures higher than 20K below melting we get nucleation rates slower than the appearance of a critical cluster in all the water of the hydrosphere in the age of the universe. Therefore, our simulations predict that water freezing above this temperature must necessarily be heterogeneous.

As part of this project, an accurate 3D seismic derived geological model is needed. The paper shows the procedure used for building the 3D seismic constrained geological model in depth by combining time-to-depth conversion of seismic horizons, consistent seismic velocity model and elastic impedance in time. It also shows how the 3D model is used for mechanical and hydrogeological studies. The 3D seismic field data example illustrates the potential of the proposed depth conversion procedure for estimating density and velocity distributions, which are consistent with the depth conversion of seismic horizons using the Bayesian Kriging method. The geological model shows good agreement with well log data obtained from a reference well, located closest to the 3D seismic survey area. Modeling of the mechanical parameters such as shear modulus, Young modulus, bulk modulus indicates low variability of parameters confirming the homogeneity of the target formation (Callovo-Oxfordian claystone). 3D modeling of a permeability index (Ik-Seis) computed from seismic attributes (instantaneous frequency, envelope, elastic impedance) and validated at the reference well shows promising potential for supporting hydrogeological simulation and decision making related to safety issues.

Solar System bodies exhibit a wide variety of surface environments, even including potential habitable conditions beyond Earth, and it is essential to know how they can be characterized from outside the Solar System. In this study, we provide an overview of geological features of major Solar System solid bodies with minor atmospheres (i.e., the Terrestrial Moon, Mercury, the Galilean moons, and Mars) that affect surface albedo at local to global scale, and we survey how they influence point-source photometry in UV, visible, and near IR (i.e., the reflection-dominant range). We simulate them based on recent mapping products and also compile observed light curves where available. We show a 5-50% peak-to-trough variation amplitude in one spin rotation associated with various geological processes including heterogeneous surface compositions due to igneous activities, interaction with surrounding energetic particles, and distribution of grained materials. Some indications of these processes are provided by the amplitude and wavelength dependence of variation in combinations of the time-averaged spectra. We also estimate the photometric precision needed to detect their spin rotation rates through periodogram analysis. Our survey illustrates realistic possibilities for inferring the detailed properties of solid exoplanets with future direct imaging observations.

A key component of the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) is the Davis Campus, which is in operation at the 4850-foot level (4300 m.w.e.) and currently hosts two main physics projects: the LUX dark matter experiment and the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR neutrinoless double-beta decay experiment. In addition, two low-background counters currently operate at the Davis Campus in support of current and future experiments. Expansion of the underground laboratory space is underway at the 4850L Ross Campus in order to maintain and enhance low-background assay capabilities as well as to host a unique nuclear astrophysics accelerator facility. Plans to accommodate other future experiments at SURF are also underway and include the next generation of direct-search dark matter experiments and the Fermilab-led international long-baseline neutrino program. Planning to understand the infrastructure developments necessary to accommodate these future projects is well advanced and in some cases have already started. SURF is a dedicated research facility with significant expansion capability.

Wood	  In compositional data analysis an observation is a vector containing non-negative values, only the relative sizes of which are considered to be of interest. Without loss of generality, a compositional vector can be taken to be a vector of proportions that sum to one. Data of this type arise in many areas including geology, archaeology, biology, economics and political science. In this paper we investigate methods for classification of compositional data. Our approach centres on the idea of using the $\alpha$-transformation to transform the data and then to classify the transformed data via regularised discriminant analysis and the k-nearest neighbours algorithm. Using the $\alpha$-transformation generalises two rival approaches in compositional data analysis, one (when $\alpha=1$) that treats the data as though they were Euclidean, ignoring the compositional constraint, and another (when $\alpha=0$) that employs Aitchison's centred log-ratio transformation. A numerical study with several real datasets shows that whether using $\alpha=1$ or $\alpha=0$ gives better classification performance depends on the dataset, and moreover that using an intermediate value of $\alpha$ can sometimes give better performance than using either 1 or 0. 	
1506.05938v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.05938v1	2015	Experimental evidence of electrification processes at the 2009 LAquila   earthquake mainshock	P. Nenovski	  Two types of coseismic magnetic field events are simultaneously observed: transient offset events and magnetic field signal that occurred at the destructive, Mw6.1 LAquila earthquake (EQ) mainshock. The offset event, conventionally interpreted as a signature of piezomagnetic effects, however could not be ascribed as such. The reason is that the presently known geology of the LAquila basin consists mainly of carbonates, dolomites and limestone, thus it does not suggest an appearance of piezomagnetic related effects under EQ fracture/slip events. The second type of coseismic event, the transient magnetic signal starts simultaneously with the offset event and reaches amplitude of 0.8 nT in the total magnetic field. The signal is local one, in the sense that its form differs from the signals of ionospheric/magnetospheric origin confirmed (indirectly) by additional magnetic field data in Italy and Central Europe. The reliability of the observed local signal is examined also: it follows from the fact that the transient signal is recorded by two different measurements: i) in components (by fluxgate magnetometers) and 2) absolute one (overhauser magnetometer), it persists after the seismic wave train passage but within the first five minutes after the EQ shock and is not a consequence of ionosphere disturbances caused by the seismic wave train. Its amplitude shape resembles diffusion-like form with time scale characteristics that are indicative for a source deep in the crust. The polarity of the transient signal is in the horizontal plane and nearly parallel to the LAquila fault strike, i.e. along the NW-SE direction.

The model consists of a Gaussian Markov Random Field (GMRF) with Dirichlet observations. A block updated Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), including an adaptive Metropolis adjusted Langevin step, is used to estimate model parameters. The sparse precision matrix in the GMRF provides computational advantages leading to a fast MCMC algorithm. Reconstructions are obtained by combining pollen-based estimates of vegetation cover at a limited number of locations with scenarios of past deforestation and output from a dynamic vegetation model. To evaluate uncertainties in the predictions a novel way of constructing joint confidence regions for the entire composition at each prediction location is proposed. The hierarchical model's ability to reconstruct past land cover is evaluated through cross validation for all time periods, and by comparing reconstructions for the recent past to a present day European forest map. The evaluation results are promising and the model is able to capture known structures in past land-cover compositions.

On the contrary, monitoring the radon concentration in soil by measuring the thermal neutron flux reduces environmental effects. In this paper we report some experimental results on the natural thermal neutron flux as well as the concentration of air radon and its variations at 4300 m a.s.l. These results were obtained with unshielded thermal neutron scintillation detectors (en-detectors) and radon monitors located inside the ARGO-YBJ experimental hall. The correlation of these variations with the lunar month and 1-year period is undoubtedly confirmed. A method for earthquakes prediction provided by a global net of the en-detectors is currently under study. 	
1609.00093v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.00093v1	2016	From geometry to geology: An invitation to mathematical pluralism   through the phenomenon of independence	Jonas Reitz	  This paper explores how a pluralist view can arise in a natural way out of the day-to-day practice of modern set theory. By contrast, the widely accepted orthodox view is that there is an ultimate universe of sets $V$, and it is in this universe that mathematics takes place. From this view, the purpose of set theory is "learning the truth about $V$." It has become apparent, however, that the phenomenon of independence - those questions left unresolved by the axioms - holds a central place in the investigation. This paper introduces the notion of independence, explores the primary tool ("soundness") for establishing independence results, and shows how a plurality of models arises through the investigation of this phenomenon. Building on a familiar example from Euclidean geometry, a template for independence proofs is established. Applying this template in the domain of set theory leads to a consideration of forcing, the tool par excellence for constructing universes of sets. Fifty years of forcing has resulted in a profusion of universes exhibiting a wide variety of characteristics - a multiverse of set theories. Direct study of this multiverse presents technical challenges due to its second-order nature. Nonetheless, there are certain nice "local neighborhoods" of the multiverse that are amenable to first-order analysis, and \emph{set-theoretic geology} studies just such a neighborhood, the collection of grounds of a given universe $V$ of set theory. I will explore some of the properties of this collection, touching on major concepts, open questions, and recent developments.

It has been noticed for a long time that the phenomenon is "scale-free", indicating some type of criticality. In spite of attempts to invoke "Self-Organized Criticality", the physical origin of this criticality, and also its universal nature, being quite insensitive to the nature of microscopic interactions, remained elusive. Recently we proposed that the precise nature of this critical behavior is manifested by a spinodal point of a thermodynamic phase transition. Moreover, at the spinodal point there exists a divergent correlation length which is associated with the system-spanning instabilities (known also as shear bands) which are typical to the mechanical yield. Demonstrating this requires the introduction of an "order parameter" that is suitable for distinguishing between disordered amorphous systems, and an associated correlation function, suitable for picking up the growing correlation length. The theory, the order parameter, and the correlation functions used are universal in nature and can be applied to any amorphous solid that undergoes mechanical yield. Critical exponents for the correlation length divergence and the system size dependence are estimated. The phenomenon is seen at its sharpest in athermal systems, as is explained below; in this paper we extend the discussion also to thermal systems, showing that at sufficiently high temperatures the spinodal phenomenon is destroyed by thermal fluctuations.

Ivanov|Sergey A. Bushmin	  An empirical model of the concentration dependence of the excess Gibbs free energy Gex for saline solutions is proposed. Our simple analytical form of Gex allows obtaining equations of state of saline solutions equally precise in the whole range of the salt concentrations, from dilute solutions up to the limit of solubility. Our equation for Gex includes one term responsible for concentration dependence of Gex at low salt concentrations and two terms of Margules type dependent on powers of mole fractions of the components. These terms contain four parameters dependent on temperature and pressure. As an example of application of the proposed model we took the system H2O-NaCl. For fixed T and P, our four-parameter form of Gex allows precisely reproduce experimental data for NaCl water solutions, including both regions of low and high concentrations. An introduction of temperature dependence of the parameters allowed us to build a precise analytic fit of experimental data on osmotic coefficients of NaCl solutions for saturation pressures of NaCl at temperatures 423.15K-573.15K. On the basis of PVTx data by Driesner (2007) the model was extended towards pressures up to 5kbar. Our form of Gex allows obtaining the molar volumes, activities of components and other thermodynamic properties of NaCl-H2O solutions in the range of temperatures 423.15K-573.15K and pressures from saturation up to 5kbar in the whole range of concentrations possible for H2O-NaCl solutions (from zero up to approximately 10 molal at 573.15K). 	
1705.09269v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.09269v1	2017	Geometric Methods for Robust Data Analysis in High Dimension	Joseph Anderson	  Machine learning and data analysis now finds both scientific and industrial application in biology, chemistry, geology, medicine, and physics. These applications rely on large quantities of data gathered from automated sensors and user input. Furthermore, the dimensionality of many datasets is extreme: more details are being gathered about single user interactions or sensor readings. All of these applications encounter problems with a common theme: use observed data to make inferences about the world. Our work obtains the first provably efficient algorithms for Independent Component Analysis (ICA) in the presence of heavy-tailed data. The main tool in this result is the centroid body (a well-known topic in convex geometry), along with optimization and random walks for sampling from a convex body. This is the first algorithmic use of the centroid body and it is of independent theoretical interest, since it effectively replaces the estimation of covariance from samples, and is more generally accessible.   This reduction relies on a non-linear transformation of samples from such an intersection of halfspaces (i.e. a simplex) to samples which are approximately from a linearly transformed product distribution. Through this transformation of samples, which can be done efficiently, one can then use an ICA algorithm to recover the vertices of the intersection of halfspaces.   Finally, we again use ICA as an algorithmic primitive to construct an efficient solution to the widely-studied problem of learning the parameters of a Gaussian mixture model. Our algorithm again transforms samples from a Gaussian mixture model into samples which fit into the ICA model and, when processed by an ICA algorithm, result in recovery of the mixture parameters. Our algorithm is effective even when the number of Gaussians in the mixture grows polynomially with the ambient dimension

However, it is thought that paleo-magnetism has the incapability in providing paleo-longitude. To obtain this important location parameter many other indirect methods have been developed based on different assumptions. Here we present a direct method to derive the paleo-longitude from the usual paleo-magnetic measurements. This method takes into account the contributions to the Earth's magnetic potential from additional dipoles with their axes in the equatorial plane, which were omitted by the traditional paleo-magnetism. Two explicit formulae for inferring the longitude are obtained. It is shown in synthetic experiments that longitudes can be perfectly derived through these formulae, from the measured components of magnetic field ($B_x, B_y, B_z$), or declination ($D$) and inclination($I$). The errors are mainly from $B_x,B_z$ or $I$. Thus these two explicit formulae can be used in paleo-magnetism as an alternative approach to estimate the paleo-longitude. By this direct approach, we infer the synthetic paleo-longitudes for the reference points in the continents of North America, Eurasia, and India for the last 200 Ma and a reference paleo-longitude for Indo-Asia collision based on paleo-magnetic data. The synthetic trajectories of these reference points, which determined by synthetic paleo-longitudes and paleo-latitudes, show the movements of these three continents had their own respective properties. All of them included different both translation and rotation in four phases. The paleo-longitude for India-Asia collision was at ${132.6^{-27.2}_{+14.7}}^\circ $E.

We find that several OCs potentially hosting SN progenitors have passed within 100 pc of the Sun during the past 35 Myr. In particular we find that ASCC 19, NGC 1981, and NGC 1976 are likely to have hosted one or more SNe while passing within 200 pc of the solar system in the period 17 - 12 Myr BP which might have affected Earths' geology and climate. Besides the stellar history of the individual OCs we also compute 1) a spatial and temporal 2D-probability density map showing the most likely position and time of SN from our sample of OCs within 1 kpc during the past 35 Myr, 2) the time series of the SN rate per volume and 3) the relative SN rate compared with today and corrected for OC evaporation of older generations. The SN rate today from core collapse is estimated to be 37.8$\pm$6.1$\rm kpc^{-3} Myr^{-1}$. During the past 35 Myr we find a peak SN rate around 10 Myr before present (BP) where the rate was 40% higher relative to the past 1 Myr. Finally we discuss possible effects of binary stellar evolution in relation to the history of SN production in the solar neighbourhood and the detected $\rm ^{60}Fe$ signal in terrestrial geological samples induced between $\sim$2.2 - 2.8Myr BP.

Obtaining and analyzing rock samples can provide unprecedented insight into the geology, geo-history and prospects for finding past life and water. Current methods of exploration rely on mission scientists to identify objects of interests and this presents major operational challenges. Finding objects of interests will require systematic and efficient methods to quickly and correctly evaluate the importance of hundreds if not thousands of samples so that the most interesting are saved for further analysis by the mission scientists. In this paper, we propose an automated information theoretic approach to identify shapes of interests using a library of predefined interesting shapes. These predefined shapes maybe human input or samples that are then extrapolated by the shape matching system using the Superformula to judge the importance of newly obtained objects. Shape samples are matched to a library of shapes using the eigenfaces approach enabling categorization and prioritization of the sample. The approach shows robustness to simulated sensor noise of up to 20%. The effect of shape parameters and rotational angle on shape matching accuracy has been analyzed. The approach shows significant promise and efforts are underway in testing the algorithm with real rock samples.

Design of efficient strategies for safe, long-term storage requires the capability to efficiently simulate processes taking place on very different temporal and spatial scales. The physical laws describing CO2 storage are the same as for hydrocarbon recovery, but the characteristic spatial and temporal scales are quite different. Petroleum reservoirs seldom extend more than tens of kilometers and have operational horizons spanning decades. Injected CO2 needs to be safely contained for hundreds or thousands of years, during which it can migrate hundreds or thousands of kilometers. Because of the vast scales involved, conventional 3D reservoir simulation quickly becomes computationally unfeasible. Large density difference between injected CO2 and resident brine means that vertical segregation will take place relatively quickly, and depth-integrated models assuming vertical equilibrium (VE) often represents a better strategy to simulate long-term migration of CO2 in large-scale aquifer systems. VE models have primarily been formulated for relatively simple rock formations and have not been coupled to 3D simulation in a uniform way. In particular, known VE simulations have not been applied to models of realistic geology in which many flow compartments may exist in-between impermeable layers. In this paper, we generalize the concept of VE models, formulated in terms of well-proven reservoir simulation technology, to complex aquifer systems with multiple layers and regions. We also introduce novel formulations for multi-layered VE models by use of both direct spill and diffuse leakage between individual layers. This new layered 3D model is then coupled to a state-of-the-art, 3D black-oil type model.

Consequently, the reservoir models used for production optimization are subject to significant uncertainty. To minimize the associated risk, the oil literature has mainly used ensemble-based methods to optimize sample estimated risk measures of net present value (NPV). However, the success in reducing risk critically depends on the choice of risk measure. As a systematic approach to risk mitigation in production optimization, this paper characterizes proper risk measures by the axioms of coherence and aversion. As an example of a proper measure, we consider conditional value-at-risk, $\text{CVaR}_{\alpha}$, at different risk levels, $\alpha$. The potential of $\text{CVaR}_{\alpha}$ to minimize profit loss is demonstrated by a simulated case study. The case study compares $\text{CVaR}_{\alpha}$ to real-world best practices, represented by reactive control. It shows that for any risk level, $\alpha$, we may find an optimized strategy that provides lower risk than reactive control. However, despite overall lower risk, we see that all optimized strategies still yield some unacceptable low profit realizations relative to reactive control. To remedy this, we introduce a risk mitigation method based on the NPV offset distribution. Unlike existing methods of the oil literature, the offset risk mitigation approach minimizes the risk relative to a reference strategy representing common real-life practices, e.g. reactive control. In the simulated case study, we minimize the worst case profit offset to reduce the risk of realizations that do worse than the reactive strategy. The results suggest that it may be more relevant to consider the NPV offset distribution than the NPV distribution when minimizing risk in production optimization.

McGuire|Javier Gomez-Elvira|Jose Antonio Rodriguez-Manfredi|Eduardo Sebastian-Martinez|Jens Ormo|Enrique Diaz-Martinez|Markus Oesker|Robert Haschke|Joerg Ontrup|Helge Ritter	  We present results from the first geological field tests of the `Cyborg Astrobiologist', which is a wearable computer and video camcorder system that we are using to test and train a computer-vision system towards having some of the autonomous decision-making capabilities of a field-geologist. The Cyborg Astrobiologist platform has thus far been used for testing and development of these algorithms and systems: robotic acquisition of quasi-mosaics of images, real-time image segmentation, and real-time determination of interesting points in the image mosaics. This work is more of a test of the whole system, rather than of any one part of the system. However, beyond the concept of the system itself, the uncommon map (despite its simplicity) is the main innovative part of the system. The uncommon map helps to determine interest-points in a context-free manner. Overall, the hardware and software systems function reliably, and the computer-vision algorithms are adequate for the first field tests. In addition to the proof-of-concept aspect of these field tests, the main result of these field tests is the enumeration of those issues that we can improve in the future, including: dealing with structural shadow and microtexture, and also, controlling the camera's zoom lens in an intelligent manner. Nonetheless, despite these and other technical inadequacies, this Cyborg Astrobiologist system, consisting of a camera-equipped wearable-computer and its computer-vision algorithms, has demonstrated its ability of finding genuinely interesting points in real-time in the geological scenery, and then gathering more information about these interest points in an automated manner. We use these capabilities for autonomous guidance towards geological points-of-interest.

Omerbashich	  New periods can emerge from data as a byproduct of incorrect processing or even the method applied. In one such recent instance, a new life cycle with a 62+-3 Myr period was reportedly found (about trend) in genus variations from the Sepkoski compendium, the world most complete fossil record. The approach that led to reporting this period was based on Fourier method of spectral analysis. I show here that no such period is found when the original data set is considered rigorously and processed in the Gauss-Vanicek spectral analysis. I also demonstrate that data altering can boost spectral power up to a nearly 100 percent increase in the signal range, thus introducing artificial, "99 percent significant" periods as seen in the corresponding variance-spectra of noise. Besides geology and paleontology, virtually all science and engineering disciplines could benefit from the approach described here. The main general advantages of the Gauss-Vanicek spectral analysis lay in period detection from gapped records and in straightforward testing of statistical null hypothesis. The main advantage of the method for physical sciences is its use as a field descriptor for accurate simultaneous detection of eigenfrequencies and relative dynamics. Besides analyzing incomplete records, researchers might also want to remove less-trustworthy data from any time series before analyzing it with the Gauss-Vanicek method. This could increase both the accuracy and reliability of spectral analyses in general.

Moskovitz|Robert Jedicke|Eric Gaidos|Mark Willman|David Nesvorny|Ronald Fevig|Zeljko Ivezic	  We present the observational results of a survey designed to target and detect asteroids whose colors are similar to those of Vesta family members and thus may be considered as candidates for having a basaltic composition. Fifty basaltic candidates were selected with orbital elements that lie outside of the Vesta dynamical family. Optical and near-infrared spectra were used to assign a taxonomic type to 11 of the 50 candidates. Ten of these were spectroscopically confirmed as V-type asteroids, suggesting that most of the candidates are basaltic and can be used to constrain the distribution of basaltic material in the Main Belt.   Using our catalog of V-type candidates and the success rate of the survey, we calculate unbiased size-frequency and semi-major axis distributions of V-type asteroids. These distributions, in addition to an estimate for the total mass of basaltic material, suggest that Vesta was the predominant contributor to the basaltic asteroid inventory of the Main Belt, however scattered planetesimals from the inner Solar System (a < 2.0 AU) and other partially/fully differentiated bodies likely contributed to this inventory. In particular, we infer the presence of basaltic fragments in the vicinity of asteroid 15 Eunomia, which may be derived from a differentiated parent body in the middle Main Belt (2.5 < a < 2.8). We find no asteroidal evidence for a large number of previously undiscovered basaltic asteroids, which agrees with previous theories suggesting that basaltic fragments from the ~100 differentiated parent bodies represented in meteorite collections have been "battered to bits" [Burbine, T.H., Meibom, A., Binzel, R.P., 1996. Mantle material in the Main Belt: Battered to bits? Met. & Planet. Sci. 31, 607].

Moskovitz|Eric Gaidos|Darren Williams	  We investigate the influence of lunar-like satellites on the infrared orbital light curves of Earth-analog extra-solar planets. Such light curves will be obtained by NASA's Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF) and ESA's Darwin missions as a consequence of repeat observations to confirm the companion status of a putative planet. We use an energy balance model to calculate disk-averaged infrared (bolometric) fluxes from planet-satellite systems over a full orbital period (one year). The satellites are assumed to lack an atmosphere, have a low thermal inertia like that of the Moon and span a range of plausible radii. The planets are assumed to have thermal and orbital properties that mimic those of the Earth while their obliquities and orbital longitudes of inferior conjunction remain free parameters. Even if the gross thermal properties of the planet can be independently constrained (e.g. via spectroscopy or visible-wavelength detection of specular glint from a surface ocean) only the largest (approximately Mars-size) lunar-like satellites can be detected by light curve data from a TPF-like instrument (i.e. one that achieves a photometric signal-to-noise of 10-20 at infrared wavelengths). Non-detection of a lunar-like satellite can obfuscate the interpretation of a given system's infrared light curve so that it may resemble a single planet with high obliquity, different orbital longitude of vernal equinox relative to inferior conjunction and in some cases drastically different thermal characteristics. If the thermal properties of the planet are not independently established then the presence of a lunar-like satellite cannot be inferred from infrared data, thus demonstrating that photometric light curves alone can only be used for preliminary study of extra-solar Earth-like planets.

This mission, under a Phase 0 study performed by CNES, will aim at Neptune and Triton. Two sets of objectives will be pursued. The first one is to perform a set of gravitation experiments at the Solar System scale. Experimental tests of gravitation have always shown good agreement with General Relativity. There are however drivers to continue testing General Relativity, and to do so at the largest possible scales. From a theoretical point of view, Einstein's theory of gravitation shows inconsistencies with a quantum description of Nature and unified theories predict deviations from General Relativity. From an observational point of view, as long as dark matter and dark energy are not observed through other means than their gravitational effects, they can be considered as a manifestation of a modification of General Relativity at cosmic scales. The scientific objectives are to: (i) test the gravitation law at the Solar System scale; (ii) measure the Eddington parameter; and (iii) investigate the navigation anomalies during fly-bys. To fulfil these objectives, the following components are to be on board the spacecraft: (i) the Gravity Advanced Package (GAP), which is an electrostatic accelerometer to which a rotating stage is added; (ii) radio-science; (iii) laser ranging, to improve significantly the measure of the Eddington parameter. The second set of objectives is to enhance our knowledge of Neptune and Triton. Several instruments dedicated to planetology are foreseen: camera, spectrometer, dust and particle detectors, and magnetometer. Depending on the ones kept, the mission could provide information on the gravity field, the atmosphere and the magnetosphere of the two bodies as well as on the surface geology of Triton and on the nature of the planetary rings around Neptune.

Head|J. -B. Madeleine|B. Charnay	  We discuss 3D global simulations of the early Martian climate that we have performed assuming a faint young Sun and denser CO2 atmosphere. We include a self-consistent representation of the water cycle, with atmosphere-surface interactions, atmospheric transport, and the radiative effects of CO2 and H2O gas and clouds taken into account. We find that for atmospheric pressures greater than a fraction of a bar, the adiabatic cooling effect causes temperatures in the southern highland valley network regions to fall significantly below the global average. Long-term climate evolution simulations indicate that in these circumstances, water ice is transported to the highlands from low-lying regions for a wide range of orbital obliquities, regardless of the extent of the Tharsis bulge. In addition, an extended water ice cap forms on the southern pole, approximately corresponding to the location of the Noachian/Hesperian era Dorsa Argentea Formation. Even for a multiple-bar CO2 atmosphere, conditions are too cold to allow long-term surface liquid water. Limited melting occurs on warm summer days in some locations, but only for surface albedo and thermal inertia conditions that may be unrealistic for water ice. Nonetheless, meteorite impacts and volcanism could potentially cause intense episodic melting under such conditions. Because ice migration to higher altitudes is a robust mechanism for recharging highland water sources after such events, we suggest that this globally sub-zero, `icy highlands' scenario for the late Noachian climate may be sufficient to explain most of the fluvial geology without the need to invoke additional long-term warming mechanisms or an early warm, wet Mars.

Dietmar Müller	  The Banda Arc, situated west of Irian Jaya and in the easternmost extension of the Sunda subduction zone system, reveals a characteristic bowl-shaped geometry in seismic tomographic images. This indicates that the oceanic lithosphere still remains attached to the surrounding continental margins of northern Australia and the Bird's Head microcontinent. Major controversies exist between authors proposing an allochthonous or autochthonous origin of the Bird's Head block. Either scenario has important implications for plate kinematic models aiming to reconstruct the tectonic evolution of the region and the late Jurassic seaoor spreading geometry of this now subducted Argo-Tanimbar-Seram (ATS) ocean basin. Wider implications affect the tectonic conguration of the Tethyan-Pacic realm, the distribution of plate boundaries as well as the shape and size of continental blocks which have been rifted off the northeastern Gondwana margin during the Late Jurassic and are now accreted to the SE Asia margin. We apply structural geology restoration techniques to unfold the subducted oceanic lithosphere of the Banda Slab. Our slab unfolding results help to discriminate between the different hypotheses concerning the origin and kinematic history of the Bird's Head tectonic block. According to our preferred model, the block is required to rotate 20-35 degrees clockwise relative to its present-day position and that the initial geometry of the ATS ocean basin was more or less rectangular shaped. We evaluate currently accepted plate kinematic scenarios for the Jurassic and younger seaoor spreading history north of Australia in conjunction with our restored ocean basin geometry and conclude that the Bird's Head block is autochthonous to western Irian Jaya, with its western margin being a continental transform margin during the rifting and opening of the ATS ocean.

Guillot	  The objective of this study is to use molecular dynamics simulation (MD) to evaluate the vesicularity and noble gas fractionation, and to shed light on bubble formation during MORB degassing. A previous simulation study (Guillot and Sator (2011) GCA 75, 1829-1857) has shown that the solubility of CO2 in basaltic melts increases steadily with the pressure and deviates significantly from Henry's law at high pressures (e.g. 9.5 wt% CO2 at 50 kbar as compared with 2.5 wt% from Henry's law). From the CO2 solubility curve and the equations of state of the two coexisting phases (silicate melt and supercritical CO2), deduced from the MD simulation, we have evaluated the evolution of the vesicularity of a MORB melt at depth as function of its initial CO2 contents. An excellent agreement is obtained between calculations and data on MORB samples collected at oceanic ridges. Moreover, by implementing the test particle method (Guillot and Sator (2012) GCA 80, 51-69), the solubility of noble gases in the two coexisting phases (supercritical CO2 and CO2-saturated melt), the partitioning and the fractionation of noble gases between melt and vesicles have been evaluated as function of the pressure. We show that the melt/CO2 partition coefficients of noble gases increase significantly with the pressure whereas the large distribution of the 4He/40Ar* ratio reported in the literature is explained if the magma experiences a suite of vesiculation and vesicle loss during ascent. By applying a pressure drop to a volatile bearing melt, the MD simulation reveals the main steps of bubble formation and noble gas transfer at the nanometric scale. A key result is that the transfer of noble gases is found to be driven by CO2 bubble nucleation, a finding which suggests that the diffusivity difference between He and Ar in the degassing melt has virtually no effect on the 4He/40Ar* ratio measured in the vesicles.

P. Buso|A. Caciolli|Carmignani L.|I. Callegari|T. Colonna|K. Dule|G. Fiorentini|M. Kaçeli Xhixha|F. Mantovani|G. Massa|R. Menegazzo|L. Mou|C. Rossi Alvarez|V. Strati|G. Xhixha|A. Zanon	  In this paper we present maps of K, eU, and eTh abundances of Elba Island (Italy) obtained with a multivariate spatial interpolation of airborne {\gamma}-ray data using the constraints of the geologic map. The radiometric measurements were performed by a module of four NaI(Tl) crystals of 16 L mounted on an autogyro. We applied the collocated cokriging (CCoK) as a multivariate estimation method for interpolating the primary under-sampled airborne {\gamma}-ray data considering the well-sampled geological information as ancillary variables. A random number has been assigned to each of 73 geological formations identified in the geological map at scale 1:10,000. The non-dependency of the estimated results from the random numbering process has been tested for three distinct models. The experimental cross-semivariograms constructed for radioelement-geology couples show well-defined co-variability structures for both direct and crossed variograms. The high statistical correlations among K, eU, and eTh measurements are confirmed also by the same maximum distance of spatial autocorrelation. Combining the smoothing effects of probabilistic interpolator and the abrupt discontinuities of the geological map, the results show a distinct correlation between the geological formation and radioactivity content. The contour of Mt. Capanne pluton can be distinguished by high K, eU and eTh abundances, while different degrees of radioactivity content identify the tectonic units. A clear anomaly of high K content in the Mt. Calamita promontory confirms the presence of felsic dykes and hydrothermal veins not reported in our geological map. Although we assign a unique number to each geological formation, the method shows that the internal variability of the radiometric data is not biased by the multivariate interpolation.

Torreno-Pina|Pietro Massignan|Gerald J. Lapeyre Jr.|Maciej Lewenstein|Maria F. Garcia Parajo	  Molecular transport in living systems regulates numerous processes underlying biological function. Although many cellular components exhibit anomalous diffusion, only recently has the subdiffusive motion been associated with nonergodic behavior. These findings have stimulated new questions for their implications in statistical mechanics and cell biology. Is nonergodicity a common strategy shared by living systems? Which physical mechanisms generate it? What are its implications for biological function? Here, we use single particle tracking to demonstrate that the motion of DC-SIGN, a receptor with unique pathogen recognition capabilities, reveals nonergodic subdiffusion on living cell membranes. In contrast to previous studies, this behavior is incompatible with transient immobilization and therefore it can not be interpreted according to continuous time random walk theory. We show that the receptor undergoes changes of diffusivity, consistent with the current view of the cell membrane as a highly dynamic and diverse environment. Simulations based on a model of ordinary random walk in complex media quantitatively reproduce all our observations, pointing toward diffusion heterogeneity as the cause of DC-SIGN behavior. By studying different receptor mutants, we further correlate receptor motion to its molecular structure, thus establishing a strong link between nonergodicity and biological function. These results underscore the role of disorder in cell membranes and its connection with function regulation. Due to its generality, our approach offers a framework to interpret anomalous transport in other complex media where dynamic heterogeneity might play a major role, such as those found, e.g., in soft condensed matter, geology and ecology. 	
1408.3524v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1408.3524v1	2014	Cosmic-ray exposure ages of fossil micrometeorites from mid-Ordovician   sediments at Lynna River, Russia	Matthias M. M. Meier|Birger Schmitz|Anders Lindskog|Colin Maden|Rainer Wieler	  We measured the He and Ne concentrations of 50 individual extraterrestrial chromite grains recovered from mid-Ordovician (lower Darriwilian) sediments from the Lynna River section near St. Petersburg, Russia. High concentrations of solar wind-like He and Ne found in most grains indicate that they were delivered to Earth as micrometeoritic dust, while their abundance, stratigraphic position and major element composition indicate an origin related to the L chondrite parent body (LCPB) break-up event, 470 Ma ago. Compared to sediment-dispersed extraterrestrial chromite (SEC) grains extracted from coeval sediments at other localities, the grains from Lynna River are both highly concentrated and well preserved. As in previous work, in most grains from Lynna River, high concentrations of solar wind-derived He and Ne impede a clear quantification of cosmic-ray produced He and Ne. However, we have found several SEC grains poor in solar wind Ne, showing a resolvable contribution of cosmogenic 21Ne. This makes it possible, for the first time, to determine robust cosmic-ray exposure (CRE) ages in these fossil micrometeorites, on the order of a few hundred-thousand years. These ages are similar to the CRE ages measured in chromite grains from cm-sized fossil meteorites recovered from coeval sediments in Sweden. As the CRE ages are shorter than the orbital decay time of grains of this size by Poynting-Robertson drag, this suggests that the grains were delivered to Earth through direct injection into an orbital resonance. We demonstrate how CRE ages of fossil micrometeorites can be used, in principle, to determine sedimentation rates, and to correlate the sediments at Lynna River with the fossil meteorite-bearing sediment layers in Sweden.

Delano	  Lunar impact glasses, quenched melts produced during cratering events on the Moon, have the potential to provide not only compositional information about both the local and regional geology of the Moon but also information about the impact flux over time. We present in this paper the results of 73 new 40Ar/39Ar analyses of well-characterized, inclusion-free lunar impact glasses and demonstrate that size, shape, chemical composition, fraction of radiogenic 40Ar retained, and cosmic ray exposure (CRE) ages are important for 40Ar/39Ar investigations of these samples. Specifically, analyses of lunar impact glasses from the Apollo 14, 16, and 17 landing sites indicate that retention of radiogenic 40Ar is a strong function of post-formation thermal history in the lunar regolith, size, and chemical composition. Based on the relationships presented in this paper, lunar impact glasses with compositions and sizes sufficient to have retained 90% of their radiogenic Ar during 750 Ma of cosmic ray exposure at time-integrated temperatures of up to 290 K have been identified and are likely to have yielded reliable 40Ar/39Ar ages of formation. Additionally, ~50% of the identified impact glass spheres have formation ages of <500 Ma, while ~75% of the identified lunar impact glass shards and spheres have ages of formation <2000 Ma. The observed age-frequency distribution of lunar impact glasses may reflect two processes: (i) diminished preservation due to spontaneous shattering with age; and (ii) preservation of a remnant population of impact glasses from the tail end of the terminal lunar bombardment having 40Ar/39Ar ages up to 3800 Ma. A protocol is described for selecting and analyzing lunar impact glasses.

Cloutis|Paul Mann|Christian Müller|Thomas Platz|Tanja Schäfer	  We introduce an innovative three-dimensional spectral approach (three band parameter space with polyhedrons) that can be used for both qualitative and quantitative analyses improving the characterization of surface heterogeneity of (4) Vesta. It is an advanced and more robust methodology compared to the standard two-dimensional spectral approach (two band parameter space). The Dawn Framing Camera (FC) color data obtained during High Altitude Mapping Orbit (resolution ~ 60 m/pixel) is used. The main focus is on the howardite-eucrite-diogenite (HED) lithologies containing carbonaceous chondritic material, olivine, and impact-melt. The archived spectra of HEDs and their mixtures, from RELAB, HOSERLab and USGS databases as well as our laboratory-measured spectra are used for this study. Three-dimensional convex polyhedrons are defined using computed band parameter values of laboratory spectra. Polyhedrons based on the parameters of Band Tilt (R0.92{\mu}m/R0.96{\mu}m), Mid Ratio ((R0.75{\mu}m/R0.83{\mu}m)/(R0.83{\mu}m/R0.92{\mu}m)) and reflectance at 0.55 {\mu}m (R0.55{\mu}m) are chosen for the present analysis. An algorithm in IDL programming language is employed to assign FC data points to the respective polyhedrons. The Arruntia region in the northern hemisphere of Vesta is selected for a case study because of its geological and mineralogical importance. We observe that this region is eucrite-dominated howarditic in composition. The extent of olivine-rich exposures within an area of 2.5 crater radii is ~ 12% larger than the previous finding (Thangjam et al., 2014). Lithologies of nearly pure CM2-chondrite, olivine, glass, and diogenite are not found in this region. Our spectral approach can be extended to the entire Vestan surface to study the heterogeneous surface composition and its geology.

Thompson|Aneurin Evans|Sarah J. Day|C. A. Murray|J. E. Parker|A. R. Baker|J. M. Oliveira|J. Th. van Loon	  There is evidence to suggest that clathrate hydrates have a significant effect on the surface geology of icy bodies in the Solar System. However the aqueous environments believed to be present on these bodies are likely to be saline rather than pure water. Laboratory work to underpin the properties of clathrates in such environments is lacking. We fill this gap by carrying out a laboratory investigation of the physical properties of CO$_2$ clathrates produced in weak aqueous solutions of MgSO$_4$. We use synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction to investigate clathrates formed at high CO$_2$ pressure in ice that has formed from aqueous solutions of MgSO$_4$. We measure the thermal expansion, density and dissociation properties of the clathrates under temperature conditions similar to those on icy Solar System bodies. We find that the sulphate solution inhibits the formation of clathrates by lowering their dissociation temperatures. Hysteresis is found in the thermal expansion coefficients as clathrates are cooled and heated; we attribute this to the presence of the salt in solution. The density derived from X-ray powder diffraction is temperature and pressure dependent. When comparing the density of CO$_2$ clathrates to that of the solution in which they formed, we conclude that they sink in the oceans in which they form. We also find that the polymorph of ice present at low temperatures is Ih rather than Ic, which we attribute to the presence of the MgSO$_4$. We 1) conclude that the clathrate density has implications for their behaviour in satellite oceans as their sinking and floating capabilities are temperature and pressure dependent, 2) conclude that the presence of MgSO$_4$ inhibits the formation of clathrates and in some cases may even affect their structure and 3) report the dominance of Ih throughout the experimental procedure despite Ic being the stable phase at low temperature.

Meier|Sanna Holm-Alwmark	  Rampino & Caldeira (2015) carry out a circular spectral analysis (CSA) of the terrestrial impact cratering record over the past 260 million years (Ma), and suggest a ~26 Ma periodicity of impact events. For some of the impacts in that analysis, new accurate and high-precision ("robust"; 2SE<2%) 40Ar-39Ar ages have recently been published, resulting in significant age shifts. In a CSA of the updated impact age list, the periodicity is strongly reduced. In a CSA of a list containing only impacts with robust ages, we find no significant periodicity for the last 500 Ma. We show that if we relax the assumption of a fully periodic impact record, assuming it to be a mix of a periodic and a random component instead, we should have found a periodic component if it contributes more than ~80% of the impacts in the last 260 Ma. The difference between our CSA and the one by Rampino & Caldeira (2015) originates in a subset of "clustered" impacts (i.e., with overlapping ages). The ~26 Ma periodicity seemingly carried by these clusters alone is strongly significant if tested against a random distribution of ages, but this significance disappears if it is tested against a distribution containing (randomly-spaced) clusters. The presence of a few impact age clusters (e.g., from asteroid break-up events) in an otherwise random impact record can thus give rise to false periodicity peaks in a CSA. There is currently no evidence for periodicity in the impact record.

Why are the terrestrial planets so different? Venus should be the most Earth-like of all our planetary neighbours: its size, bulk composition and distance from the Sun are very similar to those of Earth. Its original atmosphere was probably similar to that of early Earth, with abundant water that would have been liquid under the young sun's fainter output. Even today, with its global cloud cover, the surface of Venus receives less solar energy than does Earth, so why did a moderate climate ensue here but a catastrophic runaway greenhouse on Venus? How and why did it all go wrong for Venus? What lessons can be learned about the life story of terrestrial planets in general, in this era of discovery of Earth-like exoplanets? Were the radically different evolutionary paths of Earth and Venus driven solely by distance from the Sun, or do internal dynamics, geological activity, volcanic outgassing and weathering also play an important part?   Following the primarily atmospheric focus of Venus Express, we propose a new Venus orbiter named EnVision, to focus on Venus' geology and geochemical cycles, seeking evidence for present and past activity. The payload comprises a state-of-the-art S-band radar which will be able to return imagery at spatial resolutions of 1 - 30 m, and capable of measuring cm-scale deformation; this is complemented by subsurface radar, IR and UV spectrometers to map volcanic gases, and by geodetic investigations.

Herrmann|P. Hart|A. Tomada|J. Koglin|G. Haller|S. Boutet|M. Messerschmidt|G. Williams|M. Chollet|G. Dakovski|S. Nelson|J. Pines|S. Song|J. Thayer	  Silicon drift detectors (SDDs) revolutionized spectroscopy in fields as diverse as geology and dentistry. For a subset of experiments at ultra-fast, x-ray free-electron lasers (FELs), SDDs can make substantial contributions. Often the unknown spectrum is interesting, carrying science data, or the background measurement is useful to identify unexpected signals. Many measurements involve only several discrete photon energies known a priori. We designed a pulse function (a combination of gradual step and exponential decay function) and demonstrated that for individual pulses the signal amplitude, peaking time, and pulse amplitude are interrelated and the signal amplitude and peaking time are obtained for each pulse by fitting. Avoiding pulse shaping reduced peaking times to tens of nanoseconds, resulting in reduced pulse pile-up and allowing decomposition of remaining pulse pile-up at photon separation times down to 100~ns while yielding time-of-arrival information with precision of 10~nanoseconds. At pulsed sources or high photon rates, photon pile-up still occurs. We showed that the area of one photon peaks is not suitable for estimating high photon rates while pile-up spectrum fitting is relatively simple and preferable to pile-up spectrum deconvolution. We developed a photon pile-up model for constant intensity sources, extended it to variable intensity sources (typical for FELs) and used it to fit a complex pile-up spectrum, demonstrating its accuracy. Based on the pile-up model, we developed a Bayesian pile-up decomposition method that allows decomposing pile-up of single events with up to 6 photons from 6 monochromatic lines with 99% accuracy. The usefulness of SDDs will continue into the x-ray FEL era of science. Their successors, the ePixS hybrid pixel detectors, already offer hundreds of pixels, each with similar performance to an SDD, in a compact, robust and affordable package.

Ramirez	  The climate of early Mars has been hotly debated for decades. Although most investigators believe that the geology indicates the presence of surface water, disagreement has persisted regarding how warm and wet the surface must have been and how long such conditions may have existed. Although the geologic evidence is most easily explained by a persistently warm climate, the perceived difficulty that climate models have in generating warm surface conditions has seeded various models that assume a cold and glaciated early Mars punctuated by transient warming episodes. However, I use a single-column radiative-convective climate model to show that it is relatively more straightforward to satisfy warm and relatively unglaciated early Mars conditions, requiring only about 1 percent H2 and 3 bar CO2 or about 20 percent H2 and 0.55 bar CO2. In contrast, the reflectivity of surface ice greatly increases the difficulty to transiently warm an initially frozen surface. Surface pressure thresholds required for warm conditions increase about 10 to 60 percent for transient warming models, depending on ice cover fraction. No warm solution is possible for ice cover fractions exceeding 40, 70, and 85 percent for mixed snow and ice and 25, 35, and 49 percent for fresher snow and ice at H2 concentrations of 3, 10, and 20 percent, respectively. If high temperatures (298 to 323 K) were required to produce the observed surface clay amounts on a transiently warm early Mars (Bishop et al), I show that such temperatures would have required surface pressures that exceed available paleopressure constraints for nearly all H2 concentrations considered (1 to 20 percent). I then argue that a warm and semi-arid climate remains the simplest and most logical solution to Mars paleoclimate.

Asteroids, due to their low gravity are a challenging target for surface exploration. Current missions envision performing touch-and-go operations over an asteroid surface. In this work, we analyse the feasibility of sending scores of nano-landers, each 1 kg in mass and volume of 1U, or 1000 cm3. These landers would hop, roll and fly over the asteroid surface. The landers would include science instruments such as stereo cameras, hand-lens imagers and spectrometers to characterize rock composition. A network of nano-landers situated on the surface of an asteroid can provide unique and very detailed measurements of a spacecraft impacting onto an asteroid surface. A full-scale, artificial impact experiment onto an asteroid can help characterize its composition and geology and help in the development of asteroid deflection techniques intended for planetary defence. Scores of nano-landers could provide multiple complementary views of the impact, resultant seismic activity and trajectory of the ejecta. The nano-landers can analyse the pristine, unearthed regolith shielded from effects of UV and cosmic rays and that may be millions of years old. Our approach to formulating this mission concepts utilizes automated machine learning techniques in the planning and design of space systems. We use a form of Darwinian selection to select and identify suitable number of nano-landers, the on-board instruments and control system to explore and navigate the asteroid environment. Scenarios are generated in simulation and evaluated against quantifiable mission goals such as area explored on the asteroid and amount of data recorded from the impact event.

Mengel|M. R. M. Izawa|D. M. Applin	  Variations and spatial distributions of bright and dark material on dwarf planet Ceres play a key role in understanding the processes that have led to its present surface composition. We define limits for bright and dark material in order to distinguish them consistently, based on the reflectance of the average surface using Dawn Framing Camera data. A systematic classification of four types of bright material is presented based on their spectral properties, composition, spatial distribution, and association with specific geomorphological features. We found obvious correlations of reflectance with spectral shape (slopes) and age; however, this is not unique throughout the bright spots. Although impact features show generally more extreme reflectance variations, several areas can only be understood in terms of inhomogeneous distribution of composition as inferred from Dawn Visible and Infrared Spectrometer data. Additional material with anomalous composition and spectral properties are rare. The identification of the composition and origin of the dark, particularly the darkest material, remains to be explored. The spectral properties and the morphology of the dark sites suggest an endogenic origin, but it is not clear whether they are more or less primitive surficial exposures or excavated subsurface but localized material. The reflectance, spectral properties, inferred composition, and geologic context collectively suggest that the bright and dark material tends to gradually change toward the average surface over time. This could be because of multiple processes, i.e., impact gardening/space weathering, and lateral mixing, including thermal and aqueous alteration, accompanied by changes in composition and physical properties such as grain size, surface temperature, and porosity (compaction).

Schelble|S. Vance| ;	  Astrobiology, the study of life as a planetary phenomenon, aims to understand the fundamental nature of life on earth and the possibility of life elsewhere. To achieve this goal, astrobiologists have initiated unprecedented communication between the disciplines of astronomy, biology, chemistry, and geology. The Astrobiology Primer has been created as a reference tool for those who are interested in the interdisciplinary field of astrobiology. The field incorporates many diverse research endeavors, but it is our hope that this slim volume will present the reader with all he or she needs to know to become involved and to understand, at least at a fundamental level, the state of the art. Because of the great diversity of material, each section was written by a different author with a different expertise. The Primer was constructed collaboratively. Ninety researchers from around the world contributed information with regard to what they expected from other astrobiologists and what they would like to know themselves but still had difficulty understanding (see Contributors). Those submissions were read and considered by the Editors who produced a list of seven general categories of knowledge, represented by the seven chapters in the Primer: 1) Stellar Formation and Evolution, 2) Planetary Formation and Evolution, 3) Astrobiogeochemistry and the Origin of Life, 4) Evolution of Life through Time, 5) Planet Detection & Characterization, 6) Diversity of Life, and 7) Science in Space. No one volume, of course, can contain the vast amount of information brought to play in astrobiology, but we believe that the Primer will provide a forum and a language around which the community will have the opportunity to develop a consensus about central issues.

Martins|V. Petit|J. S. Vink|S. Bagnulo|C. P. Folsom|Y. Nazé|N. R. Walborn|R. H. D. Townsend|C. J. Evans|the MiMeS Collaboration	  We report magnetic and spectroscopic observations and modeling of the Of?p star HD 148937 within the context of the MiMeS LP at the CFHT. Thirty-two high signal-to-noise ratio circularly polarised (Stokes V) spectra and 13 unpolarised (Stokes I) spectra of HD 148937 were acquired in 2009 and 2010. A definite detection of a Stokes V Zeeman signature is obtained in the grand mean of all observations (in both LSD mean profiles and individual spectral lines). The longitudinal magnetic field inferred from the Stokes V LSD profiles is consistently negative, in contrast to the essentially zero field strength measured from the diagnostic null profiles. A period search of equivalent width measurements confirms the previously-reported 7.03 d variability period. The variation of equivalent widths is not strictly periodic: we present evidence for evolution of the amount or distribution of circumstellar plasma. Interpreting the 7.03 d period as the stellar rotational period within the context of the ORM, we have phased the equivalent widths and longitudinal field measurements. The longitudinal field measurements show a weak sinusoidal variation of constant sign, with extrema out of phase with the H{\alpha} variation by about 0.25 cycles. The inferred magnetic configuration confirms the suggestion of Naz\'e et al (2010), who proposed that the weaker variability of HD 148937 as compared to other members of this class is a consequence of the stellar geometry. Based on the derived magnetic properties and published wind characteristics, we find a wind magnetic confinement parameter \eta\ast \simeq 20 and rotation parameter W = 0.12, supporting a picture in which the Halpha emission and other line variability have their origin in an oblique, rigidly rotating magnetospheric structure resulting from a magnetically channeled wind.

Spyrou|E. Thiagalingam	  Background: Measurements of $\beta$ decay provide important nuclear structure information that can be used to probe isospin asymmetries and inform nuclear astrophysics studies. Purpose: To measure the $\beta$-delayed $\gamma$ decay of $^{26}$P and compare the results with previous experimental results and shell-model calculations. Method: A $^{26}$P fast beam produced using nuclear fragmentation was implanted into a planar germanium detector. Its $\beta$-delayed $\gamma$-ray emission was measured with an array of 16 high-purity germanium detectors. Positrons emitted in the decay were detected in coincidence to reduce the background. Results: The absolute intensities of $^{26}$P $\beta$-delayed $\gamma$-rays were determined. A total of six new $\beta$-decay branches and 15 new $\gamma$-ray lines have been observed for the first time in $^{26}$P $\beta$-decay. A complete $\beta$-decay scheme was built for the allowed transitions to bound excited states of $^{26}$Si. $ft$ values and Gamow-Teller strengths were also determined for these transitions and compared with shell model calculations and the mirror $\beta$-decay of $^{26}$Na, revealing significant mirror asymmetries. Conclusions: A very good agreement with theoretical predictions based on the USDB shell model is observed. The significant mirror asymmetry observed for the transition to the first excited state ($\delta=51(10)\%$) may be evidence for a proton halo in $^{26}$P.

Pluto's surface displays diverse landforms, terrain ages, albedos, colors, and composition gradients. Evidence is found for a water-ice crust, geologically young surface units, surface ice convection, wind streaks, volatile transport, and glacial flow. Pluto's atmosphere is highly extended, with trace hydrocarbons, a global haze layer, and a surface pressure near 10 microbars. Pluto's diverse surface geology and long-term activity raise fundamental questions about how small planets remain active many billions of years after formation. Pluto's large moon Charon displays tectonics and evidence for a heterogeneous crustal composition, its north pole displays puzzling dark terrain. Small satellites Hydra and Nix have higher albedos than expected.

All the data from SDSS-III are now made public. In particular, this paper describes Data Release 11 (DR11) including all data acquired through 2013 July, and Data Release 12 (DR12) adding data acquired through 2014 July (including all data included in previous data releases), marking the end of SDSS-III observing. Relative to our previous public release (DR10), DR12 adds one million new spectra of galaxies and quasars from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) over an additional 3000 sq. deg of sky, more than triples the number of H-band spectra of stars as part of the Apache Point Observatory (APO) Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE), and includes repeated accurate radial velocity measurements of 5500 stars from the Multi-Object APO Radial Velocity Exoplanet Large-area Survey (MARVELS). The APOGEE outputs now include measured abundances of 15 different elements for each star. In total, SDSS-III added 2350 sq. deg of ugriz imaging; 155,520 spectra of 138,099 stars as part of the Sloan Exploration of Galactic Understanding and Evolution 2 (SEGUE-2) survey; 2,497,484 BOSS spectra of 1,372,737 galaxies, 294,512 quasars, and 247,216 stars over 9376 sq. deg; 618,080 APOGEE spectra of 156,593 stars; and 197,040 MARVELS spectra of 5,513 stars. Since its first light in 1998, SDSS has imaged over 1/3 of the Celestial sphere in five bands and obtained over five million astronomical spectra.
