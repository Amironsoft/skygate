Gasda	  When injecting CO2 or other fluids into a geological formation, pressure plays an important role both as a driver of flow and as a risk factor for mechanical integrity.   The full effect of geomechanics on aquifer flow can only be captured using a coupled flow-geomechanics model. In order to solve this computationally expensive system, various strategies have been put forwards over the years, with some of the best current methods based on sequential splitting.   In the present work, we seek to approximate the full geomechanical effect on flow without the need of coupling with a geomechanics solver during simulation, and at a computational cost comparable to that of an uncoupled model. We do this by means of precomputed pressure response functions. At grid model generation time, a geomechanics solver is used to compute the mechanical response of the aquifer for a set of pressure fields. The relevant information from these responses is then stored in a compact form and embedded with the grid model.   We test the accuracy and computational performance of our approach on a simple 2D and a more complex 3D model, and compare the results with those produced by a fully coupled approach as well as from a simple decoupled method based on Geertsma's uniaxial expansion coefficient.

1512.04581v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.04581v2	2017	Testing a coupled hydro-thermo-chemo-geomechanical model for gas hydrate   bearing sediments using triaxial compression lab experiments	Shubhangi Gupta|Christian Deusner|Matthias Haeckel|Rainer Helmig|Barbara Wohlmuth	  Natural gas hydrates are considered a potential resource for gas production on industrial scales. Gas hydrates contribute to the strength and stiffness of the hydrate-bearing sediments. During gas production, the geomechanical stability of the sediment is compromised. Due to the potential geotechnical risks and process management issues, the mechanical behavior of the gas hydrate-bearing sediments needs to be carefully considered. In this study, we describe a coupling concept that simplifies the mathematical description of the complex interactions occuring during gas production by isolating the effects of sediment deformation and hydrate phase changes. Central to this coupling concept is the assumption that the soil grains form the load-bearing solid skeleton, while the gas hydrate enhances the mechanical properties of this skeleton. We focus on testing this coupling concept in capturing the overall impact of geomechanics on gas production behavior though numerical simulation of a high-pressure isotropic compression experiment combined with methane hydrate formation and dissociation. We consider a linear-elastic stress-strain relationship because it is uniquely defined and easy to calibrate. Since, in reality, the geomechanical response of the hydrate bearing sediment is typically inelastic and is characterized by a significant shear-volumetric coupling, we control the experiment very carefully in order to keep the sample deformations small and well within the assumptions of poro-elasticity. The closely co-ordinated experimental and numerical procedures enable us to validate the proposed simplified geomechanics-to-flow coupling, and set an important precursor towards enhancing our coupled hydro-geomechanical hydrate reservoir simulator with more suitable elasto-plastic constitutive models.

Yang|S. S. Hakim|S. Bruns|M. Rogowska|S. Boehnert|J. U. Hammel|S. L. S. Stipp|H. O. Sørensen	  The dissolution of porous media in a geologic formation induced by the injection of massive amounts of CO2 can undermine the mechanical stability of the formation structure before carbon mineralization takes place. The geomechanical impact of geologic carbon storage is therefore closely related to the structural sustainability of the chosen reservoir as well as the probability of buoyancy driven CO2 leakage through caprocks. Here we show, with a combination of ex situ nanotomography and in situ microtomography, that the presence of dissolved CO2 in water produces a homogeneous dissolution pattern in natural chalk microstructure. This pattern stems from a greater apparent solubility of chalk and therefore a greater reactive subvolume in a sample. When a porous medium dissolves homogeneously in an imposed flow field, three geomechanical effects were observed: material compaction, fracturing and grain relocation. These phenomena demonstrated distinct feedbacks to the migration of the dissolution front and severely complicated the infiltration instability problem. We conclude that the presence of dissolved CO2 makes the dissolution front less susceptible to spatial and temporal perturbations in the strongly coupled geochemical and geomechanical processes.

It combines the discrete element method (DEM) for the modeling of the solid phase and a pore-scale finite volume (PFV) formulation for the flow of an incompressible pore fluid. The coupling equations are derived and contrasted against the equations of conventional poroelasticity. An analogy is found between the DEM-PFV coupling and Biot's theory in the limit case of incompressible phases. The simulation of an oedometer test validates the coupling scheme and demonstrates the ability of the model to capture strong poromechanical effects. A detailed analysis of microscale strain and stress confirms the analogy with poroelasticity. An immersed deposition problem is finally simulated and shows the potential of the method to handle phase transitions.

Wohlmuth|Rainer Helmig	  We present an extrapolation-based semi-implicit multirate time stepping (MRT) scheme and a compound-fast MRT scheme for a naturally partitioned, multi-time-scale hydro-geomechanical hydrate reservoir model. We evaluate the performance of the two MRT methods compared to an iteratively coupled solution scheme and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. The performance of the two MRT methods is evaluated in terms of speed-up and accuracy by comparison to an iteratively coupled solution scheme. We observe that the extrapolation-based semi-implicit method gives a higher speed-up but is strongly dependent on the relative time scales of the latent (slow) and active (fast) components. On the other hand, the compound-fast method is more robust and less sensitive to the relative time scales, but gives lower speed up as compared to the semi-implicit method, especially when the relative time scales of the active and latent components are comparable. 	
1606.09508v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.09508v2	2017	Virtual Element Method for geomechanics on reservoir grids	Odd Andersen|Halvor M. Nilsen|Xavier Raynaud	  In this paper we study the use of Virtual Element method for geomechanics. Our emphasis is on applications to reservoir simulations. The physical processes that form the reservoirs, such as sedimentation, erosion and faulting, lead to complex geometrical structures. A minimal representation, with respect to the physical parameters of the system, then naturally leads to general polyhedral grids. Numerical methods which can directly handle this representation will be highly favorable, in particular in the setting of advanced work-flows. The Virtual Element method is a promising candidate to solve the linear elasticity equations on such models. In this paper, we investigate some of the limits of the VEM method when used on reservoir models. First, we demonstrate that care must be taken to make the method robust for highly elongated cells, which is common in these applications, and show the importance of calculating forces in terms of traction on the boundary of the elements for elongated distorted cells. Second, we study the effect of triangulations on the surfaces of curved faces, which also naturally occur in subsurface models. We also demonstrate how a more stable regularization term for reservoir application can be derived.

Wheeler	  In this work, we present numerical studies of fixed-stress iterative coupling for solving flow and geomechanics with propagating fractures in a porous medium. Specifically, fracture propagations are described by employing a phase-field approach. The extension to fixed-stress splitting to propagating phase-field fractures and systematic investigation of its properties are important enhancements to existing studies. Moreover, we provide an accurate computation of the fracture opening using level-set approaches and a subsequent finite element interpolation of the width. The latter enters as fracture permeability into the pressure diffraction problem which is crucial for fluid filled fractures. Our developments are substantiated with several numerical tests that include comparisons of computational cost for iterative coupling and nonlinear and linear iterations as well as convergence studies in space and time. 	
1303.5304v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1303.5304v1	2013	A laboratory investigation of thermally induced pore pressures in the   Callovo-Oxfordian Claystone	Mehrdokht Mohajerani|Pierre Delage|Jean Sulem|Mohammad Monfared|Anh-Minh Tang|Behrouz Gatmiri	  In the framework of research into radioactive waste disposal, it was decided to investigate the thermally induce pore pressure occurring in the Callovo-Oxfordian claystone, a possible host rock in which the ANDRA underground laboratory of Bure (East of France) has been excavated. Thermal pore pressures appear in low permeability soils and rocks because the thermal expansion coefficient of water is significantly higher than that of the solid grains (Campanella and Mitchell; 1968 [1], Ghabezloo and Sulem; 2009 [2]). This phenomenon has clearly been observed in various in-situ heating tests conducted in Opalinus claystone in the Mont-Terri Underground Research Laboratory (URL) in Switzerland (HE-D test) and in Callovo-Oxfordian (COx) claystone in the Bure URL in France (TER test, Wileveau and Su; 2007 [3]) The processes of coring, transportation, storage and specimen trimming induce some desaturation in the sample. Due to the very low permeability (10-20 m2) of the COx claystone, a long period of time is necessary to properly resaturate the sample, a mandatory condition to satisfactorily investigate thermal pressurisation. Particular emphasis was hence put on the previous saturation procedure that was carried out under in-situ effective stress condition. Thermal pressurization has been investigated by performing undrained heating tests while measuring pore pressures changes in a specially adapted thermal isotropic compression cell. Special care was devoted to calibration procedures to account for the effects of the system on the pore pressure measurements. The thermal pressurization coefficient measured appeared to change with temperature, mainly because of the changes with temperature of both the water thermal expansion coefficient of water and the drained compression coefficient of the claystone. 	
0902.1309v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/0902.1309v1	2009	Numerical Simulation of Gas Storage Caverns in Qom Region	Mostafa Sharifzadeh|Ali Moradi Ghasr	  The rock mechanical design of gas storage cavern in salt requires the analysis of the stability and the usability of the cavern over the planned operating time period. The design includes the build up of a rock mass model and a numerical model taking into account the geological situation, load condition, geometrical condition, and material parameters. In this paper multiple caverns in salt formation with geological and geomechanical situation in Qom (central part of Iran) was investigated a using creep model. Minimum safe center to center distances (CTCD) of multiple horizontal caverns also were studied. CTCD of caverns interact at less than two times of cavern diameter. With increasing the CTCD to 2.5 times cavern diameters, diminish most interaction. 	
1206.6711v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.6711v1	2012	L'approche energetique en mecanique des materiaux granulaires	E. Frossard	  This communication establishes first, that basis of discontinuous granular materials mechanics, are the explicit result of a new approach of the physics of energy dissipation by friction, and second, that these mechanics of discontinua, transposed to the equivalent continuous media, as used in geomechanics, is directly responsible for a large set of practical properties of these materials, part of the fundamentals of Soil Mechanics. These physics of energy dissipation are developped on the original concept of energy rate tensor of internal actions. 	
1408.0645v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1408.0645v2	2014	Robust joint full-waveform inversion of time-lapse seismic data sets   with total-variation regularization	Musa Maharramov|Biondo Biondi	  We present a technique for reconstructing subsurface velocity model changes from time-lapse seismic survey data using full-waveform inversion (FWI). The technique is based on simultaneously inverting multiple survey vintages, with model difference regularization using the total variation (TV) seminorm. We compare the new TV-regularized time-lapse FWI with the $L_2$-regularized joint inversion proposed in our earlier work, using synthetic data sets that exhibit survey repeatability issues. The results demonstrate clear advantages of the proposed TV-regularized joint inversion over alternatives methods for recovering production-induced model changes that are due to both fluid substitution and geomechanical effects. 	
1505.05694v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.05694v1	2015	Total-variation minimization with bound constraints	Musa Maharramov|Stewart A. Levin	  We present a powerful and easy-to-implement algorithm for solving constrained optimization problems that involve $L_1$/total-variation regularization terms, and both equality and inequality constraints. We discuss the relationship of our method to earlier works of Goldstein and Osher (2009) and Chartrand and Wohlberg (2010), and demonstrate that our approach is a combination of the augmented Lagrangian method with splitting and model projection. We test the method on a geomechanical problem and invert highly compartmentalized pressure change from noisy surface uplift observations. We conclude the paper with a discussion of possible extension to a wide class of regularized optimization problems with bound and equality constraints.

The impact of gas adsorption, real gas properties, gas flow in nano-scale pore space and geomechanics effects on total gas flow capacity are investigated. We also showed that by elevating shale rock temperature, the characteristic of gas adsorption behavior can be substantially altered. 	
1802.00949v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.00949v1	2018	A parallel-in-time fixed-stress splitting method for Biot's   consolidation model	Manuel Borregales|Kundan Kumar|Florin Adrian Radu|Carmen Rodrigo|Francisco José Gaspar	  In this work, we study the parallel-in-time iterative solution of coupled flow and geomechanics in porous media, modelled by a two-field formulation of the Biot's equations. In particular, we propose a new version of the fixed stress splitting method, which has been widely used as solution method of these problems. This new approach forgets about the sequential nature of the temporal variable and considers the time direction as a further direction for parallelization. We present a rigorous convergence analysis of the method and a numerical experiment to demonstrate the robust behaviour of the algorithm. 	
1802.04256v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.04256v1	2018	GeoMFree3D: An Under-Development Meshfree Software Package for   Geomechanics	Gang Mei|Nengxiong Xu|Liangliang Xu|Yazhe Li	  This paper briefly reports the GeoMFree3D, a meshfree / meshless software package designed for analyzing the problems of large deformations and crack propagations of rock and soil masses in geotechnics. The GeoMFree3D is developed based on the meshfree RPIM, and accelerated by exploiting the parallel computing on multi-core CPU and many-core GPU. The GeoMFree3D is currently being under intensive developments. To demonstrate the correctness and effectiveness of the GeoMFree3D, several simple verification examples are presented in this paper. Moreover, future work on the development of the GeoMFree3D is introduced. 	
1508.01421v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.01421v1	2015	Non-Isothermal, Multi-phase, Multi-component Flows through Deformable   Methane Hydrate Reservoirs	Shubhangi Gupta|Rainer Helmig|Barbara Wohlmuth	  We present a hydro-geomechanical model for subsurface methane hydrate systems. Our model considers kinetic hydrate phase change and non-isothermal, multi-phase, multi-component flow in elastically deforming soils. The model accounts for the effects of hydrate phase change and pore pressure changes on the mechanical properties of the soil, and also for the effect of soil deformation on the fluid-solid interaction properties relevant to reaction and transport processes (e.g., permeability, capillary pressure, reaction surface area). We discuss a 'cause-effect' based decoupling strategy for the model and present our numerical discretization and solution scheme. We then identify the important model components and couplings which are most vital for a hydro-geomechanical hydrate simulator, namely, 1) dissociation kinetics, 2) hydrate phase change coupled with non-isothermal two phase two component flow, 3) two phase flow coupled with linear elasticity (poroelasticity coupling), and finally 4) hydrate phase change coupled with poroelasticity (kinetics-poroelasticity coupling) and present numerical examples where, for each example, one of the aforementioned model components/couplings is isolated. A special emphasis is laid on the kinetics-poroelasticity coupling. We also present a more complex 3D example based on a subsurface hydrate reservoir which is destabilized through depressurization using a low pressure gas well. In this example, we simulate the melting of hydrate, methane gas generation, and the resulting ground subsidence and stress build-up in the vicinity of the well. 	
0510066v3	http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0510066v3	2006	Modeling 1-D elastic P-waves in a fractured rock with hyperbolic jump   conditions	Bruno Lombard|Joël Piraux	  The propagation of elastic waves in a fractured rock is investigated, both theoretically and numerically. Outside the fractures, the propagation of compressional waves is described in the simple framework of one-dimensional linear elastodynamics. The focus here is on the interactions between the waves and fractures: for this purpose, the mechanical behavior of the fractures is modeled using nonlinear jump conditions deduced from the Bandis-Barton model classicaly used in geomechanics. Well-posedness of the initial-boundary value problem thus obtained is proved. Numerical modeling is performed by coupling a time-domain finite-difference scheme with an interface method accounting for the jump conditions. The numerical experiments show the effects of contact nonlinearities. The harmonics generated may provide a non-destructive means of evaluating the mechanical properties of fractures. 	
0808.2009v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/0808.2009v1	2008	Thermo-Poro-Mechanical Properties of Clayey Gouge and Application to   Rapid Fault Shearing	Jean Sulem|Paul Lazar|Ioannis Vardoulakis	  In this paper, the mechanism of fault pressurization in rapid slip events is analyzed on the basis of a complete characterization of the thermo-poro-mechanical behavior of a clayey gouge extracted at 760m depth in Aigion fault in the active seismic zone of the Gulf of Corinth, Greece. It is shown that the thermally collapsible character of this clayey gouge can be responsible for a dramatic reduction of effective stress and a full fluidization of the material. The thickness of the 'ultra localized' zone of highly strained material is a key parameter that controls the competing phenomena of pore pressure increase leading to fluidization of the fault gouge and temperature increase leading to pore fluid vaporization. 	
1005.3439v4	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1005.3439v4	2011	Small World Property of a Rock Joint(Complexity of Frictional   Interfaces: A Complex Network Perspective)	Hamed O. Ghaffari|M. Sharifzadeh|E. Evgin	  The shear strength and stick-slip behavior of a rough rock joint are analyzed using the complex network approach. We develop a network approach on correlation patterns of void spaces of an evolvable rough fracture (crack type II). Correlation among networks properties with the hydro -mechanical attributes (obtained from experimental tests) of fracture before and after slip is the direct result of the revealed non-contacts networks. Joint distribution of locally and globally filtered correlation gives a close relation to the contact zones attachment-detachment sequences through the evolution of shear strength of the rock joint. Especially spread of node's degree rate to spread of clustering coefficient rate yielded possible stick and slip sequences during the displacements. Our method can be developed to investigate the complexity of stick-slip behavior of faults as well as energy /stress localization on crumpled shells/sheets in which ridge networks are controlling the energy distribution. 	
1205.6299v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1205.6299v1	2012	Interaction between Injection Points during Hydraulic Fracturing	Kjetil M. D. Hals|Inga Berre	  We present a model of the hydraulic fracturing of heterogeneous poroelastic media. The formalism is an effective continuum model that captures the coupled dynamics of the fluid pressure and the fractured rock matrix and models both the tensile and shear failure of the rock. As an application of the formalism, we study the geomechanical stress interaction between two injection points during hydraulic fracturing (hydrofracking) and how this interaction influences the fracturing process. For injection points that are separated by less than a critical correlation length, we find that the fracturing process around each point is strongly correlated with the position of the neighboring point. The magnitude of the correlation length depends on the degree of heterogeneity of the rock and is on the order of 30-45 m for rocks with low permeabilities. In the strongly correlated regime, we predict a novel effective fracture-force that attracts the fractures toward the neighboring injection point.

Herrmann	  We explore possible applications of the Lattice-Boltzmann Method for the simulation of geophysical flows. This fluid solver, while successful in other fields, is still rarely used for geotechnical applications. We show how the standard method can be modified to represent free-surface realization of mudflows, debris flows, and in general any plastic flow, through the implementation of a Bingham constitutive model. The chapter is completed by an example of a full-scale simulation of a plastic fluid flowing down an inclined channel and depositing on a flat surface. An application is given, where the fluid interacts with a vertical obstacle in the channel. 	
1511.04870v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.04870v1	2015	Isogeometric Boundary Element Analysis with elasto-plastic inclusions.   Part 1: Plane problems	Gernot Beer|Benjamin Marussig|Jürgen Zechner|Christian Dünser|Thomas-Peter Fries	  In this work a novel approach is presented for the isogeometric Boundary Element analysis of domains that contain inclusions with different elastic properties than the ones used for computing the fundamental solutions. In addition the inclusion may exhibit inelastic material behavior. In this paper only plane stress/strain problems are considered.   In our approach the geometry of the inclusion is described using NURBS basis functions. The advantage over currently used methods is that no discretization into cells is required in order to evaluate the arising volume integrals. The other difference to current approaches is that Kernels of lower singularity are used in the domain term. The implementation is verified on simple finite and infinite domain examples with various boundary conditions. Finally a practical application in geomechanics is presented. 	
1608.04144v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.04144v2	2016	A multiscale framework for the simulation of the anisotropic mechanical   behavior of shale	Weixin Li|Roozbeh Rezakhani|Congrui Jin|Xinwei Zhou|Gianluca Cusatis	  Shale, like many other sedimentary rocks, is typically heterogeneous, anisotropic, and is characterized by partial alignment of anisotropic clay minerals and naturally formed bedding planes. In this study, a micromechanical framework based on the Lattice Discrete Particle Model (LDPM) is formulated to capture these features. Material anisotropy is introduced through an approximated geometric description of shale internal structure, which includes representation of material property variation with orientation and explicit modeling of parallel lamination. The model is calibrated by carrying out numerical simulations to match various experimental data, including the ones relevant to elastic properties, Brazilian tensile strength, and unconfined compressive strength. Furthermore, parametric study is performed to investigate the relationship between the mesoscale parameters and the macroscopic properties. It is shown that the dependence of the elastic stiffness, strength, and failure mode on loading orientation can be captured successfully. Finally, a homogenization approach based on the asymptotic expansion of field variables is applied to upscale the proposed micromechanical model, and the properties of the homogenized model are analyzed.

Tenreiro Machado	  In this paper, a new fractional operator of variable order with the use of the monotonic increasing function is proposed in sense of Caputo type. The properties in term of the Laplace and Fourier transforms are analyzed and the results for the anomalous diffusion equations of variable order are discussed. The new formulation is efficient in modeling a class of concentrations in the complex transport process. 	
1706.06468v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.06468v1	2017	A finite-strain hyperviscoplastic model and undrained triaxial tests of   peat	L. Zhang|B. C. O'Kelly|T. Nagel	  This paper presents a finite-strain hyperviscoplastic constitutive model within a thermodynamically consistent framework for peat which was categorised as a material with both rate-dependent and thermodynamic equilibrium hysteresis based on the data reported in the literature. The model was implemented numerically using implicit time integration and verified against analytical solutions under simplified conditions. Experimental studies on the undrained relaxation and loading-unloading-reloading behaviour of an undisturbed fibrous peat were carried out to define the thermodynamic equilibrium state during deviatoric loading as a prerequisite for further modelling, to fit particularly those model parameters related to solid matrix properties, and to validate the proposed model under undrained conditions. This validation performed by comparison to experimental results showed that the hyperviscoplastic model could simulate undrained triaxial compression tests carried out at five different strain rates with loading/unloading relaxation steps. 	
1801.00615v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.00615v1	2018	Computational multiscale methods for linear heterogeneous poroelasticity	Robert Altmann|Eric Chung|Roland Maier|Daniel Peterseim|Sai-Mang Pun	  We consider a strongly heterogeneous medium saturated by an incompressible viscous fluid as it appears in geomechanical modeling. This poroelasticity problem suffers from rapidly oscillating material parameters, which calls for a thorough numerical treatment. In this paper, we propose a method based on the local orthogonal decomposition technique and motivated by a similar approach used for linear thermoelasticity. Therein, local corrector problems are constructed in line with the static equations, whereas we propose to consider the full system. This allows to benefit from the given saddle point structure and results in two decoupled corrector problems for the displacement and the pressure. We prove the optimal first-order convergence of this method and verify the result by numerical experiments. 	
0803.1306v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/0803.1306v1	2008	An evaluation of the osmotic method of controlling suction	Pierre Delage|Yu Jun Cui	  Experimental techniques of testing the mechanical properties of unsaturated soils are complex and difficult to conduct. As a consequence, complete sets of parameters that characterise the behaviour of unsaturated soils remain scarce and necessary. In this context, it has been found useful to gather the information obtained after some years of practice of the osmotic technique of controlling suction. As compared to the more documented axis-translation technique, the osmotic technique has its own advantages and drawbacks that are discussed in this paper, together with some potential future developments. The osmotic method has been developed by soil scientists in the 1960s and adapted to geotechnical testing in the early 1970s. This paper presents the osmotic technique and comments on its advantages (including suction condition close to reality and higher suctions easily attained) and drawbacks (including some concern with the membrane resistance and some membrane effects in the suction/concentration calibration). Various applications to geotechnical testing are presented such as the determination of the water retention curve, oedometer and triaxial testing procedures and the determination of the permeability of unsaturated soils. Recent developments, that include the extension of the method up to high suctions (10 MPa) are also described, together with some recent and novel applications such as data from high controlled suction oedometer compression test and the determination of the oil/water retention properties of oil reservoir chalks. 	
1105.1013v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1105.1013v1	2011	On the capillary stress tensor in wet granular materials	Luc Scholtès|Pierre-Yves Hicher|François Nicot|Bruno Chareyre|Félix Darve	  This paper presents a micromechanical study of unsaturated granular media in the pendular regime, based upon numerical experiments using the discrete element method, compared to a microstructural elastoplastic model. Water effects are taken into account by adding capillary menisci at contacts and their consequences in terms of force and water volume are studied. Simulations of triaxial compression tests are used to investigate both macro and micro-effects of a partial saturation. The results provided by the two methods appear to be in good agreement, reproducing the major trends of a partially saturated granular assembly, such as the increase in the shear strength and the hardening with suction. Moreover, a capillary stress tensor is exhibited from capillary forces by using homogenisation techniques. Both macroscopic and microscopic considerations emphasize an induced anisotropy of the capillary stress tensor in relation with the pore fluid distribution inside the material. In so far as the tensorial nature of this fluid fabric implies shear effects on the solid phase associated with suction, a comparison has been made with the standard equivalent pore pressure assumption. It is shown that water effects induce microstrural phenomena that cannot be considered at the macro level, particularly when dealing with material history. Thus, the study points out that unsaturated soil stress definitions should include, besides the macroscopic stresses such as the total stress, the microscopic interparticle stresses such as the ones resulting from capillary forces, in order to interpret more precisely the implications of the pore fluid on the mechanical behaviour of granular materials. 	
1108.3402v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1108.3402v1	2011	Modeling seismic wave propagation and amplification in 1D/2D/3D linear   and nonlinear unbounded media	Jean-François Semblat	  To analyze seismic wave propagation in geological structures, it is possible to consider various numerical approaches: the finite difference method, the spectral element method, the boundary element method, the finite element method, the finite volume method, etc. All these methods have various advantages and drawbacks. The amplification of seismic waves in surface soil layers is mainly due to the velocity contrast between these layers and, possibly, to topographic effects around crests and hills. The influence of the geometry of alluvial basins on the amplification process is also know to be large. Nevertheless, strong heterogeneities and complex geometries are not easy to take into account with all numerical methods. 2D/3D models are needed in many situations and the efficiency/accuracy of the numerical methods in such cases is in question. Furthermore, the radiation conditions at infinity are not easy to handle with finite differences or finite/spectral elements whereas it is explicitely accounted in the Boundary Element Method. Various absorbing layer methods (e.g. F-PML, M-PML) were recently proposed to attenuate the spurious wave reflections especially in some difficult cases such as shallow numerical models or grazing incidences. Finally, strong earthquakes involve nonlinear effects in surficial soil layers. To model strong ground motion, it is thus necessary to consider the nonlinear dynamic behaviour of soils and simultaneously investigate seismic wave propagation in complex 2D/3D geological structures! Recent advances in numerical formulations and constitutive models in such complex situations are presented and discussed in this paper. A crucial issue is the availability of the field/laboratory data to feed and validate such models. 	
1202.5198v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1202.5198v1	2012	Network Theory, Cracking and Frictional Sliding	H. O. Ghaffari|R. P. Young	  We have developed different network approaches to complex patterns of frictional interfaces (contact areas developments). Here, we analyze the dynamics of static friction. We found, under the correlation measure, the fraction of triangles correlates with the detachment fronts. Also, for all types of the loops (such as triangles), there is a universal power law between nodes' degree and motifs where motifs frequency follow a power law. This shows high energy localization is characterized by fast variation of the loops fraction. Also, this proves that the congestion of loops occurs around hubs. Furthermore, the motif distributions and modularity space of networks -in terms of within-module degree and participation coefficient- show universal trends, indicating an in common aspect of energy flow in shear ruptures. Moreover, we confirmed that slow ruptures generally hold small localization, while regular ruptures carry a high level of energy localization. We proposed that assortativity, as an index to correlation of node's degree, can uncover acoustic features of the interfaces. We showed that increasing assortativity induces a nearly silent period of fault's activities. Also, we proposed that slow ruptures resulted from within-module developments rather than extra-modules of the networks. Our approach presents a completely new perspective of the evolution of shear ruptures.

Prevost	  Deep saline aquifers are promising geological reservoirs for CO2 sequestration if they do not leak. The absence of leakage is provided by the caprock integrity. However, CO2 injection operations may change the geomechanical stresses and cause fracturing of the caprock. We present a model for the propagation of a fracture in the caprock driven by the outflow of fluid from a low-permeability aquifer. We show that to describe the fracture propagation, it is necessary to solve the pressure diffusion problem in the aquifer. We solve the problem numerically for the two-dimensional domain and show that, after a relatively short time, the solution is close to that of one-dimensional problem, which can be solved analytically. We use the relations derived in the hydraulic fracture literature to relate the the width of the fracture to its length and the flux into it, which allows us to obtain an analytical expression for the fracture length as a function of time. Using these results we predict the propagation of a hypothetical fracture at the In Salah CO2 injection site to be as fast as a typical hydraulic fracture. We also show that the hydrostatic and geostatic effects cause the increase of the driving force for the fracture propagation and, therefore, our solution serves as an estimate from below. Numerical estimates show that if a fracture appears, it is likely that it will become a pathway for CO2 leakage.

Glinsky|Andrea Cortis|Jinsong Chen|Doug Sassen|Howard Rael	  An extension of a previously developed rock physics model is made that quantifies the relationship between the ductile fraction of a brittle/ductile binary mixture and the isotropic seismic reflection response. By making a weak scattering (Born) approximation and plane wave (eikonal) approximation, with a subsequent ordering according to the angle of incidence, singular value decomposition analysis are done to understand the stack weightings, number of stacks, and the type of stacks that will optimally estimate the two fundamental rock physics parameters. Through this angle ordering, it is found that effective wavelets can be used for the stacks up to second order. Finally, it is concluded that the full PP stack and the "full" PS stack are the two optimal stacks needed to estimate the two rock physics parameters. They dominate over both the second order AVO "gradient" stack and the higher order (4th order) PP stack (even at large angles of incidence). Using this result and model based Bayesian inversion, the detectability of the ductile fraction (shown by others to be the important quantity for the geomechanical response of unconventional reservoir fracking) is demonstrated on a model characteristic of the Marcellus shale play.

LDPM is formulated in the framework of discrete mechanics and it simulates the heterogeneous deformation of cemented granular systems by means of discrete compatibility/equilibrium equations defined at the grain scale. A numerical strategy is proposed to generate a realistic microstructure based on the actual grain size distribution of a sandstone and the capabilities of the method are illustrated with reference to the particular case of Bleurswiller sandstone, i.e. a granular rock that has been extensively studied at the laboratory scale. LDPM micromechanical parameters are calibrated based on evidences from triaxial experiments, such as hydrostatic compression, brittle failure at low confinement and plastic behavior at high confinement. Results show that LDPM allows exploring the effect of fine-scale heterogeneity on the inelastic response of rock cores, achieving excellent quantitative performance across a wide range of stress conditions. In addition, LDPM simulations demonstrate its capability of capturing different modes of strain localization within a unified mechanical framework, which makes this approach applicable for a wide variety of geomechanical settings. Such promising performance suggests that LDPM may constitute a viable alternative to existing discrete numerical methods for granular rocks, as well as a versatile tool for the interpretation of their complex deformation/failure patterns and for the development of continuum models capturing the effect of micro-scale heterogeneity.

The impact of the movements of the ground on existing structures is generally dramatic. It is therefore necessary to accurately predict these movements (settlements and horizontal extension or compression displacements). Even though it is obvious that the overall stiffness and weight of the structure influences the size and shape of the soil movement, the main features of this soil-structure interaction phenomenon are not well established. Caudron et al. (2006) developed an original small-scale physical model to take the soil-structure interaction into account. It is based on the use of the frictional Schneebeli material (assembly of small diameter rods) and a modified version including cohesion in order to reproduce a cohesive layer above a cavity. The displacements of the soil are obtained from digital images processing by particle image velocimetry (PIV). Interesting results were obtained, probing that the soil-structure interactions could be analysed by this experimental model. This article is focused in a first part on the influence of the position of the structure with respect to the cavity position. Consequences on the areas mainly concerned by horizontal compression or extension of the structure are determined. It appears that the stresses induced in the building are a superposition of several elementary loading (sum of the effects of the slope, the horizontal deformations and the curvature). The second part concerns the effect of the relative soil/structure stiffness on the ground movement during a cavity collapse by considering a second model of structure with similar dimensions but more flexible.

Wettlaufer	  Compressing a porous material will decrease the volume of the pore space, driving fluid out. Similarly, injecting fluid into a porous material can expand the pore space, distorting the solid skeleton. This poromechanical coupling has applications ranging from tissue mechanics to hydrogeology. The classical theory of linear poroelasticity captures this coupling by combining Darcy's law with Terzaghi's effective stress and linear elasticity in a linearized kinematic framework. Linear poroelasticity is a good model for very small deformations, but it becomes increasingly inappropriate for moderate to large deformations, which are common in the context of phenomena such as swelling and damage, and for soft materials such as gels and tissues. The well-known theory of large-deformation poroelasticity combines Darcy's law with Terzaghi's effective stress and nonlinear elasticity in a rigorous kinematic framework. This theory has been used extensively in biomechanics to model large elastic deformations in soft tissues, and in geomechanics to model large elastoplastic deformations in soils. Here, we first provide an overview and discussion of this theory with an emphasis on the physics of poromechanical coupling. We present the large-deformation theory in an Eulerian framework to minimize the mathematical complexity, and we show how this nonlinear theory simplifies to linear poroelasticity under the assumption of small strain. We then compare the predictions of linear poroelasticity with those of large-deformation poroelasticity in the context of two uniaxial model problems: Fluid outflow driven by an applied mechanical load (the consolidation problem) and compression driven by a steady fluid throughflow. We use these problems to explore the steady and dynamical errors associated with the linear model in both situations, as well as the impact of introducing a deformation-dependent permeability.
