1608.04144v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.04144v2	2016	A multiscale framework for the simulation of the anisotropic mechanical   behavior of shale	Weixin Li|Roozbeh Rezakhani|Congrui Jin|Xinwei Zhou|Gianluca Cusatis	  Shale, like many other sedimentary rocks, is typically heterogeneous, anisotropic, and is characterized by partial alignment of anisotropic clay minerals and naturally formed bedding planes. In this study, a micromechanical framework based on the Lattice Discrete Particle Model (LDPM) is formulated to capture these features. Material anisotropy is introduced through an approximated geometric description of shale internal structure, which includes representation of material property variation with orientation and explicit modeling of parallel lamination. The model is calibrated by carrying out numerical simulations to match various experimental data, including the ones relevant to elastic properties, Brazilian tensile strength, and unconfined compressive strength. Furthermore, parametric study is performed to investigate the relationship between the mesoscale parameters and the macroscopic properties. It is shown that the dependence of the elastic stiffness, strength, and failure mode on loading orientation can be captured successfully. Finally, a homogenization approach based on the asymptotic expansion of field variables is applied to upscale the proposed micromechanical model, and the properties of the homogenized model are analyzed.
