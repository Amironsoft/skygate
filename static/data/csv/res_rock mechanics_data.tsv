Renzoni	  Directed transport in ratchets is determined by symmetry-breaking in a system out of equilibrium. A hallmark of rocking ratchets is current reversals: an increase in the rocking force changes the direction of the current. In this work for a bi-harmonically driven spatially symmetric rocking ratchet we show that a class of current reversal is precisely determined by symmetry-breaking, thus creating a link between dynamical and symmetry-breaking mechanisms.

The pore distribution determines many characteristics of the rock among which, its transport property is often the most useful. Multifractal analysis is a powerful tool that is increasingly used to characterize the pore space. In this study we have done multifractal analysis of pore distribution on sedimentary rocks simulated using the Relaxed Bidisperse Ballistic Model (RBBDM). The RBBDM can generate a $3-D$ structure of sedimentary rocks of variable porosity by tuning the fraction $p$ of particles of two different sizes. We have also done multifractal analysis on two samples of real sedimentary rock to compare with the simulation studies. One sample, an oolitic limestone is of high porosity (40%)while the other is a reefal carbonate of low porosity around 7%. $2-D$ sections of X-ray micro-tomographs of the real rocks were stacked sequentially to reconstruct the real rock specimens. Both samples show a multifractal character, but we show that RBBDM gives a very realistic representation of a typical high porosity sedimentary rock.

It was shown by Pouya (2000) and Pouya and Zaoui (2006) that many closed-form solutions for basic problems involving linear isotropic materials could be extended by linear transformation to cover a variety of "ellipsoidal" materials. This paper will describe two main varieties of ellipsoidal elastic models and show how well they fit the in situ data for sedimentary rocks; numerical homogenization results for several varieties of fractured rock masses will also be provided.

Patrick Royall	  We introduce a model system of anisotropic colloidal `rocks'. Due to their shape, the bonding introduced via non-absorbing polymers is profoundly different from spherical particles: bonds between rocks are rigid against rotation, leading to strong frustration. We develop a geometric model which captures the essence of the rocks. Experiments and simulations show that the colloid geometry leads to structures of low fractal dimension. This is in stark contrast to gels of spheres, whose rigidity results from locally dense regions. At high density the rocks form a quasi one-component glass. 	
1210.3024v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1210.3024v1	2012	Sensitivity analysis of GSI based mechanical characterization of rock   mass	P. Ván|B. Vásárhelyi	  Recently, the rock mechanical and rock engineering designs and calculations are frequently based on Geological Strength Index (GSI) method, because it is the only system that provides a complete set of mechanical properties for design purpose. Both the failure criteria and the deformation moduli of the rock mass can be calculated with GSI based equations, which consists of the disturbance factor, as well. The aim of this paper is the sensitivity analysis of GSI and disturbance factor dependent equations that characterize the mechanical properties of rock masses. The survey of the GSI system is not our purpose. The results show that the rock mass strength calculated by the Hoek-Brown failure criteria and both the Hoek-Diederichs and modified Hoek-Diederichs deformation moduli are highly sensitive to changes of both the GSI and the D factor, hence their exact determination is important for the rock engineering design. 	
0908.4140v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/0908.4140v1	2009	Investigation of a hydraulic impact: a technology in rock breaking	Martin Genet|Wenyi Yan|Thanh Tran-Cong	  The finite element method and dimensional analysis have been applied in the present paper to study a hydraulic impact, which is utilized in a non-explosive rock breaking technology in mining industry. The impact process of a high speed piston on liquid water, previously introduced in a borehole drilled in rock, is numerically simulated. The research is focused on the influences of all the parameters involved in the technology on the largest principal stress in the rock, which is considered as one of the key factors to break the rock. Our detailed parametric investigation reveals that the variation of the isotropic rock material properties, especially its density, has no significant influence on the largest principal stress. The influences of the depth of the hole and the depth of the water column are also very small. On the other hand, increasing the initial kinetic energy of the piston can dramatically increase the largest principal stress and the best way to increase the initial kinetic energy of the piston is to increase its initial velocity. Results from the current dimensional analysis can be applied to optimize this non-explosive rock breaking technology.

Ladd	  A reactive fluid dissolving the surface of a uniform fracture will trigger an instability in the dissolution front, leading to spontaneous formation of pronounced well-spaced channels in the surrounding rock matrix. Although the underlying mechanism is similar to the wormhole instability in porous rocks there are significant differences in the physics, due to the absence of a steadily propagating reaction front. In previous work we have described the geophysical implications of this instability in regard to the formation of long conduits in soluble rocks. Here we describe a more general linear stability analysis, including axial diffusion, transport limited dissolution, non-linear kinetics, and a finite length system. 	
0902.3941v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/0902.3941v2	2009	Rocking feedback controlled ratchets	M. Feito|J. P. Baltanas|F. J. Cao	  We investigate the different regimes that emerge when a periodic driving force, the rocking force, acts on a collective feedback flashing ratchet. The interplay of the rocking and the feedback control gives a rich dynamics with different regimes presenting several unexpected novel features. In particular, we show that for both the one-particle ratchet and the collective version of the ratchet an appropriate rocking increases the flux. This mechanism gives the maximum flux that has been achieved in a ratchet device without an a priori bias. 	
0808.3886v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/0808.3886v2	2009	Stress dependent thermal pressurization of a fluid-saturated rock	Siavash Ghabezloo|Jean Sulem	  Temperature increase in saturated porous materials under undrained conditions leads to thermal pressurization of the pore fluid due to the discrepancy between the thermal expansion coefficients of the pore fluid and of the solid matrix. This increase in the pore fluid pressure induces a reduction of the effective mean stress and can lead to shear failure or hydraulic fracturing. The equations governing the phenomenon of thermal pressurization are presented and this phenomenon is studied experimentally for a saturated granular rock in an undrained heating test under constant isotropic stress. Careful analysis of the effect of mechanical and thermal deformation of the drainage and pressure measurement system is performed and a correction of the measured pore pressure is introduced. The test results are modelled using a non-linear thermo-poro-elastic constitutive model of the granular rock with emphasis on the stress-dependent character of the rock compressibility. The effects of stress and temperature on thermal pressurization observed in the tests are correctly reproduced by the model. 	
0709.3028v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/0709.3028v1	2007	Emerging complexity in a simple model of the mechanical behaviour of   rocks	David Amitrano	  We propose a mechanical model for the behaviour of rocks based on progressive damage at the elementary scale and elastic interaction. It allows us to simulate several experimental observations: mechanical behaviour ranging from brittle to ductile, fractal structure of the damage, powerlaw distribution of the damage avalanches. These macroscopic properties are not incorporated at the elementary scale, but are the results of the interaction between elements. This emerging complexity permits us to consider the strain rock process as a complex system characterized by non-linear dynamics.

Casals|Jordi Garcia-Ojalvo	  We experimentally demonstrate the effective rocking of a nonlinear electronic circuit operating in a periodic regime. Namely, we show that driving a Chua circuit with a periodic signal, whose phase alternates (also periodically) in time, we lock the oscillation frequency of the circuit to that of the driving signal, and its phase to one of two possible values shifted by pi, and lying between the alternating phases of the input signal. In this way, we show that a rocked nonlinear oscillator displays phase bistability. We interpret the experimental results via a theoretical analysis of rocking on a simple oscillator model, based on a normal form description (complex Landau equation) of the rocked Hopf bifurcation 	
1111.6520v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1111.6520v1	2011	Two-dimensional rocking ratchet for cold atoms	V. Lebedev|F. Renzoni	  We investigate experimentally a two-dimensional rocking ratchet for cold atoms, realized by using a driven three-beam dissipative optical lattice. AC forces are applied in perpendicular directions by phase-modulating two of the lattice beams. As predicted by the general theory [S. Denisov et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 224102 (2008)], we observe a rectification phenomenon unique to high-dimensional rocking ratchets, as determined by two single-harmonic drivings applied in orthogonal directions. Also, by applying two bi-harmonic forces in perpendicular directions, we demonstrate the possibility of generating a current in an arbitrary direction within the optical lattice plane. 	
1201.0065v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1201.0065v1	2011	Analysis of wasp-waisted hysteresis loops in magnetic rocks	R S Kharwanlang|Prabodh Shukla	  The random-field Ising model of hysteresis is generalized to dilute magnets and solved on a Bethe lattice. Exact expressions for the major and minor hysteresis loops are obtained. In the strongly dilute limit the model provides a simple and useful understanding of the shapes of hysteresis loops in magnetic rock samples. 	
0902.1311v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/0902.1311v1	2009	Rock Joint Surfaces Measurement and Analysis of Aperture Distribution   under Different Normal and Shear Loading Using GIS	Mostafa Sharifzadeh|Yasuhiro Mitani|Tetsuro Esaki	  Geometry of the rock joint is a governing factor for joint mechanical and hydraulic behavior. A new method of evaluating aperture distribution based on measurement of joint surfaces and three dimensional characteristics of each surface is developed. Artificial joint of granite surfaces are measured,processed, analyzed and three dimensional approaches are carried out for surface characterization. Parameters such as asperity's heights, slope angles, and aspects distribution at micro scale,local concentration of elements and their spatial localization at local scale are determined by Geographic Information System (GIS). Changes of aperture distribution at different normal stresses and various shear displacements are visualized and interpreted. Increasing normal load causes negative changes in aperture frequency distribution which indicates high joint matching. However, increasing shear displacement causes a rapid increase in the aperture and positive changes in the aperture frequency distribution which could be due to unmatching, surface anisotropy and spatial localization of contact points with proceeding shear. 	
1709.01847v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.01847v2	2017	Three-Dimensional Numerical Modeling of Shear Stimulation of Naturally   Fractured Reservoirs	Eren Ucar|Inga Berre|Eirik Keilegavlen	  Shear dilation based hydraulic stimulations enable exploitation of geothermal energy from reservoirs with inadequate initial permeability. While contributing to enhancing the reservoir's permeability, hydraulic stimulation processes may lead to undesired seismic activity. Here, we present a three dimensional numerical model aiming to increase understanding of this mechanism and its consequences. The fractured reservoir is modeled as a network of explicitly represented large scale fractures immersed in a permeable rock matrix. The numerical formulation is constructed by coupling three physical processes: fluid flow, fracture deformation, and rock matrix deformation. For flow simulations, the discrete fracture matrix model is used, which allows the fluid transport from high permeable conductive fractures to the rock matrix and vice versa. The mechanical behavior of the fractures is modeled using a hyperbolic model with reversible and irreversible deformations. Linear elasticity is assumed for the mechanical deformation and stress alteration of the rock matrix. Fractures are modeled as lower dimensional surfaces embodied in the domain, subjected to specific governing equations for their deformation along the tangential and normal directions. Both the fluid flow and momentum balance equations are approximated by finite volume discretizations. The new numerical model is demonstrated considering a three dimensional fractured formation with a network of 20 explicitly represented fractures. The effects of fluid exchange between fractures and rock matrix on the permeability evolution and the generated seismicity are examined for test cases resembling realistic reservoir conditions. 	
0709.2647v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/0709.2647v2	2007	Rupture by damage accumulation in rocks	David Amitrano	  The deformation of rocks is associated with microcracks nucleation and propagation, i.e. damage. The accumulation of damage and its spatial localization lead to the creation of a macroscale discontinuity, so-called "fault" in geological terms, and to the failure of the material, i.e. a dramatic decrease of the mechanical properties as strength and modulus. The damage process can be studied both statically by direct observation of thin sections and dynamically by recording acoustic waves emitted by crack propagation (acoustic emission). Here we first review such observations concerning geological objects over scales ranging from the laboratory sample scale (dm) to seismically active faults (km), including cliffs and rock masses (Dm, hm). These observations reveal complex patterns in both space (fractal properties of damage structures as roughness and gouge), time (clustering, particular trends when the failure approaches) and energy domains (power-law distributions of energy release bursts). We use a numerical model based on progressive damage within an elastic interaction framework which allows us to simulate these observations. This study shows that the failure in rocks can be the result of damage accumulation.

LDPM is formulated in the framework of discrete mechanics and it simulates the heterogeneous deformation of cemented granular systems by means of discrete compatibility/equilibrium equations defined at the grain scale. A numerical strategy is proposed to generate a realistic microstructure based on the actual grain size distribution of a sandstone and the capabilities of the method are illustrated with reference to the particular case of Bleurswiller sandstone, i.e. a granular rock that has been extensively studied at the laboratory scale. LDPM micromechanical parameters are calibrated based on evidences from triaxial experiments, such as hydrostatic compression, brittle failure at low confinement and plastic behavior at high confinement. Results show that LDPM allows exploring the effect of fine-scale heterogeneity on the inelastic response of rock cores, achieving excellent quantitative performance across a wide range of stress conditions. In addition, LDPM simulations demonstrate its capability of capturing different modes of strain localization within a unified mechanical framework, which makes this approach applicable for a wide variety of geomechanical settings. Such promising performance suggests that LDPM may constitute a viable alternative to existing discrete numerical methods for granular rocks, as well as a versatile tool for the interpretation of their complex deformation/failure patterns and for the development of continuum models capturing the effect of micro-scale heterogeneity. 	
0803.1308v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/0803.1308v1	2008	Subsidence and capillary effects in chalks	Pierre Delage|Christian Schroeder|Yu Jun Cui	  Based on the concepts of the mechanics of unsaturated soils where capillary phenomena arise between the wetting fluid (water) and the non-wetting one (air), the subsidence of chalks containing oil (non-wetting fluid) during water injection (wetting fluid) is analysed. It is shown that the collapse phenomenon of unsaturated soils under wetting provides a physical explanation and a satisfactory prediction of the order of magnitude of the subsidence of the chalk. The use of a well established constitutive model for unsaturated soils allows a description of the hydro-mechanical history of the chalk, from its deposition to the oil exploitation. 	
1112.0766v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1112.0766v1	2011	Current reversals in a rocking ratchet: the frequency domain	A. Wickenbrock|D. Cubero|N. A. Abdul Wahab|P. Phoonthong|F. Renzoni	  Motivated by recent work [D. Cubero et al., Phys. Rev. E 82, 041116 (2010)], we examine the mechanisms which determine current reversals in rocking ratchets as observed by varying the frequency of the drive. We found that a class of these current reversals in the frequency domain are precisely determined by dissipation-induced symmetry breaking. Our experimental and theoretical work thus extends and generalizes the previously identified relationship between dynamical and symmetry-breaking mechanisms in the generation of current reversals. 	
1502.02300v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.02300v1	2015	Paradox of Peroxy Defects and Positive Holes in Rocks Part II: Outflow   of Electric Currents from Stressed Rocks	John Scoville|Jaufray Sornette|Friedemann Freund	  Understanding the electrical properties of rocks is of fundamental interest. We report on currents generated when stresses are applied. Loading the center of gabbro tiles, 30x30x0.9 cm$^3$, across a 5 cm diameter piston, leads to positive currents flowing from the center to the unstressed edges. Changing the constant rate of loading over 5 orders of magnitude from 0.2 kPa/s to 20 MPa/s produces positive currents, which start to flow already at low stress levels, <5 MPa. The currents increase as long as stresses increase. At constant load they flow for hours, days, even weeks and months, slowly decreasing with time. When stresses are removed, they rapidly disappear but can be made to reappear upon reloading. These currents are consistent with the stress-activation of peroxy defects, such as O$_3$Si-OO-SiO$_3$, in the matrix of rock-forming minerals. The peroxy break-up leads to positive holes h$^{\bullet}$, i.e. electronic states associated with O$^-$ in a matrix of O$^{2-}$, plus electrons, e'. Propagating along the upper edge of the valence band, the holes are able to flow from stressed to unstressed rock, traveling fast and far by way of a phonon-assisted electron hopping mechanism using energy levels at the upper edge of the valence band. Impacting the tile center leads to h$^{\bullet}$ pulses, 4-6 ms long, flowing outward at ~100 m/sec at a current equivalent to 1-2 x 10$^9$ A/km$^3$. Electrons, trapped in the broken peroxy bonds, are also mobile, but only within the stressed volume. 	
1502.07224v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.07224v1	2015	An analytical study of seismoelectric signals produced by 1D mesoscopic   heterogeneities	Leonardo B. Monachesi|J. German Rubino|Marina Rosas-Carbajal|Damien Jougnot|Niklas Linde|Beatriz Quintal|Klaus Holliger	  The presence of mesoscopic heterogeneities in fluid-saturated porous rocks can produce measurable seismoelectric signals due to wave-induced fluid flow between regions of differing compressibility. The dependence of these signals on the petrophysical and structural characteristics of the probed rock mass remains largely unexplored. In this work, we derive an analytical solution to describe the seismoelectric response of a rock sample, containing a horizontal layer at its center, that is subjected to an oscillatory compressibility test. We then adapt this general solution to compute the seismoelectric signature of a particular case related to a sample that is permeated by a horizontal fracture located at its center. Analyses of the general and particular solutions are performed to study the impact of different petrophysical and structural parameters on the seismoelectric response. We find that the amplitude of the seismoelectric signal is directly proportional to the applied stress, to the Skempton coefficient contrast between the host rock and the layer, and to a weighted average of the effective excess charge of the two materials. Our results also demonstrate that the frequency at which the maximum electrical potential amplitude prevails does not depend on the applied stress or the Skempton coefficient contrast. In presence of strong permeability variations, this frequency is rather controlled by the permeability and thickness of the less permeable material. The results of this study thus indicate that seismoelectric measurements can potentially be used to estimate key mechanical and hydraulic rock properties of mesoscopic heterogeneities, such as compressibility, permeability, and fracture compliance.

Thoreen|David M. Sabatini	  Understanding the mechanisms by which cells coordinate their size with their ability to divide has long attracted the interest of biologists. The Target of Rapamycin (TOR) pathway is becoming increasingly recognized as a master regulator of cell size, however less is known how TOR activity might be coupled with the cell cycle. Here, we establish that mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) promotes cytokinesis through activation of a Rho GTPase-Rho Kinase (ROCK) signaling cascade. Hyperactivation of mTORC1 signaling by depletion of any of its negative regulators: TSC1, TSC2, PTEN, or DEPTOR, induces polyploidy in a rapamycin-sensitive manner. mTORC1 hyperactivation-mediated polyploidization occurs by a prolonged, but ultimately failed attempt at abcission followed by re-fusion. Similar to the effects of ROCK2 overexpression, these mTORC1-driven aberrant cytokinesis events are accompanied by increased Rho-GTP loading, extensive plasma membrane blebbing, and increased actin-myosin contractility, all of which can be rescued by either mTORC1 or ROCK inhibition. These results provide evidence for the existence of a novel mTORC1-Rho-ROCK pathway during cytokinesis and suggest that mTORC1 might play a critical role in setting the size at which a mammalian cell divides. 	
1612.03221v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.03221v1	2016	Continuum modeling of the effect of surface area growth due to crushing   and damage on the permeability of granular rocks	Shiva Esna Ashari|Arghya Das|Giuseppe Buscarnera	  This paper discusses a continuum approach to track the evolution of permeability in granular rocks by accounting for the combined effect of porosity changes, grain breakage and cement bond damage. To account for such a broad range of microscopic processes under general loading paths, the Breakage Mechanics theory is used and the computed mechanical response is linked with the Kozeny equation, i.e. a permeability model able to evaluate the reduction of the hydraulic conductivity resulting from the simultaneous loss of porosity and growth of surface area. In particular, the evolution of the internal variables of the model has been linked to idealized geometric schemes at particle scale, with the goal to distinguish the contribution of the fines generated by the disaggregation of the cement matrix from that of the broken fragments resulting from the crushing of the skeleton. Compression/flow experiments available in the literature for different granular rocks are used to validate the proposed methodology. The analyses illustrate that the drop of the permeability of damaged rocks would be severely underestimated without an accurate computation of the growth of surface area, as well as that the distributed fragmentation of skeleton particles tends to have stronger implications than the generation of cement fines. These findings, along with the satisfactory agreement between model predictions and experiments, stress the benefits of adopting microstructure-based constitutive laws for the analysis of coupled hydro-mechanical problems. 	
0008360v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0008360v1	2000	Multiple current reversals in forced inhomogeneous ratchets	Debasis Dan|Mangal C. Mahato|A. M. Jayannavar	  Transport properties of overdamped Brownian paricles in a rocked thermal ratchet with space dependent friction coefficient is studied. By tuning the parameters, the direction of current exhibit multiple reversals, both as a function of the thermal noise strength as well as the amplitude of rocking force. Current reversals also occur under deterministic conditions and exhibits intriguing structure. All these features arise due to mutual interplay between potential asymmetry,noise, driving frequency and inhomogeneous friction. 	
0106631v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0106631v2	2001	Energetics of rocked inhomogeneous ratchets	Debasis Dan|A. M. Jayannavar	  We study the efficiency of frictional thermal ratchets driven by finite frequency driving force and in contact with a heat bath. The efficiency exhibits varied behavior with driving frequency. Both nonmonotonic and monotonic behavior have been observed. In particular the magnitude of efficiency in finite frequency regime may be more than the efficiency in the adiabatic regime. This is our central result for rocked ratchets. We also show that for the simple potential we have chosen, the presence of only spatial asymmetry (homogeneous system) or only frictional ratchet (symmetric potential profile), the adiabatic efficiency is always more than in the nonadiabatic case.

Jayannavar	  We study the nature of currents, input energy and entropy production in different types of adiabatically rocked ratchets using the method of stochastic energetics. The currents exhibit a peak as a function of noise strength. We show that there is no underlying resonance or synchronisation phenomena in the dynamics of the particle with these current peaks. This follows from the analysis of energy loss in the medium. We also show that the maxima seen in current as well as the total entropy production are not directly correlated.

Monte Carlo simulations are performed on a square lattice when varying the temperature and the strength of cyclic dominance. It is shown that the critical phase transition from the disordered state to the ordered one is destroyed by the cyclic dominance that yields a self-organizing pattern even at low temperatures. The differences and similarities are discussed between the present model and the half-filled, driven lattice gases with repulsive interaction. 	
0407425v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0407425v1	2004	Phase transitions for rock-scissors-paper game on different networks	Attila Szolnoki|Gyorgy Szabo	  Monte Carlo simulations and dynamical mean-field approximations are performed to study the phase transitions in rock-scissors-paper game on different host networks. These graphs are originated from lattices by introducing quenched and annealed randomness simultaneously. In the resulting phase diagrams three different stationary states are identified for all structures. The comparison of results on different networks suggests that the value of clustering coefficient plays an irrelevant role in the emergence of a global oscillating phase. The critical behavior of phase transitions seems to be universal and can be described by the same exponents. 	
0610720v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0610720v1	2006	Scaling and universality in rock fracture	Jörn Davidsen|Sergei Stanchits|Georg Dresen	  We present a detailed statistical analysis of acoustic emission time series from laboratory rock fracture obtained from different experiments on different materials including acoustic emission controlled triaxial fracture and punch-through tests. In all considered cases, the waiting time distribution can be described by a unique scaling function indicating its universality. This scaling function is even indistinguishable from that for earthquakes suggesting its general validity for fracture processes independent of time, space and magnitude scales.

Grammatikakis	  Negative defect activation volumes are extremely rare in solids. Here, we report for the first time that this holds in a couple of hydrated rocks for dielectric relaxation by exploring the complex impedance spectra at various pressures and temperatures. The present findings mean that the relaxation time of the relevant relaxation mechanisms decreases upon increasing pressure, thus it may become too short at higher pressure and hence lead to the emission of transient electric signals before fracture. This may constitute the long-standing laboratory confirmation for the explanation of the generation of electric signals prior to an earthquake, as recently pointed out by Uyeda et al [Tectonophysics 470 (2009) 205-213].

Srivastava	  A theoretical explanation is provided for the experimental evidence that fracturing piezoelectric rocks produces neutrons. The elastic energy micro-crack production ultimately yields the macroscopic fracture. The mechanical energy is converted by the piezoelectric effect into electric field energy. The electric field energy decays via radio frequency (microwave) electric field oscillations. The radio frequency electric fields accelerate the condensed matter electrons which then collide with protons producing neutrons and neutrinos.

We modelled the problem using an individual-based setting and using the system size van Kampen expansion to deal with the Master Equation, we have been able to characterise the spatio-temporal patterns using the power spectrum of the fluctuations. We proved that such patterns are robust against the intrinsic noise and they can be found for parameters values beyond the ones fixed by the deterministic approach. We complement such analytical results with numerical simulations based on the Gillespie's algorithm.

The design includes the build up of a rock mass model and a numerical model taking into account the geological situation, load condition, geometrical condition, and material parameters. In this paper multiple caverns in salt formation with geological and geomechanical situation in Qom (central part of Iran) was investigated a using creep model. Minimum safe center to center distances (CTCD) of multiple horizontal caverns also were studied. CTCD of caverns interact at less than two times of cavern diameter. With increasing the CTCD to 2.5 times cavern diameters, diminish most interaction.

When an UHE neutrino interacts with rock salt or ice as a detection medium, a shower is generated. That shower is formed by hadronic and electromagnetic avalanche processes. The energy of the UHE neutrino shower converts to thermal energy through ionization processes. Consequently, the temperature rises along the shower produced by the UHE neutrino. The refractive index of the medium rises with temperature. The irregularity of the refractive index in the medium leads to a reflection of radio waves. This reflection effect combined with the long attenuation length of radio waves in rock salt and ice would yield a new method to detect UHE neutrinos. We measured the phase of the reflected radio wave under irradiation with an electron beam on ice and rock salt powder. The measured phase showed excellent consistence with the power reflection fraction which was measured directly. A model taking into account the temperature change explained the phase and the amplitude of the reflected wave. Therefore the reflection mechanism was confirmed. The power reflection fraction was compared with that calculated with the Fresnel equations, the ratio between the measured result and that obtained with the Fresnel equations in ice was larger than that of rock salt.

As a consequence, the pore waters become more reactive, which leads to enhanced dissolution-precipitation processes and a modification of the mechanical and hydrological properties of the rock. This effect is especially important for limestones given that the solubility and reactivity of carbonates is strongly dependent on pH and the partial pressure of CO2. The main mechanism that couples dissolution, precipitation and rock matrix deformation is commonly referred to as intergranular pressure solution creep (IPS) or pervasive pressure solution creep (PSC). This process involves dissolution at intergranular grain contacts subject to elevated stress, diffusion of dissolved material in an intergranular fluid, and precipitation in pore spaces subject to lower stress. This leads to an overall and pervasive reduction in porosity due to both grain indentation and precipitation in pore spaces. The percolation of CO2-rich fluids may influence on-going compaction due to pressure solution and can therefore potentially affect the reservoir and its long-term CO2 storage capacity. We aim at quantifying this effect by using a 2D numerical model to study the coupling between dissolution-precipitation processes, local mass transfer, and deformation of the rock over long time scales. We show that high partial pressures of dissolved CO2 (up to 30 MPa) significantly increase the rates of compaction by a factor of ~ 50 to ~ 75, and also result in a concomitant decrease in the viscosity of the rock matrix.

In our paper we explain this phenomenon based on high-precision scans of pebbles which exhibit similar behavior. We construct their convex hull and the heteroclinic graph carrying their equilibrium points. By systematic simplification of the arising Morse-Smale complex in a one-parameter process we show that equilibria occur typically in highly localized groups (flocks), the number of the latter can be reliably observed and determined by hand experiments. Both local and global (micro and macro) equilibria can be either stable or unstable. Most commonly, rocks and pebbles are balanced on stable local equilibria belonging to stable flocks. However, it is possible to balance a convex body on a stable local equilibrium belonging to an unstable flock and this is the intriguing mechanical scenario corresponding to rocking stones. Since outside observers can only reliably perceive flocks, the last described situation will appear counter-intuitive. Comparison of computer experiments to hand experiments reveals that the latter are consistent, i.e. the flocks can be reliably counted and the pebble classification system proposed in our previous work (Domokos et al 2010) is robustly applicable. We also find an interesting logarithmic relationship between the Zingg parameters and the average number of global equilibrium points, indicating a close relationship between the two systems.

We present a new approach to the stochastic counting process of noise-induced switching events: starting from the Markovian dynamics of the nonstationary, continuous particle dynamics one finds upon contraction onto two states a non-Markovian renewal dynamics. The output frequency is determined as the velocity of the underlying discrete phase dynamics. The phenomenon of noise-assisted phase synchronization is investigated in terms of an effective, instantaneous phase diffusion. The theory is applied to rectangular-shaped rocking signals versus increasing input-noise strengths. Precise numerical simulations corroborate very favorably our analytical results. The novel theoretical findings are also compared with prior findings.

Redner	  We investigate an idealized model for the size reduction and smoothing of a polygonal rock due to repeated chipping at corners. Each chip is sufficiently small so that only a single corner and a fraction of its two adjacent sides are cut from the object in a single chipping event. After many chips have been cut away, the resulting shape of the rock is generally anisotropic, with facet lengths and corner angles distributed over a broad range. Although a well-defined shape is quickly reached for each realization, there are large fluctuations between realizations.

Owladeghaffari	  This paper describes application of information granulation theory, on the design of rock engineering flowcharts. Firstly, an overall flowchart, based on information granulation theory has been highlighted. Information granulation theory, in crisp (non-fuzzy) or fuzzy format, can take into account engineering experiences (especially in fuzzy shape-incomplete information or superfluous), or engineering judgments, in each step of designing procedure, while the suitable instruments modeling are employed. In this manner and to extension of soft modeling instruments, using three combinations of Self Organizing Map (SOM), Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (NFIS), and Rough Set Theory (RST) crisp and fuzzy granules, from monitored data sets are obtained. The main underlined core of our algorithms are balancing of crisp(rough or non-fuzzy) granules and sub fuzzy granules, within non fuzzy information (initial granulation) upon the open-close iterations. Using different criteria on balancing best granules (information pockets), are obtained. Validations of our proposed methods, on the data set of in-situ permeability in rock masses in Shivashan dam, Iran have been highlighted.

Thanassoulas	  In this work, it is demonstrated that the Earth's preseismic electric field, which is registered by a pair of electrodes in contact to the ground surface at certain distance from the epicentral area, corresponds to the gradient of the total field generated in the focal area as a function of time and distance from it. The original form of the generated preseismic field follows closely the theoretical piezoelectric potential form. The later is obtained after integration in time of the original registered potential grad data values. Consequently, the time of occurrence of the imminent earthquake (collapsing of the rock formation) is estimated by the classical laws of rock fracturing based on theoretical Rock Mechanics. The methodology has been tested on the grad potential data, registered in Greece, before four large EQs which took place in the regional area as follows: Izmit, Turkey EQ (M = 7.8R, 17th August, 1999), Milos, Greece EQ (M = 5.6R, 21st May, 2002), Kythira Greece EQ (M = 6.9R, 8th January, 2006) and Methoni, Greece EQ (M = 6.7R, 14th February, 2008). The obtained results prove the validity of the postulated methodology.

The following stages can be considered for the limestone weathering and degradation process in underground mines: condensation of the water on the roof of the gallery, infiltration of water in the porous rock, migration of the air CO2 molecules in the rock pore water by convection and molecular diffusion, dissolution of limestone by CO2 rich water and consequently, reduction of the strength properties of rock. Considering this process, a set of equations governing different hydrochemo-mechanical aspects of the weathering phenomenon and progressive failure occurring in these mines is presented. Then the feasibility of numerical modelling of this process is studied and a simple example of application is presented.

Lett., 28 (1994) 459]. In this letter, we apply their ratchet theory to a rotary motor-protein, F1-ATPase. In this work, we construct a model of a rocking ratchet in which F1-ATPase rotates not as a result of ATP hydrolysis but through the influence of an oscillating force. We then study the motion of F1-ATPase on the basis of molecular dynamics simulations of this coarse-grained protein model. Although in the absence of ATP, F1-ATPase exhibits directionless Brownian motion when there exists no oscillating force, we observe directional motion when we do apply an oscillating force. Furthermore, we observe that the direction of rotation is reversed when we change the oscillation frequency.

Within this study, the implementation of a novel fibre optic point sensor for pressure and temperature determination into a high pressure / high temperature triaxial cell is presented. For the first time, pressure was measured directly within the pore space of a Flechtinger sandstone specimen during a hydrostatic compression test at up to 70 MPa. The sensor used within this study consists of a miniature all-silica fibre optic Extrinsic Fabry-Perot Interferometer (EFPI) sensor which has an embedded Fibre Bragg Grating (FBG) reference sensor element to determine temperature and pressure directly at the point of measurement.

Evolutionary game theory predicts the existence of persistent cycles in the evolutionary trajectories of the RPS game, but experimental evidence has remained to be rather weak. In this work we performed laboratory experiments on the RPS game and analyzed the social-state evolutionary trajectories of twelve populations of N=6 players. We found strong evidence supporting the existence of persistent cycles. The mean cycling frequency was measured to be $0.029 \pm 0.009$ period per experimental round. Our experimental observations can be quantitatively explained by a simple non-equilibrium model, namely the discrete-time logit dynamical process with a noise parameter. Our work therefore favors the evolutionary game theory over the classical game theory for describing the dynamical behavior of the RPS game. 	
1309.6737v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.6737v1	2013	Rocking Subdiffusive Ratchets: Origin, Optimization and Efficiency	I. Goychuk|V. O. Kharchenko	  We study origin, parameter optimization, and thermodynamic efficiency of isothermal rocking ratchets based on fractional subdiffusion within a generalized non-Markovian Langevin equation approach. A corresponding multi-dimensional Markovian embedding dynamics is realized using a set of auxiliary Brownian particles elastically coupled to the central Brownian particle (see video on the journal web site). We show that anomalous subdiffusive transport emerges due to an interplay of nonlinear response and viscoelastic effects for fractional Brownian motion in periodic potentials with broken space-inversion symmetry and driven by a time-periodic field. The anomalous transport becomes optimal for a subthreshold driving when the driving period matches a characteristic time scale of interwell transitions. It can also be optimized by varying temperature, amplitude of periodic potential and driving strength. The useful work done against a load shows a parabolic dependence on the load strength. It grows sublinearly with time and the corresponding thermodynamic efficiency decays algebraically in time because the energy supplied by the driving field scales with time linearly. However, it compares well with the efficiency of normal diffusion rocking ratchets on an appreciably long time scale.

Rucklidge	  The spatio-temporal arrangement of interacting populations often influences the maintenance of species diversity and is a subject of intense research. Here, we study the spatio-temporal patterns arising from the cyclic competition between three species in two dimensions. Inspired by recent experiments, we consider a generic metapopulation model comprising "rock-paper-scissors" interactions via dominance removal and replacement, reproduction, mutations, pair-exchange and hopping of individuals. By combining analytical and numerical methods, we obtain the model's phase diagram near its Hopf bifurcation and quantitatively characterize the properties of the spiraling patterns arising in each phase. The phases characterizing the cyclic competition away far from the Hopf bifurcation (at low mutation rate) are also investigated. Our analytical approach relies on the careful analysis of the properties of the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation derived through a controlled (perturbative) multiscale expansion around the model's Hopf bifurcation. Our results allows us to clarify when spatial "rock-paper-scissors" competition leads to stable spiral waves and under which circumstances they are influenced by nonlinear mobility.

Berge|Inga Berre|Eirik Keilegavlen	  Fluid-induced slip of fractures is characterized by strong multiphysics couplings. Three physical processes are considered: Flow, rock deformation and fracture deformation. The fractures are represented as lower-dimensional objects embedded in a three-dimensional domain. Fluid is modeled as slightly compressible, and flow in both fractures and matrix is accounted for. The deformation of rock is inherently different from the deformation of fractures; thus, two different models are needed to describe the mechanical deformation of the rock. The medium surrounding the fractures is modeled as a linear elastic material, while the slip of fractures is modeled as a contact problem, governed by a static-dynamic friction model. We present an iterative scheme for solving the non-linear set of equations that arise from the models, and suggest how the step parameter in this scheme should depend on the shear modulus and mesh size. 	
0103552v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0103552v2	2001	Pumping Heat with Quantum Ratchets	T. E. Humphrey|H. Linke|R. Newbury	  We describe how adiabatically rocked quantum electron ratchets can act as heat pumps. In general, ratchets may be described as non-equilibrium systems in which directed particle motion is generated using spatial or temporal asymmetry. In a rocked ratchet, which may also be described as a non-linear rectifier, an asymmetric potential is tilted symmetrically and periodically. The potential deforms differently during each half-cycle, producing a net current of particles when averaged over a full period of rocking. Recently it was found that in the quantum regime, where tunnelling contributes to transport, the net current may change sign with temperature. Here we show that a Landauer model of an experimental tunnelling ratchet [Linke et. al., Science 286, 2314 (1999)] predicts the existence of a net heat current even when the net particle current goes through zero. We quantify this heat current and define a coefficient of performance for the ratchet as a heat pump, finding that more heat is deposited in each of the two electron reservoirs due to the process of rocking than is pumped from one reservoir to the other by the ratchet. 	
0709.0217v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/0709.0217v2	2008	Mobility promotes and jeopardizes biodiversity in rock-paper-scissors   games	Tobias Reichenbach|Mauro Mobilia|Erwin Frey	  Biodiversity is essential to the viability of ecological systems. Species diversity in ecosystems is promoted by cyclic, non-hierarchical interactions among competing populations. Such non-transitive relations lead to an evolution with central features represented by the `rock-paper-scissors' game, where rock crushes scissors, scissors cut paper, and paper wraps rock. In combination with spatial dispersal of static populations, this type of competition results in the stable coexistence of all species and the long-term maintenance of biodiversity. However, population mobility is a central feature of real ecosystems: animals migrate, bacteria run and tumble. Here, we observe a critical influence of mobility on species diversity. When mobility exceeds a certain value, biodiversity is jeopardized and lost. In contrast, below this critical threshold all subpopulations coexist and an entanglement of travelling spiral waves forms in the course of temporal evolution. We establish that this phenomenon is robust, it does not depend on the details of cyclic competition or spatial environment. These findings have important implications for maintenance and evolution of ecological systems and are relevant for the formation and propagation of patterns in excitable media, such as chemical kinetics or epidemic outbreaks.

Thrombin is a pro-coagulant serine protease, which causes the local loss of endothelial barrier integrity thereby enabling the rapid extravasation of plasma proteins and the local formation of fibrin-containing clots. Available information suggests that thrombin induces endothelial permeability by promoting actomyosin contractility through the Rho/ROCK signaling pathway. Here we took advantage of pharmacological inhibitors, knockdown approaches, and the emerging knowledge on how permeability factors affect endothelial junctions to investigate in detail the mechanism underlying thrombin-induced endothelial permeability. We show that thrombin signals through PAR-1 and its coupled G proteins G(12/13) and G(11/q) to induce RhoA activation and intracellular calcium elevation, and that these events are interrelated. In turn, this leads to the stimulation of ROCK, which causes actin stress-fiber formation. However, this alone is not sufficient to account for thrombin-induced permeability. Instead, we found that protein kinase C-related kinase, a Rho-dependent S/T kinase, is activated in endothelial cells upon thrombin stimulation and that its expression is required for endothelial permeability and remodeling of cell-extracellular matrix and cell-cell adhesions. Our results demonstrate that the signal initiated by thrombin bifurcates at the level of RhoA to promote changes in the cytoskeletal architecture through ROCK and the remodeling of focal adhesion components through PRK. Ultimately, both pathways converge to cause cell-cell junction disruption and provoke vascular leakage.

Rudge|Richard F. Katz|Garth N. Wells	  The processes that are involved in migration and extraction of melt from the mantle are not yet fully understood. Gaining a better understanding of material properties of partially molten rock could help shed light on the behavior of melt on larger scales in the mantle. In this study, we simulate three-dimensional torsional deformation of a partially molten rock that contains a rigid, spherical inclusion. We compare the computed porosity patterns to those found in recent laboratory experiments. The laboratory experiments show emergence of melt-rich bands throughout the rock sample, and pressure shadows around the inclusion. The numerical model displays similar melt-rich bands only for a small bulk-to-shear-viscosity ratio (five or less). The results are consistent with earlier two-dimensional numerical simulations; however, we show that it is easier to form melt-rich bands in three dimensions compared to two. The addition of strain-rate dependence of the viscosity causes a distinct change in the shape of pressure shadows around the inclusion. This change in shape presents an opportunity for experimentalists to identify the strain-rate dependence and therefore the dominant deformation mechanism in torsion experiments with inclusions.

Rucklidge|Matjaz Perc	  Rock is wrapped by paper, paper is cut by scissors, and scissors are crushed by rock. This simple game is popular among children and adults to decide on trivial disputes that have no obvious winner, but cyclic dominance is also at the heart of predator-prey interactions, the mating strategy of side-blotched lizards, the overgrowth of marine sessile organisms, and the competition in microbial populations. Cyclical interactions also emerge spontaneously in evolutionary games entailing volunteering, reward, punishment, and in fact are common when the competing strategies are three or more regardless of the particularities of the game. Here we review recent advances on the rock-paper-scissors and related evolutionary games, focusing in particular on pattern formation, the impact of mobility, and the spontaneous emergence of cyclic dominance. We also review mean-field and zero-dimensional rock-paper-scissors models and the application of the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation, and we highlight the importance and usefulness of statistical physics for the successful study of large-scale ecological systems. Directions for future research, related for example to dynamical effects of coevolutionary rules and invasion reversals due to multi-point interactions, are outlined as well. 	
1303.5304v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1303.5304v1	2013	A laboratory investigation of thermally induced pore pressures in the   Callovo-Oxfordian Claystone	Mehrdokht Mohajerani|Pierre Delage|Jean Sulem|Mohammad Monfared|Anh-Minh Tang|Behrouz Gatmiri	  In the framework of research into radioactive waste disposal, it was decided to investigate the thermally induce pore pressure occurring in the Callovo-Oxfordian claystone, a possible host rock in which the ANDRA underground laboratory of Bure (East of France) has been excavated. Thermal pore pressures appear in low permeability soils and rocks because the thermal expansion coefficient of water is significantly higher than that of the solid grains (Campanella and Mitchell; 1968 [1], Ghabezloo and Sulem; 2009 [2]). This phenomenon has clearly been observed in various in-situ heating tests conducted in Opalinus claystone in the Mont-Terri Underground Research Laboratory (URL) in Switzerland (HE-D test) and in Callovo-Oxfordian (COx) claystone in the Bure URL in France (TER test, Wileveau and Su; 2007 [3]) The processes of coring, transportation, storage and specimen trimming induce some desaturation in the sample. Due to the very low permeability (10-20 m2) of the COx claystone, a long period of time is necessary to properly resaturate the sample, a mandatory condition to satisfactorily investigate thermal pressurisation. Particular emphasis was hence put on the previous saturation procedure that was carried out under in-situ effective stress condition. Thermal pressurization has been investigated by performing undrained heating tests while measuring pore pressures changes in a specially adapted thermal isotropic compression cell. Special care was devoted to calibration procedures to account for the effects of the system on the pore pressure measurements. The thermal pressurization coefficient measured appeared to change with temperature, mainly because of the changes with temperature of both the water thermal expansion coefficient of water and the drained compression coefficient of the claystone. 	
1406.1052v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.1052v2	2014	A Conceptual Approach to Two-Scale Constitutive Modelling For   Hydro-Mechanical Coupling	Giang D. Nguyen|Abbas El-Zein|Terry Bennett	  Large scale modelling of fluid flow coupled with solid failure in geothermal reservoirs or hydrocarbon extraction from reservoir rocks usually involves behaviours at two scales: lower scale of the inelastic localization zone, and larger scale of the bulk continuum where elastic behaviour can be reasonably assumed. The hydraulic conductivities corresponding to the mechanical properties at these two scales are different. In the bulk elastic host rock, the hydraulic conductivity does not vary much with the deformation, while it significantly changes in the lower scale of the localization zone due to inelastic deformation. Increase of permeability due to fracture and/or dilation, or reduction of permeability due to material compaction can take place inside this zone. The challenge is to predict the evolution of hydraulic conductivities coupled with the mechanical behaviour of the material in all stages of the deformation process. In the early stage of diffuse deformation, the permeability of the material can be reasonably assumed to be homogenous over the whole Representative Volume Element (RVE) However, localized failure results in distinctly different conductivities in different parts of the RVE. This paper establishes a general framework and corresponding field equations to describe the hydro-mechanical coupling in both diffuse and localized stages of deformation in rocks. In particular, embedding the lower scale hydro-mechanical behaviour of the localization zone inside an elastic bulk, together with their corresponding effective sizes, helps effectively deal with scaling issues in large-scale modelling. Preliminary results are presented which demonstrate the promising features of this new approach. 	
9809423v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/9809423v2	1999	Grain Segregation Mechanism in Aeolian Sand Ripples	Hernan A. Makse	  Many sedimentary rocks are formed by migration of sand ripples. Thin layers of coarse and fine sand are present in these rocks, and understanding how layers in sandstone are created has been a longstanding question. Here, we propose a mechanism for the origin of the most common layered sedimentary structures such as inverse graded climbing ripple lamination and cross-stratification patterns. The mechanism involves a competition between three segregation processes: (i) size-segregation and (ii) shape-segregation during transport and rolling, and (iii) size segregation due to different hopping lengths of the small and large grains. We develop a discrete model of grain dynamics which incorporates the coupling between moving grains and the static sand surface, as well as the different properties of grains, such as size and roughness, in order to test the plausibility of this physical mechanism. 	
1401.2448v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.2448v1	2014	A 4D synchrotron X-ray tomography study of the formation of hydrocarbon   migration pathways in heated organic-rich shale	Hamed Panahi|Maya Kobchenko|Francois Renard|Adriano Mazzini|Julien Scheibert|Dag Kristian Dysthe|Bjorn Jamtveit|Anders Malthe-Sørenssen|Paul Meakin	  Recovery of oil from oil shales and the natural primary migration of hydrocarbons are closely related processes that have received renewed interests in recent years because of the ever tightening supply of conventional hydrocarbons and the growing production of hydrocarbons from low permeability tight rocks. Quantitative models for conversion of kerogen into oil and gas and the timing of hydrocarbon generation have been well documented. However, lack of consensus about the kinetics of hydrocarbon formation in source rocks, expulsion timing and how the resulting hydrocarbons escape from or are retained in the source rocks motivates further investigation. In particular, many mechanisms for the transport of hydrocarbons from the source rocks in which they are generated into adjacent rocks with higher permeabilities and smaller capillary entry pressures have been proposed, and a better understanding of this complex process (primary migration) is needed. To characterize these processes it is imperative to use the latest technological advances. In this study, it is shown how insights into hydrocarbon migration in source rocks can be obtained by using sequential high resolution synchrotron X-ray tomography. Three-dimensional (3D) images of several immature "shale" samples were constructed at resolutions close to 5 micrometers. This is sufficient to resolve the source rock structure down to the grain level, but very fine grained silt particles, clay particles and colloids cannot be resolved. Samples used in this investigation came from the R-8 unit in the upper part of the Green River Shale, which is organic rich, varved, lacustrine marl formed in Eocene Lake Uinta, United States of America. One Green River Shale sample was heated in-situ up to 400{\deg}C as X-ray tomography images were recorded. The other samples were scanned before and after heating at 400{\deg}C. During the heating phase, the organic matter was decomposed, and gas was released. Gas expulsion from the low permeability shales was coupled with formation of microcracks. The main technical difficulty was numerical extraction of microcracks that have apertures in the 5 to 30 micrometer range (with 5 micrometers being the resolution limit) from a large 3D volume of X-ray attenuation data. The main goal of the work presented here is to develop a methodology to process these 3D data and image the cracks. This methodology is based on several levels of spatial filtering and automatic recognition of connected domains. Supportive petrographic and thermogravimetric data were an important complement to this study. An investigation of the strain field using two-dimensional image correlation analyses was also performed. As one application of the four-dimensional (4D, space + time) microtomography and the developed workflow, we show that fluid generation was accompanied by crack formation. Under different conditions, in the subsurface, this might provide paths for primary migration.

The electric charges are released by activation of dormant charge carriers in the oxygen anion sublattice, called peroxy bonds or positive hole pairs (PHP), where a PHP represents an $O_3X/^{OO}\backslash YO_3$ with $X,Y = Si^{4+}, Al^{3+}...$, i.e. an $O^-$ in a matrix of $O^{2-}$ of silicates. We propose that PHP are activated by plastic deformations during the slow cooperative build-up of stress and the increasingly correlated damage culminating in a large ``critical'' earthquake. Recent laboratory experiments indeed show that stressed rocks form electric batteries which can release their charge when a conducting path closes the equivalent electric circuit. We conjecture that the intermittent and erratic occurrences of EM signals are a consequence of the progressive build-up of the battery charges in the Earth crust and their erratic release when crack networks are percolating throughout the stressed rock volumes, providing a conductive pathway for the battery currents to discharge. EM signals are thus expected close to the rupture, either slightly before or after, that is, when percolation is most favored.

Sitnitsky	  A mechanism for relationship of solvent viscosity with reaction rate constant at enzyme action is suggested. It is based on fluctuations of electric field in enzyme active site produced by thermally equilibrium rocking (cranckshaft motion) of the rigid plane (in which the dipole moment $\approx 3.6 D$ lies) of a favourably located and oriented peptide group (or may be a few of them). Thus the rocking of the plane leads to fluctuations of the electric field of the dipole moment. These fluctuations can interact with the reaction coordinate because the latter in its turn has transition dipole moment due to separation of charges at movement of the reacting system along it. The rocking of the plane of the peptide group is sensitive to the microviscosity of its environment in protein interior and the latter is a function of the solvent viscosity. Thus we obtain an additional factor of interrelationship for these characteristics with the reaction rate constant. We argue that due to the properties of the cranckshaft motion the frequency spectrum of the electric field fluctuations has a sharp resonance peak at some frequency and the corresponding Fourier mode can be approximated as oscillations. We employ a known result from the theory of thermally activated escape with periodic driving to obtain the reaction rate constant and argue that it yields reliable description of the preexponent where the dependence on solvent viscosity manifests itself. The suggested mechanism is shown to grasp the main feature of this dependence known from the experiment and satisfactorily yields the upper limit of the fractional index of a power in it.

Pride	  This is the first of a series of three articles that treats fracture localization as a critical phenomenon. This first article establishes a statistical mechanics based on ensemble averages when fluctuations through time play no role in defining the ensemble. Ensembles are obtained by dividing a huge rock sample into many mesoscopic volumes. Because rocks are a disordered collection of grains in cohesive contact, we expect that once shear strain is applied and cracks begin to arrive in the system, the mesoscopic volumes will have a wide distribution of different crack states. These mesoscopic volumes are the members of our ensembles. We determine the probability of observing a mesoscopic volume to be in a given crack state by maximizing Shannon's measure of the emergent crack disorder subject to constraints coming from the energy-balance of brittle fracture. The laws of thermodynamics, the partition function, and the quantification of temperature are obtained for such cracking systems. 	
1411.5047v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.5047v1	2014	On the thermal impact on the excavation damaged zone around deep   radioactive waste disposal	Pierre Delage	  Clays and claystones are considered in some countries (including Belgium, France and Switzerland) as a potential host rock for high activity long lived radioactive waste disposal at great depth. One of the aspects to deal with in performance assessment is related to the effects on the host rock of the temperature elevation due to the placement of exothermic wastes. The potential effects of the thermal impact on the excavated damaged zone in the close field are another important issue that was the goal of the TIMODAZ European research project. In this paper, some principles of waste disposal in clayey host rocks at great depth are first presented and a series of experimental investigations carried out on specific equipment specially developed to face the problem are presented. Both drained and undrained tests have been developed to investigate the drained thermal volume changes of clays and claystone and the thermal pressurization occurring around the galleries. This importance of proper initial saturation (under in-situ stresses) and of satisfactory drainage conditions (in spite of the significantly low permeability of claystones) is emphasized, leading to the development of a new hollow cylinder apparatus. It is observed that claystones cannot be considered as overconsolidated clays given that they can exhibit, as the Callovo-Oxfordian claystone does, a thermoplastic contraction. Mechanical and thermal hardening are however observed, extending to claystones the knowledge already gained on clays. A new method of determining in the laboratory the thermal pressurization coefficient is described and the data obtained allow completing existing data in the field. Finally, the hollow cylinder apparatus makes it possible to demonstrate that the good self-sealing properties of clays and claystones can be extended to temperature effects, an important conclusion in terms of performance assessment.

Täuber	  We study several variants of the stochastic four-state rock-paper-scissors game or, equivalently, cyclic three-species predator-prey models with conserved total particle density, by means of Monte Carlo simulations on one- and two-dimensional lattices. Specifically, we investigate the influence of spatial variability of the reaction rates and site occupancy restrictions on the transient oscillations of the species densities and on spatial correlation functions in the quasi-stationary coexistence state. For small systems, we also numerically determine the dependence of typical extinction times on the number of lattice sites. In stark contrast with two-species stochastic Lotka-Volterra systems, we find that for our three-species models with cyclic competition quenched disorder in the reaction rates has very little effect on the dynamics and the long-time properties of the coexistence state. Similarly, we observe that site restriction only has a minor influence on the system's dynamical properties. Our results therefore demonstrate that the features of the spatial rock-paper-scissors system are remarkably robust with respect to model variations, and stochastic fluctuations as well as spatial correlations play a comparatively minor role.

Stewart|Lars Hernquist	  Water-rich super-Earth exoplanets are expected to be common. We explore the effect of late giant impacts on the final bulk abundance of water in such planets. We present the results from smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of impacts between differentiated water(ice)-rock planets with masses between 0.5 and 5 M_Earth and projectile to target mass ratios from 1:1 to 1:4. We find that giant impacts between bodies of similar composition never decrease the bulk density of the target planet. If the commonly assumed maximum water fraction of 75wt% for bodies forming beyond the snow line is correct, giant impacts between similar composition bodies cannot serve as a mechanism for increasing the water fraction. Target planets either accrete materials in the same proportion, leaving the water fraction unchanged, or lose material from the water mantle, decreasing the water fraction. The criteria for catastrophic disruption of water-rock planets are similar to those found in previous work on super-Earths of terrestrial composition. Changes in bulk composition for giant impacts onto differentiated bodies of any composition (water-rock or rock-iron) are described by the same equations. These general laws can be incorporated into future N-body calculations of planet formation to track changes in composition from giant impacts.

Synchronized beating is required to swim both fast and straight. A long-standing hypothesis proposes that synchronization of flagella results from hydrodynamic coupling, but the details are not understood. Here, we present realistic hydrodynamic computations and high-speed tracking experiments of swimming cells that show how a perturbation from the synchronized state causes rotational motion of the cell body. This rotation feeds back on the flagellar dynamics via hydrodynamic friction forces and rapidly restores the synchronized state in our theory. We calculate that this `cell body rocking' provides the dominant contribution to synchronization in swimming cells, whereas direct hydrodynamic interactions between the flagella contribute negligibly. We experimentally confirmed the coupling between flagellar beating and cell body rocking predicted by our theory. This work appeared also in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science of the U.S.A as: Geyer et al., PNAS 110(45), p. 18058(6), 2013.

Katz|Yasuko Takei	  Chemical differentiation of rocky planets occurs by melt segregation away from the region of melting. The mechanics of this process, however, are complex and incompletely understood. In partially molten rocks undergoing shear deformation, melt pockets between grains align coherently in the stress field; it has been hypothesized that this anisotropy in microstructure creates an anisotropy in the viscosity of the aggregate. With the inclusion of anisotropic viscosity, continuum, two-phase-flow models reproduce the emergence and angle of melt-enriched bands that form in laboratory experiments. In the same theoretical context, these models also predict sample-scale melt migration due to a gradient in shear stress. Under torsional deformation, melt is expected to segregate radially inward. Here we present new torsional deformation experiments on partially molten rocks that test this prediction. Microstructural analyses of the distribution of melt and solid reveal a radial gradient in melt fraction, with more melt toward the centre of the cylinder. The extent of this radial melt segregation grows with progressive strain, consistent with theory. The agreement between theoretical prediction and experimental observation provides a validation of this theory, which is critical to understanding the large-scale geodynamic and geochemical evolution of Earth.

Research has shown, however, that mobility jeopardizes biodiversity by promoting the formation of spiral waves, especially if there is no conservation law in place for the total number of competing players. Firstly, we show that even if such a conservation law applies, mobility still jeopardizes biodiversity in the spatial rock-paper-scissors game if only a small fraction of links of the square lattice is randomly rewired. Secondly, we show that zealots are very effective in taming the amplitude of oscillations that emerge due to mobility and/or interaction randomness, and this regardless of whether the later is quenched or annealed. While even a tiny fraction of zealots brings significant benefits, at 5\% occupancy zealots practically destroy all oscillations regardless of the intensity of mobility, and regardless of the type and strength of randomness in the interaction structure. Interestingly, by annealed randomness the impact of zealots is qualitatively the same as by mobility, which highlights that fast diffusion does not necessarily destroy the coexistence of species, and that zealotry thus helps to recover the stable mean-field solution. Our results strengthen the important role of zealots in models of cyclic dominance, and they reveal fascinating evolutionary outcomes in structured populations that are a unique consequence of such uncompromising behavior.

The AWS method considered herein aims to exploit the well-known permeability-enhancing effect of mechanical vibrations in acoustically porous materials, by transmitting time-harmonic sound waves from a sound source device---placed inside the well---to the well perforations made into the formation. The efficiency of the AWS is assessed by quantifying the amount of acoustic energy transmitted from the source device to the rock formation in terms of the emission frequency and the well configuration. A simple methodology to find optimal emission frequencies for a given well configuration is presented. The proposed model is based on the Helmholtz equation and an impedance boundary condition that effectively accounts for the porous solid-fluid interaction at the interface between the rock formation and the well perforations. Exact non-reflecting boundary conditions derived from Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps are utilized to truncate the circular cylindrical waveguides considered in the model. The resulting boundary value problem is then numerically solved by means of the finite element method. A variety of numerical examples are presented in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed procedure for finding optimal emission frequencies.

Mertens|Angel Sanchez	  We investigate the ratchet dynamics of nonlinear Klein-Gordon kinks in a periodic, asymmetric lattice of point-like inhomogeneities. We explain the underlying rectification mechanism within a collective coordinate framework, which shows that such system behaves as a rocking ratchet for point particles. Careful attention is given to the kink width dynamics and its role in the transport. We also analyze the robustness of our kink rocking ratchet in the presence of noise. We show that the noise activates unidirectional motion in a parameter range where such motion is not observed in the noiseless case. This is subsequently corroborated by the collective variable theory. An explanation for this new phenomenom is given.

It was found that only four carbides (RuC, PdC, AgC and PtC) are mechanically stable. In particular, we have shown that RuC, PdC, and PtC have very high bulk modulus, which has been remarkably observed by the most recent experiment for the case of PtC. From the calculated density of states, we can conclude that these compounds are metallic, like the conventional group IV and group V transition metal carbides.

Outside the fractures, the propagation of compressional waves is described in the simple framework of one-dimensional linear elastodynamics. The focus here is on the interactions between the waves and fractures: for this purpose, the mechanical behavior of the fractures is modeled using nonlinear jump conditions deduced from the Bandis-Barton model classicaly used in geomechanics. Well-posedness of the initial-boundary value problem thus obtained is proved. Numerical modeling is performed by coupling a time-domain finite-difference scheme with an interface method accounting for the jump conditions. The numerical experiments show the effects of contact nonlinearities. The harmonics generated may provide a non-destructive means of evaluating the mechanical properties of fractures.

It is, furthermore, elaborated that the strategies of cooperation, defection and nonparticipant form a Rock-Paper-Scissors type cycle, and the cycle of three strategies are persistent over 200 rounds. This cycle is very similar to the cycle given by evolutionary dynamics e.g. replicator dynamics. The mechanism that nonparticipant can sustain cooperation is driven by the Rock-Paper-Scissors type of cyclic dominance in the three strategies. That is, if the cycle is existent, the cooperation will always sustain. Meanwhile, the distribution of social states changes in the state space and from cooperation as the most frequent strategy to defection and, from defection to nonparticipant, forms a clear rotation path in a long run. These results seem to implicate that the evolutionary dynamics has ability to capture the real dynamics applying not only on biosphere, but also on human society.

Rothman	  CO$_2$ sequestration in subsurface reservoirs is important for limiting atmospheric CO$_2$ concentrations. However, a complete physical picture able to predict the structure developing within the porous medium is lacking. We investigate theoretically reactive transport in the long-time evolution of carbon in the brine-rock environment. As CO$_2$ is injected into a brine-rock environment, a carbonate-rich region is created amid brine. Within the carbonate-rich region minerals dissolve and migrate from regions of high concentration to low concentration, along with other dissolved carbonate species. This causes mineral precipitation at the interface between the two regions. We argue that precipitation in a small layer reduces diffusivity, and eventually causes mechanical trapping of the CO$_2$. Consequently, only a small fraction of the CO$_2$ is converted to solid mineral; the remainder either dissolves in water or is trapped in its original form. We also study the case of a pure CO$_2$ bubble surrounded by brine and suggest a mechanism that may lead to a carbonate-encrusted bubble due to structural diffusion.

Liu|Sidney R. Nagel	  Recent advances in designing meta-materials have demonstrated that global mechanical properties of disordered spring networks can be tuned by selectively modifying only a small subset of bonds. Here, using a computationally-efficient approach, we extend this idea in order to tune more general properties of networks. With nearly complete success, we are able to produce a strain between any pair of target nodes in a network in response to an applied source strain on any other pair of nodes by removing only ~1% of the bonds. We are also able to control multiple pairs of target nodes, each with a different individual response, from a single source, and to tune multiple independent source/target responses simultaneously into a network. We have fabricated physical networks in macroscopic two- and three-dimensional systems that exhibit these responses. This targeted behavior is reminiscent of the long-range coupled conformational changes that often occur during allostery in proteins. The ease with which we create these responses may give insight into why allostery is a common means for the regulation of activity in biological molecules.

Ghassemi	  As the magma ascends from its depth of generation to the surface, it is often stored in a series of chambers along the way. The rheological contrast between the viscous magma in the magmatic chambers and the surrounding rocks disturbed the stress field which can give rise to various modes of rock failure at magmatic pressures less than the lithostatic stress, leading to an eruption. Different modes of mechanical failure of the chamber walls are considered depending on the geometry and the sign the relative pressure. Relaxation of viscous stress around magmatic chambers, which is important on the time scale of weeks to months is considered in the analysis of stability with application to both large and extra-large magmatic chambers such as Yellowstone. The effects of a strong deep CO2 flux in Yellowstone are considered in detail. The analysis shows that variations in the flow rate around the observed mean value of 40 kg/m2/yr in the hydrothermally active areas can change the composition of the magma for several hundred thousand years, and cause periodic uplift and subsidence of the caldera surface with a period of several decades.

These last decades, considerable progress has been made towards understanding deformation and fracture process in laboratory experiment on granular rock materials, as the well-known shear banding experiment. One of the reasons for this progress is the continuous improvement in the instrumental techniques of observation. But the lack of real time methods does not allow the detection of indicators of the upcoming fracture process and thus to anticipate the phenomenon. Here, we have performed uniaxial compression experiments to analyse the response of a granular rock material sample to different shocks. We use a novel interferometric laser sensor based on the nonlinear self-mixing interferometry technique to observe in real time the deformations of the sample and assess its usefulness as a diagnostic tool for the analysis of geomaterial dynamics. Due to the high spatial and temporal resolution of this approach, we observe both vibrations processes in response to a dynamic loading and the onset of failure. The latter is preceded by a continuous variation of vibration period of the material. After several shocks, the material response is no longer reversible and we detect a progressive accumulation of irreversible deformation leading to the fracture process. We demonstrate that material failure is anticipated by the critical slowing down of the surface vibrational motion, which may therefore be envisioned as an early warning signal or predictor to the macroscopic failure of the sample. The nonlinear self-mixing interferometry technique is readily extensible to fault propagation measurements. As such, it opens a new window of observation for the study of geomaterial deformation and failure.

The traditional stress mechanism of fracture formation assigned a support role. As a proximate cause of the earthquake the destruction of the roofs of sub-horizontal fluid-saturated bodies (SHFB) is considered. This collapse may occur due to redistribution of fluid pressure within the system of SHFB connected by cracks (tectonic or other nature). It can cause both shifts of rock blocks contributing to seismic shocks and various effects characteristic of foreshocks and aftershocks. 	
0107315v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0107315v2	2003	A Thermodynamic Model for Prebiotic Protein Function	Ayse Erzan|Erkan Tuzel	  We propose a scenario for the prebiotic co-evolution of RNA and of fast folding proteins with large entropy gaps as observed today. We show from very general principles that the folding and unfolding of the proteins synthesized by RNA can function as a heat pump. Rock surfaces can facilitate the folding of amino acid chains having polar and hydrophobic residues, with an accompanying heat loss to the surrounding rock. These chains then absorb heat from the soup as they unfold. This opens the way to the enhancement of RNA replication rates, by the enzymatic action of folded proteins present in greater numbers at reduced temperatures. This gives an evolutionary advantage to those RNA coding amino acid sequences with non-degenerate folded states which would provide the most efficient refrigeration.

On the square lattice this system exhibits a self-organizing pattern with equal concentration of the competing strategies (species). If the quenched background is constructed by substituting random links for the nearest neighbor bonds of a square lattice then a limit cycle occurs when the portion of random links exceeds a threshold value. This transition can also be observed if the standard link is replaced temporarily by a random one with a probability $P$ at each step of iteration. Above a second threshold value of $P$ the amplitude of global oscillation increases with time and finally the system reaches one of the homogeneous (absorbing) states. In this case the results of Monte Carlo simulations are compared with the predictions of the dynamical cluster technique evaluating all the configuration probabilities on one-, two-, four-, and six-site clusters.

Jayannavar	  We study the generalized efficiency of an adiabatically rocked ratchet with both spatial and temporal asymmetry. We obtain an analytical expression for the generalized efficiency in the deterministic case. Generalized efficiency of the order of 50% is obtained by fine tuning of the parameter range. This is unlike the case of thermodynamic efficiency where we could readily get an enhanced efficiency of upto 90%. The observed higher values of generalized efficiency is attributed to be due to the suppression of backward current. We have also discussed briefly the differences between thermodynamic, rectification or generalized efficiency and Stoke's efficiency. Temperature is found to optimize the generalized efficiency over a wide range of parameter space unlike in the case of thermodynamic efficiency.

In this manner, some hidden metric spaces (similarity measurements) between apertures profiles are set up and a general evolutionary network in two directions (in parallel and perpendicular to the shear direction) is constructed. Also, an algorithm (COmplex Networks on Apertures: CONA) is proposed in which evolving of a network is accomplished using preferential detachments and attachments of edges (based on a competition and game manner) while the number of nodes is fixed. Also, evolving of clustering coefficients and number of edges display similar patterns as well as are appeared in shear stress, hydraulic conductivity and dilation changes, which can be engaged to estimate shear strength distribution of asperities. 	
0912.5179v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/0912.5179v2	2010	Oscillatory Dynamics in Rock-Paper-Scissors Games with Mutations	Mauro Mobilia	  We study the oscillatory dynamics in the generic three-species rock-paper-scissors games with mutations. In the mean-field limit, different behaviors are found: (a) for high mutation rate, there is a stable interior fixed point with coexistence of all species; (b) for low mutation rates, there is a region of the parameter space characterized by a limit cycle resulting from a Hopf bifurcation; (c) in the absence of mutations, there is a region where heteroclinic cycles yield oscillations of large amplitude (not robust against noise). After a discussion on the main properties of the mean-field dynamics, we investigate the stochastic version of the model within an individual-based formulation. Demographic fluctuations are therefore naturally accounted and their effects are studied using a diffusion theory complemented by numerical simulations. It is thus shown that persistent erratic oscillations (quasi-cycles) of large amplitude emerge from a noise-induced resonance phenomenon. We also analytically and numerically compute the average escape time necessary to reach a (quasi-)cycle on which the system oscillates at a given amplitude.

We here discuss rock-paper-scissors games on a one-dimensional lattice where the interaction rates and the mobility can be species dependent. Allowing only single site occupation, we realize mobility by exchanging individuals of different species. When the interaction and swapping rates are symmetric, a strongly enhanced swapping rate yields an increased mixing of the species, leading to a mean-field like coexistence even in one-dimensional systems. This coexistence is transient when the rates are asymmetric, and eventually only one species will survive. Interestingly, in our spatial games the dominating species can differ from the species that would dominate in the corresponding nonspatial model. We identify different regimes in the parameter space and construct the corresponding dynamical phase diagram.

In contrast to many two-strategy evolutionary games, games with three strategies and cyclic dominance like the rock-paper-scissors game (RPS) stabilize coexistence and thus preserve biodiversity in this system. In the limit of infinite populations, resembling the traditional picture of evolutionary game theory, replicator equations predict the existence of a fixed point in the interior of the phase space. But in finite populations, strategy frequencies will run out of the fixed point because of stochastic fluctuations, and strategies can even go extinct. For three different processes and for zero-sum and non-zero-sum RPS as well, we present results of extensive simulations for the mean extinction time (MET), depending on the number of agents N, and we introduce two analytical approaches for the derivation of the MET.

Ladd	  A reactive fluid dissolving the surrounding rock matrix can trigger an instability in the dissolution front, leading to spontaneous formation of pronounced channels or wormholes. Theoretical investigations of this instability have typically focused on a steadily propagating dissolution front that separates regions of high and low porosity. In this paper we show that this is not the only possible dissolutional instability in porous rocks; there is another instability that operates instantaneously on any initial porosity field, including an entirely uniform one. The relative importance of the two mechanisms depends on the ratio of the porosity increase to the initial porosity. We show that the "inlet" instability is likely to be important in limestone formations where the initial porosity is small and there is the possibility of a large increase in permeability. In quartz-rich sandstones, where the proportion of easily soluble material (e.g. carbonate cements) is small, the instability in the steady-state equations is dominant.

However, the previous studies only consider the nearest- neighbor- interaction among the species. In this paper, taking the long range migration into account, the effects of the interplay between nearest-neighbor-interaction and long-range-interaction of Levy flight obey the power law distance distribution with the exponent h (-0.3<h<-0.1) in spatial RPS game is investigated. Taking the probability of long range Levy flight and the power exponent as parameters, the coexistence conditions of three species are found. The critical curves for stable coexistence of three species in the parameters space are presented. It is also found that long-range-interaction with Levy flight has interesting effects on the final spatiotemporal pattern of the system. The results reveal that the long-range-interaction of Levy flight exhibit pronounced effects on biodiversity of ecosystem.

Klapp	  Based on the Fokker-Planck equation we investigate the transport of an overdamped colloidal particle in a static, asymmetric periodic potential supplemented by a time-dependent, delayed feedback force, $F_{\mathrm{fc}}$. For a given time $t$, $F_\mathrm{fc}$ depends on the status of the system at a previous time $t-\tau_\mathrm{D}$, with $\tau_\mathrm{D}$ being a delay time, specifically on the delayed mean particle displacement (relative to some "switching position"). For non-zero delay times $F_{\mathrm{fc}}(t)$ develops nearly regular oscillations generating a net current in the system. Depending on the switching position, this current is nearly as large or even larger than that in a conventional open-loop rocking ratchet. We also investigate thermodynamic properties of the delayed non-equilibrium system and we suggest an underlying Langevin equation which reproduces the Fokker-Planck results. 	
0802.0225v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/0802.0225v1	2008	Nonlinear Dynamics, Magnitude-Period Formula and Forecasts on Earthquake	Yi-Fang Chang	  Based on the geodynamics, an earthquake does not take place until the momentum-energy excess a faulting threshold value of rock due to the movement of the fluid layer under the rock layer and the transport and accumulation of the momentum. From the nonlinear equations of fluid mechanics, a simplified nonlinear solution of momentum corresponding the accumulation of the energy could be derived. Otherwise, a chaos equation could be obtained, in which chaos corresponds to the earthquake, which shows complexity on seismology, and impossibility of exact prediction of earthquakes. But, combining the Carlson-Langer model and the Gutenberg-Richter relation, the magnitude-period formula of the earthquake may be derived approximately, and some results can be calculated quantitatively. For example, we forecast a series of earthquakes of 2004, 2009 and 2014, especially in 2019 in California. Combining the Lorenz model, we discuss the earthquake migration to and fro. Moreover, many external causes for earthquake are merely the initial conditions of this nonlinear system.

Kantz	  We study directed transport of overdamped particles in a periodically rocked random sawtooth potential. Two transport regimes can be identified which are characterized by a nonzero value of the average velocity of particles and a zero value, respectively. The properties of directed transport in these regimes are investigated both analytically and numerically in terms of a random sawtooth potential and a periodically varying driving force. Precise conditions for the occurrence of transition between these two transport regimes are derived and analyzed in detail.

Mateos	  A thorough analysis of the dynamics in a deterministic optical rocking ratchet (introduced in A. V. Arzola et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 168104 (2011)) and a comparison with experimental results are presented. The studied system consists of a microscopic particle interacting with a periodic and asymmetric light pattern, which is driven away from equilibrium by means of an unbiased time- periodic external force. It is shown that the asymmetry of the effective optical potential depends on the relative size of the particle with respect to the spatial period, and this is analyzed as an effective mechanism for particle fractionation. The necessary conditions to obtain current reversals in the deterministic regime are discussed in detail.

Viswanathan|Wenquan Tao	  A pore-scale numerical model for reactive transport processes based on the Lattice Boltzmann method is used to study the dissolution-induced changes in hydrologic properties of a fractured medium and a porous medium. The solid phase of both media consists of two minerals, and a structure reconstruction method called quartet structure generation set is employed to generate the distributions of both minerals. Emphasis is put on the effects of undissolved minerals on the changes of permeability and porosity under different Peclet and Damkohler numbers. The simulation results show porous layers formed by the undissolved mineral remain behind the dissolution reaction front. Due to the large flow resistance in these porous layers, the permeability increases very slowly or even remains at a small value although the porosity increases by a large amount. Besides, due to the heterogeneous characteristic of the dissolution, the chemical, mechanical and hydraulic apertures are very different from each other. Further, simulations in complex porous structures demonstrate that the existence of the porous layers of the nonreactive mineral suppresses the wormholing phenomena observed in the dissolution of mono-mineralic rocks.

Between 160 K and 400 K, the dominant scattering process of the carriers in this system changes from acoustic phonon scattering in PbSe to ionized impurity scattering in AgPbmSnSe2+m, which synergistically optimizes electrical and thermal transport properties. Thanks to the faint amount of AgSnSe2, the Seebeck coefficient is enhanced by boosting the scattering factor, the electric conductivity is improved by the increase of the concentration of holes coupled to a limited degradation of their mobility, and the total thermal conductivity is reduced by suppressing bipolar thermal conductivity. Therefore, ZT of AgPbmSnSe2+m (m = 50) reaches 1.3 at 889 K. The mechanism suggested in this study opens new paths to improve the thermoelectric performances of other families of materials.

Rucklidge|Bartosz Szczesny	  We consider a two-dimensional model of three species in rock-paper-scissors competition and study the self-organisation of the population into fascinating spiraling patterns. Within our individual-based metapopulation formulation, the population composition changes due to cyclic dominance (dominance-removal and dominance-replacement), mutations, and pair-exchange of neighboring individuals. Here, we study the influence of mobility on the emerging patterns and investigate when the pair-exchange rate is responsible for spiral waves to become elusive in stochastic lattice simulations. In particular, we show that the spiral waves predicted by the system's deterministic partial equations are found in lattice simulations only within a finite range of the mobility rate. We also report that in the absence of mutations and dominance-replacement, the resulting spiraling patterns are subject to convective instability and far-field breakup at low mobility rate. Possible applications of these resolution and far-field breakup phenomena are discussed.

Ramos	  This work deals with the effects of an apex predator on the cyclic competition among three distinct species that follow the rules of the rock-paper-scissors game. The investigation develops standard stochastic simulations but is motivated by a novel procedure which is explained in the work. We add the apex predator as the fourth species in the system that contains three species that evolve following the standard rules of migration, reproduction and predation, and study how the system evolves in this new environment, in comparison with the case in the absence of the apex predator. The results show that the apex predator engenders the tendency to spread uniformly in the lattice, contributing to destroy the spiral patterns, keeping biodiversity but diminishing the average size of the clusters of the species that compete cyclically.

Inferring Triggering Rates   From Incomplete Information	Jordi Baró|Jörn Davidsen	  The acoustic emission activity associated with recent rock fracture experiments under different conditions has indicated that some features of event-event triggering are independent of the details of the experiment and the materials used and are often even indistinguishable from tectonic earthquakes. While the event-event triggering rates or aftershock rates behave pretty much identical for all rock fracture experiments at short times, this is not the case for later times. Here, we discuss how these differences can be a consequence of the aftershock identification method used and show that the true aftershock rates might have two distinct regimes. Specifically, tests on a modified Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence model show that the model rates cannot be correctly inferred at late times based on temporal information only if the activity rates or the branching ratio are high. We also discuss both the effect of the two distinct regimes in the aftershock rates and the effect of the background rate on the inter-event time distribution. Our findings should be applicable for inferring event-event triggering rates for many other types of triggering and branching processes as well.

Ramos	  This work reports on two related investigations of stochastic simulations which are widely used to study biodiversity and other related issues. We first deal with the behavior of the Hamming distance under the increase of the number of species and the size of the lattice, and then investigate how the mobility of the species contributes to jeopardize biodiversity. The investigations are based on the standard rules of reproduction, mobility and predation or competition, which are described by specific rules, guided by generalization of the rock-paper-scissors game, valid in the case of three species. The results on the Hamming distance indicate that it engenders universal behavior, independently of the number of species and the size of the square lattice. The results on the mobility confirm the prediction that it may destroy diversity, if it is increased to higher and higher values.

Czaran	  As a generalization of the 3-strategy Rock-Scissors-Paper game dynamics in space, cyclical interaction models of six mutating species are studied on a square lattice, in which each species is supposed to have two dominant, two subordinated and a neutral interacting partner. Depending on their interaction topologies, these systems can be classified into four (isomorphic) groups exhibiting significantly different behaviors as a function of mutation rate. On three out of four cases three (or four) species form defensive alliances which maintain themselves in a self-organizing polydomain structure via cyclic invasions. Varying the mutation rate this mechanism results in an ordering phenomenon analogous to that of magnetic Ising model.

Thanassoulas|V. Klentos	  The generated, prior to the Izmit Turkey large EQ, preseismic electric signals were recorded in Greece by the VOL Earth's electric field monitoring site. In order to explain their peculiar character and their generating mechanism, a large scale piezoelectric mechanism was assumed that was initiated in the Izmit seismogenic region long before the EQ occurrence time. The theoretical analysis of the adopted physical model justifies the generation of a number of specific electric signals that can be emitted from the focal area before the rock formation failure. The processing of the registered by the VOL monitoring site raw data revealed the presence of similar signals as the expected theoretical ones. Therefore, it is concluded that long before the Izmit EQ occurrence a large scale piezoelectric mechanism was initiated that was modulated too by the tidally triggered lithospheric oscillation and therefore generated the observed preseismic electric signals. The adopted piezoelectric model provides critical information about the time of occurrence of the seismogenic area rock formation failure and therefore the possibility for a real short-term time prediction of a large EQ. The other two predictive EQ parameters, location and magnitude, are discussed in the frame of electric field triangulation and the Lithospheric Seismic Energy Flow Model (LSEFM). 	
1701.03486v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.03486v1	2017	Multi-step Steady-State Measurements of Low Permeability Using Series   Circuit with A Reference Rock Sample	Jun Li	  A multi-step steady-state (MSSS) method is proposed here for the measurement of low permeability. This new method can accurately and easily measure very low permeabilities of rock samples using a new setup, where the targeted rock sample and ordinary apparatus components are connected with a reference rock sample to form a series circuit. Any conventional rock sample with high permeability could be used as a reference rock sample such that the traditional steady-state measurement is feasible to accurately determine its permeability to be used as a reference value in the MSSS method. The challenging measurement of tiny mass flux rate by advanced pump system is avoided and the permeability of targeted rock sample can be directly computed using the pressure drops, sectional areas and lengths of the two connected rock samples, and the known permeability of the reference rock sample based on the mass conservation principle in a series circuit at steady state. Multi-step measurements using additional reference rock samples will be needed if the pressure drop over the first reference rock sample is too small to be accurately measured due to high permeability ratio when it is connected with the targeted rock sample to form a series circuit. The relative pressure drops can be small since the measurement of flow speed is unnecessary, which improves the accuracy in studying the dependence of gas permeability on the pore pressure. Consequently, the advantages of the MSSS method include low expense, simplicity, high accuracy and efficiency.

The model pre- dictions and the natural data for the Austroalpine of the Western Alps agree very well in terms of P-T peak conditions, relative chronology of peak and exhumation events, P-T-t paths, thermal gradients and the tectonic evolu- tion of the continental rocks. These findings suggest that a pre-collisional evolution of this domain, with the burial of the continental rocks (induced by ablative subduction of the overriding Adria plate) and their exhumation (driven by an upwelling flow generated in a hydrated mantle wedge) could be a valid mechanism that reproduces the actual tectono-metamorphic config- uration of this part of the Alps. There is less agreement between the model predictions and the natural data for the Austroalpine of the Central-Eastern Alps. Based on the natural data available in the literature, a critical discus- sion of the other proposed mechanisms is presented, and additional geological factors that should be considered within the numerical model are suggested to improve the fitting to the numerical results; these factors include varia- tions in the continental and/or oceanic thickness, variation of the subduction rate and/or slab dip, the initial thermal state of the passive margin, the oc- currence of continental collision and an oblique convergence. 	
1507.04539v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.04539v1	2015	On comparison of simulated and observed seismicity	Aleksandr M. Linkov|Liliana Rybarska-Rusinek|Victor V. Zoubkov	  Numerical simulation of seismicity has been successfully developed and used for the two last decades. Presently, the general theory of modeling and the progress in computational techniques provide wide options for simulation of seismic and aseismic events with various source mechanisms accounting for blocky structure of rock mass, inclusions, faults, cracks, complicated contact conditions and various mechanical properties of rock. Meanwhile, in practical applications, the input data are limited and uncertain. The data on observed seismicity are also often limited with a few parameters, like coordinates and time. The paper aims to agree the input and output data, used in and provided by numerical simulations, with uncertain and limited data of direct observations. For the input parameters, we suggest their minimal set, which complies with commonly available data. For output seismic parameters, we distinguish three major groups, which are provided by field observations. The first group includes the common (minimal) data on distributions of the event location. These distributions are of special value for improving the input data on geometrical features of a problem. The second group employs the data (commonly available, as well) on the event magnitude. These distributions are of exceptional need for evaluating the risk of strong events. The third group employs data on the event source mechanism. It is based on the tensor of seismic moment/potency, provided by advanced mining seismic systems. This group includes distributions of the geometrical parameters of the event source (orientation of nodal planes, B, P and T directions). It is especially important when establishing and using the connection between stresses and seismicity. The exposition is illustrated by considering an example of long-wall mining in a coal seam.

As part of this project, an accurate 3D seismic derived geological model is needed. The paper shows the procedure used for building the 3D seismic constrained geological model in depth by combining time-to-depth conversion of seismic horizons, consistent seismic velocity model and elastic impedance in time. It also shows how the 3D model is used for mechanical and hydrogeological studies. The 3D seismic field data example illustrates the potential of the proposed depth conversion procedure for estimating density and velocity distributions, which are consistent with the depth conversion of seismic horizons using the Bayesian Kriging method. The geological model shows good agreement with well log data obtained from a reference well, located closest to the 3D seismic survey area. Modeling of the mechanical parameters such as shear modulus, Young modulus, bulk modulus indicates low variability of parameters confirming the homogeneity of the target formation (Callovo-Oxfordian claystone). 3D modeling of a permeability index (Ik-Seis) computed from seismic attributes (instantaneous frequency, envelope, elastic impedance) and validated at the reference well shows promising potential for supporting hydrogeological simulation and decision making related to safety issues.

A deep understanding of the mechanical properties of shale is of vital importance in various geotechnical applications, including oil and gas exploitation. In this work, deformability, strength, and fracturing properties of Marcellus shale were investigated through an experimental study. Firstly, uniaxial compression, direct tension, and Brazilian tests were performed on the Marcellus shale specimens in various bedding plane orientations with respect to loading directions to measure the static mechanical properties and their anisotropy. Furthermore, the deformability of Marcellus shale was also studied through seismic velocity measurements for comparison with the static measurements. The experimental results revealed that the transversely isotropic model is applicable for describing the elastic behaviors of Marcellus shale in pure tension and compression. The elastic properties measured from these two experiments, however, were not exactly the same. Strength results showed that differences exist between splitting (Brazilian) and direct tensile strengths, both of which varied with bedding plane orientations and loading directions and were associated with different failure modes. Finally, a series of three-point-bending tests were conducted on specimens of increasing size in three different principal notch orientations to investigate the fracture properties of the material. It was found that there exists a significant size effect on the fracture properties calculated from the measured peak loads and by using the Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) theory. The fracture properties can be uniquely identified, however, by using Bazant's Size Effect Law and they were found to be anisotropic.

Under an external ac current, a rocking ratchet mechanism operates whereby one sign of the time derivative of the phase is favored. We show that there exists a range of parameters in which a fixed sign (and, in a narrower range, even a fixed value) of the average voltage across the ring occurs, regardless of the sign of the external current dc component.

For small amplitudes of the forcing, the drift is enhanced, but the enhancement is reduced with increasing frequency of the forcing. On the other hand, a reduction of the drift or even a flux reversal can be induced at larger amplitudes, while the flux is now found to be an increasing function of the perturbation frequency.

It is shown that microstructural models exhibit certain similarities to corresponding theories of continua. These similarities are most easily demonstrated for simple crack geometries, i.e., straight cracks (finite size scalings). However, there exist even scaling relations which are completely independent of the particular employed crack structure. Furthermore it is demonstrated that disorder in cohesional/flow properties can influence the crack growth and the resulting fracture geometry in an essential way.

Majer	  We investigate directed motion in non-adiabatically rocked ratchet systems sustaining few bands below the barrier. Upon restricting the dynamics to the lowest M bands, the total system-plus-bath Hamiltonian is mapped onto a discrete tight-binding model containing all the information both on the intra- and inter-well tunneling motion. A closed form for the current in the incoherent tunneling regime is obtained. In effective single-band ratchets, no current rectification occurs. We apply our theory to describe rectification effects in vortex quantum ratchets devices. Current reversals upon variation of the ac-field amplitude or frequency are predicted.

Jayannavar	  The efficiency of energy transduction in a temporally asymmetric rocked ratchet is studied. Time asymmetry favours current in one direction and suppresses it in the opposite direction due to which large efficiency ~ 50% is readily obtained. The spatial asymmetry in the potential together with system inhomogeneity may help in further enhancing the efficiency. Fine tuning of system parameters considered leads to multiple current reversals even in the adiabatic regime.

We demonstrate that the velocity-load characteristics is distinctly non-monotonic, possessing regimes with a {\em negative differential mobility}.

These quantifiers characterize the mutual interplay between the viscous drag and the external load differently, weighing the inherent rectification features from different physical perspectives.

Oliveira|Peter Hänggi	  Nonergodic Brownian motion is elucidated within the framework of the generalized Langevin equation. For thermal noise yielding either a vanishing or a divergent zero-frequency friction strength, the non-Markovian Browninan dynamics exhibits a riveting, anomalous diffusion behavior being characterized by a ballistic or possibly also a localized dynamics. As a consequence, such tailored thermal noise may cause a net acceleration of directed transport in a rocking Brownian motor. Two notable conditions for the thermal noise are identified in order to guarantee the fluctuation-dissipation theorem of first kind.

Zoia	  The motion of contaminant particles through complex environments such as fractured rocks or porous sediments is often characterized by anomalous diffusion: the spread of the transported quantity is found to grow sublinearly in time due to the presence of obstacles which hinder particle migration. The asymptotic behavior of these systems is usually well described by fractional diffusion, which provides an elegant and unified framework for modeling anomalous transport. We show that pre-asymptotic corrections to fractional diffusion might become relevant, depending on the microscopic dynamics of the particles. To incorporate these effects, we derive a modified transport equation and validate its effectiveness by a Monte Carlo simulation.

Here we propose a solid-solid phase transformation model for roughening instability in the interface between two porous materials with different porosities under normal compression stresses. This instability is triggered by a finite jump in the free energy density across the interface, and it leads to the formation of finger-like structures aligned with the principal direction of compaction. The model is proposed as an explanation for the roughening of stylolites - irregular interfaces associated with the compaction of sedimentary rocks that fluctuate about a plane perpendicular to the principal direction of compaction.

The model consists of players on lattice points, each of which plays the RSP game with neighboring players. Each player copies the next hand from the hand of the neighbouring player with the maximum point. The model exhibits a steady pattern with pairs of vortices and sinks on the triangular lattice. It is shown that the stationary vortex is due to the frustrations on the triangular lattice. A frustration is the three-sided situation where each of the three players around a triangle chooses the rock, the scissors and the paper, respectively.

Fortney	  We highlight the importance of transit observations on understanding the physics of planetary atmospheres and interiors. Transmission spectra and emission spectra allow us to characterize this exotic atmospheres, which possess TiO, VO, H2O, CO, Na, and K, as principal absorbers. We calculate mass-radius relations for water-rock-iron and gas giant planets and examine these relations in light of current and future transit observations. A brief review is given of mechanisms that could lead to the large radii observed for some transiting planets.

Zoia	  We study the dynamics of a radioactive species flowing through a porous material, within the Continuous-Time Random Walk (CTRW) approach to the modelling of stochastic transport processes. Emphasis is given to the case where radioactive decay is coupled to anomalous diffusion in locally heterogeneous media, such as porous sediments or fractured rocks. In this framework, we derive the distribution of the number of jumps each particle can perform before a decay event. On the basis of the obtained results, we compute the moments of the cumulative particle distribution, which can be then used to quantify the overall displacement and spread of the contaminant species.

Likewise, for an average zero-temperature difference between the two contacts a net, ratchet-like heat flux emerges. Computer simulations show that this very heat flux can be controlled and reversed by suitably tailoring the frequency ($\lesssim$ 100 MHz) of the alternating temperature field.

Winkler|Tobias Reichenbach|Erwin Frey	  Cyclic (rock-paper-scissors-type) population models serve to mimic complex species interactions. Focusing on a paradigmatic three-species model with mutations in one dimension, we observe an interplay between equilibrium and non-equilibrium processes in the stationary state. We exploit these insights to obtain asymptotically exact descriptions of the emerging reactive steady state in the regimes of high and low mutation rates. The results are compared to stochastic lattice simulations. Our methods and findings are potentially relevant for the spatio-temporal evolution of other non-equilibrium stochastic processes.

The model explicitely accounts for tensile and shear local damage and reproduces the main features of compressive failure of brittle materials like rocks or ice. We show that the size distribution of damage-clusters, as well as the evolution of an order parameter, the size of the largest damage-cluster, argue for a critical interpretation of fracture. The compressive failure strength follows a normal distribution with a very small size effect on the mean strength, in good agreement with experiments.

Shamanna	  A deposition process with particles having realistic intermediate stickiness is studied in 2+1 dimensions. At each stage of the deposition process, for any given configuration, a newly depositing particle gives rise to allowed set of configurations that are vastly larger than those for deposition of a mixture of purely non-sticky (random like) and purely sticky (ballistic like) particles. We obtain scaling behavior and demonstrate collapse of scaled data for surface width and porosity. Scaling of conductivity, when a porous structure thus formed, is saturated with conductive fluid, e.g. brine, is studied. The results obtained are in good agreement with Archie's law for porous sedimentary rocks.

Specifically, we present our 3D SPH code to simulate and analyze collisions of asteroids consisting of two types of material: basaltic rock and ice. We consider effects like brittle failure, fragmentation, and merging in different impact scenarios.

Larrondo|Miguel Arizmendi|Fereydoon Family	  We present a minimal one-dimensional deterministic continuous dynamical system that exhibits chaotic behavior and complex transport properties. Our model is an overdamped rocking ratchet that is periodically kicked with a delta function potential. We develop an analytical approach that predicts many key features of the system, such as current reversals, as well as the presence of chaotic behavior and bifurcation. We show that our approach can be easily extended to other types of periodic forces, including the square wave.

Alava	  Wood is a multi-scale material exhibiting a complex viscoplastic response. We study avalanches in small wood samples in compression. "Woodquakes" measured by acoustic emission are surprisingly similar to earthquakes and crackling noise in rocks and laboratory tests on brittle materials. Both the distributions of event energies and of waiting (silent) times follow power-laws. The stress- strain response exhibits clear signatures of localization of deformation to "weak spots" or softwood layers, as identified using Digital Image Correlation. Even though material structure-dependent localization takes place, the avalanche behavior remains scale-free.

Pikhitsa|Seungha Shin|Chang Hyuk Kim|Sekwon Jung|Mansoo Choi	  When Mg metal burns in air the resulting rock-salt MgO smoke consists of perfect [100] cubes of about 100 nm. On contrast, we found that intensification of self-burning of Mg micropowder either by injecting it into oxy-hydrogen diffusion flame or under an infrared laser beam switches the growth mechanism producing mostly single-crystalline spheres and terraced nanoparticles. MgO molecule condensation onto primary spherical nanoparticles can account for generation of terraced nanoparticles with regular steps proportional to the nanoparticle size.

Similar, yet conceptually and calculationally more difficult problems have been suggested to improve student proficiency in projectile motion. The problem of determining the maximum distance of a rock thrown from a rotating arm motion is presented and analyzed in detail in this text. The calculational results confirm several conceptually derived conclusions regarding the initial throw position and provide some details on the angles and the way of throwing (underhand or overhand) which produce the maximum throw distance.

Arizmendi	  The relationship between anomalous superdiffusive behavior and particle trapping probability is analyzed on a rocking ratchet potential with spatially correlated weak disorder. The trapping probability allows us to obtain analytical expressions for the number of wells where a given number of particles get trapped. We have also calculated the second-moment of the particle distribution function $C_2$ as a function of time, when the untrapped particle has a constant velocity. We also use the expression for $C_2$ to characterize anomalous superdiffusive motion.

Schoellig	  This work investigates the application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technology for measurement of rock fragmentation without placement of scale objects in the scene to determine image scale. Commonly practiced image-based rock fragmentation analysis requires a technician to walk to a rock pile, place a scale object of known size in the area of interest, and capture individual 2D images. Our previous work has used UAV technology for the first time to acquire real-time rock fragmentation data and has shown comparable quality of results; however, it still required the (potentially dangerous) placement of scale objects, and continued to make the assumption that the rock pile surface is planar and that the scale objects lie on the surface plane. This work improves our UAV-based approach to enable rock fragmentation measurement without placement of scale objects and without the assumption of planarity. This is achieved by first generating a point cloud of the rock pile from 2D images, taking into account intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters, and then taking 2D images for fragmentation analysis. This work represents an important step towards automating post-blast rock fragmentation analysis. In experiments, a rock pile with known size distribution was photographed by the UAV with and without using scale objects. For fragmentation analysis without scale objects, a point cloud of the rock pile was generated and used to compute image scale. Comparison of the rock size distributions show that this point-cloud-based method enables producing measurements with better or comparable accuracy (within 10% of the ground truth) to the manual method with scale objects.

The compressibility and the thermal expansion of the drainage system along with the dead volume of the fluid filling this system, influence the measured pore pressure and volumetric strain during an undrained thermal or mechanical loading in a triaxial cell. The correction methods previously presented by Wissa (1969), Bishop (1976) and Ghabezloo and Sulem (2009) only permit to correct the measured pore pressures during an undrained isotropic compression test or an undrained heating test. An extension of these methods is presented in this paper to correct also the measured volumetric strain and consequently the measured undrained bulk compressibility and undrained thermal expansion coefficients during these tests. Two examples of application of the proposed correction method are presented on the results of an undrained isotropic compression test and an undrained heating test performed on a fluid-saturated granular rock. A parametric study has demonstrated that the porosity and the drained compressibility of the tested material, and the ratio of the volume of the drainage system to the one of the tested sample are the key parameters which influence the most the error induced on the measurements by the drainage system.

Sadowski|Xinyu Liu|Huai-Hsun Lien|Alexander Chaney|Yimo Han|Micheal Cao|Junzhang Ma|Tian Qian|Jerry I. Dadap|Shancai Wang|Malgorzata Dobrowolska|Jacek Furdyna|David A. Muller|Karsten Pohl|Hong Ding|Huili Grace Xing|Richard M. Osgood, Jr	  Topological crystalline insulators have been recently predicted and observed in rock-salt structure SnSe $\{111\}$ thin films. Previous studies have suggested that the Se-terminated surface of this thin film with hydrogen passivation, has a reduced surface energy and is thus a preferred configuration. In this paper, synchrotron-based angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, along with density functional theory calculations, are used to demonstrate conclusively that a rock-salt SnSe $\{111\}$ thin film epitaxially-grown on \ce{Bi2Se3} has a stable Sn-terminated surface. These observations are supported by low energy electron diffraction (LEED) intensity-voltage measurements and dynamical LEED calculations, which further show that the Sn-terminated SnSe $\{111\}$ thin film has undergone a surface structural relaxation of the interlayer spacing between the Sn and Se atomic planes. In sharp contrast to the Se-terminated counterpart, the observed Dirac surface state in the Sn-terminated SnSe $\{111\}$ thin film is shown to yield a high Fermi velocity, $0.50\times10^6$m/s, which suggests a potential mechanism of engineering the Dirac surface state of topological materials by tuning the surface configuration.

The familiar rocking motion of these objects, a non-linear combination of a rigid rotation and a translation of the center of mass, gives rise to a number of interesting dynamical properties. However, their study has received little attention in the literature.   This work presents a comprehensive introduction to the dynamics of rocking rigid bodies, including a concise derivation of the equations of motion as well as a general inversion procedure to construct rocking rigid body shapes with specified dynamical properties. Moreover, two novel rigid body shapes are derived - the tautochrone shape and the brachistochrone shape - which represent an intriguing generalization of the well-know tautochrone and brachistochrone curves. In particular, tautochrone shapes offer an alternative construction of a tautochrone pendulum, in addition to Huygens' cycloid pendulum solution.

Two types of rocking walls namely stepping rocking wall and pinned rocking wall are presented and analyzed. For each case, full nonlinear equations of motions are calculated. The dynamic behavior of the systems shows mixed results in suppressing the dynamic response of the elastic oscillator. Through comprehensive analysis, pinned rocking wall amplifies the displacement along wide range of the spectrum, in the other hand, stepping rocking wall is the most effective especially in relatively flexible structures and with a heavier wall. This is mainly because of the pinned wall's mass works against its stability. In this study, a simple, oscillator-rocking-wall model is defined and analyzed using OpenSees and, the results from OpenSees shows a good agreement with equation of motion solution using MATLAB.

Shaviv	  Cosmic ray bursts (CRBs) from mergers or accretion induced collapse of neutron stars that hit an Earth-like planet closer than $\sim 1 kpc$ from the explosion produce lethal fluxes of atmospheric muons at ground level, underground and underwater. These CRBs also destroy the ozone layer and radioactivate the environment. The mean rate of such life devastating CRBs is one in 100 million years (Myr), consistent with the observed 5 ``great'' extinctions in the past 600 Myr. Unlike the previously suggested extraterrestrial extinction mechanisms the CRBs explain massive life extinction on the ground, underground and underwater and the higher survival levels of radiation resistant species and of terrain sheltered species. More distant mergers can cause smaller extinctions. Biological mutations caused by ionizing radiation produced by the CRB may explain a fast appearance of new species after mass extinctions. The CRB extinction predicts detectable enrichment of rock layers which formed during the extinction periods with cosmogenically produced radioactive nucleides such as $^{129}$I, $^{146}$Sm, $^{205}$Pb with and $^{244}$Pu. Tracks of high energy particles in rock layers on Earth and on the moon may also contain records of intense CRBs. An early warning of future extinctions due to neutron star mergers can be obtained by identifying, mapping and timing all the nearby binary neutron stars systems. A final warning of an approaching CRB from a nearby neutron stars merger will be provided by a gamma ray burst a few days before the arrival of the CRB.

Extensive numerical simulation of an inertial rocked ratchet displays that two quantifiers, namely the energetic efficiency and the P\'eclet number (or equivalently the Fano factor), suffice to determine the regimes of optimal transport. The effective diffusion of this rocked inertial Brownian motor can be expressed as a generalized fluctuation theorem of the Green -- Kubo type.   Addendum and Erratum   The expression for the effective diffusion of an inertial, periodically driven Brownian particle in an asymmetric, periodic potential is compared with the step number diffusion which is extracted from the corresponding coarse grained hopping process specifying the number of covered spatial periods within each temporal period. The two expressions are typically different and involve the correlations between the number of hops.

Intriguing examples are provided by cyclic competition of species, as metaphorically described by the `rock-paper-scissors' game. Both experimentally and theoretically, such non-transitive interactions have been found to induce self-organization of static individuals into noisy, irregular clusters. However, a profound understanding and characterization of such patterns is still lacking. Here, we theoretically investigate the influence of individuals' mobility on the spatial structures emerging in rock-paper-scissors games. We devise a quantitative approach to analyze the spatial patterns self-forming in the course of the stochastic time evolution. For a paradigmatic model originally introduced by May and Leonard, within an interacting particle approach, we demonstrate that the system's behavior - in the proper continuum limit - is aptly captured by a set of stochastic partial differential equations. The system's stochastic dynamics is shown to lead to the emergence of entangled rotating spiral waves. While the spirals' wavelength and spreading velocity is demonstrated to be accurately predicted by a (deterministic) complex Ginzburg-Landau equation, their entanglement results from the inherent stochastic nature of the system.These findings and our methods have important applications for understanding the formation of noisy patterns, e.g., in ecological and evolutionary contexts, and are also of relevance for the kinetics of (bio)-chemical reactions. 	
0808.4084v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/0808.4084v1	2008	Effective stress law for the permeability of a limestone	Siavash Ghabezloo|Jean Sulem|Sylvine Guédon|François Martineau	  The effective stress law for the permeability of a limestone is studied experimentally by performing constant head permeability tests in a triaxial cell with different conditions of confining pressure and pore pressure. Test results have shown that a pore pressure increase and a confining pressure decrease both result in an increase of the permeability, and that the effect of the pore pressure change on the variation of the permeability is more important than the effect of a change of the confining pressure. A power law is proposed for the variation of the permeability with the effective stress. The permeability effective stress coefficient increases linearly with the differential pressure and is greater than one as soon the differential pressure exceeds few bars. The test results are well reproduced using the proposed permeability-effective stress law. A conceptual pore-shell model based on a detailed observation of the microstructure of the studied limestone is proposed. This model is able to explain the experimental observations on the effect of the total stress and of the pore pressure on the permeability of the limestone. Effective stress coefficients for the stress-dependent permeability which are greater than one are obtained. It is shown that the controlling factor is the ratio of the different bulk moduli of the various constituents of the rock. This ratio is studied experimentally by performing microhardness tests. 	
1003.1244v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1003.1244v1	2010	Subdiffusive Brownian ratchets rocked by a periodic force	Igor Goychuk	  This work puts forward a generalization of the well-known rocking Markovian Brownian ratchets to the realm of antipersistent non-Markovian subdiffusion in viscoelastic media. A periodically forced subdiffusion in a parity-broken ratchet potential is considered within the non-Markovian generalized Langevin equation (GLE) description with a power-law memory kernel $\eta(t)\propto t^{-\alpha}$ ($0<\alpha<1$). It is shown that subdiffusive rectification currents, defined through the mean displacement and subvelocity $v_{\alpha}$, $<\delta x(t)>\sim v_{\alpha} t^{\alpha}/ \Gamma(1+\alpha)$, emerge asymptotically due to the breaking of the detailed balance symmetry by driving. The asymptotic exponent is $\alpha$, the same as for free subdiffusion, $<\delta x^2(t)>\propto t^\alpha$.   However, a transient to this regime with some time-dependent $\alpha_{\rm eff}(t)$ gradually decaying in time, $\alpha\leq \alpha_{\rm eff}(t)\leq 1$, can be very slow depending on the barrier height and the driving field strength. In striking contrast to its normal diffusion counterpart, the anomalous rectification current is absent asymptotically in the limit of adiabatic driving with frequency $\Omega\to 0$, displaying a resonance like dependence on the driving frequency. However, an anomalous current inversion occurs for a sufficiently fast driving, like in the normal diffusion case. In the lowest order of the driving field, such a rectification current presents a quadratic response effect. Beyond perturbation regime it exhibits a broad maximum versus the driving field strength. Moreover, anomalous current exhibits a maximum versus the potential amplitude. 	
1108.1790v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1108.1790v1	2011	Effects of competition on pattern formation in the rock-paper-scissors   game	Luo-Luo Jiang|Tao Zhou|Matjaz Perc|Bing-Hong Wang	  We investigate the impact of cyclic competition on pattern formation in the rock-paper-scissors game. By separately considering random and prepared initial conditions, we observe a critical influence of the competition rate $p$ on the stability of spiral waves and on the emergence of biodiversity. In particular, while increasing values of $p$ promote biodiversity, they may act detrimental on spatial pattern formation. For random initial conditions, we observe a phase transition from biodiversity to an absorbing phase, whereby the critical value of mobility grows linearly with increasing values of $p$ on a log-log scale, but then saturates as $p$ becomes large. For prepared initial conditions, we observe the formation of single-armed spirals, but only for values of $p$ that are below a critical value. Once above, the spirals break up and form disordered spatial structures, mainly because of the percolation of vacant sites. Thus, there exists a critical value of the competition rate $p_{c}$ for stable single-armed spirals in finite populations. Importantly though, $p_{c}$ increases with increasing system size, because noise reinforces the disintegration of ordered patterns. In addition, we also find that $p_{c}$ increases with the mobility. These phenomena are reproduced by a deterministic model that is based on nonlinear partial differential equations. Our findings indicate that competition is vital for the sustenance of biodiversity and emergence of pattern formation in ecosystems governed by cyclical interactions. 	
1305.1582v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1305.1582v1	2013	The scattering map in two coupled piecewise-smooth systems, with   numerical application to rocking blocks	A. Granados|S. J. Hogan|T. M. Seara	  We consider a non-autonomous dynamical system formed by coupling two piecewise-smooth systems in $\RR^2$ through a non-autonomous periodic perturbation. We study the dynamics around one of the heteroclinic orbits of one of the piecewise-smooth systems. In the unperturbed case, the system possesses two $C^0$ normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds of dimension two with a couple of three dimensional heteroclinic manifolds between them. These heteroclinic manifolds are foliated by heteroclinic connections between $C^0$ tori located at the same energy levels. By means of the {\em impact map} we prove the persistence of these objects under perturbation. In addition, we provide sufficient conditions of the existence of transversal heteroclinic intersections through the existence of simple zeros of Melnikov-like functions. The heteroclinic manifolds allow us to define the {\em scattering map}, which links asymptotic dynamics in the invariant manifolds through heteroclinic connections. First order properties of this map provide sufficient conditions for the asymptotic dynamics to be located in different energy levels in the perturbed invariant manifolds. Hence we have an essential tool for the construction of a heteroclinic skeleton which, when followed, can lead to the existence of Arnol'd diffusion: trajectories that, on large time scales, destabilize the system by further accumulating energy. We validate all the theoretical results with detailed numerical computations of a mechanical system with impacts, formed by the linkage of two rocking blocks with a spring.

Quintero|Renato Alvarez-Nodarse	  Ratchets are devices able to rectify an otherwise oscillatory behavior by exploiting an asymmetry of the system. In rocking ratchets the asymmetry is induced through a proper choice of external forces and modulations of nonlinear symmetric potentials. The ratchet currents thus obtained in systems as different as semiconductors, Josephson junctions, optical lattices, or ferrofluids, show a set of universal features. A satisfactory explanation for them has challenged theorist for decades, and so far we still lack a general theory of this phenomenon. Here we provide such a theory by exploring ---through functional analysis--- the constraints that the simple assumption of time-shift invariance of the ratchet current imposes on its dependence on the external drivings. Because the derivation is based on so general a principle, the resulting expression is valid irrespective of the details and the nature of the physical systems to which it is applied, and of whether they are classical, quantum, or stochastic. The theory also explains deviations observed from universality under special conditions, and allows to make predictions of phenomena not yet observed in any experiment or simulation.

Ivanov|Samuel W. Kingman	  Microwave energy has been demonstrated to be beneficial for reducing the energetic cost of several steps of the mining process. Significant literature has been developed about this topic but few studies are focused on understanding the interaction between microwaves and minerals at a fundamental level in order to elucidate the underlying physical processes that control the observed phenomena. This is ascribed to the complexity of such phenomena, related to chemical and physical transformations, where electrical, thermal and mechanical forces play concurrent roles. In this work a new characterization method for the dielectric properties of mineral samples at microwave frequencies is presented. The method is based upon the scanning microwave microscopy technique that enables measurement of the dielectric constant, loss factor and conductivity with extremely high spatial resolution and accuracy. As opposed to conventional bulk dielectric techniques, the scanning microwave microscope can then access and measure the dielectric properties of micrometer-sized mineral inclusions within a complex structure of natural rock. In this work a 5 by 20 micrometers size hematite inclusion has been characterized at a microwave frequency of 3 GHz. Scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy and confocal micro Raman spectroscopy were used to determine the structural details and chemical and elemental composition of mineral sample on similar scale. 	
1309.6749v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.6749v1	2013	Subdiffusive rocking ratchets in viscoelastic media: transport   optimization and thermodynamic efficiency in overdamped regime	Vasyl O. Kharchenko|I. Goychuk	  We study subdiffusive overdamped Brownian ratchets periodically rocked by an external zero-mean force in viscoelastic media within the framework of non-Markovian Generalized Langevin equation (GLE) approach and associated multi-dimensional Markovian embedding dynamics. Viscoelastic deformations of the medium caused by the transport particle are modeled by a set of auxiliary Brownian quasi-particles elastically coupled to the transport particle and characterized by a hierarchy of relaxation times which obey a fractal scaling. The most slowly relaxing deformations which cannot immediately follow to the moving particle imprint long-range memory about its previous positions and cause subdiffusion and anomalous transport on a sufficiently long time scale. This anomalous behavior is combined with normal diffusion and transport on an initial time scale of overdamped motion. Anomalously slow directed transport in a periodic ratchet potential with broken space inversion symmetry emerges due to a violation of the thermal detailed balance by a zero-mean periodic driving and is optimized with frequency of driving, its amplitude, and temperature. Such optimized anomalous transport can be low dispersive and characterized by a large generalized Peclet number. Moreover, we show that overdamped subdiffusive ratchets can sustain a substantial load and do a useful work. The corresponding thermodynamic efficiency decays algebraically in time since the useful work done against a load scales sublinearly with time following to the transport particle position, but the energy pumped by an external force scales with time linearly. Nevertheless, it can be transiently appreciably high and compare well with the thermodynamical efficiency of the normal diffusion overdamped ratchets on sufficiently long temporal and spatial scales.

Two possible approaches are considered: 1) the spectral decomposition of the stiffness tensor to define the microplane constitutive laws in terms of energetically orthogonal eigenstrains and eigenstresses; and 2) the definition of orientation-dependent microplane elastic moduli. It is shown that the first approach provides a rigorous way to tackle anisotropy within the microplane framework whereas the second approach represents an approximation which, however, makes the formulation of nonlinear constitutive equations much simpler. The efficacy of the second approach in modeling the macroscopic elastic behavior is compared to the thermodynamic restrictions of the anisotropic parameters showing that a significant range of elastic properties can be modeled with excellent accuracy. Further, it is shown that it provides a very good approximation of the microplane stresses provided by the first approach, with the advantage of a simpler formulation.   It is concluded that the spectral stiffness decomposition represents the best approach in such cases as for modeling unidirectional composites, in which accurately capturing the elastic behavior is important. The introduction of orientation-dependent microplane elastic moduli provides a simpler framework for the modeling of transversely isotropic materials with remarked inelastic behavior, as in the case, for example, of shale rock.

Stock	  Social dilemmas concern a natural conflict between cooperation and self interests among individuals in large populations. The emergence of cooperation and its maintenance is the key for the understanding of fundamental concepts about the evolution of species. In order to understand the mechanisms involved in this framework, here we study the Optional Public Good Games with focus on the effects of diffusive aspects in the emergent patterns of cyclic dominance between the strategies. Differently from other works, we showed that rock-paper-scissors (RPS) patterns occur by introducing a simple kind of random mobility in a lattice sparsely occupied. Such pattern has been revealed to be very important in the conservation of the species in ecological and social environments. The goal of this paper is to show that we do not need more elaborated schemes for construction of the neighbourhood in the game to observe RPS patterns as suggested in the literature. As an interesting additional result, in this contribution we also propose an alternative method to quantify the RPS density in a quantitative context of the game theory which becomes possible to perform a finite size scaling study. Such approach can be very interesting to be applied in other games generically.

Revealed by spindle rocking, these pulling forces are regulated by the force generator dynamics, which are related to mitosis progression. This may be combined with a second regulation, this one by the posterior spindle pole position, which can be seen when comparing related species. Results: After delaying anaphase onset, we identified a positional pulling force regulation in C. elegans, which we ascribed to microtubule dynamics at the cortex. Indeed, in mapping the contacts we found a correlation between the centrosome-cortex distance and the microtubule contact density. This density in turn modulates pulling force generator activity. We expanded our model of spindle rocking and predicted then experimentally validated that the oscillation onset position resists changes in cellular geometry and number of force generators. Consistent with final spindle position measurements, this new model accounts for a lower dependence on force generator dynamics and quantities than predicted by the previous model. Conclusion: The spindle position regulates the rapid increase in forces needed for anaphase oscillation and positioning through the spatial modulation of microtubule-cortex contacts. This regulation superimposes that of force generator processivity, putatively linked to the cell cycle. This novel control confers resistance to variations in zygote geometry and dynamics of cortical force generators. Interestingly, this robustness originates in cell mechanics rather than biochemical networks.

We review a unifying theory for a solid-state mechanism, based on decades of research bridging semi-conductor physics, chemistry and rock physics. A synthesis has emerged that all pre-earthquake phenomena could trace back to one fundamental physical process: the activation of electronic charges (electrons and positive holes) in rocks subjected to ever-increasing tectonic stresses prior to any major seismic activity, via the rupture of peroxy bonds. In the second part of the review, we critically examine satellite and ground station data, recorded before past large earthquakes, as they have been claimed to provide evidence that precursory signals tend to become measurable days, sometimes weeks before the disasters. We review some of the various phenomena that can be directly predicted by the peroxy defect theory , namely, radon gas emanations, corona discharges, thermal infrared emissions, air ionization, ion and electron content in the ionosphere, and electro-magnetic anomalies. Our analysis demonstrates the need for further systematic investigations, in particular with strong continuous statistical testing of the relevance and confidence of the precursors. Only then, the scientific community will be able to assess and improve the performance of earthquake forecasts.

Currently, the driving force behind these modes is a mystery; the measured amplitudes are many orders of magnitude larger than anticipated based on theory analogous to heliosiesmology (that is, turbulent convection as a source of stochastic excitation). One of the most promising hypotheses is that these modes are driven by Jovian storms. This work constructs a framework to analytically model the expected equilibrium normal mode amplitudes arising from convective columns in storms. We also place rough constraints on Jupiter's seismic modal quality factor. Using this model, neither meteor strikes, turbulent convection, nor water storms can feasibly excite the order of magnitude of observed amplitudes. Next we speculate about the potential role of rock storms deeper in Jupiter's atmosphere, because the rock storms' expected energy scales make them promising candidates to be the chief source of excitation for Jovian seismic modes, based on simple scaling arguments. We also suggest some general trends in the expected partition of energy between different frequency modes. Finally we supply some commentary on potential applications to gravity, Juno, Cassini and Saturn, and future missions to Uranus and Neptune.

Tipper|Nengxiong Xu	  Google Earth (GE) has become a powerful tool for geological modeling and visualization. An interesting and useful feature of GE, Google Street View, can allow the GE users to view geological structure such as layers of rock masses at a field site. In this paper, we introduce a practical solution for building 3D geological models for rock masses based on the data acquired by use with GE. A real study case at Haut-Barr, France is presented to demonstrate our solution. We first locate the position of Haut-Barr in GE, and then determine the shape and scale of the rock masses in the study area, and thirdly acquire the layout of layers of rock masses in the Google Street View, and finally create the approximate 3D geological models by extruding and intersecting. The generated 3D geological models can simply reflect the basic structure of the rock masses at Haut-Barr, and can be used for visualizing the rock bodies interactively.

Salusti|R. Droghei|R. Garra	  We here analyze the propagation of transients of fluid-rock temperature and pressure through a thin boundary layer, where a steady trend is present, between two adjacent homogeneous rocks. We focus on the effect of convection on transients crossing such thin layer. In comparison with early models where this boundary was assumed a sharp mathematical plane separating the two rocks, here we show a realistic analysis of such boundary layer that implies a novel nonlinear model. Its solutions describe large amplitude, quick and sharp transients characterized by a novel drift and variations of the signal amplitude, leading to a nonlinear wave propagation. Possible applications are in volcanic, hydrologic, hydrothermal systems as well as for deep oil drilling. In addition, this formalism could easily be generalized for the case of a signal arriving in a rock characterized by a steady trend of pressure and/or temperature. These effects, being proportional to the initial conditions, can also give velocity variations not particularly important. A further heuristic model has therefore been analyzed, i.e. assuming a pressure dependent rock permeability. In this way, a remarkable increase of the system velocities is obtained.

Canup	  Saturn's rings are rock-poor, containing 90%-95% ice by mass. As a group, Saturn's moons interior to and including Tethys are also about 90% ice. Tethys itself contains <6% rock by mass, in contrast to its similar-mass outer neighbor Dione, which contains >40% rock. Here we simulate the evolution of a massive primordial ice-rich ring and the production of satellites as ring material spreads beyond the Roche limit. We describe the Roche-interior ring with an analytic model, and use an N-body code to describe material beyond the Roche limit. We track the accretion and interactions of spawned satellites, including tidal interaction with the planet, assuming a tidal dissipation factor for Saturn of $Q~10^4$. We find that ring torques and capture of moons into mutual resonances produce a system of ice-rich inner moons that extends outward to approximately Tethys's orbit in $10^9$ years, even with relatively slow orbital expansion due to tides. The resulting mass and semimajor axis distribution of spawned moons resembles that of Mimas, Enceladus, and Tethys. We estimate the mass of rock delivered to the moons by external cometary impactors during a late heavy bombardment. We find that the inner moons receive a mass in rock comparable to their current total rock content, while Dione and Rhea receive an order-of-magnitude less rock than their current rock content. This suggests that external ontamination may have been the primary source of rock in the inner moons, and that Dione and Rhea formed from much more rock-rich source material. Reproducing the distribution of rock among the current inner moons is challenging, and appears to require large impactors stochasticity and/or the presence of some rock in the initial ring. 	
0901.1907v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/0901.1907v1	2009	The mechanisms of spatial and temporal earthquake clustering	E. A. Jagla|A. B. Kolton	  The number of earthquakes as a function of magnitude decays as a power law. This trend is usually justified using spring-block models, where slips with the appropriate global statistics have been numerically observed. However, prominent spatial and temporal clustering features of earthquakes are not reproduced by this kind of modeling. We show that when a spring-block model is complemented with a mechanism allowing for structural relaxation, realistic earthquake patterns are obtained. The proposed model does not need to include a phenomenological velocity weakening friction law, as traditional spring-block models do, since this behavior is effectively induced by the relaxational mechanism as well. In this way, the model provides also a simple microscopic basis for the widely used phenomenological rate-and-state equations of rock friction.

Hari Dass	  The superposition principle forms the very backbone of quantum theory. The resulting linear structure of quantum theory is structurally so rigid that tampering with it may have serious, seemingly unphysical, consequences. This principle has been succesful at even the highest available accelerator energies. Is this aspect of quantum theory forever then? The present work is an attempt to understand the attitude of the founding fathers, particularly of Bohr and Dirac, towards this principle. The Heisenberg matrix mechanics on the one hand, and the Schrodinger wave mechanics on the other, are critically examined to shed light as to how this principle entered the very foundations of quantum theory. 	
1508.07082v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.07082v1	2015	Does a dissolution-precipitation mechanism explain concrete creep in   moist environments?	Isabella Pignatelli|Aditya Kumar|Rouhollah Alizadeh|Yann Le Pape|Mathieu Bauchy|Gaurav Sant	  Long-term creep (i.e., deformation under sustained load) is a significant material response that needs to be accounted for in concrete structural design. However, the nature and origin of creep remains poorly understood, and controversial. Here, we propose that concrete creep at RH (relative humidity) > 50%, but fixed moisture-contents (i.e., basic creep), arises from a dissolution-precipitation mechanism, active at nanoscale grain contacts, as is often observed in a geological context, e.g., when rocks are exposed to sustained loads, in moist environments. Based on micro-indentation and vertical scanning interferometry experiments, and molecular dynamics simulations carried out on calcium-silicate-hydrates (C-S-H's), the major binding phase in concrete, of different compositions, we show that creep rates are well correlated to dissolution rates - an observation which supports the dissolution-precipitation mechanism as the origin of concrete creep. C-S-H compositions featuring high resistance to dissolution, and hence creep are identified - analysis of which, using topological constraint theory, indicates that these compositions present limited relaxation modes on account of their optimally connected (i.e., constrained) atomic networks. 	
1211.4656v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1211.4656v1	2012	A mathematical framework for inverse wave problems in heterogeneous   media	Kirk D. Blazek|Christiaan C. Stolk|William W. Symes	  This paper provides a theoretical foundation for some common formulations of inverse problems in wave propagation, based on hyperbolic systems of linear integro-differential equations with bounded and measurable coefficients. The coefficients of these time-dependent partial differential equations respresent parametrically the spatially varying mechanical properties of materials. Rocks, manufactured materials, and other wave propagation environments often exhibit spatial heterogeneity in mechanical properties at a wide variety of scales, and coefficient functions representing these properties must mimic this heterogeneity. We show how to choose domains (classes of nonsmooth coefficient functions) and data definitions (traces of weak solutions) so that optimization formulations of inverse wave problems satisfy some of the prerequisites for application of Newton's method and its relatives. These results follow from the properties of a class of abstract first-order evolution systems, of which various physical wave systems appear as concrete instances. Finite speed of propagation for linear waves with bounded, measurable mechanical parameter fields is one of the by-products of this theory.

Arenzon	  Predators may attack isolated or grouped prey in a cooperative, collective way. Whether a gregarious behavior is advantageous to each species depends on several conditions and game theory is a useful tool to deal with such a problem. We here extend the Lett-Auger-Gaillard model [Theor. Pop. Biol. 65 (2004) 263] to spatially distributed populations and compare the resulting behavior with their mean-field predictions for the coevolving densities of predator and prey strategies. Besides its richer behavior in the presence of spatial organization, we also show that the coexistence phase in which collective and individual strategies for each group are present is stable because of an effective, cyclic dominance mechanism similar to a well-studied generalization of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game with four species, a further example of how ubiquitous this coexistence mechanism is.

Turner	  Consider representation theory associated to symmetric groups, or to Hecke algebras in type A, or to q-Schur algebras, or to finite general linear groups in non-describing characteristic. Rock blocks are certain combinatorially defined blocks appearing in such a representation theory, first observed by R. Rouquier. Rock blocks are much more symmetric than general blocks, and every block is derived equivalent to a Rock block. Motivated by a theorem of J. Chuang and R. Kessar in the case of symmetric group blocks of abelian defect, we pursue a structure theorem for these blocks.

The response of the indentation curve is studied for various values of the size of the indentor as compared to the internal length of the rock in order to assess the scale effect.

Arzola|Karen Volke-Sepúlveda|José L. Mateos	  We present an experimental demonstration of a deterministic optical rocking ratchet. A periodic and asymmetric light pattern is created to interact with dielectric microparticles in water, giving rise to a ratchet potential. The sample is moved with respect to the pattern with an unbiased time-periodic rocking function, which tilts the potential in alternating opposite directions. We obtain a current of particles whose direction can be controlled in real time and show that particles of different sizes may experience opposite currents. Moreover, we observed current reversals as a function of the magnitude and period of the rocking force.

Schoellig	  In recent years, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technology has been introduced into the mining industry to conduct terrain surveying. This work investigates the application of UAVs with artificial lighting for measurement of rock fragmentation under poor lighting conditions, representing night shifts in surface mines or working conditions in underground mines. The study relies on indoor and outdoor experiments for rock fragmentation analysis using a quadrotor UAV. Comparison of the rock size distributions in both cases show that adequate artificial lighting enables similar accuracy to ideal lighting conditions.

Täuber	  Spatially extended population dynamics models that incorporate intrinsic noise serve as case studies for the role of fluctuations and correlations in biological systems. Including spatial structure and stochastic noise in predator-prey competition invalidates the deterministic Lotka-Volterra picture of neutral population cycles. Stochastic models yield long-lived erratic population oscillations stemming from a resonant amplification mechanism. In spatially extended predator-prey systems, one observes noise-stabilized activity and persistent correlations. Fluctuation-induced renormalizations of the oscillation parameters can be analyzed perturbatively. The critical dynamics and the non-equilibrium relaxation kinetics at the predator extinction threshold are characterized by the directed percolation universality class. Spatial or environmental variability results in more localized patches which enhances both species densities. Affixing variable rates to individual particles and allowing for trait inheritance subject to mutations induces fast evolutionary dynamics for the rate distributions. Stochastic spatial variants of cyclic competition with rock-paper-scissors interactions illustrate connections between population dynamics and evolutionary game theory, and demonstrate how space can help maintain diversity. In two dimensions, three-species cyclic competition models of the May-Leonard type are characterized by the emergence of spiral patterns whose properties are elucidated by a mapping onto a complex Ginzburg-Landau equation. Extensions to general food networks can be classified on the mean-field level, which provides both a fundamental understanding of ensuing cooperativity and emergence of alliances. Novel space-time patterns emerge as a result of the formation of competing alliances, such as coarsening domains that each incorporate rock-paper-scissors competition games.

Sometimes this behaviour is triggered in life-threatening situations such as fires in crowded buildings; at other times, stampedes can arise from the rush for seats or seemingly without causes. Tragic examples within recent months include the panics in Harare, Zimbabwe, and at the Roskilde rock concert in Denmark. Although engineers are finding ways to alleviate the scale of such disasters, their frequency seems to be increasing with the number and size of mass events. Yet, systematic studies of panic behaviour, and quantitative theories capable of predicting such crowd dynamics, are rare. Here we show that simulations based on a model of pedestrian behaviour can provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of and preconditions for panic and jamming by incoordination. Our results suggest practical ways of minimising the harmful consequences of such events and the existence of an optimal escape strategy, corresponding to a suitable mixture of individualistic and collective behaviour.

Ehm|M. Hytha|B. Winkler|W. Depmeier	  The high-pressure behaviour of PbS was investigated by angular dispersive X-ray powder diffraction up to pressures of 6.8 GPa. Experiments were accompanied by first principles calculations at the density functional theory level. By combining both methods reliable data for the elastic properties of rock-salt type alpha- and high-pressure beta-PbS could be obtained. beta-PbS could be determined to crystallise in the CrB-type (B33), with space group Cmcm. The reversible ferro-elastic alpha/beta transition is of first order. It is accompanied by a large volume discontinuity of about 5% and a coexistence region of the two phases. A gliding mechanism of {001} bilayers along one of the cubic <110>-directions governs the phase transition which can be described in terms of group/subgroup relationships via a common subgroup, despite its reconstructive character. The quadrupling of the primitive unit cell indicates a wave vector (0,0,pi/a) on the Delta-line of the Brillouin zone.

Kerr, M. A. Riley, M. W. Feldman and B. J. M. Bohannan [Nature {\bf 418}, 171 (2002)] and B. Kirkup and M. A. Riley [Nature {\bf 428}, 412 (2004)]. Through analytical methods supported by numerical simulations, we address this issue by studying the properties of a paradigmatic non-spatial three-species stochastic system, namely the `rock-paper-scissors' or cyclic Lotka-Volterra model. While the deterministic approach (rate equations) predicts the coexistence of the species resulting in regular (yet neutrally stable) oscillations of the population densities, we demonstrate that fluctuations arising in the system with a \emph{finite number of agents} drastically alter this picture and are responsible for extinction: After long enough time, two of the three species die out. As main findings we provide analytic estimates and numerical computation of the extinction probability at a given time. We also discuss the implications of our results for a broad class of competing population systems.

The variations of the average crack velocity with the external loading are measured for a brittle rock and are shown to display two distinct regimes: Below a given threshold Gc, the crack velocity is well described by an exponential law v ~ exp^{-(C/(G-(Gamma))} characteristic of subcritical propagation, while for larger values of the driving force G > Gc, the velocity evolves as a power law v ~ (G - G_c)^theta with theta = 0.80 $\pm$ 0.15. These results can be explained extending the continuum theory of Fracture Mechanics to disordered systems. In this description, the motion of a crack is analogue to the one of an elastic line driven in a random medium and critical failure occurs when the loading is sufficiently large to depinne the crack front from the heterogeneities of the material.

Disruption, through high velocity collisions or rotational spin-up, is believed to be the primary mechanism for the production and destruction of small asteroids and a contributor to dust in the Sun's Zodiacal cloud, while analogous collisions around other stars feed dust to their debris disks. Unfortunately, direct evidence about the mechanism or rate of disruption is lacking, owing to the rarity of events. Here we present observations of P/2010 A2, a previously unknown inner-belt asteroid with a peculiar, comet-like morphology that is most likely the evolving remnant of a recent asteroidal disruption. High resolution Hubble Space Telescope observations reveal an approximately 120 meter diameter nucleus with an associated tail of millimeter-sized dust particles formed in February/March 2009, all evolving slowly under the action of solar radiation pressure.

The compressibility and the thermal expansion of the drainage system along with the dead volume of the fluid filling this system, influence the measured pore pressure and volumetric strain during undrained thermal or mechanical loading in a triaxial cell. A correction method is presented in this paper to correct these effects during an undrained isotropic compression test or an undrained heating test. A parametric study has demonstrated that the porosity and the drained compressibility of the tested material and the ratio of the vol-ume of the drainage system to the one of the tested sample are the key parameters which influence the most the error induced on the measurements by the drainage system.

Both signals display an irregular burst-like dynamics, with power-law distributed fluctuations spanning a broad range of scales. Yet, the elastic power released at each time step is proportional to the global velocity all along the process, which enables defining a material-constant fracture energy. We characterize the intermittent dynamics by computing the burst statistics. This latter displays the scale-free features signature of crackling dynamics, in qualitative but not quantitative agreement with the depinning interface models derived for fracture problems. The possible sources of discrepancies are pointed out and discussed.

This material has a geometry similar to a wet packing of beads, but with an additional control over the elasticity of the bonds holding the particles together. We show that its mechanical response can be varied over several orders of magnitude by adjusting the size and stiffness of the bridges, and the size of the particles. We also investigate its mechanism of failure under unconfined uniaxial compression in combination with in situ x-ray microtomography. We show that a broad linear-elastic regime ends at a limiting strain of about 8%, whatever the stiffness of the agglomerate, which corresponds to the beginning of shear failure. The possibility to finely tune the stiffness, size and shape of this simple material makes it an ideal model system for investigations on, for example, fracturing of porous rocks, seismology, or root growth in cohesive porous media.

Mayer	  Build-up of relatively young ($<\sim$3.6 Ga) deltas and alluvial fans on Mars required lakes to persist for $>$3 Kyr (assuming dilute flow), but the watersheds' little-weathered soils indicate a climate history that was $>$99% dry. The lake-forming climates' trigger mechanism remains unknown. Here we show that these intermittency constraints, while inconsistent with many previously-proposed triggers for lake-forming climates, are consistent with a novel CH$_4$-burst mechanism. Chaotic transitions in mean obliquity drive latitudinal shifts in temperature and ice loading that destabilize CH$_4$ clathrate. For past clathrate hydrate stability zone occupancy fractions $>\sim$0.2, we show that CH$_4$($\pm$C$_2$H$_6$) builds up to levels whose radiative forcing ($>$15 W/m$^2$, plus feedbacks) is sufficient to modulate lake-forming climates. Such occupancy fractions are consistent with CH$_4$+C$_2$H$_6$ production by $>$3 Ga water-rock reactions. Sub-lake CH$_4$ destabilization provides positive feedback. UV-limited CH$_4$ photolysis curtails individual lake-forming climates to $<$10$^6$ yr duration, consistent with data. Our results show how a warmer early Mars can undergo intermittent excursions to a warm, wet climate state.

Walsworth	  In this work we present measurements of permeability, effective porosity and tortuosity on a variety of rock samples using NMR/MRI of thermal and laser-polarized gas. Permeability and effective porosity are measured simultaneously using MRI to monitor the inflow of laser-polarized xenon into the rock core. Tortuosity is determined from measurements of the time-dependent diffusion coefficient using thermal xenon in sealed samples. The initial results from a limited number of rocks indicate inverse correlations between tortuosity and both effective porosity and permeability. Further studies to widen the number of types of rocks studied may eventually aid in explaining the poorly understood connection between permeability and tortuosity of rock cores.

Rawal|Bijan Nikouravan	  Considering effects of tidal plus centrifugal stress acting on icy-rocks and the tensile strength thereof, icy-rocks being in the density range (1-2.4) g cm-3 which had come into existence as collisional ejecta (debris) in the vicinity of Pluto at the time when Pluto-Charon system came into being as a result of a giant impact of a Kuiper Belt Object on the primordial Pluto, it is shown, here, that these rocks going around Pluto in its vicinity are under slow disruption generating a stable ring structure consisting of icy-rocks of diameters in the range (20-90) km, together with fine dust and particles disrupted off the rocks, and spread all over the regions in their respective Roche Zones, various Roche radii being in ~1/2 three-body mean motion resonance. Calculations of gravitational spheres of influence of Pluto which turns out to be 4.2 x 106 km for prograde orbits and 8.5 x 106 km for retrograde orbits together with the existence of Kuiper Belt in the vicinity of Pluto assure that there may exist a few rocks (satellites)/dust rings/sheets so far undiscovered moving in prograde orbits around the planet and few others which are distant ones and move around Pluto in the region between 4.2x106 km and 8.5x106 km in retrograde orbits.

We have considered a two dimensional case of a rock in the form of a lattice structure. The fiber bundle model is used for modelling the $2-D$ rock. Each lattice site is considered to be a fiber which has a breaking threshold. Fractures in this system will be of the form a cluster of sites and the length is defined as the number of sites belonging to a single cluster. We introduce fractures in the system initially and apply load until the rock breaks. The breaking of a rock is characterized by a horizontal fracture which connects the left side of the lattice to the right side. The length distribution and the strength of such systems have been measured.

Lund|E. F. Sønstebø|S. Roy	  Fracturing in reservoir rocks is an important issue for the petroleum industry - as productivity can be enhanced by a controlled fracturing operation. Fracturing also has a big impact on CO2 storage, geothermal installation and gas production at and from the reservoir rocks. Therefore, understanding the fracturing behavior of different types of reservoir rocks is a basic need for planning field operations towards these activities. In our study, the fracturing of rock sample is monitored by Acoustic Emission (AE) and post-experiment Computer Tomography (CT) scans. The fracturing experiments have been performed on hollow cylinder cores of different rocks - sandstones and chalks. Our analysis show that the amplitudes and energies of acoustic events clearly indicate initiation and propagation of the main fractures. The amplitudes of AE events follow an exponential distribution while the energies follow a power law distribution. Time-evolution of the radial strain measured in the fracturing-test will later be compared to model predictions of fracture size.

These geological objects and phenomena are described as containing statistically selfsimilar patterns often modeled with fractal geometry. Fractal geometry has been used extensively to characterize pore space and fracture distribution of both carbonate and clastic rocks as well as the transport properties of porous media and fluid flow in reservoirs. The fractal properties are usually estimated from thin-section photomicrograph images or scanning electron microscope images. For complex rock such as carbonate rocks, automatic feature detection methods are often inaccurate. In addition, the rocks may be have been subjected to facies selective diagenesis which preferentially affect some of the rock fabric, thus increasing the difficulty in automatic detection of certain features. We present an interactive program, GeoBoxCount, for analyzing thin-section images and calculating the fractal dimension interactively. The program relies on the geologists insight in interpreting the features of interest; this significantly improves the accuracy of feature selection. The program provides two options for calculating the fractal dimension: the Hausdorff and the Minkowsi-Bouligand box-counting methods.

That is, we are aiming to learn two predictors/hypotheses $P_A^*,P_B^*$ such that $P_A^*(X_A)$ and $P_B^*(X_B)$ provide high quality forecasts for ground truth $Y$, without labeled data. We also want to elicit a high quality forecast for $Y$ from the crowds and pay the crowds immediately, without access to $Y$. We build a natural connection between the learning question and the mechanism design question and deal with them using the same information theoretic approach.   Learning: With a natural assumption---conditioning on $Y$, $X_A$ and $X_B$ are independent, we reduce the learning question to an optimization problem $\max_{P_A,P_B}MIG^f(P_A,P_B)$ such that solving the learning question is equivalent to picking the $P_A^*,P_B^*$ that maximize $MIG^f(P_A,P_B)$---the \emph{$f$-mutual information gain} between $P_A$ and $P_B$.   Moreover, we apply our results to the "learning with noisy labels" problem to learn a predictor that forecasts the ground truth label rather than the noisy label with some side information, without pre-estimating the relationship between the ground truth labels and noisy labels.   Mechanism design: We design mechanisms that elicit high quality forecasts without verification and have instant rewards for agents by assuming the agents' information is independent conditioning on $Y$. In the single-task setting, we propose a forecast elicitation mechanism where truth-telling is a strict equilibrium, in the multi-task setting, we propose a family of forecast elicitation mechanisms where truth-telling is a strict equilibrium and pays better than any other equilibrium.

Renzoni	  Cold atoms in optical lattices have emerged as an ideal system to investigate the ratchet effect, as demonstrated by several recent experiments. In this work we analyze theoretically two aspects of ac driven transport in cold atoms ratchets. We first address the issue of whether, and to which extent, an ac driven ratchet for cold atoms can operate as a motor. We thus study theoretically a dissipative motor for cold atoms, as obtained by adding a load to a 1D non-adiabatically driven rocking ratchet. We demonstrate that a current can be generated also in the presence of a load, e.g. the ratchet device can operate as a motor. Correspondingly, we determine the stall force for the motor, which characterizes the range of loads over which the device can operate as a motor, and the differential mobility, which characterizes the response to a change in the magnitude of the load. Second, we compare our results for the transport in an ac driven ratchet device with the transport in a dc driven system. We observe a peculiar phenomenon: the bi-harmonic ac force stabilizes the dynamics, allowing the generation of uniform directed motion over a range of momentum much larger than what is possible with a dc bias. We explain such a stabilization of the dynamics by observing that a non-adiabatic ac drive broadens the effective cooling momentum range, and forces the atom trajectories to cover such a region. Thus the system can dissipate energy and maintain a steady-state energy balance. Our results show that in the case of a finite-range velocity-dependent friction, a ratchet device may offer the possibility of controlling the particle motion over a broader range of momentum with respect to a purely biased system, although this is at the cost of a reduced coherency.

Part of the region is characterized by zones of ophiolitic melange believed to represent the remnants of ancient oceanic crust and underlying upper mantle emplaced during oceanic closures. However, due to the remoteness of the region and the inhospitable terrain many areas have not received detailed investigation. Increased spatial and spectral resolution of satellite sensors have made it possible to map in greater detail the mineralogy and lithology than in the past. Recent work by Yoshiki Ninomiya of the Geological Survey of Japan has pioneered the use of several spectral indices for the mapping of quartzose, carbonate, and silicate rocks using Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) thermal infrared (TIR) data. In this study, ASTER TIR indices have been applied to a region in western-central Tibet for the purposes of assessing their effectiveness for differentiating ophiolites and other lithologies. The results agree well with existing geological maps and other published data. The study area was chosen due to its diverse range of rock types, including an ophiolitic melange, associated with the Bangong-Nujiang suture (BNS) that crops out on the northern shores of Lagkor Tso and Dong Tso ("Tso" is Tibetan for lake). The techniques highlighted in this paper could be applied to other geographical regions where similar geological questions need to be resolved. The results of this study aim to show the utility of ASTER TIR imagery for geological mapping in semi-arid and sparsely vegetated areas on the Tibetan Plateau.

The physical shape of the fractures, they are long and thin objects, puts strong limitations on how the effect of this dynamics can be incorporated into standard reservoir simulation tools. This paper reports the development of an open-source software framework, termed PorePy, which is aimed at simulation of flow and transport in three-dimensional fractured reservoirs, as well as deformation of the reservoir due to shearing along fracture and fault planes. Starting from a description of fractures as polygons embedded in a 3D domain, PorePy provides semi-automatic gridding to construct a discrete-fracture-matrix model, which forms the basis for subsequent simulations. PorePy allows for flow and transport in all lower-dimensional objects, including planes (2D) representing fractures, and lines (1D) and points (0D), representing fracture intersections. Interaction between processes in neighboring domains of different dimension is implemented as a sequence of couplings of objects one dimension apart. This readily allows for handling of complex fracture geometries compared to capabilities of existing software. In addition to flow and transport, PorePy provides models for rock mechanics, poro-elasticity and coupling with fracture deformation models. The software is fully open, and can serve as a framework for transparency and reproducibility of simulations. We describe the design principles of PorePy from a user perspective, with focus on possibilities within gridding, covered physical processes and available discretizations. The power of the framework is illustrated with two sets of simulations; involving respectively coupled flow and transport in a fractured porous medium, and low-pressure stimulation of a geothermal reservoir.

Jayannavar	  We present a detailed study of the transport and energetics of a Brownian particle moving in a periodic potential in the presence of an adiabatic external periodic drive. The particle is considered to move in a medium with periodic space dependent friction with the same periodicity as that of the potential but with a phase lag. We obtain several results, most of them arising due to the medium being inhomogeneous and are sensitive to the phase lag. When the potential is symmetric we show that efficiency of energy transduction can be maximised as a function of noise strength or temperature. However, in the case of asymmtertic potential the temperature may or may not facilitate the energy conversion but current reversals can be obtained as a function of temperature and the amplitude of the periodic drive. The reentrant behaviour of current can also be seen as a function of phase lag. 	
0009466v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0009466v1	2000	Irreversible and reversible modes of operation of deterministic ratchets	I. M. Sokolov	  We discuss a problem of optimization of the energetic efficiency of a simple rocked ratchet. We concentrate on a low-temperature case in which the particle's motion in a ratchet potential is deterministic. We show that the energetic efficiency of a ratchet working adiabatically is bounded from above by a value depending on the form of ratchet potential. The ratchets with strongly asymmetric potentials can achieve ideal efficiency of unity without approaching reversibility. On the other hand we show that for any form of the ratchet potential a set of time-protocols of the outer force exist under which the operation is reversible and the ideal value of efficiency is also achieved. The mode of operation of the ratchet is still quasistatic but not adiabatic. The high values of efficiency can be preserved even under elevated temperatures. 	
0107079v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0107079v1	2001	Inhomogeneous Systems and their Rectification Properties	A. M. Jayannavar	  We explore the possibility of obtaining unidirectional current in a symmetric (periodic) potential system without the application of any obvious (apparent) externally applied bias. There are many physical models proposed to accomplish this nonequilibrium effect. In the present work we consider inhomogeneous systems so that the friction coefficient and/or temperature could vary in space. We find out a model with minimal conditions that the inhomogeneous system assisted by fluctuating forces must satisfy, in order to obtain unidirectional current. In the process we discuss about thermal and frictional ratchets that are of current interest. We argue that different models of frictional ratchets work under the same basic principle of alteration of relative stability of otherwise locally stable states in the presence of temperature inhomogeneity. We also discuss in detail the nature of currents in rocked frictional ratchets. In particular we analyse a novel phenomenon of multiple current reversals and the efficiency of the energy transduction in these systems.

Here we present a simple yet effective mechanism promoting cooperation under full anonymity by allowing for voluntary participation in public goods games. This natural extension leads to rock--scissors--paper type cyclic dominance of the three strategies cooperate, defect and loner i.e. those unwilling to participate in the public enterprise. In spatial settings with players arranged on a regular lattice this results in interesting dynamical properties and intriguing spatio-temporal patterns. In particular, variations of the value of the public good leads to transitions between one-, two- and three-strategy states which are either in the class of directed percolation or show interesting analogies to Ising-type models. Although volunteering is incapable of stabilizing cooperation, it efficiently prevents successful spreading of selfish behavior and enables cooperators to persist at substantial levels. 	
0208478v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0208478v1	2002	Evolutionary prisoner's dilemma games with optional participation	Gyorgy Szabo|Christoph Hauert	  Competition among cooperators, defectors, and loners is studied in an evolutionary prisoner's dilemma game with optional participation. Loners are risk averse i.e. unwilling to participate and rather rely on small but fixed earnings. This results in a rock-scissors-paper type cyclic dominance of the three strategies. The players are located either on square lattices or random regular graphs with the same connectivity. Occasionally, every player reassesses its strategy by sampling the payoffs in its neighborhood. The loner strategy efficiently prevents successful spreading of selfish, defective behavior and avoids deadlocks in states of mutual defection. On square lattices, Monte Carlo simulations reveal self-organizing patterns driven by the cyclic dominance, whereas on random regular graphs different types of oscillatory behavior are observed: the temptation to defect determines whether damped, periodic or increasing oscillations occur. These results are compared to predictions by pair approximation. Although pair approximation is incapable of distinguishing the two scenarios because of the equal connectivity, the average frequencies as well as the oscillations on random regular graphs are well reproduced.

Jayannavar	  We study the phenomena of noise induced transport in frictional ratchet systems. For this we consider a Brownian particle moving in a space dependent frictional medium in the presence of external white noise fluctuations. To get the directed transport, unlike in other ratchet models like flashing or rocking ratchets etc., we do not require the potential experienced by the particle to be asymmetric nor do we require the external fluctuations to be correlated. We have obtained analytical expressions for current and the diffusion coefficient. We show that the frictional ratchet do not exhibit a pronounced coherence in the transport in that the diffusion spread overshadows the accompanying directed transport in system with finite spatial extensions.

Ananthakrishna	  We investigate the dynamics of a modified Burridge-Knopoff model by introducing a dissipative term to mimic the bursts of acoustic emission (AE) from rock samples. The model explains many features of the statistics of AE signals observed in experiments such as the crossover in the exponent value from relatively small amplitude AE signals to larger regime, and their dependence on the pulling speed. Significantly, we find that the cumulative energy dissipated identified with acoustic emission can be used to predict a major slip event. We also find a data collapse of the acoustic activity for several major slip events describable by a universal stretched exponential with corrections in terms of time-to-failure.

We present 3D high resolution measurements at laboratory scales of their complex roughness. The topography is shown to be described by a self-affine scaling invariance. At large scales, the Hurst exponent is $\zeta_1 \approx 0.5$ and very different from that at small scales where $\zeta_2 \approx 1.2$. A cross-over length scale at around $\L_c =1$~mm is well characterized. Measurements are consistent with a Langevin equation that describes the growth of a stylolitic interface as a competition between stabilizing long range elastic interactions at large scales or local surface tension effects at small scales and a destabilizing quenched material disorder.

Shahbazi|Alireza Bahraminasab|S. Mehdi Vaez Allaei|Muhammad Sahimi|M. Reza Rahimi Tabar	  Using the Martin-Siggia-Rose method, we study propagation of acoustic waves in strongly heterogeneous media which are characterized by a broad distribution of the elastic constants. Gaussian-white distributed elastic constants, as well as those with long-range correlations with non-decaying power-law correlation functions, are considered. The study is motivated in part by a recent discovery that the elastic moduli of rock at large length scales may be characterized by long-range power-law correlation functions. Depending on the disorder, the renormalization group (RG) flows exhibit a transition to localized regime in {\it any} dimension. We have numerically checked the RG results using the transfer-matrix method and direct numerical simulations for one- and two-dimensional systems, respectively. 	
0511519v3	http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0511519v3	2006	Giant coherence in driven systems	Soumen Roy|Debasis Dan|A. M. Jayannavar	  We study the noise-induced currents and reliability or coherence of transport in two different classes of rocking ratchets. For this, we consider the motion of Brownian particles in the over damped limit in both adiabatic and non-adiabatic regimes subjected to unbiased temporally symmetric and asymmetric periodic driving force. In the case of a time symmetric driving, we find that even in the presence of a spatially symmetric simple sinusoidal potential, highly coherent transport occurs. These ratchet systems exhibit giant coherence of transport in the regime of parameter space where unidirectional currents in the deterministic case are observed. Outside this parameter range, i.e., when current vanishes in the deterministic regime, coherence in transport is very low. The transport coherence decreases as a function of temperature and is a non-monotonic function of the amplitude of driving. The transport becomes unreliable as we go from the adiabatic to the non-adiabatic domain of operation.

In its evolutionary form and especially when the interacting agents are linked in a specific social network the underlying solution concepts and methods are very similar to those applied in non-equilibrium statistical physics. This review gives a tutorial-type overview of the field for physicists. The first three sections introduce the necessary background in classical and evolutionary game theory from the basic definitions to the most important results. The fourth section surveys the topological complications implied by non-mean-field-type social network structures in general. The last three sections discuss in detail the dynamic behavior of three prominent classes of models: the Prisoner's Dilemma, the Rock-Scissors-Paper game, and Competing Associations. The major theme of the review is in what sense and how the graph structure of interactions can modify and enrich the picture of long term behavioral patterns emerging in evolutionary games.

Oliveira|Peter Hanggi	  A dynamics between Newton and Langevin formalisms is elucidated within the framework of the generalized Langevin equation. For thermal noise yielding a vanishing zero-frequency friction the corresponding non-Markovian Brownian dynamics exhibits anomalous behavior which is characterized by ballistic diffusion and accelerated transport. We also investigate the role of a possible initial correlation between the system degrees of freedom and the heat-bath degrees of freedom for the asymptotic long-time behavior of the system dynamics. As two test beds we investigate (i) the anomalous energy relaxation of free non-Markovian Brownian motion that is driven by a harmonic velocity noise and (ii) the phenomenon of a net directed acceleration in noise-induced transport of an inertial rocking Brownian motor.

Marconi	  A detailed numerical study on the directed motion of ac-driven vortices and antivortices in 2D Josephson junction arrays (JJA) with an asymmetric periodic pinning potential is reported. Dc-voltage rectification shows a strong dependence on vortex density as well as an inversion of the vortex flow direction with ac amplitude for a wide range of vortex density around $f$=1/2 ($f$=$Ha^2 / \Phi_0$), in good agreement with recent experiments by Shal\'om and Pastoriza [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 94}, 177001 (2005)]. The study of vortex structures, spatial and temporal correlations, and vortex-antivortex pairs formation gives insight into a purely collective mechanism behind the current reversal effect.

Most importantly, the directed transport can exist for almost all system parameters, even after averaged over a broad range of single-band initial states. The directed transport is theoretically explained within ac-scattering theory. Total reflection phenomena associated with the matter waves travelling from a tilting-free region to a tilted region are emphasized. The results are of relevance to ultracold physics and solid-state physics, and may lead to powerful means of selective, coherent, and directed transport of cold particles in optical lattices.

Obligations undertaken by South Africa mirrored the framework for the gradual telecommunications reform process that was begun in 1996. In the light of two threatened actions for anti-competitive practices in violation of the Agreement, this paper reviews the nature of the commitments undertaken by South Africa and assesses the country's compliance to date. This paper also seeks to explore the tension that arises between domestic policy reforms and international trade aspirations. It is argued that the dynamic produced through this tension affords domestic governments a mechanism with which to balance the seemingly opposing goals of competition and development. It is further argued that the broad regulatory principles, adopted by all signatories and often criticized for lack of precision, facilitate this fine balancing and affords domestic governments an opportunity to advance sovereign concerns while pursuing international trade ideals. 	
0008235v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0008235v1	2000	Emergence of Bulk CsCl Structure in (CsCl)nCs+ Cluster Ions	Andres Aguado	  The emergence of CsCl bulk structure in (CsCl)nCs+ cluster ions is investigated using a mixed quantum-mechanical/semiempirical theoretical approach. We find that rhombic dodecahedral fragments (with bulk CsCl symmetry) are more stable than rock-salt fragments after the completion of the fifth rhombic dodecahedral atomic shell. From this size (n=184) on, a new set of magic numbers should appear in the experimental mass spectra. We also propose another experimental test for this transition, which explicitely involves the electronic structure of the cluster. Finally, we perform more detailed calculations in the size range n=31--33, where recent experimental investigations have found indications of the presence of rhombic dodecahedral (CsCl)32Cs+ isomers in the cluster beams.

Kardar	  We propose a model for anomalous transport in inhomogeneous environments, such as fractured rocks, in which particles move only along pre-existing self-similar curves (cracks). The stochastic Loewner equation is used to efficiently generate such curves with tunable fractal dimension $d_f$. We numerically compute the probability of first passage (in length or time) from one point on the edge of the semi-infinite plane to any point on the semi-circle of radius $R$. The scaled probability distributions have a variance which increases with $d_f$, a non-monotonic skewness, and tails that decay faster than a simple exponential. The latter is in sharp contrast to predictions based on fractional dynamics and provides an experimental signature for our model. 	
0801.0463v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/0801.0463v2	2008	Asymptotic Stability of Ascending Solitary Magma Waves	Gideon Simpson|Michael I. Weinstein	  Coherent structures, such as solitary waves, appear in many physical problems, including fluid mechanics, optics, quantum physics, and plasma physics. A less studied setting is found in geophysics, where highly viscous fluids couple to evolving material parameters to model partially molten rock, magma, in the Earth's interior. Solitary waves are also found here, but the equations lack useful mathematical structures such as an inverse scattering transform or even a variational formulation.   A common question in all of these applications is whether or not these structures are stable to perturbation. We prove that the solitary waves in this Earth science setting are asymptotically stable and accomplish this without any pre-exisiting Lyapunov stability. This holds true for a family of equations, extending beyond the physical parameter space. Furthermore, this extends existing results on well-posedness to data in a neighborhood of the solitary waves. 	
0803.1023v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/0803.1023v1	2008	Oscillatory dynamics in evolutionary games are suppressed by   heterogeneous adaptation rates of players	Naoki Masuda	  Game dynamics in which three or more strategies are cyclically competitive, as represented by the rock-scissors-paper game, have attracted practical and theoretical interests. In evolutionary dynamics, cyclic competition results in oscillatory dynamics of densities of individual strategists. In finite-size populations, it is known that oscillations blow up until all but one strategies are eradicated if without mutation. In the present paper, we formalize replicator dynamics with players that have different adaptation rates. We show analytically and numerically that the heterogeneous adaptation rate suppresses the oscillation amplitude. In social dilemma games with cyclically competing strategies and homogeneous adaptation rates, altruistic strategies are often relatively weak and cannot survive in finite-size populations. In such situations, heterogeneous adaptation rates save coexistence of different strategies and hence promote altruism. When one strategy dominates the others without cyclic competition, fast adaptors earn more than slow adaptors. When not, mixture of fast and slow adaptors stabilizes population dynamics, and slow adaptation does not imply inefficiency for a player.

Specifically, the square electric train pulses are generated by the combination of a stress increase phase which generates a positive piezostimulated polarized current pulse (PSPC) followed, in a short time, by the stress decrease phase at fracturing level which generates a negative piezostimulated depolarized current pulse (PSDC). Moreover, it is shown that the SES signals are closely related to the tidally triggered lithospheric stress maxima - minima. Examples of SES signals are presented in relation to the tidally triggered lithospheric oscillation (k2, S2, M1) of T = 12hours / 14 days, while some comments are made as far as it concerns their use in short-term earthquake prediction.

Jayannavar	  We study the fluctuations of work done and dissipated heat of a Brownian particle in a symmetric double well system. The system is driven by two periodic input signals that rock the potential simultaneously. Confinement in one preferred well can be achieved by modulating the relative phase between the drives. We show that in the presence of pumping the stochastic resonance signal is enhanced when analyzed in terms of the average work done on the system per cycle. This is in contrast to the case when pumping is achieved by applying an external static bias, which degrades resonance. We analyze the nature of work and heat fluctuations and show that the steady state fluctuation theorem holds in this system.

We find that, due to the spin polarized \textit{p} orbitas of N, all four compounds are half-metallic ferromagnets with wide energy bandgaps (up to 2.0 eV). The calculated total magnetic moment in all investigated compounds for all three types of crystal structure is exactly 2.00 $\mu_{\text{B}}$ per formula unit. The predicted half-metallicity is robust with respect to lattice-constant contraction. In all the cases ferromagnetic phase is energetically favored with respect to the paramagnetic one. The mechanism leading to half-metallic ferromagnetism and synthesis possibilities are discussed.

Hänggi	  We consider motion of an underdamped Brownian particle in a washboard potential that is subjected to an unbiased time-periodic external field. While in the limiting deterministic system in dependence of the strength and phase of the external field directed net motion can exist, for a finite temperature the net motion averages to zero. Strikingly, with the application of an additional time-delayed feedback term directed particle motion can be accomplished persisting up to fairly high levels of the thermal noise. In detail, there exist values of the feedback strength and delay time for which the feedback term performs oscillations that are phase locked to the time-periodic external field. This yields an effective biasing rocking force promoting periods of forward and backward motion of distinct duration, and thus directed motion. In terms of phase space dynamics we demonstrate that with applied feedback desymmetrization of coexisting attractors takes place leaving the ones supporting either positive or negative velocities as the only surviving ones. Moreover, we found parameter ranges for which in the presence of thermal noise the directed transport is enhanced compared to the noise-less case.

Mitra	  The efficiency of bio-molecular motors stems from reversible interactions $\sim$ $k_B T$; weak bonds stabilizing intermediate states (enabling $direct$ conversion of chemical into mechanical energy). For their (unknown) origins, we suggest that a magnetically structured phase (MSP) formed via accretion of super-paramagnetic particles (S-PPs) by magnetic rocks on the Hadean Ocean floor had hosted motor-like diffusion of ligand-bound S-PPs through its template-layers; its ramifications range from optical activity to quantum coherence. A gentle flux gradient offers both detailed-balance breaking non-equilibrium and $asymmetry$ to a magnetic dipole, undergoing infinitesimal spin-alignment changes. Periodic perturbation of this background by local H-fields of template-partners can lead to periodic high and low-template affinity states, due to the dipole's magnetic degree of freedom. An accompanying magnetocaloric effect allows interchange between system-entropy and bath temperature. We speculate on a magnetic reproducer in a setting close to the mound-scenario of Russell and coworkers that could evolve bio- ratchets.

Nolting	  The mechanism behind ferromagnetic exchange interaction in GdN is not well understood. It has been argued that it can be due to fourth order cross process of \textit{d-f} mixing and \textit{d-f} exchange. An alternative explanation suggests an anti- ferromagnetic interaction between Gd \textit{d} and N \textit{p} induced moments on the rock salt structure which aligns the nearest neighbor Gd \textit{f} moments ferromagnetically through the \textit{d-f} exchange. In this paper we present results of Curie temperature in GdN as a function of carrier density calculated within our multiband modified RKKY- like exchange interaction. It includes realistic bandstructure of the 5\textit{d} conduction band as an input for single particle energies. We analyze the possibility of carrier- mediated ferromagnetism in GdN and also demonstrate a simple phenomenological model which justifies the role of charge carriers.

We investigate the mean extinction time in the coevolutionary dynamics of three cyclically invading strategies for different evolutionary processes on various classes of complex networks, including random graphs, scale-free and small world networks. We find that scale-free and random graphs lead to a strong stabilization of coexistence both for the Moran process and the Local Update process. The stabilization is of an order of magnitude stronger compared to a lattice topology, and is mainly caused by the degree heterogeneity of the graph. However, evolutionary processes on graphs can be defined in many variants, and we show that in a process using effective payoffs the effect of the network topology can be completely reversed. Thus, stabilization of coexistence depends on both network geometry and underlying evolutionary process.

The time-varying populations of the interacting species are often captured rather well by a set of deterministic replicator equations in the evolutionary game theory. However, intrinsic fluctuations arisen from the discreteness of populations lead to stochastic derivations from the smooth evolution trajectories. The role of these fluctuations is shown to be critical at causing extinction and deteriorating the biodiversity of ecosystem. We use children's rock-paper-scissors game to demonstrate how the intrinsic fluctuations arise from the discrete populations and why the biodiversity of the ecosystem decays exponentially, disregarding the detail parameters for competing mechanism and initial distributions. The dissipative trend in biodiversity can be analogized to the gradual erosion of kinetic energy of a moving particle due to air drag or fluid viscosity. The dissipation-fluctuation theorem in statistical physics seals the fate of these originally conserved quantities. This concept in physics can be generalized to scrutinize the errors that might be incurred in the ecological, biological, and quantitative economic modeling for which the ingredients are all discrete in number.

Gupta	  Heteroepitaxial spinel ferrites NiFe2O4 and CoFe2O4 films have been prepared by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) at various temperatures (175 - 690 {\deg}C) under ozone/oxygen pressure of 10 mTorr. Due to enhanced kinetic energy of ablated species at low pressure and enhanced oxidation power of ozone, epitaxy has been achieved at significantly lower temperatures than previously reported. Films grown at temperature below 550 {\deg}C show a novel growth mode, which we term "vertical step-flow" growth mode. Epitaxial spinel ferrite films with atomically flat surface over large areas and enhanced magnetic moment can be routinely obtained. Interestingly, the growth mode is independent of the nature of substrates (spinel MgAl2O4, perovskite SrTiO3, and rock salt MgO) and film thicknesses. The underlying growth mechanism is discussed. 	
1009.0299v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1009.0299v1	2010	A simple model for asset price bubble formation and collapse	Alexander Kiselev|Lenya Ryzhik	  We consider a simple stochastic differential equation for modeling bubbles in social context. A prime example is bubbles in asset pricing, but similar mechanisms may control a range of social phenomena driven by psychological factors (for example, popularity of rock groups, or a number of students pursuing a given major). Our goal is to study the simplest possible model in which every term has a clear meaning and which demonstrates several key behaviors. The main factors that enter are tendency of mean reversion to a stable value, speculative social response triggered by trend following and random fluctuations. The interplay of these three forces may lead to bubble formation and collapse. Numerical simulations show that the equation has distinct regimes depending on the values of the parameters. We perform rigorous analysis of the weakly random regime, and study the role of change in fundamentals in igniting the bubble.

Zia	  Generalizing the cyclically competing three-species model (often referred to as the rock-paper-scissors game), we consider a simple system of population dynamics without spatial structures that involves four species. Unlike the previous model, the four form alliance pairs which resemble partnership in the game of Bridge. In a finite system with discrete stochastic dynamics, all but 4 of the absorbing states consist of coexistence of a partner-pair. From a master equation, we derive a set of mean field equations of evolution. This approach predicts complex time dependence of the system and that the surviving partner-pair is the one with the larger product of their strengths (rates of consumption). Simulations typically confirm these scenarios. Beyond that, much richer behavior is revealed, including complicated extinction probabilities and non-trivial distributions of the population ratio in the surviving pair. These discoveries naturally raise a number of intriguing questions, which in turn suggests a variety of future avenues of research, especially for more realistic models of multispecies competition in nature.

Fine and cost of pool-punishment are considered as the two main parameters determining the stationary distributions of strategies on the square lattice. Each player collects its payoff from five five-person public goods games, and the evolution of strategies is subsequently governed by imitation based on pairwise comparisons at a low level of noise. The impact of pool-punishment on the evolution of cooperation in structured populations is significantly different from that reported previously for peer-punishment. Representative phase diagrams reveal remarkably rich behavior, depending also on the value of the synergy factor that characterizes the efficiency of investments payed into the common pool. Besides traditional single and two-strategy stationary states, a rock-paper-scissors type cyclic dominance can emerge in strikingly different ways.

Herrmann	  The main purpose of this work is to simulate two-phase flow in the form of immiscible displacement through anisotropic, three-dimensional (3D) discrete fracture networks (DFN). The considered DFNs are artificially generated, based on a general distribution function or are conditioned on measured data from deep geological investigations. We introduce several modifications to the invasion percolation (MIP) to incorporate fracture inclinations, intersection lines, as well as the hydraulic path length inside the fractures. Additionally a trapping algorithm is implemented that forbids any advance of the invading fluid into a region, where the defending fluid is completely encircled by the invader and has no escape route. We study invasion, saturation, and flow through artificial fracture networks, with varying anisotropy and size and finally compare our findings to well studied, conditioned fracture networks.

Swift	  We describe a mechanical equation of state for NH3, based on shock wave measurements for liquid ammonia. The shock measurements, for an initial temperature of 203 K, extended to 1.54 g/cc and 38.6 GPa. The shock and particle speeds were fitted well with a straight line, so extrapolations to higher compressions are numerically stable, but the accuracy is undetermined outside the range of the data. The isentrope through the same initial state was estimated, along with its sensitivity to the Grueneisen parameter. Mass-radius relations were calculated for self-gravitating bodies of pure ammonia, and for differentiated ammonia-rock bodies. The relations were insensitive to variations in the Grueneisen parameter, indicating that they should be accurate for studies of planetary structure. 	
1112.0851v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1112.0851v1	2011	Driven Ratchets for Cold Atoms	F. Renzoni	  Brownian motors, or ratchets, are devices which "rectify" Brownian motion, i.e. they can generate a current of particles out of unbiased fluctuations. The ratchet effect is a very general phenomenon which applies to a wide range of physical systems, and indeed ratchets have been realized with a variety of solid state devices, with optical trap setups as well as with synthetic molecules and granular gases. The present article reviews recent experimental realizations of ac driven ratchets with cold atoms in driven optical lattices. This is quite an unusual system for a Brownian motor as there is no a real thermal bath, and both the periodic potential for the atoms and the fluctuations are determined by laser fields. Such a system allowed us to realize experimentally rocking and gating ratchets, and to precisely investigate the relationship between symmetry and transport in these ratchets, both for the case of periodic and quasiperiodic driving.

For large, but finite populations this allows to include demographic noise without requiring explicit simulations. Instead, the population size only rescales the amplitude of the noise. Moreover, this framework admits the inclusion of mutations between different types, provided that mutation rates, $\mu$, are not too small compared to the inverse population size 1/N. This ensures that all types are almost always represented in the population and that the occasional extinction of one type does not result in an extended absence of that type. For $\mu N\ll1$ this limits the use of SDE's, but in this case there are well established alternative approximations based on time scale separation. We illustrate our approach by a Rock-Scissors-Paper game with mutations, where we demonstrate excellent agreement with simulation based results for sufficiently large populations. In the absence of mutations the excellent agreement extends to small population sizes.

Arenzon	  Intransitivity is a property of connected, oriented graphs representing species interactions that may drive their coexistence even in the presence of competition, the standard example being the three species Rock-Paper-Scissors game. We consider here a generalization with four species, the minimum number of species allowing other interactions beyond the single loop (one predator, one prey). We show that, contrary to the mean field prediction, on a square lattice the model presents a transition, as the parameter setting the rate at which one species invades another changes, from a coexistence to a state in which one species gets extinct. Such a dependence on the invasion rates shows that the interaction graph structure alone is not enough to predict the outcome of such models. In addition, different invasion rates permit to tune the level of transitiveness, indicating that for the coexistence of all species to persist, there must be a minimum amount of intransitivity.

Pruss	  Assemblies of circular inclusions with spiraling laminate structure inside them are studied, such as spirals with inner inclusions, spirals with shells, assemblies of "wheels" - structures from laminates with radially dependent volume fractions, complex axisymmetric three-dimensional micro-geometries called Connected Hubs and Spiky Balls. The described assemblages model structures met in rock mechanics, biology, etc. The classical effective medium theory coupled with hierarchical homogenization is used. It is found that fields in spiral assemblages satisfy a coupled system of two second order differential equations, rather than a single differential equation; a homogeneous external field applied to the assembly is transformed into a rotated homogeneous field inside of the inclusions. The effective conductivity of the two-dimensional Star assembly is equivalent to that of Hashin-Shtrikman coated circles, but the conductivity of analogous three-dimensional Spiky Ball is different from the conductivity of coated sphere geometry.

Tyagi|U. Ramamurty	  This paper reports optical and nanomechanical properties of seldom studied highly a-axis oriented AlN thin films for the first time. These films were deposited by reactive DC magnetron sputtering technique at an optimal target to substrate distance of 180 mm. Bragg-Brentano geometry X-ray and rocking curve (FWHM = 52 arcsec) studies confirmed the preferred orientation. Spectroscopic ellipsometry revealed that these films exhibit a refractive index of 1.93 at a wavelength of 546 nm. The hardness and elastic modulus of these films were 17 GPa and 190 GPa, respectively. The mechanical properties obtained here are much higher than the earlier reported and therefore can be useful as protective coating in thermo printing devices, piezoelectric films in bulk acoustic wave resonators.

Scholz|I. de Gregorio-Monsalvo|A. Isella|J. M. Carpenter	  The first steps toward planet formation involve the coagulation of small microscopic grains into larger and larger pebbles and rocks in gas-rich disks around young stars and brown dwarfs. Observations in the sub-millimeter can trace mm/cm-sized pebbles in the outer disks, and investigate the mechanisms of coagulation/fragmentation and radial migration of these solids. These represent key, yet not fully understood ingredients for our understanding of the formation of planetesimals, the building blocks of planets. Here we present the first results from an observational program using the ALMA and CARMA sub-mm/mm interferometers aimed at characterizing the dust properties and disk structure of young disks around brown dwarfs and very low mass stars. Given the physical conditions expected for these disks, they represent critical test beds for the models of the early stages of planet formation in proto-planetary disks.

Nielsen aka Jan Nurzynski	  Using the growth of population in Australia in the past 10,000 years it is illustrated here how an illusion created by hyperbolic distributions may lead easily to incorrect conclusions. Contrary to the published claim, there was no change in the mechanism of growth of the ancient human population in Australia around 5000 years before present (BP). Data for the number of rock-shelter sites, interpreted as reflecting the growth of human population, are analysed. They are shown to be monotonically increasing with time without any sign of intensification in the past 10,000 years. The growth of human population in Australia is in excellent agreement with the similar pattern describing the growth of the world population.

One approach hinges on the numerical solution of Stokes equations, while the other is based on the Johnson-Koplik-Dashen (JKD) universal scaling theory of viscous frequency-dependent flow [D.~L. Johnson, J.~Koplik, and R.~Dashen, \emph{Theory of dynamic permeability and tortuosity in fluid--saturated porous media}, Journal of Fluid Mechanics \textbf{176} (1987), 379--402.] and the method of maximal inscribed spheres.   JKD steady-flow simulations only require the solution of a boundary-value problem for the Laplace equation, which is computationally less intensive than the solution of Stokes equations.   A series of numerical calculations performed on 3D pore-space images of natural rock demonstrate that JKD-based estimates are in good agreement with the corresponding Stokes-flow numerical simulations.

Tidal dissipation in planets and in stars is one of the key physical mechanisms that drive the evolution of planetary systems.   Aims. Tidal dissipation properties are intrisically linked to the internal structure and the rheology of studied celestial bodies. The resulting dependence of the dissipation upon the tidal frequency is strongly different in the cases of solids and fluids.   Methods. We compute the tidal evolution of a two-body coplanar system, using the tidal quality factor's frequency-dependencies appropriate to rocks and to convective fluids.   Results. The ensuing orbital dynamics comes out smooth or strongly erratic, dependent on how the tidal dissipation depends upon frequency.   Conclusions. We demonstrate the strong impact of the internal structure and of the rheology of the central body on the orbital evolution of the tidal perturber. A smooth frequency-dependence of the tidal dissipation renders a smooth orbital evolution while a peaked dissipation can furnish erratic orbital behaviour.

Paul Young	  Using 9-sets of different laboratory earthquake tests, we examined the nature of cracking under true triaxial stress conditions in the lithosphere . We found that 3D stress state can induce oblique nucleation of many fractures, forming final plane of complex polymodal faults. Our fully 3D experiments indicate unconventional fault nucleation with 2-3 times faster slip phase, implying a new slip-weakening mechanism for earthquakes in upper crust. In addition, We compared our observations of irregular cracks with typical anti-cracks signals in multi-anvil High Pressure and Temperature test. For the first time, we showed oblique faulting can change slip-weakening rate and accelerate the rate of energy release. This implicates a sharper source time function for further modeling of our experiments. Indeed, our results can be assumed as an ex tension to detachment fronts in micro-faults to a general concept of quasi-anti rupture fronts. We showed events from deep-focus earthquakes can share some similarity to shallow earthquakes, promoting recent approach on similarity of deep earthquakes to their shallow counterparts .

By assuming that the effects of loops in a directed random graph can be ignored in the thermodynamic limit, it is proved for any finite disorder that the system fixates to a frozen configuration when the species number $s$ is larger than the spatial connectivity $c$, and otherwise stays active. Nontrivial lower and upper bounds for the persistence probability of a site never changing its state are also analytically computed. The obtained bounds and numerical simulations support the existence of a phase transition as a function of disorder for $1<c_l(s)\le c <s$, with a $s$-dependent threshold of the connectivity $c_l(s)$.

Ribe|Olivier Castelnau|Andrew M. Walker|James Wookey	  Progressive deformation of upper mantle rocks via dislocation creep causes their constituent crystals to take on a non-random orientation distribution (crystallographic preferred orientation or CPO) whose observable signatures include shear-wave splitting and azimuthal dependence of surface wave speeds. Comparison of these signatures with mantle flow models thus allows mantle dynamics to be unraveled on global and regional scales. However, existing self-consistent models of CPO evolution are computationally expensive when used in 3-D and/or time-dependent convection models. Here we propose a new method, called ANPAR, which is based on an analytical parameterisation of the crystallographic spin predicted by the second-order (SO) self-consistent theory. Our parameterisation runs approximately 2-3 x 10^4 times faster than the SO model and fits its predictions for CPO and crystallographic spin with a variance reduction > 99%. We illustrate the ANPAR model predictions for three uniform deformations (uniaxial compression, pure shear, simple shear) and for a corner-flow model of a spreading ridge.

Rundle	  Injections of large volumes of water into tight shale reservoirs allows the extraction of oil and gas not previously accessible. This large volume "super" fracking induces damage that allows the oil and/or gas to flow to an extraction well. The purpose of this paper is to provide a model for understanding super fracking. We assume that water is injected from a small spherical cavity into a homogeneous elastic medium. The high pressure of the injected water generates hoop stresses that reactivate natural fractures in the tight shales. These fractures migrate outward as water is added creating a spherical shell of damaged rock. The porosity associated with these fractures is equal to the water volume injected. We obtain an analytic expression for this volume. We apply our model to a typical tight shale reservoir and show that the predicted water volumes are in good agreement with the volumes used in super fracking.

The RSF law describes rock friction quantitatively and therefore it is commonly used to model earthquakes and the related phenomena. But the RSF law is rather empirical and the theoretical basis has not been very clear. Here we derive the RSF law starting from constitutive laws for asperities, and give the atomistic expressions for the empirical RSF parameters. In particular, we show that both the length constant and the state variable are given as the 0th weighted power means of the corresponding microscopic quantities: a linear dimension and the contact duration of each asperity. As a result, evolution laws for the state variable can be derived systematically. We demonstrate that the aging and the slip laws can be derived and clarify the approximations behind these two major evolution laws. Additionally, the scaling properties of the length constant are clarified for fractal distribution of asperities. 	
1306.1622v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1306.1622v2	2014	The Strength of Regolith and Rubble Pile Asteroids	Paul Sanchez|Daniel J. Scheeres	  We explore the hypothesis that, due to small van der Waals forces between constituent grains, small rubble pile asteroids have a small but non-zero cohesive strength. The nature of this model predicts that the cohesive strength should be constant independent of asteroid size, which creates a scale dependence with relative strength increasing as size decreases. This model counters classical theory that rubble pile asteroids should behave as scale-independent cohesionless collections of rocks. We explore a simple model for asteroid strength that is based on these weak forces, validate it through granular mechanics simulations and comparisons with properties of lunar regolith, and then explore its implications and ability to explain and predict observed properties of small asteroids in the NEA and Main Belt populations, and in particular of asteroid 2008 TC3. One conclusion is that the population of rapidly rotating asteroids could consist of both distributions of smaller grains (i.e., rubble piles) and of monolithic boulders.

The primary aim of the present article is to investigate the influence of a realistic boundary condition, i.e. an algorithmically generated fractal surface, on the vein evolution in 3-D using a thermodynamically consistent approach, while explaining the benefits of accounting for an extra dimensionality. The 3-D simulation results are supplemented by innovative numerical post-processing and advanced visualization techniques. The new methodologies to measure the tracking efficiency demonstrate the importance of accounting the temporal evolution; no such information is usually accessible in field studies and notoriously difficult to obtain from laboratory experiments as well. The grain growth statistics obtained by numerically post-processing the 3-D computational microstructures explain the pinning mechanism which leads to arrest of grain boundaries/multi-junctions by crack peaks, thereby, enhancing the tracking behavior.

Cao|X. Chen|A. D. Christianson|G. Ehlers|D. J. Singh|B. C. Sales|O. Delaire	  The anharmonic lattice dynamics of rock-salt thermoelectric compounds SnTe and PbTe are investigated with inelastic neutron scattering (INS) and first-principles calculations. The experiments show that, surprisingly, although SnTe is closer to the ferroelectric instability, phonon spectra in PbTe exhibit a more anharmonic character. This behavior is reproduced in first-principles calculations of the temperature-dependent phonon self-energy. Our simulations reveal how the nesting of phonon dispersions induces prominent features in the self-energy, which account for the measured INS spectra and their temperature dependence. We establish that the phase-space for three-phonon scattering processes, rather than just the proximity to the lattice instability, is the mechanism determining the complex spectrum of the transverse-optical ferroelectric mode. 	
1404.4165v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.4165v1	2014	Universal asymptotic umbrella for hydraulic fracture modeling	Aleksandr M. Linkov	  The paper presents universal asymptotic solution needed for efficient modeling of hydraulic fractures. We show that when neglecting the lag, there is universal asymptotic equation for the near-front opening. It appears that apart from the mechanical properties of fluid and rock, the asymptotic opening depends merely on the local speed of fracture propagation. This implies that, on one hand, the global problem is ill-posed, when trying to solve it as a boundary value problem under a fixed position of the front. On the other hand, when properly used, the universal asymptotics drastically facilitates solving hydraulic fracture problems (both analytically and numerically). We derive simple universal asymptotics and comment on their employment for efficient numerical simulation of hydraulic fractures, in particular, by well-established Level Set and Fast Marching Methods. 	
1409.7710v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.7710v1	2014	The formation and arrangement of pits by a corrosive gas	James Burridge|Robert Inkpen	  When corroding or otherwise aggressive particles are incident on a surface, pits can form. For example, under certain circumstances rock surfaces that are exposed to salts can form regular tessellating patterns of pits known as "tafoni". We introduce a simple lattice model in which a gas of corrosive particles, described by a discrete convection diffusion equation, drifts onto a surface. Each gas particle has a fixed probability of being absorbed and causing damage at each contact. The surface is represented by a lattice of strength numbers which reduce after each absorbtion event, with sites being removed when their strength becomes negative. The model generates regular formations of pits, with each pit having a characteristic trapezoidal geometry determined by the particle bias, absorbtion probability and surface strength. The formation of this geometry may be understood in terms of a first order partial differential equation. By viewing pits as particle funnels, we are able to relate the gradient of pit walls to absorbtion probability and particle bias.

Weber|Torben Krueger|Erwin Frey	  Condensation phenomena arise through a collective behaviour of particles. They are observed in both classical and quantum systems, ranging from the formation of traffic jams in mass transport models to the macroscopic occupation of the energetic ground state in ultra-cold bosonic gases (Bose-Einstein condensation). Recently, it has been shown that a driven and dissipative system of bosons may form multiple condensates. Which states become the condensates has, however, remained elusive thus far. The dynamics of this condensation are described by coupled birth-death processes, which also occur in evolutionary game theory. Here, we apply concepts from evolutionary game theory to explain the formation of multiple condensates in such driven-dissipative bosonic systems. We show that vanishing of relative entropy production determines their selection. The condensation proceeds exponentially fast, but the system never comes to rest. Instead, the occupation numbers of condensates may oscillate, as we demonstrate for a rock-paper-scissors game of condensates.

Albrecht|Subramanian Ramamoorthy	  The ad hoc coordination problem is to design an autonomous agent which is able to achieve optimal flexibility and efficiency in a multiagent system with no mechanisms for prior coordination. We conceptualise this problem formally using a game-theoretic model, called the stochastic Bayesian game, in which the behaviour of a player is determined by its private information, or type. Based on this model, we derive a solution, called Harsanyi-Bellman Ad Hoc Coordination (HBA), which utilises the concept of Bayesian Nash equilibrium in a planning procedure to find optimal actions in the sense of Bellman optimal control. We evaluate HBA in a multiagent logistics domain called level-based foraging, showing that it achieves higher flexibility and efficiency than several alternative algorithms. We also report on a human-machine experiment at a public science exhibition in which the human participants played repeated Prisoner's Dilemma and Rock-Paper-Scissors against HBA and alternative algorithms, showing that HBA achieves equal efficiency and a significantly higher welfare and winning rate.

Damage will occur if crystals continue to grow in confinement, i.e. within the pore space of these materials generating mechanical stresses. We report on a novel method that allows to directly measure, at the microscale, the resulting pressure while visualizing the spontaneous nucleation and growth of alkali halide salts. The experiments reveal the crucial role of the wetting films between the growing crystal and the confining walls for the development of the pressure. The results suggest that the pressure originates from a charge repulsion between the similarly charged wall and the crystal separated by a ~1.5 nm salt solution film. Consequently, if the walls are made hydrophobic, no film and no crystallization pressure are detected. The magnitude of the pressure is system-specific and explains how a growing crystal exerts stresses at the scale of individual grains in porous materials.

Our emphasis is on applications of the methods to geological models. Models of subsurface, and in particular sedimentary rocks, naturally lead to general polyhedral meshes. Numerical methods which can directly handle such representation are highly desirable. Many of the numerical challenges in simulation of subsurface applications come from the lack of robustness and accuracy of numerical methods in the case of highly distorted grids. In this paper we investigate and compare the Multi-Point Stress Approximation (MPSA) and the Virtual Element Method (VEM) with regards to grid features that are frequently seen in geological models and likely to lead to a lack of accuracy of the methods. In particular we look how the methods perform near the incompressible limit. This work shows that both methods are promising for flexible modeling of subsurface mechanics.

Parmentier	  The New Horizons spacecraft has found evidence for geologic activity on the surface of Pluto, including extensional tectonic deformation of its water ice bedrock (see Moore et al., 2016). One mechanism that could drive extensional tectonic activity is global surface expansion due to the partial freezing of an ocean. We use updated physical properties for Pluto and simulate its thermal evolution to understand the survival of a possible subsurface ocean. For thermal conductivities of rock less than 3 W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$, an ocean forms and at least partially freezes, leading to recent extensional stresses in the ice shell. In scenarios where the ocean freezes and the ice shell is thicker than $260$ km, ice II forms and causes global volume contraction. Since there is no evidence for recent compressional tectonic features, we argue that ice II has not formed and that Pluto's ocean has likely survived to present day.

Peets|D. L. Feng	  Extremely high magnetoresistance (XMR) in the lanthanum monopnictides La$X$ ($X$ = Sb, Bi) has recently attracted interest in these compounds as candidate topological materials. However, their perfect electron-hole compensation provides an alternative explanation, so the possible role of topological surface states requires verification through direct observation. Our angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) data reveal multiple Dirac-like surface states near the Fermi level in both materials. Intriguingly, we have observed circular dichroism in both surface and near-surface bulk bands. Thus the spin-orbit coupling-induced orbital and spin angular momentum textures may provide a mechanism to forbid backscattering in zero field, suggesting that surface and near-surface bulk bands may contribute strongly to XMR in La$X$. The extremely simple rock salt structure of these materials and the ease with which high-quality crystals can be prepared suggests that they may be an ideal platform for further investigation of topological matter.

In this study, a micromechanical framework based on the Lattice Discrete Particle Model (LDPM) is formulated to capture these features. Material anisotropy is introduced through an approximated geometric description of shale internal structure, which includes representation of material property variation with orientation and explicit modeling of parallel lamination. The model is calibrated by carrying out numerical simulations to match various experimental data, including the ones relevant to elastic properties, Brazilian tensile strength, and unconfined compressive strength. Furthermore, parametric study is performed to investigate the relationship between the mesoscale parameters and the macroscopic properties. It is shown that the dependence of the elastic stiffness, strength, and failure mode on loading orientation can be captured successfully. Finally, a homogenization approach based on the asymptotic expansion of field variables is applied to upscale the proposed micromechanical model, and the properties of the homogenized model are analyzed.

In our methodological research, we develop an approach to testing the validity of game dynamics models that considers the dynamic patterns of angular momentum and speed as measurement variables. Using Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) games as an example, we illustrate the geometric patterns in the experiment data. We then derive the related theoretical patterns from a series of typical dynamics models. By testing the goodness-of-fit between the experimental and theoretical patterns, we show that the validity of these models can be evaluated quantitatively. Our approach establishes a link between dynamics models and experimental systems, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the most effective and rigorous strategy for ascertaining the testability of evolutionary game dynamics models.

We observe that in the deterministic limit, the transport coherence, which is determined by a dimensionless quantity called Peclet number, $Pe$ is quite high for larger spatial asymmetry in the ratchet potential. For all the regime of parameter space of this model, $Pe$ follows the nature of current like Stokes efficiency. Diffusion as a function of amplitude of drive shows a minimum exactly at which the current shows a maximum. Unlike the previously studied models, the $Pe$ as a function of temperature shows a peaking behavior and the coherence in transport decreases for high temperatures. In the nonadiabatic regime, the $Pe$ as a function of amplitude of drive decreases and the peak gets broader as a result the transport becomes unreliable.

The walker consists of two coupled "feet" that allow the interchange of the order of the particles while the walker moves. In the underdamped case, the deterministic dynamics of the walker in a tilted asymmetric ratchet with an external periodic force is considered. It is found that the delayed feedback ratchets with a switching-on-and-off dependence of the states of the system can lead to the absolute negative mobility (ANM). In such a novel phenomenon the particles move against the bias. Moreover, the walker can acquire a series of resonant steps for different values of the current. Remarkably, it is interesting to find that the resonant current of the walker are induced by the phase locked motion that corresponds to the synchronization of the motion with the change in the frequency of the external driving. These resonant steps can be well predicted in terms of time-space symmetry analysis, which is in good agreement with dynamics simulations. The transport performances can be optimized and furthermore controlled by suitably adjusting the parameters of the delayed-feedback ratchets.

Haverkort|Philipp Hansmann	  We analyze the charge- and spin response functions of rare-earth nickelates RNiO3 and their heterostructures using random-phase approximation in a two-band Hubbard model. The inter-orbital charge fluctuation is found to be the driving mechanism for the rock-salt type bond order in bulk RNiO3, and good agreement of the ordering temperature with experimental values is achieved for all RNiO3 using realistic crystal structures and interaction parameters. We further show that magnetic ordering in bulk is not driven by the spin fluctuation and should be instead explained as ordering of localized moments. This picture changes for low-dimensional heterostructures, where the charge fluctuation is suppressed and overtaken by the enhanced spin instability, which results in a spin-density-wave ground state observed in recent experiments. Predictions for spectroscopy allow for further experimental testing of our claims.

Yurchenko	  The majority of stars are now thought to support exoplanets. Many of those exoplanets discovered thus far are categorized as rocky objects with an atmosphere. Most of these objects are however hot due to their short orbital period. Models suggest that water is the dominant species in their atmospheres. The hot temperatures are expected to turn these atmospheres into a (high pressure) steam bath containing remains of melted rock. The spectroscopy of these hot rocky objects will be very different from that of cooler objects or hot gas giants. Molecules suggested to be important for the spectroscopy of these objects are reviewed together with the current status of the corresponding spectroscopic data. Perspectives of building a comprehensive database of linelist/cross sections applicable for atmospheric models of rocky super-Earths as part of the ExoMol project are discussed. The quantum-mechanical approaches used in linelist productions and their challenges are summarized.

In order to benefit from both concepts, Rashba spin-orbit interaction has been investigated in colloidal lead sulphide nanosheets by electrical measurements on the circular photo-galvanic effect. Lead sulphide nanosheets possess rock salt crystal structure, which is centrosymmetric. The symmetry can be broken by quantum confinement, asymmetric vertical interfaces and a gate electric field leading to Rashba-type band splitting in momentum space at the M points, which results in an unconventional selection mechanism for the excitation of the carriers. The effect, which is supported by simulations of the band structure using density functional theory, can be tuned by the gate electric field and by the thickness of the sheets. Spin-related electrical transport phenomena in colloidal materials open a promising pathway towards future inexpensive spintronic devices.

Brown|Michel Pleimling	  Using numerical simulations we investigate the space-time properties of a system in which spirals emerge within coarsening domains, thus giving rise to non-trivial internal dynamics. Initially proposed in the context of population dynamics, the studied six-species model exhibits growing domains composed of three species in a rock-paper-scissors relationship. Through the investigation of different quantities, such as space-time correlations and the derived characteristic length, autocorrelation, density of empty sites, and interface width, we demonstrate that the non-trivial dynamics inside the domains affects the coarsening process as well as the properties of the interfaces separating different domains. Domain growth, aging, and interface fluctuations are shown to be governed by exponents whose values differ from those expected in systems with curvature driven coarsening.

Coombs	  Peridynamics (PD) represents a new approach for modelling fracture mechanics, where a continuum domain is modelled through particles connected via physical bonds. This formulation allows us to model crack initiation, propagation, branching and coalescence without special assumptions. Up to date, anisotropic materials were modelled in the PD framework as different isotropic materials (for instance, fibre and matrix of a composite laminate), where the stiffness of the bond depends on its orientation. A non-ordinary state-based formulation will enable the modelling of generally anisotropic materials, where the material properties are directly embedded in the formulation. Other material models include rocks, concrete and biomaterials such as bones. In this paper, we implemented this model and validated it for anisotropic composite materials. A composite damage criterion has been employed to model the crack propagation behaviour. Several numerical examples have been used to validate the approach, and compared to other benchmark solution from the finite element method (FEM) and experimental results when available.

Subsurface regions are isolated from the photosphere, and consequently are incapable of utilizing this energy. This opens up the opportunity for life to evolve alternate mechanisms for harvesting available energy. Bacterium Candidatus Desulforudis audaxviator, found 2.8 km deep in a South African mine, harvests energy from radiolysis, induced by particles emitted from radioactive U, Th and K present in surrounding rock. Another radiation source in the subsurface environments is secondary particles generated by Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs). Using Monte Carlo simulations, it is shown that it is a steady source of energy comparable to that produced by radioactive substances, and the possibility of a slow metabolizing life flourishing on it cannot be ruled out. Two mechanisms are proposed through which GCR-induced secondary particles can be utilized for biological use in subsurface environments: (1) GCRs injecting energy in the environment through particle-induced radiolysis, and (2) organic synthesis from GCR secondaries interacting with the medium. Laboratory experiments to test these hypotheses are also proposed. Implications of these mechanisms on finding life in the Solar System and elsewhere in the Universe are discussed.

But this is not the case for intransitive relationships that make up the famous rock-paper-scissors game. However, the sole presence of paper might prevent rock from beating scissors, simply because paper beats rock. This is the blueprint for the rock-paper-scissors game with protection spillovers, which has recently been introduced as a new paradigm for biodiversity in well-mixed microbial populations. Here we study the game in structured populations, demonstrating that protection spillovers give rise to spatial patterns that are impossible to observe in the classical rock-paper-scissors game. We show that the spatiotemporal dynamics of the system is determined by the density of stable vortices, which may ultimately transform to frozen states, to propagating waves, or to target waves with reversed propagation direction, depending further on the degree and type of randomness in the interactions among the species. If vortices are rare, the fixation to waves and complex oscillatory solutions is likelier. Moreover, annealed randomness in interactions favors the emergence of target waves, while quenched randomness favors collective synchronization. Our results demonstrate that protection spillovers may fundamentally change the dynamics of cyclic dominance in structured populations, and they outline the possibility of programming pattern formation in microbial populations.

Malik	  Shale gas recovery has seen a major boom in recent years due to the increasing global energy demands; but the extraction technologies are very expensive. It is therefore important to develop realistic transport modelling and simulation methods, for porous rocks and porous media, that can compliment the field work. Here, a new nonlinear transport model for single phase gas flow in tight porous media is derived, incorporating many important physical processes that occur in such porous systems: continuous flow, transition flow, slip flow, Knudsen diffusion, adsorption and desorption in to and out of the rock material, and a correction for high flow rates (turbulence). This produces a nonlinear advection-diffusion type of partial differential equation (PDE) with pressure dependent model parameters and associated compressibility coefficients, and highly nonlinear apparent convective flux (velocity) and apparent diffusivity. An important application is to the determination of shale rock properties, such as porosity and permeability, by history matching of the the simulation results to data from pressure-pulse decay tests in a shale rock core sample [Pong K., Ho C., Liu J., Tai Y. Non-linear pressure distribution in uniform microchannels. ASME Fluids Eng. Div. (FED) Vol. 197, 51--56, (1994)]. The estimates of the rock porosity and the permeability from our model simulations are realistic of shale rocks, more realistic than obtained from previous models, and illustrates the potential of the modelling strategy presented here in producing accurate simulations of shale gas flow in tight reservoirs. 	
9807305v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/9807305v1	1998	Earthquakes: from chemical alteration to mechanical rupture	D. Sornette	  In the standard rebound theory of earthquakes, elastic deformation energy is progressively stored in the crust until a threshold is reached at which it is suddenly released in an earthquake. We review three important paradoxes, the strain paradox, the stress paradox and the heat flow paradox, that are difficult to account for in this picture, either individually or when taken together. Resolutions of these paradoxes usually call for additional assumptions on the nature of the rupture process (such as novel modes of deformations and ruptures) prior to and/or during an earthquake, on the nature of the fault and on the effect of trapped fluids within the crust at seismogenic depths. We review the evidence for the essential importance of water and its interaction with the modes of deformations. Water is usually seen to have mainly the mechanical effect of decreasing the normal lithostatic stress in the fault core on one hand and to weaken rock materials via hydrolytic weakening and stress corrosion on the other hand. We also review the evidences that water plays a major role in the alteration of minerals subjected to finite strains into other structures in out-of-equilibrium conditions. This suggests novel exciting routes to understand what is an earthquake, that requires to develop a truly multidisciplinary approach involving mineral chemistry, geology, rupture mechanics and statistical physics.

Stereoscopic analysis of pairs of SEM images yielded a digital elevation model of the surface of the microstylolites. Fourier analyses of these microstylolites reveal a self-affine roughness (with a roughness exponent H of 1.2). Coupled with observations of close interactions between dissolution pits and stylolitic peaks, these data illustrate a possible mechanism for stylolite formation. The complex geometry of stylolite surfaces is imposed by the interplay between the development of dissolution peaks in preferential locations (fast dissolution pits) and the mechanical properties of the solid-fluid-solid interfaces. Simple mechanical modeling expresses the crucial competition that could rule the development of microstylolites: (i) a stress-related process, modeled in terms of the stiffness of springs that activate the heterogeneous dissolution rates of the solid interface, promotes the deflection. In parallel, (ii) the strength of the solid interface, modeled in terms of the stiffness of a membrane, is equivalent to a surface tension that limits the deflection and opposes its development. The modeling produces stylolitic surfaces with characteristic geometries varying from conical to columnar when both the effect of dissolution-rate heterogeneity and the strength properties of the rock are taken into account. A self-affine roughness exponent (Hz1.2) measured on modeled surfaces is comparable with natural stylolites at small length scale and experimental microstylolites. 	
0806.2929v3	http://arxiv.org/pdf/0806.2929v3	2009	Influence of sedimentary layering on tsunami generation	Denys Dutykh|Frédéric Dias	  The present article is devoted to the influence of sediment layers on the process of tsunami generation. The main scope here is to demonstrate and especially quantify the effect of sedimentation on vertical displacements of the seabed due to an underwater earthquake. The fault is modelled as a Volterra-type dislocation in an elastic half-space. The elastodynamics equations are integrated with a finite element method. A comparison between two cases is performed. The first one corresponds to the classical situation of an elastic homogeneous and isotropic half-space, which is traditionally used for the generation of tsunamis. The second test case takes into account the presence of a sediment layer separating the oceanic column from the hard rock. Some important differences are revealed. We conjecture that deformations in the generation region may be amplified by sedimentary deposits, at least for some parameter values. The mechanism of amplification is studied through careful numerical simulations.

We revisit a mechanism proposed by Ogilvie and Lin for tidal forcing of inertial waves, which are short-wavelength, low-frequency disturbances restored primarily by Coriolis rather than buoyancy forces. This mechanism is of particular interest for hot Jupiters because it relies upon a rocky core, and because these bodies are otherwise largely convective. Compared to waves excited at the base of the stratified, externally heated atmosphere, waves excited at the core are more likely to deposit heat in the convective region and thereby affect the planetary radius. However, Ogilvie and Lin's results were numerical, and the manner of the wave excitation was not clear. Using WKB methods, we demonstrate the production of short waves by scattering of the equilibrium tide off the core at critical latitudes. The tidal dissipation rate associated with these waves scales as the fifth power of the core radius, and the implied tidal $Q$ is of order ten million for nominal values of the planet's mass, radius, orbital period, and core size. We comment upon an alternative proposal by Wu for exciting inertial waves in an unstratified fluid body by means of compressibility rather than a core. We also find that even a core of rock is unlikely to be rigid. But Ogilvie and Lin's mechanism should still operate if the core is substantially denser than its immediate surroundings.

Matveev	  Mechanisms of acoustic energy dissipation in heterogeneous solids attract much attention in view of their importance for material characterization, nondestructive testing, and geophysics. Due to the progress in measurement techniques in recent years it has been revealed that rocks can demonstrate extremely high strain sensitivity of seismo-acoustic loss. In particular, it has been found that strains of order $10^{-8}$ produced by lunar and solar tides are capable to cause variations in the seismoacoustic decrement on the order of several percents. Some laboratory data (although obtained for higher frequencies) also indicate the presence of very high dissipative nonlinearity. Conventionally discussed dissipation mechanisms (thermoelastic loss in dry solids, Biot and squirt-type loss in fluid-saturated ones) do not suffice to interpret such data. Here, the dissipation at individual cracks is revised taking into account the influence of wavy asperities of their surfaces quite typical of real cracks, which can drastically change the values of the relaxation frequencies and can result in giant strain sensitivity of the dissipation without the necessity to assume the presence of unrealistically thin (and, therefore, unrealistically soft) cracks. In particular, these mechanisms suggest interpretation for observations of pronounced amplitude modulation of seismo-acoustic waves by tidal strains.

Terrón-Mejía|Roberto López-Rendon|Armando Gama Goicochea	  The need to extract oil from wells where it is embedded on the surfaces of rocks has led to the development of new and improved enhanced oil recovery techniques. One of those is the injection of surfactants with water vapor, which promotes desorption of oil that can then be extracted using pumps, as the surfactants encapsulate the oil in foams. However, the mechanisms that lead to the optimal desorption of oil and the best type of surfactants to carry out desorption are not well known yet, which warrants the need to carry out basic research on this topic. In this work, we report non equilibrium dissipative particle dynamics simulations of model surfactants and oil molecules adsorbed on surfaces, with the purpose of studying the efficiency of the surfactants to desorb hydrocarbon chains, that are found adsorbed over flat surfaces. The model surfactants studied correspond to nonionic and cationic surfactants, and the hydrocarbon desorption is studied as a function of surfactant concentration under increasing Poiseuille flow. We obtain various hydrocarbon desorption isotherms for every model of surfactant proposed, under flow. Nonionic surfactants are found to be the most effective to desorb oil and the mechanisms that lead to this phenomenon are presented and discussed.

Heath	  We use helium released during mechanical deformation of shales as a signal to explore the effects of deformation and failure on material transport properties. A dynamic dual-permeability model with evolving pore and fracture networks is used to simulate gases released from shale during deformation and failure. Changes in material properties required to reproduce experimentally observed gas signals are explored. We model two different experiments of $^4$He flow rate measured from shale undergoing mechanical deformation, a core parallel to bedding and a core perpendicular to bedding. We find that the helium signal is sensitive to fracture development and evolution as well as changes in the matrix transport properties. We constrain the timing and effective fracture aperture, as well as the increase in matrix porosity and permeability. Increases in matrix permeability are required to explain gas flow prior to macroscopic failure, and the short-term gas flow post failure. Increased matrix porosity, is required to match the long-term, post-failure gas flow. Our model provides the first quantitative interpretation of helium release as a result of mechanical deformation. The sensitivity of this model to changes in the fracture network, as well as to matrix properties during deformation, indicates that helium release can be used as a quantitative tool to evaluate the state of stress and strain in earth materials.

Heath	  A multiporosity extension of classical double and triple porosity fractured rock flow models for slightly compressible fluids is presented. The multiporosity model is an adaptation of the multirate solute transport model of Haggerty and Gorelick (1995) to viscous flow in fractured rock reservoirs. It is a generalization of both pseudo-steady-state and transient interporosity flow double porosity models. The model includes a fracture continuum and an overlapping distribution of multiple rock matrix continua, whose fracture-matrix exchange coefficients are specified through a discrete probability mass function. Semi-analytical cylindrically symmetric solutions to the multiporosity mathematical model are developed using the Laplace transform to illustrate its behavior. The multiporosity model presented here is conceptually simple, yet flexible enough to simulate common conceptualizations of double and triple porosity flow. This combination of generality and simplicity makes the multiporosity model a good choice for flow in low-permeability fractured rocks.

Srivastava	  There has been considerable interest in recent experiments on iron nuclear disintegrations observed when rocks containing such nuclei are crushed and fractured. The resulting nuclear transmutations are particularly strong for the case of magnetite rocks, i.e. loadstones. We argue that the fission of the iron nucleus is a consequence of photo-disintegration. The electro-strong coupling between electromagnetic fields and nuclear giant dipole resonances are central for producing observed nuclear reactions. The large electron energies produced during the fracture of piezomagnetic rocks are closely analogous to the previously discussed case of the fracture of piezoelectric rocks. In both cases electro-weak interactions can produce neutrons and neutrinos from energetic protons and electrons thus inducing nuclear transmutations. The electro-strong condensed matter coupling discussed herein represents new many body collective nuclear photo-disintegration effects.

Dindarloo|Elnaz Siami-Irdemoosa	  Conventionally, many researchers have used both regression and black box techniques to estimate the unconfined compressive strength (UCS) of different rocks. The advantage of the regression approach is that it can be used to render a functional relationship between the predictive rock indices and its UCS. The advantage of the black box techniques is in rendering more accurate predictions. Gene expression programming (GEP) is proposed, in this study, as a robust mathematical alternative for predicting the UCS of carbonate rocks. The two parameters of total porosity and P-wave speed were selected as predictive indices. The proposed GEP model had the advantage of the both traditionally used approaches by proposing a mathematical model, similar to a regression, while keeping the prediction errors as low as the black box methods. The GEP outperformed both artificial neural networks and support vector machines in terms of yielding more accurate estimates of UCS. Both the porosity and the P-wave velocity were sufficient predictive indices for estimating the UCS of the carbonate rocks in this study. Nearly, 95% of the observed variation in the UCS values was explained by these two parameters (i.e., R2 =95%).

Jin	  First-principles density-functional method is used to study the recently high-pressure synthesized compound PtC. It is confirmed by our calculations that the platinum carbide has a zinc-blende ground-state phase at zero pressure and the rock-salt structure is a high-pressure phase. The theoretical transition pressure from zinc-blende to rock-salt is determined to be 52GPa. Furthermore, our calculation shows the possibility that the experimentally synthesized PtC by Ono et al. under high pressure condition might undergo a transition from rock-salt structure to zinc-blende after the pressure quench to ambient condition.

Scales|Michael Batzle	  One region of the electromagnetic spectrum that is relatively unexploited for materials characterization is the millimeter wave band (frequencies roughly between 40 and 300 GHz). Millimeter wave techniques involve free-space (non-contacting) measurements which have a length scale that makes them ideal for characterizing bulk properties of multicomponent composites where the scale of homogeneity is on the order of millimeters. Such composites include granular materials such as rocks, fluid mixtures, suspensions and emulsions. Here we show measurements on partially saturated rocks and an oil/water mixture, demonstrating that millimeter wave spectroscopy is sensitive yet rapid measure of changing composition.

Papathanassiou|I. Sakellis|J. Grammatikakis	  Transient electric signals emitted prior to earthquake occurrence are recorded at certain sites in the Earth's crust termed sensitive. These field observations enforce the laboratory investigation of the dielectric response of rocks forming these localities. The dielectric relaxation of granodiorite rock coming from such a sensitive locality (Keratea, Greece) reveals, through complex impedance spectroscopy, that the activation volume for relaxation of this rock is negative which so far has been reported only rarely. This result, however, supports a theoretical model on the pre-seismic electric signals and is likely to be correlated with the sensitivity of the site and hence with the selectivity.

Their chemical analysis results serve to be initial data for calculations. For rocks of different composition the index is considered to be classification value as well. Crystal lattice energy change in minerals and their associations can be measured by the index value change, thus contributing to the solution of important practical problems.

The Goodman model of a rock joint shear behavior, under CNL, was modified to render a better representation of the data obtained. The model applicability was validated.

0012058v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0012058v1	2000	A model for complex aftershock sequences	Y. Moreno|A. Correig|J. B. Gomez|A. F. Pacheco	  The decay rate of aftershocks is commonly very well described by the modified Omori law, $n(t) \propto t^{-p}$, where n(t) is the number of aftershocks per unit time, t is the time after the main shock, and p is a constant in the range 0.9<p<1.5, and usually close to 1. But there are also more complex aftershock sequences for which the Omori law can be considered only as a first approximation. One of these complex aftershock sequences took place in the Eastern Pyrenees on February 18, 1996, and was described in detail by {\it Correig et al.} [1997]. In this paper, we propose a new model inspired by dynamic fiber-bundle models to interpret this type of complex aftershock sequences with sudden increases in the rate of aftershock production not directly related to the magnitude of the aftershocks (as in the epidemic-type aftershock sequences). The model is a simple, discrete, stochastic fracture model where the elements (asperities or barriers) break because of static fatigue, transfer stress according to a local load-sharing rule and then are regenerated. We find a very good agreement between the model and the Eastern Pyrenees aftershock sequence and we propose that the key mechanism for explaining aftershocks, apart from a time-dependent rock strength, is the presence of dynamic stress fluctuations which constantly reset the initial conditions for the next aftershock in the sequence. 	
0709.0479v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/0709.0479v1	2007	Granular Fluids	James W. Dufty	  The terminology granular matter refers to systems with a large number of hard objects (grains) of mesoscopic size ranging from millimeters to meters. Geological examples include desert sand and the rocks of a landslide. But the scope of such systems is much broader, including powders and snow, edible products such a seeds and salt, medical products like pills, and extraterrestrial systems such as the surface regolith of Mars and the rings of Saturn. The importance of a fundamental understanding for granular matter properties can hardly be overestimated. Practical issues of current concern range from disaster mitigation of avalanches and explosions of grain silos to immense economic consequences within the pharmaceutical industry. In addition, they are of academic and conceptual importance as well as examples of systems far from equilibrium. Under many conditions of interest, granular matter flows like a normal fluid. In the latter case such flows are accurately described by the equations of hydrodynamics. Attention is focused here on the possibility for a corresponding hydrodynamic description of granular flows. The tools of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, developed over the past fifty years for fluids composed of atoms and molecules, are applied here to a system of grains for a fundamental approach to both qualitative questions and practical quantitative predictions. The nonlinear Navier-Stokes equations and expressions for the associated transport coefficients are obtained.

Taylor|Jean-Luc Margot	  The locations of the fully despun, double synchronous end states of tidal evolution are derived for spherical components. With the exception of nearly equal-mass binaries, binary asteroid systems are in the midst of lengthy tidal evolutions, far from their fully synchronous tidal end states. Calculations of material strength indicate that binaries in the main belt with 100-km-scale primary components are consistent with being made of monolithic or fractured rock as expected for binaries likely formed from sub-catastrophic impacts in the early solar system. To tidally evolve in their dynamical lifetime, near-Earth binaries with km-scale primaries or smaller must be much weaker mechanically than their main-belt counterparts even if formed in the main belt prior to injection into the near-Earth region. Small main-belt binaries with primary components less than 10 km in diameter, depending on their ages, could either be as strong as large main-belt binaries or as weak as near-Earth binaries because the inherent uncertainty in the age of a binary system can affect the calculation of material strength by orders of magnitude. Several other issues are considered, though these typically affect the calculation of material strength by no more than a factor of two. We also find indirect evidence within all three groups of binary asteroids that the inter-component separation may evolve via another mechanism(s) with the binary YORP effect being a likely candidate.

Schild	  Hydrogravitional-dynamics (HGD) cosmology of Gibson/Schild 1996 predicts proto-globular-star-cluster PGC clumps of Earth-mass planets fragmented from plasma at ~0.3 Myr. Protogalaxies retained the ~0.03 Myr baryonic density existing at the time of the first viscous-gravitational plasma fragmentation. Stars promptly formed from mergers of these gas planets, seeded by chemicals C, N, O, Fe etc. created by the first stars and their supernovae at ~ 0.33 Myr. Hot hydrogen gas planets reduced seeded oxides to hot water oceans over metal-rock cores at water critical temperature 647 K, at ~2 Myr. Merging planets and moons hosted the first organic chemistry and the first life, distributed to the 10^80 planets of the cosmological big bang by comets produced by the (HGD) binary-planet-merger star formation mechanism: the biological big bang. Life distributed by the Hoyle/Wickramasinghe cometary-panspermia mechanism thus evolves in a cosmological primordial soup of the merging planets throughout the universe space-time. A primordial astrophysical origin is provided for astrobiology by planets of HGD cosmology. Concordance {\Lambda}CDMHC cosmology is rendered obsolete by the observation of complex life on Earth, falsifying the dark energy and cold dark matter concepts. The dark matter of galaxies is mostly primordial planets in protoglobularstarcluster clumps, 30,000,000 planets per star (not 8!). Complex organic chemicals observed in the interstellar dust is formed by life on these planets, and distributed by their comets. 	
1203.4633v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.4633v1	2012	Random Motion with Interfacial Contact: Driven Diffusion vis-a-vis   Mechanical Activation	P. S. Goohpattader|M. K. Chaudhury	  Rolling of a small sphere on a solid support is governed by a non-linear friction that is akin to the Coulombic dry fiction. No motion occurs when the external field is weaker than the frictional resistance. However, with the intervention of an external noise, a viscous friction like property emerges; thus the sphere rolls with an uniform drift velocity that is proportional to the applied field. As the sphere rolls, it rocks forward and backward resulting in substantial fluctuation of displacement opposite to the net drift. The ratio of the integrated probabilities of the negative to positive work fluctuations decreases monotonically with the time of observation, from which a temperature like intensive parameter can be estimated. This parameter conforms to the Einstein's ratio of diffusivity and mobility that increases almost linearly, even though the diffusivity increases super-linearly, with the strength of the noise. A new barrier crossing experiment is introduced that can be performed either with a hard (e.g. a steel ball) or with a soft (e.g. a water drop) sphere in contact with a periodically undulated substrate. The frequency of barrier crossing follows the classical transition state equation allowing a direct estimation of the effective temperature. These experiments as well as certain numerical simulations suggest that the effective temperature of a system controlled by a non-linear friction may not have a unique value.

Javad Hashemifar|Hadi Akbarzadeh	  On the basis of density functional - pseudopotential calculations, we study structural, electronic, magnetic, and mechanical properties of the hypothetical CaC ionic compound in the rock-salt (RS), B2, zinc-blende (ZB), wurtzite (WZ), NiAs (NA), and anti-NiAs (NA*) structures. The results show that RS-CaC is the most stable system at equilibrium while applying negative hydrostatic pressures may stabilize the half-metallic WZ and ZB structures. The ferromagnetic equilibrium state observed in the RS, ZB, NA and WZ structures of CaC is attributed to the sharp partially filled p band of the carbon atom. It is argued that the ionic interaction increases the sharpness of the p band and hence enhances ferromagnetism while the covalent interaction increases the band dispersion and weakens magnetism. We investigate various properties of the exchange interaction in the ferromagnetic CaC structures. It is observed that the interatomic exchange interaction in these systems have consistent behavior with the spin splittings of the bond points. Comparing the structural properties in the ferromagnetic and nonmagnetic states. indicates a weak magneto-structural coupling in CaC. Applying non-local corrections to the exchange functional enhance the exchange splitting and hence give rise to a half-metallic electronic structure for the WZ, RS, and NA structures of CaC. In the framework of density functional perturbation theory, the phonon spectra of these systems are investigated and the observed dynamical instabilities in the NA* and B2 structures are attributed to the tendency of the carbon atoms toward dimerization. Various mechanical properties of the dynamically stable structures of CaC are determined from their phonon spectra.

A particular development was related to high entropy alloys in which the configurational disorder is responsible for forming simple solid solutions and which are thoroughly studied for various applications especially due to their mechanical properties but also electrical properties, hydrogen storage, magnetic properties. Many unexplored compositions and properties still remain for this class of materials due to their large phase space. In a recent report it has been shown that the configurational disorder can be used for stabilizing simple solid solutions of oxides, which should normally not form solid solutions, these new materials were called "entropy-stabilized oxides". In this pioneering report, it was shown that mixing five equimolar binary oxides yielded, after heating at high temperature and quenching, an unexpected rock salt structure compound with statistical distribution of the cations in a face centered cubic lattice. Following this seminal study, we show here that these high entropy oxides (named HEOx hereafter) can be substituted by aliovalent elements with a charge compensation mechanism. This possibility largely increases the potential development of new materials by widening their (already complex) phase space. As a first example, we report here that at least one HEOx composition exhibits colossal dielectric constants, which could make it very promising for applications as large-k dielectric materials.

Recently, the regolith on asteroid (25143) Itokawa, visited by the JAXA Hayabusa spacecraft, was observed to contain millimeter to centimeter sized particles. Itokawa boulders commonly display well-rounded profiles and surface textures that appear inconsistent with mechanical fragmentation during meteorite impact; the rounded profiles have been hypothesized to arise from rolling and movement on the surface as a consequence of seismic shaking. We provide a possible explanation of these observations by exploring the primary crack propagation mechanisms during thermal fatigue of a chondrite. We present the in situ evolution of the full-field strains on the surface as a function of temperature and microstructure, and observe and quantify the crack growth during thermal cycling. We observe that the primary fatigue crack path preferentially follows the interfaces between monominerals, leaving them intact after fragmentation. These observations are explained through a microstructure-based finite element model that is quantitatively compared with our experimental results. These results on the interactions of thermal fatigue cracking with the microstructure may ultimately allow us to distinguish between thermally induced fragments and impact products.

Nakamura	  Cratering on small bodies is crucial for the collision cascade and also contributes to the ejection of dust particles into interplanetary space. A crater cavity forms against the mechanical strength of the surface, gravitational acceleration, or both. The formation of moderately sized craters that are sufficiently larger than the thickness of the regolith on small bodies, in which mechanical strength plays the dominant role rather than gravitational acceleration, is in the strength regime. The formation of microcraters on blocks on the surface is also within the strength regime. On the other hand, the formation of a crater of a size comparable to the thickness of the regolith is affected by both gravitational acceleration and cohesion between regolith particles. In this short review, we compile data from the literature pertaining to impact cratering experiments on porous targets, and summarize the ratio of spall diameter to pit diameter, the depth, diameter, and volume of the crater cavity, and the ratio of depth to diameter. Among targets with various porosities studied in the laboratory to date, based on conventional scaling laws (Holsapple and Schmidt, J. Geophys. Res., 87, 1849-1870, 1982) the cratering efficiency obtained for porous sedimentary rocks (Suzuki et al., J. Geophys. Res. 117, E08012, 2012) is intermediate. A comparison with microcraters formed on a glass target with impact velocities up to 14 $km s^{-1}$ indicates a different dependence of cratering efficiency and depth-to-diameter ratio on impact velocity.

In this paper, the size effect of Marcellus shale was analyzed, and the fracture properties were obtained through size effect tests. A number of fracture tests were conducted on Three-Point-Bending (TPB) specimens with increasing size. Test results show that the nominal strength decreases with increasing specimen size, and can be fitted well by Bazant's Size Effect Law (SEL). It is shown that SEL accounts for the effects of both specimen size and geometry, allowing an accurate identification of the initial fracture energy of the material, Gf, and the effective Fracture Process Zone (FPZ) length, cf. The obtained fracture properties were verified by the numerical simulations of the investigated specimens using standard Finite Element technique with cohesive model. Significant anisotropy was observed in the fracture properties determined in three principal notch orientations: arrester, divider, and short-transverse. The size effect of the measured structural strength and apparent fracture toughness was discussed. Neither strength-based criterion which neglects size effect, nor classic LEFM which does not account for the finiteness of the FPZ can predict the reported size effect data, and nonlinear fracture mechanics of the quasibrittle type is instead applicable.

Spergel	  This paper considers the lithopanspermia hypothesis in star forming groups and clusters, where the chances of biological material spreading from one solar system to another is greatly enhanced (relative to the field) due to the close proximity of the systems and lower relative velocities. These effects more than compensate for the reduced time spent in such crowded environments. This paper uses 300,000 Monte Carlo scattering calculations to determine the cross sections for rocks to be captured by binaries and provides fitting formulae for other applications. We assess the odds of transfer as a function of the ejection speed and number of members in the birth aggregate. The odds of any given ejected meteroid being recaptured by another solar system are relatively low. Because the number of ejected rocks per system can be large, virtually all solar systems are likely to share rocky ejecta with all of the other solar systems in their birth cluster. The number of ejected rocks that carry living microorganisms is much smaller and less certain, but we estimate that several million rocks can be ejected from a biologically active solar system. For typical birth environments, the capture of life bearing rocks is expected to occur 10 -- 16,000 times per cluster (under favorable conditions), depending on the ejection speeds. Only a small fraction of the captured rocks impact the surfaces of terrestrial planets, so that only a few lithopanspermia events are expected (per cluster).

Kahre|Michael J. Wolff|Michael Manga	  A model for the formation and distribution of sedimentary rocks on Mars is proposed. The rate-limiting step is supply of liquid water from seasonal melting of snow or ice. The model is run for a O(10^2) mbar pure CO2 atmosphere, dusty snow, and solar luminosity reduced by 23%. For these conditions snow only melts near the equator, and only when obliquity >40 degrees, eccentricity >0.12, and perihelion occurs near equinox. These requirements for melting are satisfied by 0.01-20% of the probability distribution of Mars' past spin-orbit parameters. Total melt production is sufficient to account for aqueous alteration of the sedimentary rocks. The pattern of seasonal snowmelt is integrated over all spin-orbit parameters and compared to the observed distribution of sedimentary rocks. The global distribution of snowmelt has maxima in Valles Marineris, Meridiani Planum and Gale Crater. These correspond to maxima in the sedimentary-rock distribution. Higher pressures and especially higher temperatures lead to melting over a broader range of spin-orbit parameters. The pattern of sedimentary rocks on Mars is most consistent with a Mars paleoclimate that only rarely produced enough meltwater to precipitate aqueous cements and indurate sediment. The results suggest intermittency of snowmelt and long globally-dry intervals, unfavorable for past life on Mars. This model makes testable predictions for the Mars Science Laboratory rover at Gale Crater. Gale Crater is predicted to be a hemispheric maximum for snowmelt on Mars.

Here we have analyzed four groups of ship-rocking time series in horizontal and vertical directions utilizing a Hilbert based method from statistical physics. Our method gives a way to construct an analytic signal on the two-dimensional plane from a one-dimensional time series. The analytic signal share the complete property of the original time series. From the analytic signal of a time series, we have found some information of the original time series which are often hidden from the view of the conventional methods. The analytic signals of interest usually evolve very smoothly on the complex plane. In addition, the phase of the analytic signal is usually moves linearly in time. From the auto-correlation and cross-correlation functions of the original signals as well as the instantaneous amplitudes and phase increments of the analytic signals we have found that the ship-rocking in horizontal direction drives the ship-rocking in vertical direction when the ship navigates freely. And when the ship keeps a fixed navigation direction such relation disappears. Based on these resultswe could predict certain amount of future values of the ship-rocking time series based on the current and the previous values. Our predictions are as accurate as the conventional methods from stochastic processes and provide a much wider prediction time range. 	
1703.05686v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.05686v1	2017	Khristianovich-Geertsma-de Klerk problem with stress contrast	Igor Gladkov|Aleksandr Linkov	  The paper contains an extension of the Khristianovich-Geertsma-de Klerk (KGD) model to the case when the confining rock pressure, which closes a hydraulic fracture, varies in the direction of its propagation. The extension is impelled by the need to simulate fracture hampering (acceleration) when it penetrates into a layer with increased (decreased) rock pressure. The paper presents the problem formulation, an efficient numerical method for its solving, examples of fractures propagating through layers with various stresses and general conclusions. It is established that when the fracture enters a layer with increased rock stresses (positive stress contrast), it actually stops. In this case, the fluid particle velocity drops practically to zero and the velocity near the tip oscillates about a small value until the fluid pressure increases to the level of the increased rock pressure. In the opposite case, when the fracture enters a layer with decreased stresses (negative stress contrast), the fracture front accelerates until the fluid pressure drops to the level of the decreased rock pressure. Physical considerations and numerical results imply that the transition through a boundary of layers with different stresses may be characterized by a simple dimensionless parameter. The latter is defined as the ratio of the average difference between the fluid and rock pressures (at the moment of reaching the contact) to the stress jump at the contact. The parameter is applicable to contacts with positive as well as negative contrasts. The model and the method developed are to serve for improvement of the popular pseudo three-dimensional (P3D) model.

Schoellig	  Accurate measurement of blast-induced rock fragmentation is of great importance for many mining operations. The post-blast rock size distribution can significantly influence the efficiency of all the downstream mining and comminution processes. Image analysis methods are one of the most common methods used to measure rock fragment size distribution in mines regardless of criticism for lack of accuracy to measure fine particles and other perceived deficiencies. The current practice of collecting rock fragmentation data for image analysis is highly manual and provides data with low temporal and spatial resolution. Using UAVs for collecting images of rock fragments can not only improve the quality of the image data but also automate the data collection process. Ultimately, real-time acquisition of high temporal- and spatial-resolution data based on UAV technology will provide a broad range of opportunities for both improving blast design without interrupting the production process and reducing the cost of the human operator. This paper presents the results of a series of laboratory-scale rock fragment measurements using a quadrotor UAV equipped with a camera. The goal of this work is to highlight the benefits of aerial fragmentation analysis in terms of both prediction accuracy and time effort. A pile of rock fragments with different fragment sizes was placed in a lab that is equipped with a motion capture camera system for precise UAV localization and control. Such an environment presents optimal conditions for UAV flight and thus, is well-suited for conducting proof-of-concept experiments before testing them in large-scale field experiments. The pile was photographed by a camera attached to the UAV, and the particle size distribution curves were generated in almost real-time. The pile was also manually photographed and the results of the manual method were compared to the UAV method.

Pride	  The properties of the Hamiltonian developed in Paper II are studied showing that at a particular strain level a ``localization'' phase transition occurs characterized by the emergence of conjugate bands of coherently oriented cracks. The functional integration that yields the partition function is then performed analytically using an approximation that employs only a subset of states in the functional neighborhood surrounding the most probable states. Such integration establishes the free energy of the system, and upon taking the derivatives of the free energy, the localization transition is shown to be continuous and to be distinct from peak stress. When the bulk modulus of the grain material is large, localization always occurs in the softening regime following peak stress, while for sufficiently small bulk moduli and at sufficiently low confining pressure, the localization occurs in the hardening regime prior to peak stress.   In the approach to localization, the stress-strain relation for the whole rock remains analytic, as is observed both in experimental data and in simpler models.   The correlation function of the crack fields is also obtained. It has a correlation length characterizing the aspect ratio of the crack clusters that diverges as (\xi \sim (\ep_{c}-\ep)^{-2}) at localization. 	
0510031v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0510031v1	2005	New Misfit-Layered Cobalt Oxide (CaOH)1.14CoO2	M. Shizuya|M. Isobe|Y. Baba|T. Nagai|M. Osada|K. Kosuda|S. Takenouchi|Y. Matsui|E. Takayama-Muromachi	  We found a new cobalt oxide (CaOH)1.14CoO2 by utilizing the high-pressure technique. X-ray and electron diffraction studies revealed that the compound has layer structure which consists of CdI2-type CoO2 layers and rock-salt-type double CaOH atomic layers. The two subcells have incommensurate periodicity along the a-axis, resulting in modulated crystal structure due to the inter-subcell interaction. The structural modulation affects carrier conduction through the potential randomness. We found that the two-dimensional (2-D) variable-range hopping (VRH) regime with hole conduction is dominant at low temperature for this compound, and that the conduction mechanism undergoes crossover from the 2-D VRH regime to thermal activation-energy type one with increasing temperature. Based on the experimental results of resistivity, thermoelectric power, magnetic susceptibility and specific heat measurements, we suggested a possible electronic-band structure model to explain these results. The cobalt t2g-derivative band crosses Fermi energy level near the band edge, yielding small finite density of localized states at the Fermi level in the band. The observed resistivity, Seebeck coefficient, large Pauli paramagnetic component in the magnetic susceptibility and comparatively small Sommerfeld constant in the specific heat are principally attributed to the holes in the t2g-derivative band. We estimated the Wilson ratio to be about 2.8, suggesting the strong electron correlation realized in this compound.

A review	Ioana Bena	  Nonequilibrium systems driven by additive or multiplicative dichotomous Markov noise appear in a wide variety of physical and mathematical models. We review here some prototypical examples, with an emphasis on {\em analytically-solvable} situations. In particular, it has escaped attention till recently that the standard results for the long-time properties of such systems cannot be applied when unstable fixed points are crossed in the asymptotic regime. We show how calculations have to be modified to deal with these cases and present a few relevant applications -- the hypersensitive transport, the rocking ratchet, and the stochastic Stokes' drift. These results reinforce the impression that dichotomous noise can be put on a par with Gaussian white noise as far as obtaining analytical results is concerned. They convincingly illustrate the interplay between noise and nonlinearity in generating nontrivial behaviors of nonequilibrium systems and point to various practical applications.

This method accounts for both elastic and non-elastic deformations of the sample during the test and is applied to a hardened class G oil well cement paste. An initial hydrostatic undrained loading is applied to the sample. The generated excess pore pressure is then released at one end of the sample while monitoring the pore pressure at the other end and the radial strain in the middle of the sample during the dissipation of the pore pressure. These measurements are back analysed to evaluate the permeability and its evolution with porosity change. The effect of creep of the sample during the test on the measured pore pressure and volume change is taken into account in the analysis. This approach permits to calibrate a power law permeability-porosity relationship for the tested hardened cement paste. The porosity sensitivity exponent of the power-law is evaluated equal to 11 and is shown to be mostly independent of the stress level and of the creep strains. 	
0909.1588v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/0909.1588v1	2009	Surveying Diffusion in Complex Geometries. An Essay	Denis Grebenkov	  The surrounding world surprises us by the beauty and variety of complex shapes that emerge from nanometric to macroscopic scales. Natural or manufactured materials (sandstones, sedimentary rocks and cement), colloidal solutions (proteins and DNA), biological cells, tissues and organs (lungs, kidneys and placenta), they all present irregularly shaped "scenes" for a fundamental transport "performance", that is, diffusion. Here, the geometrical complexity, entangled with the stochastic character of diffusive motion, results in numerous fascinating and sometimes unexpected effects like diffusion screening or localization. These effects control many diffusion-mediated processes that play an important role in heterogeneous catalysis, biochemical mechanisms, electrochemistry, growth phenomena, oil recovery, or building industry. In spite of a long and rich history of academic and industrial research in this field, it is striking to see how little we know about diffusion in complex geometries, especially the one which occurs in three dimensions.   We present our recent results on restricted diffusion. We look into the role of geometrical complexity at different levels, from boundary microroughness to hierarchical structure and connectivity of the whole diffusion-confining domain. We develop a new approach which consists in combining fast random walk algorithms with spectral tools. The main focus is on studying diffusion in model complex geometries (von Koch boundaries, Kitaoka acinus, etc.), as well as on developing and testing spectral methods. We aim at extending this knowledge and at applying the accomplished arsenal of theoretical and numerical tools to structures found in nature and industry.

At about 350\degree;C cracks nucleated in the sample, and as the temperature continued to increase, these cracks propagated parallel to shale bedding and coalesced, thus cutting across the sample. Thermogravimetry and gas chromatography revealed that the fracturing occurring at ~350\degree;C was associated with significant mass loss and release of light hydrocarbons generated by the decomposition of immature organic matter. Kerogen decomposition is thought to cause an internal pressure build up sufficient to form cracks in the shale, thus providing pathways for the outgoing hydrocarbons. We show that a 2D numerical model based on this idea qualitatively reproduces the experimentally observed dynamics of crack nucleation, growth and coalescence, as well as the irregular outlines of the cracks. Our results provide a new description of fracture pattern formation in low permeability shales.

Malyshkov|Vasily F. Gordeev|Sergey G. Shtalin|Vitaly I. Polivach|Yury Yu. Bazhanov|Terje Hauan	  When applying the Earth's natural pulse electromagnetic fields to geophysical prospecting one should take into account characteristics of their spatial and temporal variations. ENPEMF is known to include both pulses attributed to atmospheric thunderstorms and pulses generated in the lithosphere by mechanic-to-electric energy conversion in rocks. It is evident that the most valuable information on the geophysical structure of a certain area is obviously contained in pulses originated from this area. This article covers a method of recording spatial variations of the Earth's natural pulse electromagnetic fields which is able to take due account of spatial and temporal variations of EM fields and suits to reveal crustal structural and lithologic heterogeneities including hydrocarbon pools. We use a system of several stations recording the ENPEMF concurrently to erase the temporal variations from ENPEMF records and to sort out the pulses of local and remote origin. Some stations are fixed (reference) and record only temporal variations of EM fields. While the other stations are mobile and measure pulse characteristics related to both spatial and temporal ENPEMF variations along measurement routes crossing the area investigated. Spatial variations of EM fields left after having deleted the temporal variations and pulses generated out of the area investigate show the availability or the lack of geophysical anomalies. 	
1102.2283v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1102.2283v1	2011	The role of space in the exploitation of resources	Yun Kang|Nicolas Lanchier	  In order to understand the role of space in ecological communities where each species produces a certain type of resource and has varying abilities to exploit the resources produced by its own species and by the other species, we carry out a comparative study of an interacting particle system and its mean-field approximation. For a wide range of parameter values, we show both analytically and numerically that the spatial model results in predictions that significantly differ from its nonspatial counterpart, indicating that the use of the mean-field approach to describe the evolution of communities in which individuals only interact locally is invalid. In two-species communities, the disagreements between the models appear either when both species compete by producing resources that are more beneficial for their own species or when both species cooperate by producing resources that are more beneficial for the other species. In particular, while both species coexist if and only if they cooperate in the mean-field approximation, the inclusion of space in the form of local interactions may prevent coexistence even in cooperative communities. Introducing additional species, cooperation is no longer the only mechanism that promotes coexistence. We prove that, in three-species communities, coexistence results either from a global cooperative behavior, or from rock-paper-scissors type interactions, or from a mixture of these dynamics, which excludes in particular all cases in which two species compete.

Nesmachnow	  Granular materials of different sizes are present on the surface of several atmosphere-less Solar System bodies. The phenomena related to granular materials have been studied in the framework of the discipline called Granular Physics; that has been studied experimentally in the laboratory and, in the last decades, by performing numerical simulations. The Discrete Element Method simulates the mechanical behavior of a media formed by a set of particles which interact through their contact points. The difficulty in reproducing vacuum and low-gravity environments makes numerical simulations the most promising technique in the study of granular media under these conditions. In this work, relevant processes in minor bodies of the Solar System are studied using the Discrete Element Method. Results of simulations of size segregation in low-gravity environments in the cases of the asteroids Eros and Itokawa are presented. The segregation of particles with different densities was analysed, in particular, the case of comet P/Hartley 2. The surface shaking in these different gravity environments could produce the ejection of particles from the surface at very low relative velocities. The shaking causing the above processes is due to: impacts, explosions like the release of energy by the liberation of internal stresses or the re accommodation of material. Simulations of the passage of impact-induced seismic waves through a granular medium were also performed. We present several applications of the Discrete Element Methods for the study of the physical evolution of agglomerates of rocks under low-gravity environments. 	
1202.4286v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1202.4286v1	2012	A numerical retro-action model relates rocky coast erosion to   percolation theory	Andrea Baldassarri|Bernard Sapoval|Simon Félix	  We discuss various situations where the formation of rocky coast morphology can be attributed to the retro-action of the coast morphology itself on the erosive power of the sea. Destroying the weaker elements of the coast, erosion can creates irregular seashores. In turn, the geometrical irregularity participates in the damping of sea-waves, decreasing their erosive power. There may then exist a mutual self-stabilization of the wave amplitude together with the irregular morphology of the coast. A simple model of this type of stabilization is discussed. The resulting coastline morphologies are diverse, depending mainly on the morphology/damping coupling. In the limit case of weak coupling, the process spontaneously builds fractal morphologies with a dimension close to 4/3. This provides a direct connection between the coastal erosion problem and the theory of percolation. For strong coupling, rugged but non-fractal coasts may emerge during the erosion process, and we investigate a geometrical characterization in these cases. The model is minimal, but can be extended to take into account heterogeneity in the rock lithology and various initial conditions. This allows to mimic coastline complexity, well beyond simple fractality. Our results suggest that the irregular morphology of coastlines as well as the stochastic nature of erosion are deeply connected with the critical aspects of percolation phenomena. 	
1202.5198v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1202.5198v1	2012	Network Theory, Cracking and Frictional Sliding	H. O. Ghaffari|R. P. Young	  We have developed different network approaches to complex patterns of frictional interfaces (contact areas developments). Here, we analyze the dynamics of static friction. We found, under the correlation measure, the fraction of triangles correlates with the detachment fronts. Also, for all types of the loops (such as triangles), there is a universal power law between nodes' degree and motifs where motifs frequency follow a power law. This shows high energy localization is characterized by fast variation of the loops fraction. Also, this proves that the congestion of loops occurs around hubs. Furthermore, the motif distributions and modularity space of networks -in terms of within-module degree and participation coefficient- show universal trends, indicating an in common aspect of energy flow in shear ruptures. Moreover, we confirmed that slow ruptures generally hold small localization, while regular ruptures carry a high level of energy localization. We proposed that assortativity, as an index to correlation of node's degree, can uncover acoustic features of the interfaces. We showed that increasing assortativity induces a nearly silent period of fault's activities. Also, we proposed that slow ruptures resulted from within-module developments rather than extra-modules of the networks. Our approach presents a completely new perspective of the evolution of shear ruptures.

Turner	  Modeling important engineering problems related to flow-induced damage (in the context of hydraulic fracturing among others) depends critically on characterizing the interaction of porous media and interstitial fluid flow. This work presents a new formulation for incorporating the effects of pore pressure in a nonlocal representation of solid mechanics. The result is a framework for modeling fluid-structure interaction problems with the discontinuity capturing advantages of an integral based formulation. A number of numerical examples are used to show that the proposed formulation can be applied to measure the effect of leak-off during hydraulic fracturing as well as modeling consolidation of fluid saturated rock and surface subsidence caused by fluid extraction from a geologic reservoir. The formulation incorporates the effect of pore pressure in the constitutive description of the porous material in a way that is appropriate for nonlinear materials, easily implemented in existing codes, straightforward in its evaluation (no history dependence), and justifiable from first principles. A mixture theory approach is used (deviating only slightly where necessary) to motivate an alteration to the peridynamic pressure term based on the fluid pore pressure. The resulting formulation has a number of similarities to the effective stress principle developed by Terzaghi and Biot and close correspondence is shown between the proposed method and the classical effective stress principle.

In this article, we extend this approach to animal behavior, showing that an analysis of an interactive situation involving a mating competition between certain lizard morphs allows to identify a quantum theoretic structure. More in particular, we show that when this lizard competition is analyzed structurally in the light of a compound entity consisting of subentities, the contextuality provided by the presence of an underlying rock-paper-scissors cyclic dynamics leads to a violation of Bell's inequality, which means it is of a non-classical type. We work out an explicit quantum-mechanical representation in Hilbert space for the lizard situation and show that it faithfully models a set of experimental data collected on three throat-colored morphs of a specific lizard species. Furthermore, we investigate the Hilbert space modeling, and show that the states describing the lizard competitions contain entanglement for each one of the considered confrontations of lizards with different competing strategies, which renders it no longer possible to interpret these states of the competing lizards as compositions of states of the individual lizards.

Investigation on its mechanism sheds light on the understanding and controlling of the formation of solidifying metals,earth's core, igneous rock and sea ice. Until now, it still remains controversial what composes the density contrasts and, to what extent, how it affects channel segregates. Here, we show that in experimental 500kg and 100 ton commercial cast steel ingots CS originates from oxide Al2O3/MnS impurity clusters (OICs) initially nucleated from the oxide (Al2O3) particles, which induce an extra flow due to sharp density contrast between clusters and melt. The results uncover that, as OICs enrich and grow, their driven flow becomes stronger than the traditionally recognized inter-dendritic thermo-solutal convection, dominating the subsequent opening of the channels. This study extends the classical macrosegregation theory, highlights a significant technological breakthrough to control CS, and could quickly yield practical benefits to the worldwide manufacture of over 50 million tons of ingots, super-thick slab and heavy castings annually, as well as has general implications for the elaboration of other related natural phenomena.

Sawatzky	  We study a model for the metal-insulator (MI) transition in the rare-earth nickelates RNiO$_3$, based upon a negative charge transfer energy and coupling to a rock-salt like lattice distortion of the NiO$_6$ octahedra. Using exact diagonalization and the Hartree-Fock approximation we demonstrate that electrons couple strongly to these distortions. For small distortions the system is metallic, with ground state of predominantly $d^8\ligand$ character, where $\ligand$ denotes a ligand hole. For sufficiently large distortions ($\delta d_{\rm Ni-O} \sim 0.05 - 0.10\AA$), however, a gap opens at the Fermi energy as the system enters a periodically distorted state alternating along the three crystallographic axes, with $(d^8\ligand^2)_{S=0}(d^8)_{S=1}$ character, where $S$ is the total spin. Thus the MI transition may be viewed as being driven by an internal volume "collapse" where the NiO$_6$ octahedra with two ligand holes shrink around their central Ni, while the remaining octahedra expand accordingly, resulting in the ($1/2,1/2,1/2$) superstructure observed in x-ray diffraction in the insulating phase. This insulating state is an example of a new type of charge ordering achieved without any actual movement of the charge.

It is proposed that cell-free RNA replication in the primordial soup may have been driven by self-sustained oscillatory thermochemical reactions. To test this hypothesis a well-characterised hydrogen peroxide oscillator was chosen as the driver and complementary RNA strands with known association and melting kinetics were used as the substrate. An open flow system model for the self-consistent, coupled evolution of the temperature and concentrations in a simple autocatalytic scheme is solved numerically, and it is shown that thermochemical cycling drives replication of the RNA strands. For the (justifiably realistic) values of parameters chosen for the simulated example system, the mean amount of replicant produced at steady state is 6.56 times the input amount, given a constant supply of substrate species. The spontaneous onset of sustained thermochemical oscillations via slowly drifting parameters is demonstrated, and a scheme is given for prebiotic production of complementary RNA strands on rock surfaces. 	
1406.3340v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.3340v1	2014	From pairwise to group interactions in games of cyclic dominance	Attila Szolnoki|Jeromos Vukov|Matjaz Perc	  We study the rock-paper-scissors game in structured populations, where the invasion rates determine individual payoffs that govern the process of strategy change. The traditional version of the game is recovered if the payoffs for each potential invasion stem from a single pairwise interaction. However, the transformation of invasion rates to payoffs also allows the usage of larger interaction ranges. In addition to the traditional pairwise interaction, we therefore consider simultaneous interactions with all nearest neighbors, as well as with all nearest and next-nearest neighbors, thus effectively going from single pair to group interactions in games of cyclic dominance. We show that differences in the interaction range affect not only the stationary fractions of strategies, but also their relations of dominance. The transition from pairwise to group interactions can thus decelerate and even revert the direction of the invasion between the competing strategies. Like in evolutionary social dilemmas, in games of cyclic dominance too the indirect multipoint interactions that are due to group interactions hence play a pivotal role. Our results indicate that, in addition to the invasion rates, the interaction range is at least as important for the maintenance of biodiversity among cyclically competing strategies.

Cha	  SnTe is a topological crystalline insulator that possesses spin-polarized, Dirac-dispersive surface states protected by crystal symmetry. Multiple surface states exist on the {100}, {110}, and {111} surfaces of SnTe, with the band structure of surface states depending on the mirror symmetry of a particular surface. Thus, to access surface states selectively, it is critical to control the morphology of SnTe such that only desired crystallographic surfaces are present. Here, we grow SnTe nanostructures using vapor-liquid-solid and vapor-solid growth mechanisms. Previously, SnTe nanowires and nanocrystals have been grown.1-4 In this report, we demonstrate synthesis of SnTe nanoplates with lateral dimensions spanning tens of microns and thicknesses of a hundred nanometers. The top and bottom surfaces are either (100) or (111), maximizing topological surface states on these surfaces. Magnetotransport on these SnTe nanoplates shows high bulk carrier density, consistent with bulk SnTe crystals arising due to defects such as Sn vacancies. In addition, we observe a structural phase transition in these nanoplates from the high temperature rock salt to low temperature rhombohedral structure. For nanoplates with very high carrier density, we observe a slight upturn in resistance at low temperatures, indicating electron-electron interactions.

Park|V. Bozza	  The co-planarity of solar-system planets led Kant to suggest that they formed from an accretion disk, and the discovery of hundreds of such disks around young stars as well as hundreds of co-planar planetary systems by the Kepler satellite demonstrate that this formation mechanism is extremely widespread. Many moons in the solar system, such as the Galilean moons of Jupiter, also formed out of the accretion disks that coalesced into the giant planets. We report here the discovery of an intermediate system OGLE-2013-BLG-0723LB/Bb composed of a Venus-mass planet orbiting a brown dwarf, which may be viewed either as a scaled down version of a planet plus star or as a scaled up version of a moon plus planet orbiting a star. The latter analogy can be further extended since they orbit in the potential of a larger, stellar body. For ice-rock companions formed in the outer parts of accretion disks, like Uranus and Callisto, the scaled masses and separations of the three types of systems are similar, leading us to suggest that formation processes of companions within accretion disks around stars, brown dwarfs, and planets are similar.

The nature (Fickian or not) of dispersion is determined by studying variations of the mixing front as a function of the traveled distance but also as a function of the lateral scale over which the tracer concentration is averaged. The dominant convective dispersion mechanisms (velocity profile in the gap, velocity variations in the fracture plane) are established by comparing measurements using Newtonian and shear thinning fluids. For small monodisperse rugosities, front spreading is diffusive with a dominant geometrical dispersion (dispersion coefficient $D \propto Pe$) at low P\'eclet numbers $Pe$; at higher $Pe$ values one has either $D \propto Pe^2$ ({\it i.e.} Taylor dispersion) for obstacles of height smaller than the gap or $D \propto Pe^{1.35}$ for obstacles bridging the gap. For a self affine multiscale roughness like in actual rocks and a relative shear displacement $\vec{\delta}$ of complementary walls, the aperture field is channelized in the direction perpendicular to $\delta$. For a mean velocity $\vec{U}$ parallel to the channels, the global front geometry reflects the velocity contrast between them and is predicted from the aperture field. For $\vec{U}$ perpendicular to the channels, global front spreading is much reduced. Local spreading of the front thickness remains mostly controlled by Taylor dispersion except in the case of a very strong channelization parallel to $\vec U$. 	
1411.4245v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4245v2	2015	How turbulence regulates biodiversity in systems with cyclic competition	Daniel Groselj|Frank Jenko|Erwin Frey	  Cyclic, nonhierarchical interactions among biological species represent a general mechanism by which ecosystems are able to maintain high levels of biodiversity. However, species coexistence is often possible only in spatially extended systems with a limited range of dispersal, whereas in well-mixed environments models for cyclic competition often lead to a loss of biodiversity. Here we consider the dispersal of biological species in a fluid environment, where mixing is achieved by a combination of advection and diffusion. In particular, we perform a detailed numerical analysis of a model composed of turbulent advection, diffusive transport, and cyclic interactions among biological species in two spatial dimensions and discuss the circumstances under which biodiversity is maintained when external environmental conditions, such as resource supply, are uniform in space. Cyclic interactions are represented by a model with three competitors, resembling the children's game of rock-paper-scissors, whereas the flow field is obtained from a direct numerical simulation of two-dimensional turbulence with hyperviscosity. It is shown that the space-averaged dynamics undergoes bifurcations as the relative strengths of advection and diffusion compared to biological interactions are varied. 	
1504.03276v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.03276v1	2015	Is the Shroud of Turin in Relation to the Old Jerusalem Historical   Earthquake?	Alberto Carpinteri|Giuseppe Lacidogna|Oscar Borla	  Phillips and Hedges suggested, in the scientific magazine Nature (1989), that neutron radiation could be liable of a wrong radiocarbon dating, while proton radiation could be responsible of the Shroud body image formation. On the other hand, no plausible physical reason has been proposed so far to explain the radiation source origin, and its effects on the linen fibres. However, some recent studies, carried out by the first author and his Team at the Laboratory of Fracture Mechanics of the Politecnico di Torino, found that it is possible to generate neutron emissions from very brittle rock specimens in compression through piezonuclear fission reactions. Analogously, neutron flux increments, in correspondence to seismic activity, should be a result of the same reactions. A group of Russian scientists measured a neutron flux exceeding the background level by three orders of magnitude in correspondence to rather appreciable earthquakes (4th degree in Richter Scale). The authors consider the possibility that neutron emissions by earthquakes could have induced the image formation on Shroud linen fibres, trough thermal neutron capture by Nitrogen nuclei, and provided a wrong radiocarbon dating due to an increment in C(14,6)content. Let us consider that, although the calculated integral flux of 10^13 neutrons per square centimetre is 10 times greater than the cancer therapy dose, nevertheless it is100 times smaller than the lethal dose.

Picoli|E. K. Lenzi|R. S. Mendes	  We report on an extensive characterization of the cracking noise produced by charcoal samples when dampened with ethanol. We argue that the evaporation of ethanol causes transient and irregularly distributed internal stresses that promote the fragmentation of the samples and mimic some situations found in mining processes. The results show that, in general, the most fundamental seismic laws ruling earthquakes (Gutenberg-Richter law, unified scaling law for the recurrence times, Omori's law, productivity law and Bath's law) hold under the conditions of the experiment. Some discrepancies were also identified (a smaller exponent in Gutenberg-Richter law, a stationary behavior in the aftershock rates for long times and a double power-law relationship in productivity law) and related to the different loading condition. Our results thus corroborate to elucidate the parallel between seismic laws and fracture experiments caused by a more complex loading condition that also occurs in natural and induced seismicity (such as long-term fluid injection and gas-rock outbursts in mining processes).

A plausible explanation is that methane could have been produced either by hydrothermal alteration of basaltic crust or by serpentinization of ultramafic rocks producing hydrogen and reducing crustal carbon into methane. Once formed, methane storage on Mars is commonly associated with the presence of hidden clathrate reservoirs. Here, we alternatively suggest that chabazite and clinoptilolite, which belong to the family of zeolites, may form a plausible storage reservoir of methane in the martian subsurface. Because of the existence of many volcanic terrains, zeolites are expected to be widespread on Mars and their Global Equivalent Layer may range up to more than $\sim$1 km, according to the most optimistic estimates. If the martian methane present in chabazite and clinoptilolite is directly sourced from an abiotic source in the subsurface, the destabilization of a localized layer of a few millimeters per year may be sufficient to explain the current observations. The sporadic release of methane from these zeolites requires that they also remained isolated from the atmosphere during its evolution. The methane release over the ages could be due to several mechanisms such as impacts, seismic activity or erosion. If the methane outgassing from excavated chabazite and/or clinoptilolite prevails on Mars, then the presence of these zeolites around Gale Crater could explain the variation of methane level observed by Mars Science Laboratory.

Bunger	  High flow rate, water-driven hydraulic fractures are more common now than ever in the oil and gas industry. Although the fractures are small, the high injection rate and low viscosity of the water, lead to high Reynolds numbers and potentially turbulence in the fracture. Here we present a semi-analytical solution for a blade-shaped (PKN) geometry hydraulic fracture driven by a turbulent fluid in the limit of zero fluid leak-off to the formation. We model the turbulence in the PKN fracture using the Gaukler-Manning-Strickler parametrization, which relates the the flow rate of the water to the pressure gradient along the fracture. The key parameter in this relation is the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor for the roughness of the crack wall. Coupling this turbulence parametrization with conservation of mass allows us to write a nonlinear pde for the crack width as a function of space and time. By way of a similarity ansatz, we obtain a semi-analytical solution using an orthogonal polynomial series. Embedding the asymptotic behavior near the fracture tip into the polynomial series, we find very rapid convergence: a suitably accurate solution is obtained with two terms of the series. This closed-form solution facilitates clear comparisons between the results and parameters for laminar and turbulent hydraulic fractures. In particular, it resolves one of the well known problems whereby calibration of models to data has difficulty simultaneously matching the hydraulic fracture length and wellbore pressure. 	
1701.01177v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.01177v2	2017	The Width Distribution of Loops and Strands in the Solar Corona -- Are   we Hitting Rock Bottom ?	Markus J. Aschwanden|Hard Peter	  In this study we analyze {\sl Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA)} and Hi-C images in order to investigate absolute limits for the finest loop strands. We develop a model of the occurrence-size distribution function of coronal loop widths, characterized by a lower limit of widths $w_{min}$, a peak width $w_p$, a peak occurrence number $n_p$, and a power law slope $a$. Our data analysis includes automated tracing of curvi-linear features with the OCCULT-2 code, automated sampling of the cross-sectional widths of coronal loops, and fitting of the theoretical size distribution to the observed distribution. With Monte-Carlo simulations and variable pixel sizes $\Delta x$ we derive a first diagnostic criterion to discriminate whether the loop widths are unresolved $(w_p/\Delta x \approx 2.5\pm0.2)$, or fully resolved (if $w_p/\Delta x > 2.7$). For images with resolved loop widths we can apply a second diagnostic criterion that predicts the lower limit of loop widths, $w_{min} \approx 3 (\Delta x_{crit}-0.37")$ as a function of the critical resolution $\Delta x_{crit}$. We find that the loop widths are marginally resolved in AIA images, but are fully resolved in Hi-C images, where our model predicts a lower limit of loop widths at $w_{min} \approx 100$ km and a most frequent (peak) value at $w_p \approx 300$ km, in agreement with recent results of Brooks et al. This result agrees with the statistics of photospheric granulation sizes and thus supports coronal heating mechanisms operating on the macroscopic scale of photospheric magneto-convection, rather than nanoflare heating models with unresolved microscopic scales.

G. S. Ramos	  We demonstrate the presence of chaos in stochastic simulations that are widely used to study biodiversity in nature. The investigation deals with a set of three distinct species that evolve according to the standard rules of mobility, reproduction and predation, with predation following the cyclic rules of the popular rock, paper and scissors game. The study uncovers the possibility to distinguish between time evolutions that start from slightly different initial states, guided by the Hamming distance which heuristically unveils the chaotic behavior. The finding opens up a quantitative approach that relates the correlation length to the average density of maxima of a typical species, and an ensemble of stochastic simulations is implemented to support the procedure. The main result of the work shows how a single and simple experimental realization that counts the density of maxima associated with the chaotic evolution of the species serves to infer its correlation length. We use the result to investigate others distinct complex systems, one dealing with a set of differential equations that can be used to model a diversity of natural and artificial chaotic systems, and another one, focusing on the ocean water level.

This decrease known as "slow dynamics" occurs at time scales larger than the period of the forcing. Also, hysteresis is observed in the steady-state response. The phenomenological model by Vakhnenko et al. is based on a variable that describes the softening of the material [Phys. Rev. E 70-1, 2004]. However, this model is 1D and it is not thermodynamically admissible. In the present article, a 3D model is derived in the framework of the finite strain theory. An internal variable that describes the softening of the material is introduced, as well as an expression of the specific internal energy. A mechanical constitu-tive law is deduced from the Clausius-Duhem inequality. Moreover, a family of evolution equations for the internal variable is proposed. Here, an evolution equation with one relaxation time is chosen. By construction, this new model of continuum is thermodynamically admissible and dissipative (inelas-tic). In the case of small uniaxial deformations, it is shown analytically that the model reproduces qualitatively the main features of real experiments.

The thin film exhibits a small in-plane crystal mosaic of 0.22 deg, in terms of the FWHM (full-width-at-half-maximum) of x-ray rocking curve, and an excellent out-of-plane orientation by x-ray phi-scan. Its bulk superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of 42.4 K is characterized by both zero electrical resistance and diamagnetization measurements. The upper critical field (Hc2) is estimated to be 79.5 T and 443 T, respectively, for the magnetic field perpendicular and parallel to the ab plane. Moreover, a large critical current density (Jc) of a value over 0.5 MA/cm2 is achieved at ~20 K. Such a (Li1-xFex)OHFeSe film is therefore not only important to the fundamental research for understanding the high-Tc mechanism, but also promising in the field of high-Tc superconductivity application, especially in high-performance electronic devices and large scientific facilities such as superconducting accelerator.

Rucklidge	  We study the influence of a randomly switching reproduction-predation rate on the survival behavior of the non-spatial cyclic Lotka-Volterra model, also known as the zero-sum rock-paper-scissors game, used to metaphorically describe the cyclic competition between three species. In large and finite populations, demographic fluctuations (internal noise) drive two species to extinction in a finite time, while the species with the smallest reproduction-predation rate is the most likely to be the surviving one ("law of the weakest"). Here, we model environmental (external) noise by assuming that the reproduction-predation rate of the "strongest species" (the fastest to reproduce/predate) in a given static environment randomly switches between two values corresponding to more and less favorable external conditions. We study the joint effect of environmental and demographic noise on the species survival probabilities and on the mean extinction time. In particular, we investigate whether the survival probabilities follow the law of the weakest and analyze their dependence of the external noise intensity and switching rate. Remarkably, when, on average, there is a finite number of switches prior to extinction, the survival probability of the predator of the species whose reaction rate switches typically varies non-monotonically with the external noise intensity (with optimal survival about a critical noise strength). We also outline the relationship with the case where all reaction rates switch on markedly different time scales.

Chan	  PbTe, one of the most promising thermoelectric materials, has recently demonstrated thermoelectric figure of merit ($ZT$) of above 2.0 when alloyed with group II elements. The improvements are due mainly to significant reduction of lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{l}$), which was in turn attributed to nanoparticle precipitates. However, a fundamental understanding of various phonon scattering mechanisms within the bulk alloy is still lacking. In this work, we apply the newly-developed density-functional-theory (DFT)-based compressive sensing lattice dynamics (CSLD) approach to model lattice heat transport in PbTe, MTe, and Pb$_{0.94}$M$_{0.06}$Te (M=Mg, Ca, Sr and Ba), compare our results with experimental measurements, with focus on strain effect and mass disorder scattering. We find that (1) CaTe, SrTe and BaTe in the rock-salt structure exhibit much higher $\kappa_{l}$ than PbTe, while MgTe in the same structure shows anomalously low $\kappa_{l}$; (2) lattice heat transport of PbTe is extremely sensitive to static strain induced by alloying atoms in solid solution form; (3) mass disorder scattering plays a major role in reducing $\kappa_{l}$ for Mg/Ca/Sr-alloyed PbTe through strongly suppressing the lifetimes of intermediate- and high-frequency phonons, while for Ba-alloyed PbTe, precipitated nanoparticles are also important. 	
1801.06652v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.06652v1	2018	Reactive transport under stress: Permeability evolution in deformable   porous media	Roi Roded|Xavier Paredes|Ran Holtzman	  We study reactive transport in a stressed porous media, where dissolution of the solid matrix causes two simultaneous, competing effects: pore enlargement (chemical deformation), and pore compaction due to mechanical weakening. A novel, mechanistic pore-scale model simulates flooding of a sample under fixed confining stress, showing that increasing stress inhibits permeability enhancement, increasing the injected volume required to reach a certain permeability, in agreement with recent experiments. We explain this behavior by stress concentration downstream, in the less dissolved (hence stiffer) region. As this region is also less conductive, even its small compaction has a strong bottleneck effect that curbs the permeability.   Our results also elucidate that the impact of stress depends on the dissolution regime. Under wormholing conditions (slow injection, i.e. high Damkohler, $Da$), the development of a sharp dissolution front and high porosity contrast accentuates the bottleneck effect. This reduces transport heterogeneity, promoting wormhole competition. Once the outlet starts eroding, the extreme focusing of transport and hence dissolution--characteristic of wormholing--becomes dominant, diminishing the bottleneck effect and hence the impact of stress. In contrast, at low $Da$, incomplete reaction upstream allows the reagent to traverse the sample, causing a more uniform dissolution. The continuous dissolution and its partial counteraction by compaction downstream provides a steady, gradual increase in the effect of stress. Consequently, the impact of stress is more pronounced at high $Da$ during early stages (low permeability), and at low $Da$ close to breakthrough. Our work promotes understanding of the hydromechanical property evolution, with important implications for processes ranging from diagenesis and weathering of rocks, to well stimulation and carbon geosequetration.

Radu|Eirik Keilegavlen|Kundan Kumar|Kristine Spildo	  We study a heuristic, core-scale model for the transport of polymer particles in a two phase (oil and water) porous medium. We are motivated by recent experimental observations which report increased oil recovery when polymers are injected after the initial waterflood. The recovery mechanism is believed to be microscopic diversion of the flow, where injected particles can accumulate in narrow pore throats and clog it, in a process known as a log-jamming effect. The blockage of the narrow pore channels lead to a microscopic diversion of the water flow, causing a redistribution of the local pressure, which again can lead to the mobilization of trapped oil, enhancing its recovery. Our objective herein is to develop a core-scale model that is consistent with the observed production profiles. We show that previously obtained experimental results can be qualitatively explained by a simple two-phase flow model with an additional transport equation for the polymer particles. A key aspect of the formulation is that the microscopic heterogeneity of the rock and a dynamic altering of the permeability must be taken into account in the rate equations.

Oren	  A quantitative comparison between the experimental microstructure of a sedimentary rock and three theoretical models for the same rock is presented. The microstructure of the rock sample (Fontainebleau sandstone) was obtained by microtomography. Two of the models are stochastic models based on correlation function reconstruction, and one model is based on sedimentation, compaction and diagenesis combined with input from petrographic analysis. The porosity of all models closely match that of the experimental sample and two models have also the same two point correlation function as the experimental sample. We compute quantitative differences and similarities between the various microstructures by a method based on local porosity theory. Differences are found in the degree of anisotropy, and in fluctuations of porosity and connectivity. The stochastic models differ strongly from the real sandstone in their connectivity properties, and hence need further refinement when used to model transport.

Snyder	  Though Einstein and other physicists recognized the importance of an observer being at rest in an inertial reference frame for the special theory of relativity, the supporting psychological structures were not discussed much by physicists. On the other hand, Rock, a psychologist, wrote of the factors involved in the perception of motion, including one's own motion. Rock thus came to discuss issues of significance to relativity theory, apparently without any significant understanding of how his theory might be related to relativity theory. In this paper, connections between Rock's theory on the perception of one's own motion, as well as empirical work supporting it, and relativity theory are explored. 	
1205.6299v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1205.6299v1	2012	Interaction between Injection Points during Hydraulic Fracturing	Kjetil M. D. Hals|Inga Berre	  We present a model of the hydraulic fracturing of heterogeneous poroelastic media. The formalism is an effective continuum model that captures the coupled dynamics of the fluid pressure and the fractured rock matrix and models both the tensile and shear failure of the rock. As an application of the formalism, we study the geomechanical stress interaction between two injection points during hydraulic fracturing (hydrofracking) and how this interaction influences the fracturing process. For injection points that are separated by less than a critical correlation length, we find that the fracturing process around each point is strongly correlated with the position of the neighboring point. The magnitude of the correlation length depends on the degree of heterogeneity of the rock and is on the order of 30-45 m for rocks with low permeabilities. In the strongly correlated regime, we predict a novel effective fracture-force that attracts the fractures toward the neighboring injection point.

Thorarinsson	  For a broad range of values of magnetic monopole mass and charge, the abundance of monopoles trapped inside the Earth would be expected to be enhanced in the mantle beneath the geomagnetic poles. A search for magnetic monopoles was conducted using the signature of an induced persistent current following the passage of igneous rock samples through a SQUID-based magnetometer. A total of 24.6 kg of rocks from various selected sites, among which 23.4 kg are mantle-derived rocks from the Arctic and Antarctic areas, was analysed. No monopoles were found and a 90% confidence level upper limit of $9.8\cdot 10^{-5}$/gram is set on the monopole density in the search samples.

Andres	  Pools of carbon dioxide are found in natural geological accumulations and in engineered storage in saline aquifers. It has been thought that once this CO2 dissolves in the formation water, making it denser, convection streams will transport it efficiently to depth, but this may not be so. Here, we assess theoretically and experimentally the impact of natural chemical reactions between the dissolved CO2 and the rock formation on the convection streams in the subsurface. We show that, while in carbonate rocks the streaming of dissolved carbon dioxide persists, the chemical interactions in silicate-rich rocks may curb this transport drastically and even inhibit it altogether. These results challenge our view of carbon sequestration and dissolution rates in the subsurface, suggesting that pooled carbon dioxide may remain in the shallower regions of the formation for hundreds to thousands of years. The deeper regions of the reservoir can remain virtually carbon free.

Singh|S. Mathimalar|A. Garai|V. Nanal|R. G. Pillay|K. G. Bhushan	  The neutron flux at low energy ($E_n\leq15$ MeV) resulting from the radioactivity of the rock in the underground cavern of the India-based Neutrino Observatory is estimated using Geant4-based Monte Carlo simulations. The neutron production rate due to the spontaneous fission of $^{235, 238}$U, $^{232}$Th and ($\alpha, n$) interactions in the rock is determined employing the actual rock composition. It is been shown that the total flux is equivalent to a finite size cylindrical rock ($D=L=140$ cm) element. The energy integrated neutron flux thus obtained at the centre of the underground tunnel is 2.76 (0.47) $\times 10^{-6}\rm~n ~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}$. The estimated neutron flux is of the same order ($\sim10^{-6}\rm~n ~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}$)~as measured in other underground laboratories.

We prove a conjecture of Turner asserting that a certain idempotent truncation of a RoCK block of weight $d$ of a symmetric group $\mathfrak S_n$ defined over a field $F$ of characteristic $e$ is Morita equivalent to the principal block of the wreath product $\mathfrak S_e \wr \mathfrak S_d$. This generalises a theorem of Chuang and Kessar that applies to RoCK blocks with abelian defect groups. Our proof relies crucially on an isomorphism between $F\mathfrak S_n$ and a cyclotomic Khovanov-Lauda-Rouquier algebra, and the Morita equivalence we produce is that of graded algebras. We also prove the analogous result for an Iwahori-Hecke algebra at a root of unity defined over an arbitrary field.

Rocking curves were measured versus 267 nm (UV) pump- 0.154 nm probe delay time. Curve width broadening, peak diffracted intensity and angular shift were recorded for the range of UV excitation intensities of 2-8 mJ/cm2 . Observed oscillations in time delay dependences of shift, width and of peak intensity of rocking curves are correlated, as described by acoustic pulse bouncing between crystal surfaces. In (111) Au, acoustic pulse originates from pump absorption layer, and peak intensity drops by a factor of two (at delay time at which sonic wave reaches Au-substrate boundary) of its initial value prior to absorption of laser pulse. In Cu, correlated rocking curves dynamics is also observed, however buildup of rocking curve broadening is faster than one can expect from sonic wavepacket originating in pump absorption layer. This effect is attributed to acoustic phonon generation outside of pump absorption layer, it is much stronger in Cu than in Au. Phonon generation in Cu is distributed throughout the whole bulk of crystal due to delocalization of mobile hot electrons diffusing from pump absorption layer.

Kite|David P. Mayer	  Small-crater counts on Mars light-toned sedimentary rock are often inconsistent with any isochron; these data are usually plotted then ignored. We show (using an 18-HiRISE-image, >10^4 crater dataset) that these non-isochron crater counts are often well-fit by a model where crater production is balanced by crater obliteration via steady exhumation. For these regions, we fit erosion rates. We infer that Mars light-toned sedimentary rocks typically erode at ~10^2 nm/yr, when averaged over 10 km^2 scales and 10^7-10^8 yr timescales. Crater-based erosion-rate determination is consistent with independent techniques, but can be applied to nearly all light-toned sedimentary rocks on Mars. Erosion is swift enough that radiolysis cannot destroy complex organic matter at some locations (e.g. paleolake deposits at SW Melas), but radiolysis is a severe problem at other locations (e.g. Oxia Planum). The data suggest that the relief of the Valles Marineris mounds is currently being reduced by wind erosion, and that dust production on Mars <3 Gya greatly exceeds the modern reservoir of mobile dust. 	
1710.05608v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.05608v1	2017	Correlated microtiming deviations in jazz and rock music	Mathias Sogorski|Theo Geisel|Viola Priesemann	  Musical rhythms performed by humans typically show temporal fluctuations. While they have been characterized in simple rhythmic tasks, it is an open question what is the nature of temporal fluctuations, when several musicians perform music jointly in all its natural complexity. To study such fluctuations in over 100 original jazz and rock/pop recordings played with and without metronome we developed a semi-automated workflow allowing the extraction of cymbal beat onsets with millisecond precision. Analyzing the inter-beat interval (IBI) time series revealed evidence for two long-range correlated processes characterized by power laws in the IBI power spectral densities. One process dominates on short timescales ($t < 8$ beats) and reflects microtiming variability in the generation of single beats. The other dominates on longer timescales and reflects slow tempo variations. Whereas the latter did not show differences between musical genres (jazz vs. rock/pop), the process on short timescales showed higher variability for jazz recordings, indicating that jazz makes stronger use of microtiming fluctuations within a measure than rock/pop. Our results elucidate principles of rhythmic performance and can inspire algorithms for artificial music generation. By studying microtiming fluctuations in original music recordings, we bridge the gap between minimalistic tapping paradigms and expressive rhythmic performances.

Such events are recorded by a reset of 40Ar-36Ar ages and/or impact melts. Here, we investigate the influence of friction and plastic deformation in shock-generated comminuted rocks on the degree of impact heating using the iSALE shock-physics code. We demonstrate that conversion from kinetic to internal energy in the targets with strength occurs during pressure release, and additional heating becomes significant for low-velocity impacts (<10 km/s). This additional heat reduces the impact-velocity thresholds required to heat the targets with the 0.1 projectile mass to temperatures for the onset of Ar loss and melting from 8 and 10 km/s, respectively, for strengthless rocks to 2 and 6 km/s for typical rocks. Our results suggest that the impact conditions required to produce the unique features caused by impact heating span a much wider range than previously thought. 	
0702028v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0702028v2	2008	Rocking and rolling: a can that appears to rock might actually roll	Manoj Srinivasan|Andy Ruina	  A beer bottle or soda can on a table, when slightly tipped and released, falls to an upright position and then rocks up to a somewhat opposite tilt. Superficially this rocking motion involves a collision when the flat circular base of the container slaps the table before rocking up to the opposite tilt. A keen eye notices that the after-slap rising tilt is not generally just diametrically opposite the initial tilt but is veered to one side or the other. Cushman and Duistermaat (2006) recently noticed such veering when a flat disk with rolling boundary conditions is dropped nearly flat. Here, we generalize these rolling disk results to arbitrary axi-symmetric bodies and to frictionless sliding. More specifically, we study motions that almost but do not quite involve a face-down collision of the round container's bottom with the table-top. These motions involve a sudden rapid motion of the contact point around the circular base. Surprisingly, like for the rolling disk, the net angle of motion of this contact point is nearly independent of initial conditions. This angle of turn depends simply on the geometry and mass distribution but not on the moment of inertia about the symmetry axis. We derive simple asymptotic formulas for this "angle of turn" of the contact point and check the result with numerics and with simple experiments. For tall containers (height much bigger than radius) the angle of turn is just over $\pi$ and the sudden rolling motion superficially appears as a nearly symmetric collision leading to leaning on an almost diametrically opposite point on the bottom rim.

Chaotic variation has been used to great advantage on music and dance, but the challenges here are quite different, beginning with the representation. We present a formalized system for transcribing rock climbing problems, then describe a variation generator that is designed to support human route-setters in designing new and interesting climbing problems. This variation generator, termed Strange Beta, combines chaos and machine learning, using the former to introduce novelty and the latter to smooth transitions in a manner that is consistent with the style of the climbs This entails parsing the domain-specific natural language that rock climbers use to describe routes and movement and then learning the patterns in the results. We validated this approach with a pilot study in a small university rock climbing gym, followed by a large blinded study in a commercial climbing gym, in cooperation with experienced climbers and expert route setters. The results show that {\sc Strange Beta} can help a human setter produce routes that are at least as good as, and in some cases better than, those produced in the traditional manner.

Glinsky|Andrea Cortis|Jinsong Chen|Doug Sassen|Howard Rael	  An extension of a previously developed rock physics model is made that quantifies the relationship between the ductile fraction of a brittle/ductile binary mixture and the isotropic seismic reflection response. By making a weak scattering (Born) approximation and plane wave (eikonal) approximation, with a subsequent ordering according to the angle of incidence, singular value decomposition analysis are done to understand the stack weightings, number of stacks, and the type of stacks that will optimally estimate the two fundamental rock physics parameters. Through this angle ordering, it is found that effective wavelets can be used for the stacks up to second order. Finally, it is concluded that the full PP stack and the "full" PS stack are the two optimal stacks needed to estimate the two rock physics parameters. They dominate over both the second order AVO "gradient" stack and the higher order (4th order) PP stack (even at large angles of incidence). Using this result and model based Bayesian inversion, the detectability of the ductile fraction (shown by others to be the important quantity for the geomechanical response of unconventional reservoir fracking) is demonstrated on a model characteristic of the Marcellus shale play.

Stevenson	  Titan's moment of inertia, calculated assuming hydrostatic equilibrium from gravity field data obtained during the Cassini-Huygens mission, implies an internal mass distribution that may be incompatible with complete differentiation. This suggests that Titan may have a mixed ice/rock core, possibly consistent with slow accretion in a gas-starved disk, which may initially spare Titan from widespread ice melting and subsequent differentiation. A partially differentiated Titan, however, must still efficiently remove radiogenic heat over geologic time. We argue that compositional heterogeneity in the major Saturnian satellites indicates that Titan formed from planetesimals with disparate densities. The resulting compositional anomalies would quickly redistribute to form a vertical density gradient that would oppose thermal convection. We use elements of the theory of double-diffusive convection to create a parameterized model for the thermal evolution of ice/rock mixtures with a stabilizing compositional gradient. Simulations are performed for a wide range of initial conditions to account for large uncertainties in material properties and accretionary processes. Ultimately, for realistic density gradients, double-diffusive convection in the ice/rock interior can delay, but not prevent, ice melting and differentiation, even if a substantial fraction of potassium is leached from the rock component. Consequently, Titan is not partially differentiated.

Part II - the formulation of elastoplastic   coupling at large strain	Andrea Piccolroaz|Davide Bigoni|Alessandro Gajo	  The two key phenomena occurring in the process of ceramic powder compaction are the progressive gain in cohesion and the increase of elastic stiffness, both related to the development of plastic deformation. The latter effect is an example of `elastoplastic coupling', in which the plastic flow affects the elastic properties of the material, and has been so far considered only within the framework of small strain assumption (mainly to describe elastic degradation in rock-like materials), so that it remains completely unexplored for large strain. Therefore, a new finite strain generalization of elastoplastic coupling theory is given to describe the mechanical behaviour of materials evolving from a granular to a dense state. The correct account of elastoplastic coupling and of the specific characteristics of materials evolving from a loose to a dense state (for instance, nonlinear --or linear-- dependence of the elastic part of the deformation on the forming pressure in the granular --or dense-- state) makes the use of existing large strain formulations awkward, if even possible. Therfore, first, we have resorted to a very general setting allowing general transformations between work-conjugate stress and strain measures; second, we have introduced the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient and, third, employing isotropy and hyperelasticity of elastic response, we have obtained a relation between the Biot stress and its `total' and `plastic' work-conjugate strain measure. This is a key result, since it allows an immediate achievement of the rate elastoplastic constitutive equations. Knowing the general form of these equations, all the specific laws governing the behaviour of ceramic powders are finally introduced as generalizations of the small strain counterparts given in Part I of this paper.

(1998) proposed Deuterium (DD) fusion at the core-mantle interface of giant planets as a mechanism to explain their observed heat excess. But rather high interior temperatures (~10^5 K) and a stratified D layer are needed, making such a scenario unlikely. In this paper, we re-examine DD fusion, with the addition of screening effects pertinent to a deuterated core containing ice and some heavy elements. This alleviates the extreme temperature constraint and removes the requirement of a stratified D layer. As an application, we propose that, if their core temperatures are a few times 10^4 K and core composition is chemically inhomogeneous, the observed inflated size of some giant exoplanets ("hot Jupiters") may be linked to screened DD fusion occurring deep in the interior. Application of an analytic evolution model suggests that the amount of inflation from this effect can be important if there is sufficient rock-ice in the core, making DD fusion an effective extra internal energy source for radius inflation. The mechanism of screened DD fusion, operating in the above temperature range, is generally consistent with the trend in radius anomaly with planetary equilibrium temperature $T_{\rm eq}$, and also depends on planetary mass. Although we do not consider the effect of incident stellar flux, we expect that a minimum level of irradiation is necessary to trigger core erosion and subsequent DD fusion inside the planet. Since DD fusion is quite sensitive to the screening potential inferred from laboratory experiments, observations of inflated hot Jupiters may help constrain screening effects in the cores of giant planets.

Schimmel|T. G. B. W. Sluijk|P. Steman|J. Venema|P. K. A. de Witt Huberts	  We present measurements of mechanical vibrations induced by 0.6 GeV electrons impinging on cylindrical and spherical aluminium resonators. To monitor the amplitude of the resonator's vibrational modes we used piezoelectric ceramic sensors, calibrated by standard accelerometers. Calculations using the thermo-acoustic conversion model, agree well with the experimental data, as demonstrated by the specific variation of the excitation strengths with the absorbed energy, and with the traversing particles' track positions. For the first longitudinal mode of the cylindrical resonator we measured a conversion factor of 7.4 +- 1.4 nm/J, confirming the model value of 10 nm/J. Also, for the spherical resonator, we found the model values for the L=2 and L=1 mode amplitudes to be consistent with our measurement. We thus have confirmed the applicability of the model, and we note that calculations based on the model have shown that next generation resonant mass gravitational wave detectors can only be expected to reach their intended ultra high sensitivity if they will be shielded by an appreciable amount of rock, where a veto detector can reduce the background of remaining impinging cosmic rays effectively.

King|H. E. Stanley	  Sedimentary rocks have complicated permeability fluctuations arising from the geological processes that formed them. These permeability fluctuations significantly affect the flow of fluids through the rocks. We analyze data on two sandstone samples from different geological environments, and find that the permeability fluctuations display long-range power-law correlations characterized by an exponent $H$. For both samples, we find $H \approx 0.82-0.90$.

Gross	  We analyzed voltage rectification for dc SQUIDs biased with ac current with zero mean value. We demonstrate that the reflection symmetry in the 2-dimensional SQUID potential is broken by an applied flux and with appropriate asymmetries in the dc SQUID. Depending on the type of asymmetry, we obtain a rocking or a simultaneously rocking and flashing ratchet, the latter showing multiple sign reversals in the mean voltage with increasing amplitude of the ac current. Our experimental results are in agreement with numerical solutions of the Langevin equations for the asymmetric dc SQUID.

The Josephson phase across the SQUID experiences an effective ratchet potential, and the device acts as an efficient rocking ratchet, as demonstrated experimentally for adiabatic and nonadiabatic drive frequencies. For high-frequency drives the rectified voltage is quantized due to synchronization of the phase dynamics with the external drive. The experimental data are in excellent agreement with numerical simulations including thermal fluctuations.

We propose a new algorithm which counts the number of consistent quartets for cherry picking with tie breaking. We show that the success rate of the new algorithm is almost equal to that of neighbor-joining. This gives an explanation of the qualitative nature of neighbor-joining and that of dissimilarity maps from DNA sequence data. Moreover, the new algorithm always reconstructs correct trees from quartet consistent dissimilarity maps.

The results show that rock-salt (B1) type structured FeO metallizes at around 70 GPa and 1900 K without any structural phase transition. We computed fully self-consistently the electronic structure and the electrical conductivity of B1 FeO as a function of pressure and temperature, and found that although insulating as expected at ambient condition, B1 FeO metallizes at high temperatures, consistent with experiments. The observed metallization is related to spin crossover.

They are among the most ancient lavas of the Earth following the 3.8 Ga pillow basalts at Isua and they represent some of the oldest ultramafic magmatic rocks preserved in the Earth's crust at 3.5 Ga. This fact, linked to their particular features (high magnesium content, high melting temperatures, low dynamic viscosities, etc.), has attracted the community of geoscientists since their discovery in the early sixties, who have tried to determine their origin and understand their meaning in the context of the terrestrial mantle evolution. In addition, it has been proposed that komatiites are not restricted to our planet, but they could be found in other extraterrestrial setting in our Solar System (particularly in Mars and Io). It is important to note that komatiites may be extremely significant in the study of the origins and evolution of Life on Earth. They not only preserve essential geochemical clues of the interaction between the pristine Earth rocks and atmosphere, but also may have been potential suitable sites for biological processes to develop. Thus, besides reviewing the main geodynamic, petrological and geochemical characteristics of komatiites, this paper also aims to widen their investigation beyond the classical geological prospect, calling attention to them as attracting rocks for research in planetology and astrobiology.

Brown	  The formation of the largest objects in the Kuiper belt, with measured densities of ~1.5 g cm-3 and higher, from the coagulation of small bodies, with measured densities below 1 g cm-3 is difficult to explain without invoking significant porosity in the smallest objects. If such porosity does occur, measured densities should begin to increase at the size at which significant porosity is no longer supported. Among the asteroids, this transition occurs for diameters larger than ~350 km. In the Kuiper belt, no density measurements have been made between ~350 km and ~850 km, the diameter range where porosities might first begin to drop. Objects in this range could provide key tests of the rock fraction of small Kuiper belt objects. Here we report the orbital characterization, mass, and density determination of the 2002 UX25 system in the Kuiper belt. For this object, with a diameter of ~650 km, we find a density of 0.82+/-0.11 g cm-3, making it the largest solid known object in the solar system with a measured density below that of pure water ice. We argue that the porosity of this object is unlikely to be above ~20%, suggesting a low rock fraction. If the currently measured densities of Kuiper belt objects are a fair representation of the sample as a whole, creating ~1000 km and larger Kuiper belt objects with rock mass fractions of 70% and higher from coagulation of small objects with rock fractions as low as those inferred from 2002 UX25 is difficult. 	
1106.3827v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1106.3827v1	2011	Giant impacts in the Saturnian System: a possible origin of diversity in   the inner mid-sized satellites	Yasuhito Sekine|Hidenori Genda	  It is widely accepted that Titan and the mid-sized regular satellites around Saturn were formed in the circum-Saturn disk. Thus, if these mid-sized satellites were simply accreted by collisions of similar ice-rock satellitesimals in the disk, the observed wide diversity in density (i.e., the rock fraction) of the Saturnian mid-sized satellites is enigmatic. A recent circumplanetary disk model suggests satellite growth in an actively supplied circumplanetary disk, in which Titan-sized satellites migrate inward by interaction with the gas and are eventually lost to the gas planet. Here we report numerical simulations of giant impacts between Titan-sized migrating satellites and smaller satellites in the inner region of the Saturnian disk. Our results suggest that in a giant impact with impact velocity > 1.4 times the escape velocity and impact angle of ~45 degree, a smaller satellite is destroyed, forming multiple mid-sized satellites with a very wide diversity in satellite density (the rock fraction = 0-92 wt%). Our results of the relationship between the mass and rock fraction of the satellites resulting from giant impacts reproduce the observations of the Saturnian mid-sized satellites. Giant impacts also lead to internal melting of the formed mid-sized satellites, which would initiate strong tidal dissipation and geological activity, such as those observed on Enceladus today and Tethys in the past. Our findings also imply that giant impacts might have affected the fundamental physical property of the Saturnian mid-sized satellites as well as those of the terrestrial planets in the solar system and beyond.

Lyons|Torstein Sæbø	  Measurements of acoustic backscattering from glacially-eroded rock outcrops were made off the coast of Sandefjord, Norway using a high-frequency synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) system. A method by which scattering strength can be estimated from data collected by a SAS system is detailed, as well as a method to estimate an effective calibration parameter for the system. Scattering strength measurements from very smooth areas of the rock outcrops agree with predictions from both the small-slope approximation and perturbation theory, and range between -33 and -26 dB at 20$^\circ$ grazing angle. Scattering strength measurements from very rough areas of the rock outcrops agree with the sine-squared shape of the empirical Lambertian model and fall between -30 and -20 dB at 20$^\circ$ grazing angle. Both perturbation theory and the small-slope approximation are expected to be inaccurate for the very rough area, and overestimate scattering strength by 8 dB or more for all measurements of very rough surfaces. Supporting characterization of the environment was performed in the form of geoacoustic and roughness parameter estimates.

Weiss	  Paleomagnetically useful information is expected to be recorded by samples with moments up to three orders of magnitude below the detection limit of standard superconducting rock magnetometers. Such samples are now detectable using recently developed magnetic microscopes, which map the magnetic fields above room-temperature samples with unprecedented spatial resolutions and field sensitivities. However, realizing this potential requires the development of techniques for retrieving sample moments from magnetic microscopy data. With this goal, we developed a technique for uniquely obtaining the net magnetic moment of geological samples from magnetic microscopy maps of unresolved or nearly unresolved magnetization. This technique is particularly powerful for analyzing small, weakly magnetized samples such as meteoritic chondrules and terrestrial silicate crystals like zircons. We validated this technique by applying it to field maps generated from synthetic sources and also to field maps measured using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) microscope above geological samples with moments down to 10^-15 Am2. For the most magnetic rock samples, the net moments estimated from the SQUID microscope data are within error of independent moment measurements acquired using lower sensitivity standard rock magnetometers. In addition to its superior moment sensitivity, SQUID microscope net moment magnetometry also enables the identification and isolation of magnetic contamination and background sources, which is critical for improving accuracy in paleomagnetic studies of weakly magnetic rocks.

Caserta|R. Kanivetsky|E. Salusti	  In this paper we propose the application of a new model of transients of pore pressure p and solute density \r{ho} in geologic porous media. This model is rooted in the non-linear waves theory, the focus of which is advection and effect of large pressure jumps on strain (due to large p in a non-linear version of the Hooke law). It strictly relates p and \r{ho} evolving under the effect of a strong external stress. As a result, the presence of quick and sharp transients in low permeability rocks is unveiled, i.e. the non-linear Burgers solitons. We therefore propose that the actual transport process in porous rocks for large signals is not the linear diffusion, but could be governed by solitons. A test of an eventual presence of solitons in a rock is here proposed, and then applied to Pierre Shale, Bearpaw Shale, Boom Clay and Oznam-Mugu silt and clay. A quick analysis showing the presence of solitons for nuclear waste disposal and salty water intrusions is also analyzed. Finally, in a kind of "theoretical experiment" we show that solitons could also be present in Jordan and St. Peter sandstones, thus suggesting the occurrence of osmosis in these rocks.

Yudin	  The results obtained by studying the background of neutrons produced by cosmic-ray muons in underground experimental facilities intended for rare-event searches and in surrounding rock are presented. The types of this rock may include granite, sedimentary rock, gypsum, and rock salt. Neutron production and transfer were simulated using the Geant4 and SHIELD transport codes. These codes were tuned via a comparison of the results of calculations with experimental data: in particular, with data of the Artemovsk research station of the Institute for Nuclear Research (INR, Moscow, Russia), as well as via an intercomparison of results of calculations with the Geant4 and SHIELD codes. It turns out that the atomic-number dependence of the production and yield of neutrons has an irregular character and does not allow a description in terms of a universal function of the atomic number. The parameters of this dependence are different for two groups of nuclei-nuclei consisting of alpha particles and all of the remaining nuclei. Moreover, there are manifest exceptions from a power-law dependence, for example, argon. This may entail important consequences both for the existing underground experimental facilities and for those under construction. Investigation of cosmic-ray-induced neutron production in various materials is of paramount importance for the interpretation of experiments conducted at large depths under the Earth's surface.

Here, we present an approach where machine-learning (ML) methods are used for quantitative tectonic discrimination and feature selection using global geochemical datasets containing data for volcanic rocks generated in eight different tectonic settings. This study uses support vector machine, random forest, and sparse multinomial regression (SMR) approaches. All these ML methods with data for 20 elements and 5 isotopic ratios allowed the successful geochemical discrimination between igneous rocks formed in eight different tectonic settings with a discriminant ratio better than 83% for all settings barring oceanic plateaus and back-arc basins. SMR is a particularly powerful and interpretable ML method because it quantitatively identifies geochemical signatures that characterize the tectonic settings of interest and the characteristics of each sample as a probability of the membership of the sample for each setting. We also present the most representative basalt composition for each tectonic setting. The new data provide reference points for future geochemical discussions. Our results indicate that at least 17 elements and isotopic ratios are required to characterize each tectonic setting, suggesting that geochemical tectonic discrimination cannot be achieved using only a small number of elemental compositions and/or isotopic ratios. The results show that volcanic rocks formed in different tectonic settings have unique geochemical signatures, indicating that both volcanic rock geochemistry and magma generation processes are closely connected to the tectonic setting.

Ignasi Ribas|Jordi Miralda-Escude	  We examine the distributions of eccentricity and host star metallicity of exoplanets as a function of their mass. Planets with M sin i >~ 4 M_J have an eccentricity distribution consistent with that of binary stars, while planets with M sin i <~ 4 M_J are less eccentric than binary stars and more massive planets. In addition, host star metallicities decrease with planet mass. The statistical significance of both of these trends is only marginal with the present sample of exoplanets. To account for these trends, we hypothesize that there are two populations of gaseous planets: the low-mass population forms by gas accretion onto a rock-ice core in a circumstellar disk and is more abundant at high metalliticities, and the high-mass population forms directly by fragmentation of a pre-stellar cloud. Planets of the first population form in initially circular orbits and grow their eccentricities later, and may have a mass upper limit from the total mass of the disk that can be accreted by the core. The second population may have a mass lower limit resulting from opacity-limited fragmentation. This would roughly divide the two populations in mass, although they would likely overlap over some mass range. If most objects in the second population form before the pre-stellar cloud becomes highly opaque, they would have to be initially located in orbits larger than ~30 AU, and would need to migrate to the much smaller orbits in which they are observed. The higher mean orbital eccentricity of the second population might be caused by the larger required intervals of radial migration, and the brown dwarf desert might be due to the inability of high-mass brown dwarfs to migrate inwards sufficiently in radius.

Ianovski	  The possibility of existence of a magnetic monopole has been surveyed by P. Dirac even in 1931, and then from the point of view of the modern theory by A.M. Polyakov and G.~ 'tHooft in 1974. Numerous and unsuccessful attempts of experimental search for monopole in cosmic rays and on accelerators in high energy particle collisions have been done. Also the searches have been carried out in mica for monopole tracks as well as for relict monopoles, entrapped by ferromagnetic inclusions in iron-ores, moon rock and meteorites. These entrapped monopoles, when released, would have the lowest velocities $\beta<10^{-6}$ and do not yield ionization at all, and are hard to detect. Therefore it is necessary to examine thoroughly the mechanisms of slow heavy monopole interaction with matter and their scale of energy loss.   We discuss here the interaction of a massive slow magnetic monopole with magnetically ordered matter, with conductors, superconductors and with condensed matter in general. Our results indicate that the energy loss of a slow supermassive monopole reach $10^{8} eV/cm$ and more if we take into consideration the Cherenkov radiation of magnons or phonons and conductivity of the media. A new method of search for cosmic and relict monopoles by magnetically ordered film is considered too. This approach resembles the traditional method of nuclear emulsion chamber. Apparently the proposed method is particularly attractive for detection of relict monopoles, released from melting iron ore. 	
0704.0357v3	http://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0357v3	2008	Evolutionary games on minimally structured populations	Gergely J Szollosi|Imre Derenyi	  Population structure induced by both spatial embedding and more general networks of interaction, such as model social networks, have been shown to have a fundamental effect on the dynamics and outcome of evolutionary games. These effects have, however, proved to be sensitive to the details of the underlying topology and dynamics. Here we introduce a minimal population structure that is described by two distinct hierarchical levels of interaction. We believe this model is able to identify effects of spatial structure that do not depend on the details of the topology. We derive the dynamics governing the evolution of a system starting from fundamental individual level stochastic processes through two successive meanfield approximations. In our model of population structure the topology of interactions is described by only two parameters: the effective population size at the local scale and the relative strength of local dynamics to global mixing. We demonstrate, for example, the existence of a continuous transition leading to the dominance of cooperation in populations with hierarchical levels of unstructured mixing as the benefit to cost ratio becomes smaller then the local population size. Applying our model of spatial structure to the repeated prisoner's dilemma we uncover a novel and counterintuitive mechanism by which the constant influx of defectors sustains cooperation. Further exploring the phase space of the repeated prisoner's dilemma and also of the "rock-paper-scissor" game we find indications of rich structure and are able to reproduce several effects observed in other models with explicit spatial embedding, such as the maintenance of biodiversity and the emergence of global oscillations. 	
0809.3316v5	http://arxiv.org/pdf/0809.3316v5	2010	Magnetism, FeS colloids, and Origins of Life	Gargi Mitra-Delmotte|A. N. Mitra	  A number of features of living systems: reversible interactions and weak bonds underlying motor-dynamics; gel-sol transitions; cellular connected fractal organization; asymmetry in interactions and organization; quantum coherent phenomena; to name some, can have a natural accounting via $physical$ interactions, which we therefore seek to incorporate by expanding the horizons of `chemistry-only' approaches to the origins of life. It is suggested that the magnetic 'face' of the minerals from the inorganic world, recognized to have played a pivotal role in initiating Life, may throw light on some of these issues. A magnetic environment in the form of rocks in the Hadean Ocean could have enabled the accretion and therefore an ordered confinement of super-paramagnetic colloids within a structured phase. A moderate H-field can help magnetic nano-particles to not only overcome thermal fluctuations but also harness them. Such controlled dynamics brings in the possibility of accessing quantum effects, which together with frustrations in magnetic ordering and hysteresis (a natural mechanism for a primitive memory) could throw light on the birth of biological information which, as Abel argues, requires a combination of order and complexity. This scenario gains strength from observations of scale-free framboidal forms of the greigite mineral, with a magnetic basis of assembly. And greigite's metabolic potential plays a key role in the mound scenario of Russell and coworkers-an expansion of which is suggested for including magnetism. 	
1111.1674v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1111.1674v2	2012	On the relationship between cyclic and hierarchical three-species   predator-prey systems and the two-species Lotka-Volterra model	Qian He|Uwe C. Tauber|R. K. P. Zia	  We aim to clarify the relationship between interacting three-species models and the two-species Lotka-Volterra (LV) model. We utilize mean-field theory and Monte Carlo simulations on two-dimensional square lattices to explore the temporal evolution characteristics of two different interacting three-species predator-prey systems: (1) a cyclic rock-paper-scissors (RPS) model with conserved total particle number but strongly asymmetric reaction rates that lets the system evolve towards one corner of configuration space; (2) a hierarchical food chain where an additional intermediate species is inserted between the predator and prey in the LV model. For model variant (1), we demonstrate that the evolutionary properties of both minority species in the steady state of this stochastic spatial three-species corner RPS model are well approximated by the LV system, with its emerging characteristic features of localized population clustering, persistent oscillatory dynamics, correlated spatio-temporal patterns, and fitness enhancement through quenched spatial disorder in the predation rates. In contrast, we could not identify any regime where the hierarchical model (2) would reduce to the two-species LV system. In the presence of pair exchange processes, the system remains essentially well-mixed, and we generally find the Monte Carlo simulation results for the spatially extended model (2) to be consistent with the predictions from the corresponding mean-field rate equations. If spreading occurs only through nearest-neighbor hopping, small population clusters emerge; yet the requirement of an intermediate species cluster obviously disrupts spatio-temporal correlations between predator and prey, and correspondingly eliminates many of the intriguing fluctuation phenomena that characterize the stochastic spatial LV system.

This should allow to effectively constrain the location of a putative trans-Plutonian massive object, dubbed Planet X (PX) hereafter, whose existence has recently been postulated for a variety of reasons connected with, e.g., the architecture of the Kuiper belt and the cometary flux from the Oort cloud. Traditional scenarios involve a rock-ice planetoid with mX = 0.7mE at some 100 - 200 au, or a Jovian body with mX = 5mJ at about 10,000 - 20,000 au; as a result of our preliminary sensitivity analysis, they should be detectable by New Horizons since they would impact its range at a km level or so over a time span six years long. Conversely, range residuals statistically compatible with zero having an amplitude of 10 m would imply that PX, if it exists, could not be located at less than about 4,500 au (mX = 0.7mE) or 60,000 au (mX = 5mJ), thus making a direct detection quite demanding with the present-day technologies. As a consequence, it would be appropriate to rename such a remote body as Telisto. Also fundamental physics would benefit from this analysis since certain subtle effects predicted by MOND for the deep Newtonian regions of our Solar System are just equivalent to those of a distant pointlike mass. 	
1310.4689v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.4689v1	2013	Morphological analysis of stylolites for paleostress estimation in   limestones surrounding the Andra Underground Research Laboratory site	Alexandra Rolland|Renaud Toussaint|Patrick Baud|Nathalie Conil|Philippe Landrein	  We develop and test a methodology to infer paleostress from the morphology of stylolites within borehole cores. This non-destructive method is based on the analysis of the stylolite trace along the outer cylindrical surface of the cores. It relies on an automatic digitization of high-resolution photographs and on the spatial Fourier spectrum analysis of the stylolite traces. We test and show, on both synthetic and natural examples, that the information from this outer cylindrical surface is equivalent to the one obtained from the destructive planar sections traditionally used. The assessment of paleostress from the stylolite morphology analysis is made using a recent theoretical model, which links the morphological properties to the physical processes acting during stylolite evolution. This model shows that two scaling regimes are to be expected for the stylolite height power spectrum, separated by a cross-over length that depends on the magnitude of the paleostress during formation. We develop a non linear fit method to automatically extract the cross-over lengths from the digitized stylolite profiles. Results on cores from boreholes drilled in the surroundings of the Andra Underground Research Laboratory located at Bure, France, show that different groups of sedimentary stylolites can be distinguished, and correspond to different estimated vertical paleostress values. For the Oxfordian formation, one group of stylolites indicate a paleostress of around 10 MPa, while another group yields 15 MPa. For the Dogger formation, two stylolites indicate a paleostress of around 10 MPa, while others appear to have stopped growing at paleostresses between 30 and 22 MPa, starting at an erosion phase that initiated in the late Cretaceous and continues today. This method has a high potential for further applications on reservoirs or other geological contexts where stylolites are present. 	
1403.3792v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.3792v1	2014	Globally synchronized oscillations in complex cyclic games	Charlotte Rulquin|Jeferson J. Arenzon	  The Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) game and its generalizations with ${\cal S}>3$ species are well studied models for cyclically interacting populations. Four is, however, the minimum number of species that, by allowing other interactions beyond the single, cyclic loop, breaks both the full intransitivity of the food graph and the one predator, one prey symmetry. L\"utz {\it et al} (J. Theor. Biol. {\bf 317} (2013) 286) have shown the existence, on a square lattice, of two distinct phases, with either four or three coexisting species. In both phases, each agent is eventually replaced by one of its predators but these strategy oscillations remain localized as long as the interactions are short ranged. Distant regions may be either out of phase or cycling through different food web subloops (if any). Here we show that upon replacing a minimum fraction $Q_c$ of the short range interactions by long range ones, there is a Hopf bifurcation and global oscillations become stable. Surprisingly, to build such long distance, global synchronization, the four species coexistence phase requires less long range interactions than the three species phase, while one would naively expect the contrary. Moreover, deviations from highly homogeneous conditions ($\chi=0$ or 1) increase $Q_c$ and the more heterogeneous is the food web, the harder the synchronization is. By further increasing $Q$, while the three species phase remains stable, the four species one has a transition to an absorbing, single species state. The existence of a phase with global oscillations for ${\cal S}>3$, when the interaction graph has multiple subloops and several possible local cycles, lead to the conjecture that global oscillations are a general characteristic, even for large, realistic food webs. 	
1507.07577v3	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.07577v3	2016	Study of cosmic ray events with high muon multiplicity using the ALICE   detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider	 ALICE Collaboration	  ALICE is one of four large experiments at the CERN Large Hadron Collider near Geneva, specially designed to study particle production in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Located 52 meters underground with 28 meters of overburden rock, it has also been used to detect muons produced by cosmic ray interactions in the upper atmosphere. In this paper, we present the multiplicity distribution of these atmospheric muons and its comparison with Monte Carlo simulations. This analysis exploits the large size and excellent tracking capability of the ALICE Time Projection Chamber. A special emphasis is given to the study of high multiplicity events containing more than 100 reconstructed muons and corresponding to a muon areal density $\rho_{\mu} > 5.9~$m$^{-2}$. Similar events have been studied in previous underground experiments such as ALEPH and DELPHI at LEP. While these experiments were able to reproduce the measured muon multiplicity distribution with Monte Carlo simulations at low and intermediate multiplicities, their simulations failed to describe the frequency of the highest multiplicity events. In this work we show that the high multiplicity events observed in ALICE stem from primary cosmic rays with energies above $10^{16}$ eV and that the frequency of these events can be successfully described by assuming a heavy mass composition of primary cosmic rays in this energy range. The development of the resulting air showers was simulated using the latest version of QGSJET to model hadronic interactions. This observation places significant constraints on alternative, more exotic, production mechanisms for these events.

Detailed radiative transfer models show that the observed equinox temperatures of Saturn's A ring are much higher than model predictions as long as only the flux from Saturn is taken into account. This indicates that the A ring was not completely cooled down at the equinox. We develop a simple seasonal model for ring temperatures and first assume that the internal density and the thermal inertia of a ring particle are uniform with depth. The particle size is estimated to be 1-2 m. The seasonal thermal inertia is found to be 30-50 Jm$^{-2}$K$^{-1}$s$^{-1/2}$ in the middle A ring whereas it is $\sim$ 10 Jm$^{-2}$K$^{-1}$s$^{-1/2}$ or as low as the diurnal thermal inertia in the inner and outermost regions of the A ring. An additional internal structure model, in which a particle has a high density core surrounded by a fluffy regolith mantle, shows that the core radius relative to the particle radius is about 0.9 for the middle A ring and is much less for the inner and outer regions of the A ring. This means that the radial variation of the internal density of ring particles exists across the A ring. Some mechanisms may be confining dense particles in the middle A ring against viscous diffusion. Alternatively, the (middle) A ring might have recently formed ($<$ 10$^{8}$ yr) by destruction of an icy satellite, so that dense particles have not yet diffused over the A ring and regolith mantles of particles have not grown thick. Our model results also indicate that the composition of the core is predominantly water ice, not rock.

In particular the game nicely illustrates that cyclic interactions allow multiple strategies to coexist for long time intervals. When formulated in terms of a one-dimensional cellular automata, the spatial distribution of strategies exhibits coarsening with algebraically growing domain size over time, while the two-dimensional version allows domains to break and thereby opens for long-time coexistence. We here consider a quasi-one-dimensional implementation of the cyclic competition, and study the long-term dynamics as a function of rare invasions between parallel linear ecosystems. We find that increasing the complexity from two to three parallel subsystems allows a transition from complete coarsening to an active steady state where the domain size stays finite. We further find that this transition happens irrespective of whether the update is done in parallel for all sites simultaneously, or done randomly in sequential order. In both cases the active state is characterized by localized bursts of dislocations, followed by longer periods of coarsening. In the case of the parallel dynamics, we find that there is another phase transition between the active steady state and the coarsening state within the three-line system when the invasion rate between the subsystems is varied. We identify the critical parameter for this transition, and show that the density of active boundaries have critical exponents that are consistent with the directed percolation universality class. On the other hand, numerical simulations with the random sequential dynamics suggest that the system may exhibit an active steady state as long as the invasion rate is finite.

Ignorant of   Rigidity	Michael Efroimsky	  The rate of tidal evolution of asteroidal binaries is defined by the dynamical Love numbers divided by quality factors. Common is the (often illegitimate) approximation of the dynamical Love numbers with their static counterparts. As the static Love numbers are, approximately, proportional to the inverse rigidity, this renders a popular fallacy that the tidal evolution rate is determined by the product of the rigidity by the quality factor: $\,k_l/Q\propto 1/(\mu Q)\,$. In reality, the dynamical Love numbers depend on the tidal frequency and all rheological parameters of the tidally perturbed body (not just rigidity). We demonstrate that in asteroidal binaries the rigidity of their components plays virtually no role in tidal friction and tidal lagging, and thereby has almost no influence on the intensity of tidal interactions (tidal torques, tidal dissipation, tidally induced changes of the orbit). A key quantity that determines the tidal evolution is a product of the effective viscosity $\,\eta\,$ by the tidal frequency $\,\chi\,$. The functional form of the torque's dependence on this product depends on who wins in the competition between viscosity and self-gravitation. Hence a quantitative criterion, to distinguish between two regimes. For higher values of $\,\eta\chi\,$ we get $\,k_l/Q\propto 1/(\eta\chi)\;$; $\,$while for lower values we obtain $\,k_l/Q\propto \eta\chi\,$. Our study rests on an assumption that asteroids can be treated as Maxwell bodies. Applicable to rigid rocks at low frequencies, this approximation is used here also for rubble piles, due to the lack of a better model. In the future, as we learn more about mechanics of granular mixtures in a weak gravity field, we may have to amend the tidal theory with other rheological parameters, ones that do not show up in the description of viscoelastic bodies.

Lorenz|Hsin-Hua Huang|William T. Pike|Julie C. Castillo|Philippe Lognonne|Victor C. Tsai|Alyssa R. Rhoden	  Ice-covered ocean worlds possess diverse energy sources and associated mechanisms that are capable of driving significant seismic activity, but to date no measurements of their seismic activity have been obtained. Such investigations could probe their transport properties and radial structures, with possibilities for locating and characterizing trapped liquids that may host life and yielding critical constraints on redox fluxes, and thus on habitability. Modeling efforts have examined seismic sources from tectonic fracturing and impacts. Here, we describe other possible seismic sources, their associations with science questions constraining habitability, and the feasibility of implementing such investigations. We argue, by analogy with the Moon, that detectable seismic activity on tidally flexed ocean worlds should occur frequently. Their ices fracture more easily than rocks, and dissipate more tidal energy than the <1 GW of the Moon and Mars. Icy ocean worlds also should create less thermal noise for a due to their greater distance and consequently smaller diurnal temperature variations. They also lack substantial atmospheres (except in the case of Titan) that would create additional noise. Thus, seismic experiments could be less complex and less susceptible to noise than prior or planned planetary seismology investigations of the Moon or Mars.

Traditional detection methods detect events primarily by the use of similarity and correlation in data. Those methods can be inefficient and yield low accuracy. In recent years, because of the significantly increased computational power, machine learning techniques have revolutionized many science and engineering domains. In this study, we apply a deep-learning-based method to the detection of events from time series seismic signals. However, a direct adaptation of the similar ideas from 2D object detection to our problem faces two challenges. The first challenge is that the duration of earthquake event varies significantly; The other is that the proposals generated are temporally correlated. To address these challenges, we propose a novel cascaded region-based convolutional neural network to capture earthquake events in different sizes, while incorporating contextual information to enrich features for each individual proposal. To achieve a better generalization performance, we use densely connected blocks as the backbone of our network. Because of the fact that some positive events are not correctly annotated, we further formulate the detection problem as a learning-from-noise problem. To verify the performance of our detection methods, we employ our methods to seismic data generated from a bi-axial "earthquake machine" located at Rock Mechanics Laboratory, and we acquire labels with the help of experts. Through our numerical tests, we show that our novel detection techniques yield high accuracy. Therefore, our novel deep-learning-based detection methods can potentially be powerful tools for locating events from time series data in various applications.

Baldner|Rock I. Bush|Jesper Schou|Philip H. Scherrer	  The Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) instrument is a major component of NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) spacecraft. Since beginning normal science operations on 1 May 2010, HMI has operated with remarkable continuity, e.g. during the more than five years of the SDO prime mission that ended 30 September 2015, HMI collected 98.4% of all possible 45-second velocity maps; minimizing gaps in these full-disk Dopplergrams is crucial for helioseismology. HMI velocity, intensity, and magnetic-field measurements are used in numerous investigations, so understanding the quality of the data is important. We describe the calibration measurements used to track HMI performance and detail trends in important instrument parameters during the mission. Regular calibration sequences provide information used to improve and update the HMI data calibration. The set-point temperature of the instrument front window and optical bench is adjusted regularly to maintain instrument focus, and changes in the temperature-control scheme have been made to improve stability in the observable quantities. The exposure time has been changed to compensate for a 15% decrease in instrument throughput. Measurements of the performance of the shutter and tuning mechanisms show that they are aging as expected and continue to perform according to specification. Parameters of the tunable-optical-filter elements are regularly adjusted to account for drifts in the central wavelength. Frequent measurements of changing CCD-camera characteristics, such as gain and flat field, are used to calibrate the observations. Infrequent expected events, such as eclipses, transits, and spacecraft off-points, interrupt regular instrument operations and provide the opportunity to perform additional calibration. Onboard instrument anomalies are rare and seem to occur quite uniformly in time. The instrument continues to perform very well.

Gillan M. D. Towler|R. J. Needs	  We report diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) calculations on MgO in the rock-salt and CsCl structures. The calculations are based on Hartree-Fock pseudopotentials, with the single-particle orbitals entering the correlated wave function being represented by a systematically convergeable cubic-spline basis. Systematic tests are presented on system-size errors using periodically repeating cells of up to over 600 atoms. The equilibrium lattice parameter of the rock-salt structure obtained within DMC is almost identical to the Hartree-Fock result, which is close to the experimental value. The DMC result for the bulk modulus is also in good agreement with the experimental value. The B1-B2 transition pressure (between the rock-salt and CsCl structures) is predicted to be just below 600 GPa, which is beyond the experimentally accessible range, in accord with other predictions based on Hartree-Fock and density functional theories.

Christofides|G. Christodoulides	  Using high-resolution gamma-ray spectroscopy, the terrestrial gamma radiation in all the predominant types of geological rock formations appearing in Cyprus was measured. Soil samples were collected from each rock type, sealed in 1-litre plastic Marinelli beakers, and measured in the laboratory for 24 hours each. From the measured gamma-ray spectra, activity concentrations were determined for Th-232 (range from 1.3 to 52.8 Bq/kg), U-238 (from 0.9 to 90.3 Bq/kg) and K-40 (from 13 to 894 Bq/kg). Elemental concentrations mean values of (2.8 +- 0.7) ppm, (1.3 +- 0.3) ppm and (0.6 +- 0.1) % were extracted, for thorium, uranium and potassium, respectively. Absorbed dose rates in air outdoors were calculated to be in the range of 0.1-50 nGy/h, depending on the geological features, with an overall mean value of (14.7 +- 7.3) nGy/h. The corresponding effective dose rates per person outdoors were estimated to be between 0.1 and 61.4 microSv/y, assuming a 20% occupancy factor.

For that purpose, a total of 59 samples from surface soils and 10 from the main rock formations of the region of interest were analysed. Elemental concentrations were determined for Th (range from 2.5x10^-3 ppm to 2.0 ppm), U (from 8.1x10^-4 ppm to 0.6 ppm), and K (from 1.3x10^-4 % to 1.0 %). The average values (A.M +- S.D.) derived are (0.24 +- 0.34) ppm, (0.10 +- 0.10) ppm and (0.21 +- 0.24) %, for Th, U, and K, respectively, in the soils, and (0.52 +- 0.17) ppm, (0.17 +- 0.11) ppm and (0.49 +- 0.87) % in the rocks. From these values, a radioactivity (radioelement) loss of nearly 50% is estimated in the underlying surface soils due to bleaching and eluviation during weathering of the rocks. The measured Th/U ratio exhibits values between 2 and 4, whereas the K/Th ratio is highly variable ranging between 1.5x10^3 and 3.0x10^4.

Holt	  A human return to the Moon will require that astronauts are well equipped with instrumentation to aid their investigations during geological field work. Two instruments are described in detail. The first is a portable X-ray Spectrometer, which can provide rapid geochemical analyses of rocks and soils, identify lunar resources and aid selection of samples for return to Earth. The second instrument is the Geological and Radiation environment package (GEORAD). This is an instrument package, mounted on a rover, to perform in-situ measurements on the lunar surface. It can be used for bulk geochemical measurements of rocks and soils (particularly identifying KREEP-enriched rocks), prospect for ice in shadowed areas of craters at the poles and characterise the lunar radiation environment.

Tu	  We have combined temperature dependent local structural measurements with first principles density functional calculations to develop a three dimensional local structure model of the misfit system [Ca2CoO3][CoO2]1.61 (referred to as Ca3Co4O9) which has a rock salt structure stacked incommensurately on a hexagonal CoO2 lattice. The local structural measurements reveal a low coordination of Co(2)-O bonds in the rock salt layer with large static structural disorder. The temperature dependence of the Co(1)-Co(1) bond correlations in the CoO2 layer are found to be normal above ~75K and with a very small static disorder component. An anomalous enhancement in the Co(1)-Co(1) correlations occurs at the onset of long-range magnetic order. Density functional computations suggest that the reduction of the coordination of Co(2) is due to the formation of chains of Co(2)Ox in the a-b plane linked to the Ca-O layers by c-axis Co(2)-O bonds.

Evgin	  The shear strength and stick-slip behavior of a rough rock joint are analyzed using the complex network approach. We develop a network approach on correlation patterns of void spaces of an evolvable rough fracture (crack type II). Correlation among networks properties with the hydro -mechanical attributes (obtained from experimental tests) of fracture before and after slip is the direct result of the revealed non-contacts networks. Joint distribution of locally and globally filtered correlation gives a close relation to the contact zones attachment-detachment sequences through the evolution of shear strength of the rock joint. Especially spread of node's degree rate to spread of clustering coefficient rate yielded possible stick and slip sequences during the displacements. Our method can be developed to investigate the complexity of stick-slip behavior of faults as well as energy /stress localization on crumpled shells/sheets in which ridge networks are controlling the energy distribution.

Hamacher	  Traditional Aboriginal Australian cultures include a significant astronomical component, perpetuated through oral tradition and ceremony. This knowledge has practical navigational and calendrical functions, and sometimes extends to a deep understanding of the motion of objects in the sky. Here we explore whether this astronomical tradition is reflected in the rock art of Aboriginal Australians. We find several plausible examples of depictions of astronomical figures and symbols, and also evidence that astronomical observations were used to set out stone arrangements. However, we recognise that the case is not yet strong enough to make an unequivocal statement, and describe our plans for further research.

O. Kurakevych|V. A. Tafeenko|D. Trots|V. L. Solozhenko	  Series of metastable Me1-xZnxO solid solutions (Me = Ni2+, Co2+, Fe2+, Mn2+) with the rocksalt (rs) crystal structure have been synthesized from the binary oxides by quenching from 7.7 GPa and 1450-1650 K. Phase composition of the samples, as well as structural properties and stoichiometry of synthesized solid solutions have been studied by X-ray powder diffraction, both conventional and with synchrotron radiation. The widest (0.3 \leq x \leq 0.8) composition range of the existence of individual rock-salt solid solution has been established for the NiO-ZnO system. The bulk rs-Co1-xZnxO, rs-Fe1-xZnxO and rs-Mn1-xZnxO solid solutions may be quenched down to ambient conditions only with twice lower ZnO content, i.e. x \leq 0.5, 0.5 and 0.4, respectively; while formation of rock-salt solid solutions in the CdO-ZnO system has not been observed in the whole concentration range.

Here we explore the evolution of a rock-paper-scissors system where three species compete for space. The species are allowed to mutate and change the speed by which they invade one another. In the case when all species have similar mutation rates, we observe a perpetual arms race where no single species prevails. When only two species mutate, their aggressions increase indefinitely until the ecosystem collapses and only the non-mutating species survives. Finally we show that when only one species mutates, group selection removes individual predators with the fastest growth rates, causing the growth rate of the species to stabilize. We explain this group selection quantitatively.

Wilson	  Conditions are investigated under which a body lying at rest or rocking on a solid horizontal surface can be removed from the surface by hydrodynamic forces or instead continues rocking. The investigation is motivated by recent observations on Martian dust movement as well as other small- and large-scale applications. The nonlinear theory of fluid-body interaction here has unsteady motion of an inviscid fluid interacting with a moving thin body. Various shapes of body are addressed together with a range of initial conditions. The relevant parameter space is found to be subtle as evolution and shape play substantial roles coupled with scaled mass and gravity effects. Lift-off of the body from the surface generally cannot occur without fluid flow but it can occur either immediately or within a finite time once the fluid flow starts up: parameters for this are found and comparisons are made with Martian observations.

Picozzi	  By means of a comprehensive theoretical investigation, we show that external pressure can induce topological phase transitions in IV-VI semiconducting chalcogenides with rock-salt structure. These materials satisfy mirror symmetries that are needed to sustain topologically protected surface states, at variance with time-reversal symmetry responsible for gapless edge states in $\mathcal{Z}_{2}$ topological insulators. The band inversions at high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone that are related by mirror symmetry, are brought about by an "asymmetric" hybridization between cation and anion $sp$ orbitals. By working out the microscopic conditions to be fulfilled in order to maximize this hybridization, we identify materials in the rock-salt chalcogenide class that are prone to undergo a topological phase transition induced by pressure and/or alloying. Our model analysis is fully comfirmed by complementary advanced \textit{first-principles} calculations and \textit{ab initio}-based tight-binding simulations.

Kovaltsov|Ilya G. Usoskin	  We revisited assessments of the occurrence probability distribution of large events in solar energetic particles (SEP), based on measurements of cosmogenic radionuclides in lunar rocks. We present a combined cumulative occurrence probability distribution of SEP events based on three time scales: directly measured SEP fluences for the last 60 years; estimates based on terrestrial cosmogenic radionuclides 10Be and 14C for the multi-millennial (Holocene) time scale; and cosmogenic radionuclides measured in lunar rocks on the time scale of up to 1 Myr. All the three time scales yield a consistent distribution. The data suggest a strong rollover of the occurrence probability so that SEP events with the fluence of protons with energy >30 MeV greater than 10^{11} (protons /cm2/yr) are not expected at the Myr time scale. 	
1405.4482v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.4482v1	2014	Pre-earthquake Magnetic Pulses	John Scoville|Jorge Heraud|Friedemann Freund	  A semiconductor model of rocks is shown to describe unipolar magnetic pulses, a phenomenon that has been observed prior to earthquakes. These pulses are observable because their extremely long wavelength allows them to pass through the Earth's crust. Interestingly, the source of these pulses may be triangulated to pinpoint locations where stress is building deep within the crust. We couple a semiconductor drift-diffusion model to a magnetic field in order to describe the electromagnetic effects associated with electrical currents flowing within rocks. The resulting system of equations is solved numerically and it is seen that a volume of rock may act as a diode that produces transient currents when it switches bias. These unidirectional currents are expected to produce transient unipolar magnetic pulses similar in form, amplitude, and duration to those observed before earthquakes, and this suggests that the pulses could be the result of geophysical semiconductor processes.

Katz	  Shear deformation of partially molten rock in laboratory experiments causes the emergence of melt-enriched sheets (bands in cross-section) that are aligned at about 15-20 degrees to the shear plane. Deformation and deviatoric stress also cause the coherent alignment of pores at the grain scale. This leads to a melt-preferred orientation that may, in turn, give rise to an anisotropic permeability. Here we develop a simple, general model of anisotropic permeability in partially molten rocks. We use linearised analysis and nonlinear numerical solutions to investigate its behaviour under simple-shear deformation. In particular, we consider implications of the model for the emergence and angle of melt-rich bands. Anisotropic permeability affects the angle of bands and, in a certain parameter regime, it can give rise to low angles consistent with experiments. However, the conditions required for this regime have a narrow range and seem unlikely to be entirely met by experiments. Anisotropic permeability may nonetheless affect melt transport and the behaviour of partially molten rocks in Earth's mantle.

Aitta	  Pluto has been observed by the New Horizons space probe to have some relatively fresh ice on the old ices covering most of the surface. Pluto was thought to consist of only a rocky core below the ice. Here I show that Pluto can have an iron core, as can also its companion Charon, which has recently been modelled to have one. The presence of an iron core means the giant impact origin calculations should be redone to include iron and thus higher temperatures. An iron core leads to the possibility of a different geology. An originally molten core becomes solid later, with contraction and a release of latent heat. The space vacated allows the upper rock layers to flow downwards at some locations at the surface of the core, and some of the ice above the rock to descend, filling the spaces left by the rock motion downwards. These phenomena can lead to the forces recently deforming the icy surface of Pluto, and in a lesser way, of Charon.

Mark Bradley	  Bombardment of a solid surface with a broad, obliquely-incident ion beam frequently produces nanoscale surface ripples. The primary obstacle that prevents the adoption of ion bombardment as a nano-fabrication tool is the high density of defects in the patterns that are typically formed. Our simulations indicate that ion bombardment can produce nearly defect free ripples on the surface of an elemental solid if the sample is concurrently and periodically rocked about an axis orthogonal to the surface normal and the incident beam direction. We also investigate the conditions necessary for rocking to produce highly ordered ripples and discuss how the results of our simulations can be reproduced experimentally.

The long-term aim of our project is to provide solid foundations for a large-scale integration of various kinds of knowledge, including basic terms, rock classification algorithms, findings and reports. We describe three steps we have taken towards that goal here. First, we develop a semi-automated procedure for transforming a database of igneous rock samples to texts in a controlled natural language (CNL), and then a collection of OWL ontologies. Second, we create an OWL ontology of important petrology terms currently described in natural language thesauri. We describe a prototype of a tool for collecting definitions from domain experts. Third, we present an approach to formalization of current industrial standards for classification of rock samples, which requires linear equations in OWL 2. In conclusion, we discuss a range of opportunities arising from the use of semantic technologies in petrology and outline the future work in this area.

Molaro|Shane Byrne|Steve A. Langer	  Thermomechanical processes such as fatigue and shock have been suggested to cause and contribute to rock breakdown on Earth, and on other planetary bodies, particularly airless bodies in the inner solar system. In this study, we modeled grain-scale stresses induced by diurnal temperature variations on simple microstructures made of pyroxene and plagioclase on various solar system bodies. We found that a heterogeneous microstructure on the Moon experiences peak tensile stresses on the order of 100 MPa. The stresses induced are controlled by the coefficient of thermal expansion and Young's modulus of the mineral constituents, and the average stress within the microstructure is determined by relative volume of each mineral. Amplification of stresses occurs at surface-parallel boundaries between adjacent mineral grains and at the tips of pore spaces. We also found that microscopic spatial and temporal surface temperature gradients do not correlate with high stresses, making them inappropriate proxies for investigating microcrack propagation. Although these results provide very strong evidence for the significance of thermomechanical processes on airless bodies, more work is needed to quantify crack propagation and rock breakdown rates.

Coupled fluid flow, species transport, chemical reaction and solid structure alternation due to dissolution are simulated. Effects of mineral distributions and chemical heterogeneity on the dissolution behaviors and evolutions of hydrologic properties are studied under different reactive transport conditions. Simulation results show that the coupling between advection, diffusion and reaction as well as the mineralogical heterogeneity leads to complex reactive transport behaviors and complicated temporal evolutions of hydrologic properties including porosity, permeability and reactive surface. Diverse relationships between surface area and volume are predicted, which cannot be described by simple models such as the spherical-grain model. Porosity-permeability relationships also differ under different mineral distributions and reactive transport conditions. Simulation results indicate that it is extremely challenging to propose general relationships for hydrologic properties for dissolution of rocks with mineralogical heterogeneity, due to the complicated interactions between reactive transport and mineralogical heterogeneity.

Such an equation serves as a universal order parameter equation describing the onset of spontaneous oscillations in extended systems submitted to a kind of forcing dubbed rocking when the instability is towards long wavelengths. Applications include two-level lasers and photorefractive oscillators. Under rocking, the original continuous phase symmetry of the system is replaced by a discrete one, so that phase bistability emerges. This leads to the spontaneous formation of phase-locked spatial structures like phase domains and dark-ring (phase-) cavity solitons. Stability of the homogeneous solutions is studied and numerical simulations are made covering all the dynamical regimes of the model, which turn out to be very rich. Formal derivations of the rocked complex Swift-Hohenberg equation, using multiple scale techniques, are given for the two-level laser and the photorefractive oscillator.

Castro	  The Rock-Scissors-Paper game has been studied in the context of single population dynamics to account for cyclic behaviour under various game dynamics. We use a two-person parametrised version of this game to illustrate how cyclic behaviour is still a dominant feature of the replicator dynamics. The cyclic behaviour is observed near a heteroclinic cycle, in a heteroclinic network, with two nodes such that, at each node, players alternate in winning and losing. This cycle is shown to be as stable as possible for a wide range of parameter values. The parameters are related to the players' payoff when a tie occurs. Using some applications to price setting models, we illustrate the contribution of the Rock-Scissors-Paper game to the understanding of cyclic dominance in two-player games.

Baykin	  In this paper we demonstrate the influence of the pore pressure to the development of a hydraulically-driven fracture in a poroelastic medium. We present a novel numerical model for propagation of a planar hydraulic fracture and prove its correctness by demonstration of the numerical convergence and by comparison with known solutions. The advantage of the algorithm is that it does not require the distinguishing of the fracture's tips and reconstruction of the numerical mesh according to the fracture propagation. Next, we perform a thorough analysis of the interplay of fluid filtration and redistribution of stresses near the fracture. We demonstrate that the fracture length decreases with the increase of the Biot's number (the parameter that determines the contribution of the pore pressure to the stress) and explain this effect by analysing the near-fracture pore pressure, rock deformation and stresses. We conclude, that the correct account for the fluid exchange between the fracture and the rock should be based not only on physical parameters of the rock and fluid, but also on the analysis of stresses near the fracture.

Stresses in and around EGS are believed to be either sound and non-harming or violent and catastrophic among different groups involved, directly or indirectly, in EGS. Pros and cons of EGS have been under discussion and research for a while now. This paper addresses issues associated with stress redistribution during and after working cycle of EGS and gives a new insight in understanding the behavior of stresses redistribution in and around basement rock. As the basement rock is thermo-elastically connected to the country rock, newly generated stresses interact with the existing in-situ stresses under prevailing conditions of geological, design and operating variables. Variables dictating the continuous, safe and efficient working of EGS are also outlined in detailed sections. Guidelines for future of the research related to stress redistribution in EGS are also part of this paper.

Killingback	  The rock-paper-scissor game -- which is characterized by three strategies R,P,S, satisfying the non-transitive relations S excludes P, P excludes R, and R excludes S -- serves as a simple prototype for studying more complex non-transitive systems. For well-mixed systems where interactions result in fitness reductions of the losers exceeding fitness gains of the winners, classical theory predicts that two strategies go extinct. The effects of spatial heterogeneity and dispersal rates on this outcome are analyzed using a general framework for evolutionary games in patchy landscapes. The analysis reveals that coexistence is determined by the rates at which dominant strategies invade a landscape occupied by the subordinate strategy (e.g. rock invades a landscape occupied by scissors) and the rates at which subordinate strategies get excluded in a landscape occupied by the dominant strategy (e.g. scissor gets excluded in a landscape occupied by rock). These invasion and exclusion rates correspond to eigenvalues of the linearized dynamics near single strategy equilibria. Coexistence occurs when the product of the invasion rates exceeds the product of the exclusion rates. Provided there is sufficient spatial variation in payoffs, the analysis identifies a critical dispersal rate $d^*$ required for regional persistence. For dispersal rates below $d^*$, the product of the invasion rates exceed the product of the exclusion rates and the rock-paper-scissor metacommunities persist regionally despite being extinction prone locally. For dispersal rates above $d^*$, the product of the exclusion rates exceed the product of the invasion rates and the strategies are extinction prone. These results highlight the delicate interplay between spatial heterogeneity and dispersal in mediating long-term outcomes for evolutionary games.

Our new calculations of subsurface production of neutrons, $^{21}$Ne, and $^{39}$Ar take advantage of the state-of-the-art reliable tools of nuclear physics to obtain reaction cross sections and spectra (TALYS) and to evaluate neutron propagation in rock (MCNP6). We discuss our method and results in relation to previous studies and show the relative importance of various neutron, $^{21}$Ne, and $^{39}$Ar nucleogenic production channels. Uncertainty in nuclear reaction cross sections, which is the major contributor to overall calculation uncertainty, is estimated from variability in existing experimental and library data. Depending on selected rock composition, on the order of $10^7$-$10^{10}$ {\alpha} particles are produced in one kilogram of rock per year (order of 1-$10^3$ kg$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$); the number of produced neutrons is lower by $\sim6$ orders of magnitude, $^{21}$Ne production rate drops by an additional factor of 15-20, and another one order of magnitude or more is dropped in production of $^{39}$Ar. Our calculation yields a nucleogenic $^{21}$Ne/$^4$He production ratio of $(4.6\pm0.6) \times 10^{-8}$ in Continental Crust and $(4.2\pm0.5) \times 10^{-8}$ in Oceanic Crust and Depleted Mantle. Calculated $^{39}$Ar production rates span a great range from $29\pm9$ atoms kg-rock$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$ in the K-Th-U-enriched Upper Continental Crust to $(2.6\pm0.8) \times 10^{-4}$ atoms kg-rock$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$ in Depleted Upper Mantle. Nucleogenic $^{39}$Ar production exceeds the cosmogenic production below $\sim700$ meters depth and thus, affects radiometric ages of groundwater.

Szabo|Stephen Brown|Daniel Burns|Michael Fehler	  The nonlinear elastic response of rocks is known to be caused by the rocks' microstructure, particularly cracks and fluids. This paper presents a method for characterizing the nonlinearity of rocks in a laboratory scale experiment with a unique configuration. This configuration has been designed to open up the possibility the nonlinear characterization of rocks as an imaging tool in a field scenario. The nonlinear interaction of two traveling waves: a low-amplitude 500 kHz P-wave probe and a high-amplitude 50 kHz S-wave pump has been studied on a room-dry 15 x 15x 3 cm slab of Berea sandstone. Changes in the arrival time of the P-wave probe as it passes through the perturbation created by the traveling S-wave pump were recorded. Waveforms were time gated to simulate a semi-infinite medium. The shear wave phase relative to the P-wave probe signal was varied with resultant changes in the P-wave probe arrival time of up to 100 ns, corresponding to a change in elastic properties of 0.2%. In order to estimate the strain in our sample, ae also measured the particle velocity at the sample surface to scale a finite difference linear elastic simulation to estimate the complex strain field in the sample, on the order of $10^{-6}$, induced by the S-wave pump. We derived a fourth order elastic model to relate the changes in elasticity to the pump strain components. We recover quadratic and cubic nonlinear parameters: $\tilde{\beta}=-872$, $\tilde{\delta}=-1.1\times10^{10}$, respectively, at room-temperature and when particle motions of the pump and probe waves are aligned. Temperature fluctuations are correlated to changes in the recovered values of $\tilde{\beta}$ and $\tilde{\delta}$ and we find that the nonlinear parameter changes when the particle motions are orthogonal. No evidence of slow dynamics was seen in our measurements.

Tubiana|J. -B. Vincent	  We study the link between gravitational slopes and the surface morphology on the nucleus of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and provide constraints on the mechanical properties of the cometary material. We computed the gravitational slopes for five regions on the nucleus that are representative of the different morphologies observed on the surface, using two shape models computed from OSIRIS images by the stereo-photoclinometry (SPC) and stereo-photogrammetry (SPG) techniques. We estimated the tensile, shear, and compressive strengths using different surface morphologies and mechanical considerations. The different regions show a similar general pattern in terms of the relation between gravitational slopes and terrain morphology: i) low-slope terrains (0-20 deg) are covered by a fine material and contain a few large ($>$10 m) and isolated boulders, ii) intermediate-slope terrains (20-45 deg) are mainly fallen consolidated materials and debris fields, with numerous intermediate-size boulders from $<$1 m to 10 m for the majority of them, and iii) high-slope terrains (45-90 deg) are cliffs that expose a consolidated material and do not show boulders or fine materials. The best range for the tensile strength of overhangs is 3-15 Pa (upper limit of 150 Pa), 4-30 Pa for the shear strength of fine surface materials and boulders, and 30-150 Pa for the compressive strength of overhangs (upper limit of 1500 Pa). The strength-to-gravity ratio is similar for 67P and weak rocks on Earth. As a result of the low compressive strength, the interior of the nucleus may have been compressed sufficiently to initiate diagenesis, which could have contributed to the formation of layers. Our value for the tensile strength is comparable to that of dust aggregates formed by gravitational instability and tends to favor a formation of comets by the accrection of pebbles at low velocities.

Christodoulides	  The gamma radiation in samples of a variety of natural tiling rocks (granites) imported in Cyprus for use in the building industry was measured, employing high-resolution gamma-ray spectroscopy. The rock samples were pulverized, sealed in 1 litre plastic Marinelli beakers, and measured in the laboratory with an accumulating time between 10 and 14 hours each. From the measured gamma-ray spectra, activity concentrations were determined for Th-232 (range from 1 to 906 Bq/kg), U-238 (from 1 to 588 Bq/kg) and K-40 (from 50 to 1606 Bq/kg). The total absorbed dose rates in air calculated from the concentrations of the three radionuclides, Th-232 and U-238 series and K-40, ranged from 7 to 1209 nGy/h for full utilization of the materials, from 4 to 605 nGy/h for half utilization and from 2 to 302 nGy/h for one quarter utilization. The total effective dose rates per person indoors were determined to be between 0.02 to 2.97 mSv/y for half utilization of the materials. Applying dose criteria recently recommended by the EU for superficial materials, 25 of the samples meet the exemption dose limit of 0.3 mSv/y, two of them meet the upper dose limit of 1 mSv/y and only one exceeds clearly this limit.

A new method is desired to use a huge mass of a detector medium to detect them. A fundamental study of radar method was carried out to measure microwave reflection from electromagnetic energy deposit by X-ray irradiation in a small rock salt sample. The reflection rate of 1x10^-6 was found at the energy deposit of 1x10^19 eV which was proportional to square of the X-ray intensity suggesting the effect to be coherent scattering. The decay time of the reflection was several seconds. This effect implies a large scale natural rock salt formation could be utilized like a bubble chamber irradiated by radio wave instead of visible light to detect GZK neutrinos.

Application to a Canadian   Shield environment	Y. -J. Park|F. J. Cornaton|S. D. Normani|J. F. Sykes|E. A. Sudicky	  Cornaton et al. [2007] introduced the concept of lifetime expectancy as a performance measure of the safety of subsurface repositories, based upon the travel time for contaminants released at a certain point in the subsurface to reach the biosphere or compliance area. The methodologies are applied to a hypothetical but realistic Canadian Shield crystalline rock environment, which is considered to be one of the most geologically stable areas on Earth. In an approximately 10\times10\times1.5 km3 hypothetical study area, up to 1000 major and intermediate fracture zones are generated from surface lineament analyses and subsurface surveys. In the study area, mean and probability density of lifetime expectancy are analyzed with realistic geologic and hydrologic shield settings in order to demonstrate the applicability of the theory and the numerical model for optimally locating a deep subsurface repository for the safe storage of spent nuclear fuel. The results demonstrate that, in general, groundwater lifetime expectancy increases with depth and it is greatest inside major matrix blocks. Various sources and aspects of uncertainty are considered, specifically geometric and hydraulic parameters of permeable fracture zones. Sensitivity analyses indicate that the existence and location of permeable fracture zones and the relationship between fracture zone permeability and depth from ground surface are the most significant factors for lifetime expectancy distribution in such a crystalline rock environment. As a consequence, it is successfully demonstrated that the concept of lifetime expectancy can be applied to siting and performance assessment studies for deep geologic repositories in crystalline fractured rock settings. 	
1204.0980v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1204.0980v2	2012	A New Disintegrative Capture Theory for the Origin of the Moon	Peter D. Noerdlinger	  The object that resulted in the creation of the Moon started in the same orbital path as Earth around the Sun, but at Earth's L4. This proto-Moon (PM) was 4 times less massive than the usual Giant Impact (GI) object "Theia" and was captured into Earth orbit. It had a 32% Iron-Nickel-Sulfur core supporting a dynamo, which explains magnetized lunar rocks. Following capture, it was torn apart by tidal forces and its core of iron plastered itself, with some of its rock mantle, on the surface of Earth at a very flat angle (producing the "Late Veneer"). After tidal stripping, the remaining PM rock was driven away from Earth to about 3.8 times Earth's radius and formed into what is now the Moon. The GI theory has several troubles: The violent collision melts the entire Earth, contrary to geological evidence. The Moon itself also has to condense out of the vapor cloud generated in the collision, but there is evidence that the Moon was not condensed out of vapor. In the new theory, the Moon as we know it may be only 3.8 - 3.9 billion years old, not 4.56 as usually assumed. That is the age of the PM. The minerals in the Moon would be about as old as the Earth, but would have been re-arranged in the capture and temporary disintegration process. If the Moon is as young as suggested, its origin would coincide with the beginning of life on Earth, which is unexplained in the GI theory. The manuscript asks, "Was the Moon Turned Inside-Out" and the answer is "Essentially, Yes."

Guy|Axelle Baroni|Pierre Delage|Marc Mainguy	  In thermally enhanced recovery processes like cyclic steam stimulation (CSS) or steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD), continuous steam injection entails changes in pore fluid, pore pressure and temperature in the rock reservoir, that are most often unconsolidated or weakly consolidated sandstones. This in turn increases or decreases the effective stresses and changes the elastic properties of the rocks. Thermally enhanced recovery processes give rise to complex couplings. Numerical simulations have been carried out on a case study so as to provide an estimation of the evolution of pressure, temperature, pore fluid saturation, stress and strain in any zone located around the injector and producer wells. The approach of Ciz and Shapiro (2007) - an extension of the poroelastic theory of Biot-Gassmann applied to rock filled elastic material - has been used to model the velocity dispersion in the oil sand mass under different conditions of temperature and stress. A good agreement has been found between these predictions and some laboratory velocity measurements carried out on samples of Canadian oil sand. Results appear to be useful to better interpret 4D seismic data in order to locate the steam chamber.

Pourmand	  This study reports the bulk rare earth element (REEs, La-Lu) compositions of 41 chondrites, including 32 falls and 9 finds from carbonaceous (CI, CM, CO and CV), enstatite (EH and EL) and ordinary (H, L and LL) groups, as well as 2 enstatite achondrites (aubrite). The CI-chondrite-normalized REE patterns and Eu anomalies in ordinary and enstatite chondrites show more scatter in more metamorphosed than in unequilibrated chondrites. This is due to parent-body redistribution of the REEs in various carrier phases during metamorphism. The dispersion in REE patterns of equilibrated ordinary chondrites is explained by the nugget effect associated with concentration of REEs in minor phosphate grains.   Terrestrial rocks and samples from ordinary and enstatite chondrites display negative Tm anomalies of ~-4.5 % relative to ca chondrites. In contrast, CM, CO and CV (except Allende) show no significant Tm anomalies. Allende CV chondrite shows large excess Tm (~+10 %). These anomalies are similar to those found in group II refractory inclusions in meteorites but of much smaller magnitude. The presence of Tm anomalies in meteorites and terrestrial rocks suggests that either (i) the material in the inner part of the solar system was formed from a gas reservoir that had been depleted in refractory dust and carried positive Tm anomalies or (ii) CI chondrites are enriched in refractory dust and are not representative of solar composition for refractory elements. The observed Tm anomalies in ordinary and enstatite chondrites and terrestrial rocks, relative to carbonaceous chondrites, indicate that material akin to carbonaceous chondrites must have represented a small fraction of the constituents of the Earth. 	
1510.07223v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.07223v1	2015	A 1-D evolutionary model for icy satellites, applied to Enceladus	Uri Malamud|Dina Prialnik	  We develop a long-term 1-D evolution model for icy satellites that couples multiple processes: water migration and differentiation, geochemical reactions and silicate phase transitions, compaction by self-gravity, and ablation. The model further considers the following energy sources and sinks: tidal heating, radiogenic heating, geochemical energy released by serpentinization or absorbed by mineral dehydration, gravitational energy and insolation, and heat transport by conduction, convection, and advection. We apply the model to Enceladus, by guessing the initial conditions that would render a structure compatible with present-day observations, assuming the initial structure to have been homogeneous. Assuming the satellite has been losing water continually along its evolution, we postulate that it was formed as a more massive, more icy and more porous satellite, and gradually transformed into its present day state due to sustained long-term tidal heating. We consider several initial compositions and evolution scenarios and follow the evolution for the age of the Solar System, testing the present day model results against the available observational constraints. Our model shows the present configuration to be differentiated into a pure icy mantle, several tens of km thick, overlying a rocky core, composed of dehydrated rock at the center and hydrated rock in the outer part. For Enceladus, it predicts a higher rock/ice mass ratio than previously assumed and a thinner ice mantle, compatible with recent estimates based on gravity field measurements. Although, obviously, the model cannot be used to explain local phenomena, it sheds light on the internal structure invoked in explanations of localized features and activities.

Schwamb	  Kuiper Belt objects with absolute magnitude less than 3 (radius $\gtrsim$500 km), the dwarf planets, have a range of different ice/rock ratios, and are more rock-rich than their smaller counterparts. Many of these objects have moons, which suggests that collisions may have played a role in modifying their compositions. We show that the dwarf planets fall into two categories when analysed by their mean densities and satellite-to-primary size ratio. Systems with large moons, such as Pluto/Charon and Orcus/Vanth, can form in low-velocity grazing collisions in which both bodies retain their compositions. We propose that these systems retain a primordial composition, with a density of about 1.8 g/cm$^3$. Triton, thought to be a captured KBO, could have lost enough ice during its early orbital evolution to explain its rock-enrichment relative to the primordial material. Systems with small moons, Eris, Haumea, and Quaoar, formed from a different type of collision in which icy material, perhaps a few tens of percent of the total colliding mass, is lost. The fragments would not remain in physical or dynamical proximity to the parent body. The ice loss process has not yet been demonstrated numerically, which could be due to the paucity of KBO origin simulations, or missing physical processes in the impact models. If our hypothesis is correct, we predict that large KBOs with small moons should be denser than the primordial material, and that the mean density of Orcus should be close to the primordial value.

Energetic cosmic neutrinos can interact inside the rock and produce leptons via a charged current interaction. In the case of an incoming electron neutrino undergoing a charged current interaction, the produced UHE electron will induce an underground electromagnetic shower. At high energy (above 7.7 TeV in standard rock), such showers are subject to LPM (Landau, Pomeranchuk and Migdal) suppression of the radiative processes cross sections (bremsstrahlung and pair production). The consequence of this suppression is that showers are elongated. This effect will increase the detection probability of such events allowing deeper showers to emerge with detectable energies. On the other hand, the photonuclear processes which are usually neglected in electromagnetic showers with respect to radiative processes, turn out to become dominant in the LPM regime and will reduce the shower length. In this work, we have performed a complete Monte Carlo study of an underground shower induced by UHE electrons by taking into account both the LPM suppression and the photonuclear interaction. We will discuss the effects of both of these processes on the shower length and on the detectability of such events by ground arrays or fluorescence telescopes. We show that limits on neutrino fluxes that were obtained using simulations that were obviously neglecting photonuclear processes are overoptimistic and should be corrected. 	
1404.6366v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.6366v2	2014	Pipe Poiseuille flow of viscously anisotropic, partially molten rock	Jane Allwright|Richard F Katz	  Laboratory experiments in which synthetic, partially molten rock is subjected to forced deformation provide a context for testing hypotheses about the dynamics and rheology of the mantle. Here our hypothesis is that the aggregate viscosity of partially molten mantle is anisotropic, and that this anisotropy arises from deviatoric stresses in the rock matrix. We formulate a model of pipe Poiseuille flow based on theory by Takei and Holtzman [2009a] and Takei and Katz [2013]. Pipe Poiseuille is a configuration that is accessible to laboratory experimentation but for which there are no published results. We analyse the model system through linearised analysis and numerical simulations. This analysis predicts two modes of melt segregation: migration of melt from the centre of the pipe toward the wall and localisation of melt into high-porosity bands that emerge near the wall, at a low angle to the shear plane. We compare our results to those of Takei and Katz [2013] for plane Poiseuille flow; we also describe a new approximation of radially varying anisotropy that improves the self-consistency of models over those of Takei and Katz [2013]. This study provides a set of baseline, quantitative predictions to compare with future laboratory experiments on forced pipe Poiseuille flow of partially molten mantle. 	
1407.7271v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.7271v1	2014	From stellar nebula to planetesimals	Ulysse Marboeuf|Amaury Thiabaud|Yann Alibert|Nahuel Cabral|Willy Benz	  Solar and extrasolar comets and extrasolar planets are the subject of numerous studies in order to determine their chemical composition and internal structure. In the case of planetesimals, their compositions are important as they govern in part the composition of future planets. The present works aims at determining the chemical composition of icy planetesimals, believed to be similar to present day comets, formed in stellar systems of solar chemical composition. The main objective of this work is to provide valuable theoretical data on chemical composition for models of planetesimals and comets, and models of planet formation and evolution. We have developed a model that calculates the composition of ices formed during the cooling of the stellar nebula. Coupled with a model of refractory element formation, it allows us to determine the chemical composition and mass ratio of ices to rocks in icy planetesimals throughout in the protoplanetary disc. We provide relationships for ice line positions (for different volatile species) in the disc, and chemical compositions and mass ratios of ice relative to rock for icy planetesimals in stellar systems of solar chemical composition. From an initial homogeneous composition of the nebula, a wide variety of chemical compositions of planetesimals were produced as a function of the mass of the disc and distance to the star. Ices incorporated in planetesimals are mainly composed of H2O, CO, CO2, CH3OH, and NH3. The ice/rock mass ratio is equal to 1+-0.5 in icy planetesimals following assumptions. This last value is in good agreement with observations of solar system comets, but remains lower than usual assumptions made in planet formation models, taking this ratio to be of 2-3. 	
1504.03389v3	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.03389v3	2015	Robust and efficient estimation of high dimensional scatter and location	Ricardo A. Maronna|Victor J. Yohai	  We deal with the equivariant estimation of scatter and location for p-dimensional data, giving emphasis to scatter. It it important that the estimators possess both a high efficiency for normal data and a high resistance to outliers, that is, a low bias under contamination. The most frequently employed estimators are not quite satisfactory in this respect. The Minimum Volume Ellipsoid (MVE) and Minimum Covariance Determinant (MCD) estimators are known to have a very low efficiency. S-Estimators (Davies 1987) with a monotonic weight function like the bisquare behave satisfactorily for "small" p, say p not larger than 10. Rocke (1996) showed that their efficiency tends to one with increasing p. Unfortunately, this advantage is paid with a serious loss of robustness for large p. We consider three families of estimators with controllable efficiencies: non-monotonic S-estimators (Rocke 1996), MM-estimators (Tatsuoka and Tyler 2000) and tau-estimators (Lopuhaa 1991), whose performance for large p has not been explored to date. Two types of starting estimators are employed: the MVE computed through subsampling, and a semi-deterministic procedure proposed by Pe\~na and Prieto (2007) for outlier detection. A simulation study shows that the Rocke and MM estimators starting from the Pe\~na-Prieto estimator and with an adequate tuning, can simultaneously attain high efficiency and high robustness.

Anatole von Lilienfeld	  We assess the predictive power of alchemical perturbations for estimating fundamental properties in ionic crystals. Using density functional theory we have calculated formation energies, lattice constants, and bulk moduli for all sixteen iso-valence-electronic combinations of pure pristine alkali halides involving elements $A \in \{$Na, K, Rb, Cs$\}$ and $X \in \{$F, Cl, Br, I$\}$. For rock salt, zincblende and cesium chloride symmetry, alchemical Hellmann-Feynman derivatives, evaluated along lattice scans of sixteen reference crystals, have been obtained for all respective 16$\times$15 combinations of reference and predicted target crystals. Mean absolute errors (MAE) are on par with density functional theory level of accuracy for energies and bulk modulus. Predicted lattice constants are less accurate. NaCl is the best reference salt for alchemical estimates of relative energies (MAE $<$ 40 meV/atom) while alkali fluorides are the worst. By contrast, lattice constants are predicted best using NaF as a reference salt (MAE $<$ 0.5{\AA}), yielding only semi-quantitative accuracy. The best reference salt for the prediction of bulk moduli is CsCl (MAE $<$ 0.4$\times$10$^{11}$ dynes/cm$^2$). Alchemical derivatives can also be used to predict competing rock salt and cesium chloride phases in binary and ternary solid mixtures with CsCl. Alchemical predictions based on dispersion corrected density functional theory with pure RbI as a reference salt reproduce reasonably well the reversal of the rock salt/cesium chloride stability trend for binary $(AX)_{1-x}$CsCl$_x$ as well as for ternary $(AX)_{0.5-0.5x}(BY)_{0.5-0.5x}$CsCl$_x$ mixtures.

The model is based on a generalization of the random neighborhood graphs to consider fractures embedded into rectangular spaces. We study a series of 29 real-world RFNs and find the best fit with the random rectangular neighborhood graphs (RRNGs) proposed here. We show that this model captures most of the structural characteristics of the RFNs and allows a distinction between small and more spherical rocks and large and more elongated ones. We use a diffusion equation on the graphs in order to model diffusive processes taking place through the channels of the RFNs. We find a small set of structural parameters that highly correlates with the average diffusion time in the RFNs. We found analytically some bounds for the diameter and the algebraic connectivity of these graphs that allow to bound the diffusion time in these networks. We also show that the RRNGs can be used as a suitable model to replace the RFNs in the study of diffusion-like processes. Indeed, the diffusion time in RFNs can be predicted by using structural and dynamical parameters of the RRNGs. Finally, we also explore some potential extensions of our model to include variable fracture apertures, the possibility of long-range hops of the diffusive particles as a way to account for heterogeneities in the medium and possible superdiffusive processes, and the extension of the model to 3-dimensional space.

V. Nesterenok|O. V. Yakubovich	  The paper presents data on the production of the $^3$He nuclide in rocks under the effect of cosmic-ray particles. The origin of the nuclide in the ground in neutron- and proton-induced spallation reactions, reactions induced by high-energy muons, and negative muon capture reactions is analyzed. The cross sections of reactions producing $^3$He and $^3$H are calculated by means of numerical simulations with the GEANT4 simulation toolkit. The production rate of the $^3$He nuclide in the ground is evaluated for the average level of solar activity at high geomagnetic latitudes and at sea level. It is proved that the production of $^3$He in near-surface ground layers by spallation reactions induced by cosmic-ray protons may be approximately 10% of the total production rate of cosmogenic $^3$He. At depths of 10-50 m.w.e., the accumulation of $^3$He is significantly contributed by reactions induced by cosmic-ray muons. Data presented in the paper make it possible to calculate the accumulation rate of $^3$He in a rock depending on depth that is necessary for the evaluation of the exposure time of the magmatic or metamorphic complex on the Earth's surface ($^3$He dating).

Shakas|N. Linde|L. Baron|O. Bochet| T.|O. Bour|Le Borgne	  The in situ characterization of transport processes in fractured media is particularly challenging due to the considerable spatial uncertainty on tracer pathways and dominant controlling processes, such as dispersion, channeling, trapping, matrix diffusion, ambient and density driven flows. We attempted to reduce this uncertainty by coupling push-pull tracer experiments with single-hole ground penetrating radar (GPR) time-lapse imaging. The experiments involved different injection fractures, chaser volumes and resting times, and were performed at the fractured rock research site of Ploemeur in France (H+ network, hplus.ore.fr/en). For the GPR acquisitions, we used both fixed and moving antenna setups in a borehole that was isolated with a flexible liner. During the fixed-antenna experiment, time-varying GPR reflections allowed us to track the spatial and temporal dynamics of the tracer during the push-pull experiment. During the moving antenna experiments, we clearly imaged the dominant fractures in which tracer transport took place, fractures in which the tracer was trapped for longer time periods, and the spatial extent of the tracer distribution (up to 8 m) at different times. This demonstrated the existence of strongly channelized flow in the first few meters and radial flow at greater distances. By varying the resting time of a given experiment, we identified regions affected by density-driven and ambient flow. These experiments open up new perspectives for coupled hydrogeophysical inversion aimed at understanding transport phenomena in fractured rock formations.

Dorn|N. Linde|T. Le Borgne|O. Bour|M. Kleptikova	  Investigations of solute transport in fractured rock aquifers often rely on tracer test data acquired at a limited number of observation points. Such data do not, by themselves, allow detailed assessments of the spreading of the injected tracer plume. To better understand the transport behavior in a granitic aquifer, we combine tracer test data with single-hole ground-penetrating radar (GPR) reflection monitoring data. Five successful tracer tests were performed under various experimental conditions between two boreholes 6 m apart. For each experiment, saline tracer was injected into a previously identified packed-off transmissive fracture while repeatedly acquiring single-hole GPR reflection profiles together with electrical conductivity logs in the pumping borehole. By analyzing depth-migrated GPR difference images together with tracer breakthrough curves and associated simplified flow and transport modeling, we estimate (1) the number, the connectivity, and the geometry of fractures that contribute to tracer transport, (2) the velocity and the mass of tracer that was carried along each flow path, and (3) the effective transport parameters of the identified flow paths. We find a qualitative agreement when comparing the time evolution of GPR reflectivity strengths at strategic locations in the formation with those arising from simulated transport. The discrepancies are on the same order as those between observed and simulated breakthrough curves at the outflow locations. The rather subtle and repeatable GPR signals provide useful and complementary information to tracer test data acquired at the outflow locations and may help us to characterize transport phenomena in fractured rock aquifers.

In the modified discrete element (MDEM) method, the effective forces between virtual particles are modified in all regions, without failing elements, so that they reproduce the discretization of a first order finite element method (FEM) for linear elasticity. This provides an expression of the virtual forces in terms of general Hook's macro-parameters. Previously, MDEM has been formulated through an analogy with linear elements for FEM. We show the connection between MDEM and the virtual element method (VEM), which is a generalization of FEM to polyhedral grids. Unlike standard FEM, which computes strain-states in a reference space, MDEM and VEM compute stress-states directly in real space. This connection leads us to a new derivation of the MDEM method. Moreover, it gives the basis for coupling (M)DEM to domain with linear elasticity described by polyhedral grids, which makes it easier to apply realistic boundary conditions in hydraulic-fracturing simulations. This approach also makes it possible to combine fine-scale (M)DEM behavior near the fracturing region with linear elasticity on complex reservoir grids in the far-field region without regridding. To demonstrate the simulation of hydraulic fracturing, the coupled (M)DEM-VEM method is implemented using the Matlab Reservoir Simulation Toolbox (MRST) and linked to an industry-standard reservoir simulator.

Rafkin	  We present a new database of $>$300 layer-orientations from sedimentary mounds on Mars. These layer orientations, together with draped landslides, and draping of rocks over differentially-eroded paleo-domes, indicate that for the stratigraphically-uppermost $\sim$1 km, the mounds formed by the accretion of draping strata in a mound-shape. The layer-orientation data further suggest that layers lower down in the stratigraphy also formed by the accretion of draping strata in a mound-shape. The data are consistent with terrain-influenced wind erosion, but inconsistent with tilting by flexure, differential compaction over basement, or viscoelastic rebound. We use a simple landscape evolution model to show how the erosion and deposition of mound strata can be modulated by shifts in obliquity. The model is driven by multi-Gyr calculations of Mars' chaotic obliquity and a parameterization of terrain-influenced wind erosion that is derived from mesoscale modeling. Our results suggest that mound-spanning unconformities with kilometers of relief emerge as the result of chaotic obliquity shifts. Our results support the interpretation that Mars' rocks record intermittent liquid-water runoff during a $>$10$^8$-yr interval of sedimentary rock emplacement.

Volcanic rocks characterized by a whole geochemical signature of major elements (SiO2, TiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3T, CaO, MgO, Na2O, K2O), selected trace elements (Sr, Ba, Rb, Zr, Nb, La, Ce, Nd, Hf, Sm, Gd, Y, Yb, Lu, Ta, Th) and isotopes (206Pb/204Pb, 207Pb/204Pb, 208Pb/204Pb, 87Sr/86Sr and 143Nd/144Nd) have been extracted from open-access and comprehensive petrological databases (i.e. PetDB and GEOROC). The obtained dataset has been analyzed using support vector machines, a set of supervised machine learning methods, which are considered particularly powerful in classification problems. Results from the application of the machine learning methods show that the combined use of major, trace elements and isotopes allow associating the geochemical composition of rocks to the relative tectonic setting with high classification scores (93%, on average). The lowest scores are recorded from volcanic rocks deriving from back-arc basins (65%). All the other tectonic settings display higher classification scores, with oceanic islands reaching values up to 99%. Results of this study could have a significant impact in other petrological studies potentially opening new perspectives for petrologists and geochemists. Other examples of applications include the development of more robust geo-thermometers and geo-barometers and the recognition of volcanic sources for tephra layers in tephro-chronological studies. 	
1710.03342v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.03342v1	2017	A Case for an Atmosphere on Super-Earth 55 Cancri e	Isabel Angelo|Renyu Hu	  One of the primary questions when characterizing Earth-sized and super-Earth-sized exoplanets is whether they have a substantial atmosphere like Earth and Venus or a bare-rock surface like Mercury. Phase curves of the planets in thermal emission provide clues to this question, because a substantial atmosphere would transport heat more efficiently than a bare-rock surface. Analyzing phase curve photometric data around secondary eclipse has previously been used to study energy transport in the atmospheres of hot Jupiters. Here we use phase curve, Spitzer time-series photometry to study the thermal emission properties of the super-Earth exoplanet 55 Cancri e. We utilize a semi-analytical framework to fit a physical model to the infrared photometric data at 4.5 micron. The model uses parameters of planetary properties including Bond albedo, heat redistribution efficiency (i.e., ratio between radiative timescale and advective timescale of the atmosphere), and atmospheric greenhouse factor. The phase curve of 55 Cancri e is dominated by thermal emission with an eastward-shifted hot spot. We determine the heat redistribution efficiency to be ~1.47, which implies that the advective timescale is on the same order as the radiative timescale. This requirement cannot be met by the bare-rock planet scenario because heat transport by currents of molten lava would be too slow. The phase curve thus favors the scenario with a substantial atmosphere. Our constraints on the heat redistribution efficiency translate to an atmospheric pressure of ~1.4 bar. The Spitzer 4.5-micron band is thus a window into the deep atmosphere of the planet 55 Cancri e.

Hafver	  Numerous geological observations evidence that inelastic deformation occurs during sills and laccoliths emplacement. However, most models of sill and laccolith emplacement neglect inelastic processes by assuming purely elastic deformation of the host rock. This assumption has never been tested, so that the role of inelastic deformation on the growth dynamics of magma intrusions remains poorly understood. In this paper, we introduce the first analytical model of shallow sill and laccolith emplacement that accounts for elasto-plastic deformation of the host rock. It considers the intrusion's overburden as a thin elastic bending plate attached to an elastic-perfectly-plastic foundation. We find that, for geologically realistic values of the model parameters, the horizontal extent of the plastic zone lp is much smaller than the radius of the intrusion a. By modeling the quasi-static growth of a sill, we find that the ratio lp/a decreases during propagation, as 1/ $\sqrt$ a 4 $\Delta$P , with $\Delta$P the magma overpressure. The model also shows that the extent of the plastic zone decreases with the intrusion's depth, while it increases if the host rock is weaker. Comparison between our elasto-plastic model and existing purely elastic models shows that plasticity can have a significant effect on intrusion propagation dynamics, with e.g. up to a doubling of the overpressure necessary for the sill to grow. Our results suggest that plasticity effects might be small for large sills, but conversely that they might be substantial for early sill propagation. 2

The stability of rock slopes is often dominated by one or more locked segments along a potential slip surface; these segments have relatively high strength and accumulate strain energy. Locked segments can be preliminarily classified into three categories: "rock bridge", "retaining wall" and "sustaining arch." Coupling a one-dimensional renormalization group model with the strain-softening constitutive relation of geo-materials considering the Weibull's distribution, a physical model for predicting the instability of slopes with locked segments is established. It is found that the ratio of the strain or displacement at the peak strength point to that at the volume dilation point for a locked segment is exclusively dependent on the Weibull's shape parameter m, and is approximately constant at 1.48. A corresponding accelerating displacement increment (tertiary creep) of the slope can be observed from the onset of the volume dilation of the locked segment due to its unsteady cracking. For a slope with multiple locked segments, one can predict its critical instability displacement value according to the accelerating displacement onset corresponding to the volume dilation point of the first locked segment and the number of locked segments. The back-analysis of two typical cases, the Yanchihe rockslide in China and the wedge rockslide, Libby Dam, USA, shows that their evolutionary processes, dominated respectively by one and two locked segments, follow this model, confirming the reliability of the proposed model.

Garcia|I. G. Irastorza|G. Luzon|A. Morales|J. Morales|A. Ortiz de Solorzano|J. Puimedon|M. L. Sarsa|J. A. Villar	  A quantitative study of the neutron environment in the Canfranc Underground Laboratory has been performed. The analysis is based on a complete set of simulations and, particularly, it is focused on the IGEX-DM dark matter experiment. The simulations are compared to the IGEX-DM low energy data obtained with different shielding conditions. The results of the study allow us to conclude, with respect to the IGEX-DM background, that the main neutron population, coming from radioactivity from the surrounding rock, is practically eliminated after the implementation of a suitable neutron shielding. The remaining neutron background (muon-induced neutrons in the shielding and in the rock) is substantially below the present background level thanks to the muon veto system. In addition, the present analysis gives us a further insight on the effect of neutrons in other current and future experiments at the Canfranc Underground Laboratory. The comparison of simulations with the body of data available has allowed to set the flux of neutrons from radioactivity of the Canfranc rock, (3.82 +- 0.44) x 10^{-6} cm^{-2} s^{-1}, as well as the flux of muon-induced neutrons in the rock, (1.73 +- 0.22(stat) \+- 0.69(syst)) x 10^{-9} cm^{-2} s^{-1}, or the rate of neutron production by muons in the lead shielding, (4.8 +- 0.6 (stat) +- 1.9 (syst)) x 10^{-9} cm^{-3} s^{-1}.

Kudryavtsev|R. Lerner|P. K. Lightfoot|S. M. Paling|M. Robinson|N. J. C. Spooner	  A technique to measure low intensity fast neutron flux has been developed. The design, calibrations, procedure for data analysis and interpretation of the results are discussed in detail. The technique has been applied to measure the neutron background from rock at the Boulby Underground Laboratory, a site used for dark matter and other experiments, requiring shielding from cosmic ray muons. The experiment was performed using a liquid scintillation detector. A 6.1 litre volume stainless steel cell was filled with an in-house made liquid scintillator loaded with Gd to enhance neutron capture. A two-pulse signature (proton recoils followed by gammas from neutron capture) was used to identify the neutron events from much larger gamma background from PMTs. Suppression of gammas from the rock was achieved by surrounding the detector with high-purity lead and copper. Calibrations of the detector were performed with various gamma and neutron sources. Special care was taken to eliminate PMT afterpulses and correlated background events from the delayed coincidences of two pulses in the Bi-Po decay chain. A four month run revealed a neutron-induced event rate of 1.84 +- 0.65 (stat.) events/day. Monte Carlo simulations based on the GEANT4 toolkit were carried out to estimate the efficiency of the detector and the energy spectra of the expected proton recoils. From comparison of the measured rate with Monte Carlo simulations the flux of fast neutrons from rock was estimated as (1.72 +- 0.61 (stat.) +- 0.38 (syst.))*10^(-6) cm^(-2) s^(-1) above 0.5 MeV.

Boraso|F. Mantovani|M. Morsilli|G. Fiorentini|A. Riva|G. Rusciadelli|R. Tassinari|C. Tomei|G. Di Carlo|V. Chubakov	  The regional contribution to the geo-neutrino signal at Gran Sasso National Laboratory (LNGS) was determined based on a detailed geological, geochemical and geophysical study of the region. U and Th abundances of more than 50 samples representative of the main lithotypes belonging to the Mesozoic and Cenozoic sedimentary cover were analyzed. Sedimentary rocks were grouped into four main "Reservoirs" based on similar paleogeographic conditions and mineralogy. Basement rocks do not outcrop in the area. Thus U and Th in the Upper and Lower Crust of Valsugana and Ivrea-Verbano areas were analyzed. Based on geological and geophysical properties, relative abundances of the various reservoirs were calculated and used to obtain the weighted U and Th abundances for each of the three geological layers (Sedimentary Cover, Upper and Lower Crust). Using the available seismic profile as well as the stratigraphic records from a number of exploration wells, a 3D modelling was developed over an area of 2^{\circ}x2^{\circ} down to the Moho depth, for a total volume of about 1.2x10^6 km^3. This model allowed us to determine the volume of the various geological layers and eventually integrate the Th and U contents of the whole crust beneath LNGS. On this base the local contribution to the geo-neutrino flux (S) was calculated and added to the contribution given by the rest of the world, yielding a Refined Reference Model prediction for the geo-neutrino signal in the Borexino detector at LNGS: S(U) = (28.7 \pm 3.9) TNU and S(Th) = (7.5 \pm 1.0) TNU. An excess over the total flux of about 4 TNU was previously obtained by Mantovani et al. (2004) who calculated, based on general worldwide assumptions, a signal of 40.5 TNU. The considerable thickness of the sedimentary rocks, almost predominantly represented by U- and Th- poor carbonatic rocks in the area near LNGS, is responsible for this difference.

Freund	  Though ubiquitous in minerals of igneous and high-grade metamorphic rocks, peroxy defects have been widely overlooked in the past. The charge carriers of interest are positive holes, chemically equivalent to O$^-$ in a matrix of O$^{2-}$, physically defect electrons in the O$^{2-}$ sublattice, highly mobile, able to propagate fast and far. O$^-$ are oxidized relative to O$^{2-}$. As such O$^-$ are not supposed to exist in minerals and rocks that come from deep within the Earth crust or upper mantle, where the environments are overwhelmingly reduced. In order to understand how peroxy defects are introduced, we look at peroxy defects in a crystallographically and compositionally well characterized model system: single crystals of nominally high-purity MgO, grown from the melt under highly reducing conditions. During crystallization the MgO crystals incorporate OH$^-$ through dissolution of traces of H$_2$O into the MgO matrix, leading to a solid solution (ss) Mg$_{1-\delta}$(OH)$_{2\delta}$O$_{1-2\delta}$, where $\delta$ <1. During cooling, ss turns into a metastable supersaturated solid solution (sss). During further cooling, OH$^-$ pairs at Mg$^{2+}$ vacancy sites rearrange their electrons, undergoing a redox conversion, which leads to peroxy anions, O$_2^{2-}$, plus molecular H$_2$. Being diffusively mobile, the H$_2$ can leave their Mg$^{2+}$ vacancy sites, leaving behind cation-deficient Mg$_{1-\delta}$O. During reheating O$_2^{2-}$ break up, releasing positive hole charge carriers, which affect the electrical conductivity behavior. In rocks, similar changes in the electrical conductivity are observed in the temperature window, where peroxy defects of the type O$_3$Si-OO-SiO$_3$ break up. They release positive holes, which control the electrical conductivity response along the geotherm.

Spirakis|Przemyslaw Uznanski	  In this work we focus on a natural class of population protocols whose dynamics are modelled by the discrete version of Lotka-Volterra equations. In such protocols, when an agent $a$ of type (species) $i$ interacts with an agent $b$ of type (species) $j$ with $a$ as the initiator, then $b$'s type becomes $i$ with probability $P\_{ij}$. In such an interaction, we think of $a$ as the predator, $b$ as the prey, and the type of the prey is either converted to that of the predator or stays as is. Such protocols capture the dynamics of some opinion spreading models and generalize the well-known Rock-Paper-Scissors discrete dynamics. We consider the pairwise interactions among agents that are scheduled uniformly at random. We start by considering the convergence time and show that any Lotka-Volterra-type protocol on an $n$-agent population converges to some absorbing state in time polynomial in $n$, w.h.p., when any pair of agents is allowed to interact. By contrast, when the interaction graph is a star, even the Rock-Paper-Scissors protocol requires exponential time to converge. We then study threshold effects exhibited by Lotka-Volterra-type protocols with 3 and more species under interactions between any pair of agents. We start by presenting a simple 4-type protocol in which the probability difference of reaching the two possible absorbing states is strongly amplified by the ratio of the initial populations of the two other types, which are transient, but "control" convergence. We then prove that the Rock-Paper-Scissors protocol reaches each of its three possible absorbing states with almost equal probability, starting from any configuration satisfying some sub-linear lower bound on the initial size of each species. That is, Rock-Paper-Scissors is a realization of a "coin-flip consensus" in a distributed system. Some of our techniques may be of independent value.

Measurements,   finite element modelling, and diffraction correction	Mathias Sæther|Per Lunde|Geir Ersland	  Acoustic material parameters of gas hydrate bearing porous rocks are important for evaluation of methods to exploit the vast methane gas resources present in the earth's subsurface, potentially combined with CO2 injection. A solid buffer method for measuring changes of the compressional wave velocity in porous rocks with changing methane hydrate contents under high-pressure hydrate-forming conditions, is tested and evaluated with respect to effects influencing on the measurement accuracy. The limited space available in the pressure chamber represents a challenge for the measurement method. Several effects affect the measured compressional wave velocity, such as interference from sidewall reflections, diffraction effects, the amount of torque (force) used to achieve acoustic coupling, and water draining of the watersaturated rock specimen. Test measurements using the solid buffer method in the pressure chamber at atmospheric conditions are compared to independent measurements using a water-bath immersion measurement method. Compressional wave velocity measurements have been done in the steady state region at frequency 500 kHz for various specimen made of plexiglas and Bentheim sandstone. Finite element simulations of the solid buffer measurement method with plexiglas specimen have been used for comparison with the measurements, and to aid in the design, control, and evaluation of the measurement method and results. Highly favorable agreement between the two measurement methods has been obtained, also with respect to repeatability and reproducibility. The results indicate that the solid buffer method may be suitable for use in the pressure chamber with Bentheim sandstone and changing methane hydrate contents under high-pressure hydrate-forming conditions, for quantitative measurements of the compressional wave velocity in such rock core samples at these frequencies.

J. Way|Igor Aleinov|David. S. Amundsen|Mark Chandler|Thomas Clune|Anthony D. Del Genio|Yuka Fujii|Maxwell Kelley|Nancy Y. Kiang|Linda Sohl|Kostas Tsigaridis	  Resolving Orbital and Climate Keys of Earth and Extraterrestrial Environments with Dynamics (ROCKE-3D) is a 3-Dimensional General Circulation Model (GCM) developed at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies for the modeling of atmospheres of Solar System and exoplanetary terrestrial planets. Its parent model, known as ModelE2 (Schmidt et al. 2014), is used to simulate modern and 21st Century Earth and near-term paleo-Earth climates. ROCKE-3D is an ongoing effort to expand the capabilities of ModelE2 to handle a broader range of atmospheric conditions including higher and lower atmospheric pressures, more diverse chemistries and compositions, larger and smaller planet radii and gravity, different rotation rates (slowly rotating to more rapidly rotating than modern Earth, including synchronous rotation), diverse ocean and land distributions and topographies, and potential basic biosphere functions. The first aim of ROCKE-3D is to model planetary atmospheres on terrestrial worlds within the Solar System such as paleo-Earth, modern and paleo-Mars, paleo-Venus, and Saturn's moon Titan. By validating the model for a broad range of temperatures, pressures, and atmospheric constituents we can then expand its capabilities further to those exoplanetary rocky worlds that have been discovered in the past and those to be discovered in the future. We discuss the current and near-future capabilities of ROCKE-3D as a community model for studying planetary and exoplanetary atmospheres.

Lourenço|Kei Hirose|Razvan Caracas|Ryuichi Nomura	  Terrestrial planets are thought to experience episode(s) of large-scale melting early in their history. Fractionation during magma-ocean freezing leads to unstable stratification within the related cumulate layers due to progressive iron enrichment upward, but the effects of incremental cumulate overturns during MO crystallization remain to be explored. Here, we use geodynamic models with a moving-boundary approach to study convection and mixing within the growing cumulate layer, and thereafter within the fully crystallized mantle. For fractional crystallization, cumulates are efficiently stirred due to subsequent incremental overturns, except for strongly iron-enriched late-stage cumulates, which persist as a stably stratified layer at the base of the mantle for billions of years. Less extreme crystallization scenarios can lead to somewhat more subtle stratification. In any case, the long-term preservation of at least a thin layer of extremely enriched cumulates with Fe#>0.4, as predicted by all our models, is inconsistent with seismic constraints. Based on scaling relationships, however, we infer that final-stage Fe-rich magma-ocean cumulates originally formed near the surface should have overturned as small diapirs, and hence undergone melting and reaction with the host rock during sinking. The resulting moderately iron-enriched metasomatized/hybrid rock assemblages should have accumulated at the base of the mantle, potentially fed an intermittent basal magma ocean, and be preserved through the present-day. Such moderately iron-enriched rock assemblages can reconcile the physical properties of the large low shear-wave velocity provinces in the presentday lower mantle. Thus, we reveal Hadean melting and rock-reaction processes by integrating magmaocean crystallization models with the seismic-tomography snapshot.

Vidakovic|A. Villano|W. F. Vulcan|M. Wang|G. Warren|F. R. Wesselmann|B. Wojtsekhowski|S. A. Wood|C. Xu|L. Yuan|X. Zheng	  A large set of cross sections for semi-inclusive electroproduction of charged pions ($\pi^\pm$) from both proton and deuteron targets was measured. The data are in the deep-inelastic scattering region with invariant mass squared $W^2$ > 4 GeV$^2$ and range in four-momentum transfer squared $2 < Q^2 < 4$ (GeV/c)$^2$, and cover a range in the Bjorken scaling variable 0.2 < x < 0.6. The fractional energy of the pions spans a range 0.3 < z < 1, with small transverse momenta with respect to the virtual-photon direction, $P_t^2 < 0.2$ (GeV/c)$^2$. The invariant mass that goes undetected, $M_x$ or W', is in the nucleon resonance region, W' < 2 GeV. The new data conclusively show the onset of quark-hadron duality in this process, and the relation of this phenomenon to the high-energy factorization ansatz of electron-quark scattering and subsequent quark --> pion production mechanisms. The x, z and $P_t^2$ dependences of several ratios (the ratios of favored-unfavored fragmentation functions, charged pion ratios, deuteron-hydrogen and aluminum-deuteron ratios for $\pi^+$ and $\pi^-$) have been studied. The ratios are found to be in good agreement with expectations based upon a high-energy quark-parton model description. We find the azimuthal dependences to be small, as compared to exclusive pion electroproduction, and consistent with theoretical expectations based on tree-level factorization in terms of transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution and fragmentation functions. In the context of a simple model, the initial transverse momenta of $d$ quarks are found to be slightly smaller than for $u$ quarks, while the transverse momentum width of the favored fragmentation function is about the same as for the unfavored one, and both fragmentation widths are larger than the quark widths.

That assumption, which has come to be somewhat reflexive, is critically examined in this paper and found to be poorly substantiated. The value of the lunar surface for astronomy may be broadly compelling only in comparison to terrestrial sites. It is suggested here that the development and successful operation of the Hubble Space Telescope marked a turning point in the perception of value for free-space siting of astronomical telescopes, and for telescopes on the Moon. As the astronomical community considers the scientific potential of the Vision for Space Exploration (VSE) and the return to the Moon in particular, it should construct a value proposition that includes the tools, technology, and architecture being developed for this return, as these can well be seen as being more astronomically enabling than the lunar surface itself - a destination that offers little more than rocks and gravity. While rocks and gravity may offer astronomical opportunity in certain scientific niches, our attention should be focused on the striking potential of human and robotic dexterity across cis-lunar space. It is this command of our environs that the VSE truly offers us.

Biswal	  An approximate method to calculate dielectric response and relaxation functions for water saturated sedimentary rocks is tested for realistic threedimensional pore space images. The test is performed by comparing the prediction from the approximate method against the exact solution. The approximate method is based on image analysis and local porosity theory. An empirical rule for the specification of the length scale in local porosity theory is advanced. The results from the exact solution are compared to those obtained using local porosity theory and various other approximate mixing laws. The calculation based on local porosity theory is found to yield improved quantitative agreement with the exact result.

Greber	  One monolayer of C60 on one monolayer of hexagonal boron nitride on nickel is investigated by photoemission. Between 150 and 250 K the work function decreases and the binding energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) increases by approx. 100 meV. In parallel, the occupancy of the, in the cold state almost empty, lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) changes by 0.4 electrons. This charge redistribution is triggered by onset of molecular rocking motion, i.e. by orientation dependent tunneling between the LUMO of C60 and the substrate. The magnitude of the charge transfer is large and cannot be explained within a single particle picture. It is proposed to involve electron-phonon coupling where C60- polaron formation leads to electron self-trapping.

Cava	  The high pressure synthesis, structure and magnetic properties of Ca_25Co_22O_56(OH)_28 are reported. The compound has a misfit structure, consisting of double, square calcium oxide hydroxide rock-salt-like layers between hexagonal CoO_2 layers. The misfit compound crystallizes in the monoclinic space group C2/m, and can be characterized by the coexistence of two subsystems with common a=4.893(5)A, c=8.825(9)A and b=95.745(8) parameters, and different b parameters: b_RS=4.894(5)A, and b_HEX=2.809(3)A, for the rock-salt and hexagonal type planes respectively. The compound shows Curie-Weiss paramagnetism with an antiferromagnetic Weiss temperature of -43K and a reduced Co moment. Substantial deviations from Curie-Weiss behavior are seen below 50K with no indication of magnetic ordering. No superconductivity was observed down to a temperature of 2K.

Ambrosio et al	  We have measured directly the residual energy of cosmic ray muons crossing the MACRO detector at the Gran Sasso Laboratory. For this measurement we have used a transition radiation detector consisting of three identical modules, each of about 12 m^2 area, operating in the energy region from 100 GeV to 1 TeV. The results presented here were obtained with the first module collecting data for more than two years. The average single muon energy is found to be 320 +/- 4 (stat.) +/- 11 (syst.) GeV in the rock depth range 3000-6500 hg/cm^2. The results are in agreement with calculations of the energy loss of muons in the rock above the detector.

Ambrosio	  The MACRO detector was located in the Hall B of the Gran Sasso underground Laboratories under an average rock overburden of 3700 hg/cm^2. A transition radiation detector composed of three identical modules, covering a total horizontal area of 36 m^2, was installed inside the empty upper part of the detector in order to measure the residual energy of muons. This paper presents the measurement of the residual energy of single and double muons crossing the apparatus. Our data show that double muons are more energetic than single ones. This measurement is performed over a standard rock depth range from 3000 to 6500 hg/cm^2.

Sartorelli	  We present a new three-dimensional Monte-Carlo code MUSIC (MUon SImulation Code) for muon propagation through the rock. All processes of muon interaction with matter with high energy loss (including the knock-on electron production) are treated as stochastic processes. The angular deviation and lateral displacement of muons due to multiple scattering, as well as bremsstrahlung, pair production and inelastic scattering are taken into account. The code has been applied to obtain the energy distribution and angular and lateral deviations of single muons at different depths underground. The muon multiplicity distributions obtained with MUSIC and CORSIKA (Extensive Air Shower simulation code) are also presented. We discuss the systematic uncertainties of the results due to different muon bremsstrahlung cross-sections.

Spooner	  We revise the process of muon pair production by high-energy muons in rock using the recently published cross-section. The three-dimensional Monte Carlo code MUSIC has been used to obtain the characteristics of the muon bundles initiated via this process. We have compared them with those of conventional muon bundles initiated in the atmosphere and shown that large underground detectors, capable of collecting hundreds of thousands of multiple muon events, can discriminate statistically muon induced bundles from conventional ones. However, we find that the enhancement of the measured muon decoherence function over that predicted at small distances, recently reported by the MACRO experiment, cannot be explained by the effect of muon pair production alone, unless its cross-section is underestimated by a factor of 3. 	
0601402v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0601402v1	2006	Normal generation and Clifford index	Youngook Choi|Seonja Kim|Young Rock Kim	  Let $C$ be a smooth curve of genus $g\ge 4$ and Clifford index $c$. In this paper, we prove that if $C$ is neither hyperelliptic nor bielliptic with $g\ge 2c+5$ and $\mathcal M$ computes the Clifford index of $C$, then either $\deg \mathcal M\le \frac{3c}{2}+3$ or $|\mathcal M|=|g^1_{c+2}+h^1_{c+2}|$ and $g=2c+5$. This strengthens the Coppens and Martens' theorem (\cite{CM}, Corollary 3.2.5). Furthermore, for the latter case (1) $\mathcal M$ is half-canonical unless $C$ is a $\frac{c+2}{2}$-fold covering of an elliptic curve, (2) $\mathcal M(F)$ fails to be normally generated with $\cli(\mathcal M(F))=c$, $h^1(\mathcal M(F))=2$ for $F\in g^1_{c+2}$. Such pairs $(C,\mathcal M)$ can be found on a $K3$-surface whose Picard group is generated by a hyperplane section in $\mathbb P^r$. For such a $(C, \mathcal M)$ on a K3-surface, $\mathcal M$ is normally generated while $\mathcal M(F)$ fails to be normally generated with $\cli(\mathcal M)=\cli(\mathcal M(F))=c$.

The c(8x2) structure emerges at temperatures higher than 600C, but is unstable with respect to the change to the (2x6)/(3x6) structure at lower temperatures. Our RHEED rocking-curve analysis at high temperatures revealed that the c(8x2) surface has the structure which is basically the same as that recently proposed by Kumpf et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 86, 3586 (2001)]. We found that the surface atomic configurations are locally fluctuated at high temperatures without disturbing the c(8x2) periodicity. 	
0706.1110v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/0706.1110v1	2007	Calculation of the Underground Muon Intensity Crouch Curve from a   Parameterization of the Flux at Surface	Juergen Reichenbacher	  Utilizing only the vertical muon intensity of the Gaisser parameterization of the muon flux at the surface and propagating this energy spectrum underground according to statistical ionization and radiative energy losses, it is possible to calculate the underground muon intensity Crouch curve. In addition, the primary spectral index of the Gaisser parameterization can be adjusted from $E^{-2.7}$ to $E^{-2.643}$ simply by minimizing the deviation from the Crouch curve. For chemical compositions other than standard rock, the propagation of the spectrum underground can be repeated with a different muon energy loss in the material. The resulting underground muon intensity curve represents a consistent conversion of the Crouch curve to the local rock, fully accounting for the energy dependence of the muon $dE/dx$.

Here we report the effect of doping on diversity in spatiotemporal rock-paper-scissors (RPS) games, which can be observed directly in ecological, biological and social systems in nature. Doping means that there exists some buffer patches which do not involve the main procession of the conflicts but occupied the game space. Quantitative lattices simulation finds that (1) decrease of extinction possibility is exponential dependent on the increase of doping rate, (2) the possibility of the conflict is independent of doping rate at well mix evolution beginning, and is buffered by doping in long time coexistence procession. Practical meaning of doping are discussed. To demonstrate the importance of doping, we present one practical example for microbial laboratory efficient operation and one theoretical example for human-environment co-existence system better understanding. It suggests that, for diversity, doping can not be neglected.

We solve numerically the fluid filtration equation coupled to the gravitational force balance and poro-elasto-plastic rheology equations. Systematic numerical simulations, varying initial stress, intrinsic material properties and geometry, show the existence of five distinct failure patterns caused by either shear banding or tensile fracturing. The value of the critical pore-fluid overpressure at the onset of failure is derived from an analytical solution that is in excellent agreement with numerical simulations. Finally, we construct a phase-diagram that predicts the domains of the different failure patterns and at the onset of failure.

C. Freire|Zélia S. Macedo|José M. Sasaki|Antônio A. F. Saraiva	  The Geopark Araripe, located in Northeastern Brazil, is the first UNESCO Natural Park in the South hemisphere and a world-famous fossil deposit of the Early Cretaceous period (approximately 120 million years). Fossilized fish fauna in Geopark Araripe is found inside of sedimentary rocks in three-dimensional forms. In the present study sedimentary rocks and fossil fish Rhacolepis bucalis have been carefully analysed by means of X-ray powder diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and termogravimetric analysis. Mineralogical composition of the fossil fish was explained in terms of facts occurred at the initial stages of the opening of the South Atlantic and the oceanic hydrothermal phenomena (``black smoker'', ``white smoker'' and warm-water events). The occurrence of organic substance was, for the first time, evaluated in collapsed internal elements (intestinal and muscles) by termogravimetric analysis. 	
0806.2399v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/0806.2399v1	2008	Thermal Conductivity from Core and Well log Data	Andreas Hartmann|Volker Rath|Christoph Clauser	  The relationships between thermal conductivity and other petrophysical properties have been analysed for a borehole drilled in a Tertiary Flysch sequence. We establish equations that permit us to predict rock thermal conductivity from logging data. A regression analysis of thermal conductivity, bulk density, and sonic velocity yields thermal conductivity with an average accuracy of better than 0.2 W/(m K). As a second step, logging data is used to compute a lithological depth profile, which in turn is used to calculate a thermal conductivity profile. From a comparison of the conductivity-depth profile and the laboratory data it can be concluded that thermal conductivity can be computed with an accuracy of less than 0.3 W/(m K)from conventional wireline data. The comparison of two different models shows that this approach can be practical even if old and incomplete logging data is used. The results can be used to infer thermal conductivity for boreholes without appropriate core data that are drilled in a similar geological setting. 	
0808.3312v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/0808.3312v1	2008	Three- and four-state rock-paper-scissors games with diffusion	Matti Peltomaki|Mikko Alava	  Cyclic dominance of three species is a commonly occurring interaction dynamics, often denoted the rock-paper-scissors (RPS) game. Such type of interactions is known to promote species coexistence. Here, we generalize recent results of Reichenbach et al. (e.g. Nature 448, 1046 (2007)) of a four-state variant of RPS. We show that spiral formation takes place only without a conservation law for the total density. Nevertheless, in general fast diffusion can destroy species coexistence. We also generalize the four-state model to slightly varying reaction rates. This is shown both analytically and numerically not to change pattern formation, or the effective wave length of the spirals, and therefore does not alter the qualitative properties of the cross-over to extinction.

Detailed investigations of their mineralogy, petrography, chemistry and isotopic composition and comparison with other primitive solar system samples such as cometary dust particles have allowed through the years to decipher the conditions of formation of their individual components thought to have once been free-floating pieces of dust and rocks in the early solar nebula. When put in the context of astrophysical models of young stellar objects, chondritic meteorites and cometary dust bring essential insights on the astrophysical conditions prevailing in the very first stages of the solar system. Several exemples are shown in this chapter, which include (1) high temperature processes and the formation of chondrules and refractory inclusions, (2) oxygen isotopes and their bearing on photochemistry and large scale geochemical reservoirs in the nebula, (3) organosynthesis and cold cloud chemistry recorded by organic matter and hydrogen isotopes, (4) irradiation of solids by flares from the young Sun and finally (5) large scale transport and mixing of material evidenced in chondritic interplanetary dust particles and samples returned from comet Wild2 by the Stardust mission.

Rock	  Multifractals are inhomogeneous measures (or functions) which are typically described by a full spectrum of real dimensions, as opposed to a single real dimension. Results from the study of fractal strings in the analysis of their geometry, spectra and dynamics via certain zeta functions and their poles (the complex dimensions) are used in this text as a springboard to define similar tools fit for the study of multifractals such as the binomial measure. The goal of this work is to shine light on new ideas and perspectives rather than to summarize a coherent theory. Progress has been made which connects these new perspectives to and expands upon classical results, leading to a healthy variety of natural and interesting questions for further investigation and elaboration.

Geballe|Malcolm R. Beasley	  Monoclinic CuO is anomalous both structurally as well as electronically in the 3$d$ transition metal oxide series. All the others have the cubic rock salt structure. Here we report the synthesis and electronic property determination of a tetragonal (elongated rock salt) form of CuO created using an epitaxial thin film deposition approach. In situ photoelectron spectroscopy suggests an enhanced charge transfer gap $\Delta$ with the overall bonding more ionic. As an end member of the 3d transition monoxides, its magnetic properties should be that of a high $T_N$ antiferromagnet.

By limiting the maximal connection distance $R_{max}$ in Newman-Watts networks with the long-rang connection probability $p$, we depict more realistically the stochastic interactions among species within ecosystems. When we fix mobility and vary the value of $p$ or $R_{max}$, the Monte Carlo simulations show that the spiral waves grow in size, and the system becomes unstable and biodiversity is lost with increasing $p$ or $R_{max}$. These results are similar to recent results of Reichenbach \textit{et al.} [Nature (London) \textbf{448}, 1046 (2007)], in which they increase the mobility only without including long-range interactions. We compared extinctions with or without long-range connections and computed spatial correlation functions and correlation length. We conclude that long-range connections could improve the mobility of species, drastically changing their crossover to extinction and making the system more unstable.

A change in the rock type results in a change of the flux function. Discretizing in one-dimensional with a finite volume method, we investigate two numerical fluxes, an extension of the Godunov flux and the upstream mobility flux, the latter being widely used in hydrogeology and petroleum engineering. Then, in the case of a changing rock type, one can give examples when the upstream mobility flux does not give the right answer.

The solar system planets represent at least four chemical planet types, depending on the phases that make them: Terrestrial-like planets made of rock (metal plus silicates), Plutonian planets made of rock and ice, Neptunian giant planets of rocky, icy with low H and He contents, and Jovian gas-giant planets of rocky, icy planets with near-solar H and He contents. The planetary compositions are linked to the chemical fractionation in the planetary accretion disks. Chemical tracers of these fractionations are described. Many known exoplanets are gas-giant planets with up to several Jupiter-masses and their atmospheric chemistry is compared to that of brown dwarfs. Exoplanets in close orbits around their host stars may resemble hot brown dwarfs (L-dwarfs). Planets receiving less radiation form their host may compare more to the methane-rich T dwarfs. The cloud layers resulting from condensation of oxides, metal, sulfides, and salts in these hot and cool gas giant planets and their chemical tracers are described.

Particle streams interacting with the gas far out within the Hill sphere of the protoplanet spiral into a prograde circumplanetary disc. Material is accreted onto the protoplanet due to stirring by the turbulent surroundings. We speculate that the trend for prograde rotation among the largest asteroids is primordial and that protoplanets accreted 10%-50% of their mass from pebbles and rocks during the gaseous solar nebula phase. Our model also offers a possible explanation for the narrow range of spin periods observed among the largest bodies in the asteroid and trans-Neptunian belts, and predicts that 1000 km-scale Kuiper belt objects that have not experienced giant impacts should preferentially spin in the prograde direction.

The method is based on spatial harmonic expansions of seismic fields. It is shown that gravity-gradient noise produced by seismic fields from distant sources, stationary or non-stationary, can be calculated from seismic data measured locally at the test mass. Furthermore, the formula is applied to seismic fields from stationary local sources. It is found that gravity gradients from these fields can be subtracted using local seismic measurements. The results are confirmed numerically with a finite-element simulation. A new seismic-array design is proposed that provides the additional information about the seismic field required to ensure applicability of the approach to realistic scenarios even with inhomogeneous rock and non-stationary local sources.

A relation is derived to express the flow rate in the fracture as a function of the temperature measured in the surrounding rock. These mathematical results can be useful for tunnel drilling as it approaches a vertical cold water bearing structure that induces a thermal anomaly in the surrounding massif. During the tunnel drilling, by monitoring this anomaly along the tunnel axis one can quantify the flow rate in the discontinuity ahead before intersecting the fracture. The cases of the Simplon, Mont Blanc and Gotthard tunnels (Alps) are handled with this approach which shows very good agreement between observed temperatures and the theoretical trend. The flow rates before drilling of the tunnel predicted with the theoretical solution are similar in the Mont Blanc and Simplon cases, as well as the flow rates observed during the drilling. However, the absence of information on hydraulic gradients (before and during drilling) and on fracture specific storage prevents direct predictions of discharge rates in the tunnel.

The observed values clearly show the principal trend due to rainfall recharge. Spectral analysis was carried out to evaluate correlation of the cyclic fluctuation to the synthetic earth tides as well as groundwater withdrawal time series in the surrounding. It was found that these fluctuations have considerably high correlation with earth tides whereas groundwater pumping does not show any significant correlation with water table fluctuations. It is concluded that earth tides cause the fluctuation in the water table. These fluctuations were hitherto unobserved during manual observations made over larger time intervals. It indicates that the unconfined aquifer is characterised by a low porosity.

Schipper	  It is well known that the rock-paper-scissors game has no pure saddle point. We show that this holds more generally: A symmetric two-player zero-sum game has a pure saddle point if and only if it is not a generalized rock-paper-scissors game. Moreover, we show that every finite symmetric quasiconcave two-player zero-sum game has a pure saddle point. Further sufficient conditions for existence are provided. We apply our theory to a rich collection of examples by noting that the class of symmetric two-player zero-sum games coincides with the class of relative payoff games associated with symmetric two-player games. This allows us to derive results on the existence of a finite population evolutionary stable strategies.

Specifically, the coarse Holder regularity values attained by a given measure and with respect to a sequence of partitions generate a sequence of lengths (or rather, scales) which in turn define certain Dirichlet series, called the partition zeta functions. The abscissae of convergence of these functions define a multifractal spectrum whose concave envelope is the (geometric) Hausdorff multifractal spectrum which follows from a certain type of Moran construction. We discuss at some length the important special case of self-similar measures associated with weighted iterated function systems and, in particular, certain multinomial measures. Moreover, our multifractal spectrum is shown to extend to a tapestry of complex dimensions for two specific atomic measures.

Cobine|D. Fackler|M. Hastedt|D. Houpt|Z. Mateo|Y. B. Vasilieva	  A new high-efficiency and low-background system for the measurement of natural gamma radioactivity in marine sediment and rock cores retrieved from beneath the seabed was designed, built, and installed on the JOIDES Resolution research vessel. The system includes eight large NaI(Tl) detectors that measure adjacent intervals of the core simultaneously, maximizing counting times and minimizing statistical error for the limited measurement times available during drilling expeditions. Effect to background ratio is maximized with passive lead shielding, including both ordinary and low-activity lead. Large-area plastic scintillator active shielding filters background associated with the high-energy part of cosmic radiation. The new system has at least an order of magnitude higher statistical reliability and significantly enhances data quality compared to other offshore natural gamma radiation (NGR) systems designed to measure geological core samples. Reliable correlations and interpretations of cored intervals are possible at rates of a few counts per second.

Lathe|V. Z. Turkevich|V. L. Solozhenko	  X-ray diffraction with synchrotron radiation has been used for the first time to study chemical interaction in the MnO-ZnO system at 4.8 GPa and temperatures up to 1600 K. Above 750 K, the chemical reaction between MnO and ZnO has been observed that resulted in the formation of rock salt (rs) Mn1-xZnxO solid solutions (0.3 \leq x \leq 0.7). The lattice parameters of these solid solutions have been in situ measured at high pressure as a function of temperature, and corresponding thermal expansion coefficients have been calculated.

The system consists of piezoelectric detector, amplifier-limiter, pass-band filter, piezoelectric exciter and the frequency meter. The mass rock plays a role of delaying element, in which variations in stresses causing the variations of acoustic wave velocity of propagation, and successive variation in frequency of oscillations generated by system.   The laboratory test permitted to estimate variations in frequency caused by variations in stresses of elastic medium. The principles of selection of frequency and other parameters of the electronic system in application to stresses measurement in condition of the mine were presented.

This geometrical complexity affects fluid transport and heat exchange between the flow- ing fluid and the surrounding rock. In particular, long range correlations of self-affine apertures induce strong channeling of the flow which influences both mass and heat advection. A key question is to find a geometrical model of the complex aperture that describes at best the macroscopic properties (hydraulic conductivity, heat exchange) with the smallest number of parameters. Solving numerically the Stokes and heat equa- tions with a lubrication approximation, we show that a low pass filtering of the aperture geometry provides efficient estimates of the effective hydraulic and thermal properties (apertures). A detailed study of the influence of the bandwidth of the lowpass filtering on these transport properties is also performed. For instance, keeping the information of amplitude only of the largest Fourier length scales allows us to reach already an accuracy of 9% on the hydraulic and the thermal apertures.

First, using ab initio methods we study the stability of the crystal structure of CdTe - PbTe solid solutions, to predict the composition for which rock-salt structure of PbTe changes into zinc-blende structure of CdTe. The dependence of the lattice parameter on Cd (Mn) content x in the mixed crystals is studied by the same methods. The obtained decrease of the lattice constant with x agrees with what is observed in both alloys. The band structures of PbTe-based ternary compounds are calculated within a tight-binding approach. To describe correctly the constituent materials new tight-binding parameterizations for PbTe and MnTe bulk crystals as well as a tight-binding description of rock-salt CdTe are proposed. For both studied ternary alloys, the calculated band gap in the L point increases with x, in qualitative agreement with photoluminescence measurements in the infrared. The results show also that in p-type Pb1-xCdxTe and Pb1-xMnxTe mixed crystals an enhancement of thermoelectrical power can be expected.

Menezes	  We introduce a family of Rock-Paper-Scissors type models with $Z_N$ symmetry ($N$ is the number of species) and we show that it has a very rich structure with many completely different phases. We study realizations which lead to the formation of domains, where individuals of one or more species coexist, separated by interfaces whose (average) dynamics is curvature driven. This type of behavior, which might be relevant for the development of biological complexity, leads to an interface network evolution and pattern formation similar to the ones of several other nonlinear systems in condensed matter and cosmology.

Oliveira	  We investigate the population dynamics in generalized Rock-Paper-Scissors models with an arbitrary number of species $N$. We show, for the first time, that spiral patterns with $N$-arms may develop both for odd and even $N$, in particular in models where a bidirectional predation interaction of equal strength between all species is modified to include one N-cyclic predator-prey rule. While the former case gives rise to an interface network with Y-type junctions obeying the scaling law $L \propto t^{1/2}$, where $L$ is the characteristic length of the network and $t$ is the time, the later can lead to a population network with $N$-armed spiral patterns, having a roughly constant characteristic length scale. We explicitly demonstrate the connection between interface junctions and spiral patterns in these models and compute the corresponding scaling laws. This work significantly extends the results of previous studies of population dynamics and could have profound implications for the understanding of biological complexity in systems with a large number of species. 	
1206.3010v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.3010v2	2013	Conjecture on imminent earthquake prediction --- from shaving foam to   cloud patterns	Xin Liu	  A conjecture on imminent earthquake prediction is presented. Drastic geological deformations of crustal rock strata taking place immediately (hours/days) before an earthquake may cause fast air or gas emission/absorption vertically in between ground and sky. I conjecture, inspired by an observation of strange patterns appearing on shaving foam, that this fast movement of air fluid may produce unusual cloud patterns at interfaces between atmosphere levels. This air movement is vertical and drastic, different from the horizontal and moderate meteorological air movement, hence its caused cloud patterns are expected to be different from meteorological cloud patterns. This provides a possible origin for the so-called earthquake cloud. Recognition of different earthquake cloud patterns may provide a practical way to estimate location, magnitude and strength of geological deformations of rock strata, and hence a method with support of physics for imminent earthquake prediction. In the end of this paper an experiment has been designed to test the conjecture.

Amy Pang|Arun Ram	  The operation of squaring (coproduct followed by product) in a combinatorial Hopf algebra is shown to induce a Markov chain in natural bases. Chains constructed in this way include widely studied methods of card shuffling, a natural "rock-breaking" process, and Markov chains on simplicial complexes. Many of these chains can be explictly diagonalized using the primitive elements of the algebra and the combinatorics of the free Lie algebra. For card shuffling, this gives an explicit description of the eigenvectors. For rock-breaking, an explicit description of the quasi-stationary distribution and sharp rates to absorption follow.

The spatial flux is based on motion due to local gradients in the relative fitness of each strategy, providing a game-dependent alternative to diffusive coupling. We study numerically the development of patterns in 1D for two-strategy games including the coordination game and the prisoner's dilemma, and in 2D for the rock-paper-scissors game. In 1D we observe modified travelling wave solutions in the presence of diffusion, and asymptotic attracting states under a frozen strategy assumption without diffusion. In 2D we observe spiral formation and breakup in the frozen strategy rock-paper-scissors game without diffusion. A change of variables appropriate to replicator dynamics is shown to correctly capture the 1D asymptotic steady state via a nonlinear diffusion equation.

Pierre Berest|Hippolyte Djakeun-Djizanne|Benoît Brouard|Grégoire Hévin	  Rapid gas depressurization leads to gas cooling that is followed by slow gas warming when the cavern is kept idle. The decrease in the temperature of gas depends upon the relative withdrawal rate (in %/day), and cavern size and shape. Gas cooling may result in the onset of tensile stresses at cavern walls and roofs that may generate fractures or cracks. However, in most cases, the depth of penetration of these fractures is small, and they are perpendicular to the cavern wall. The distance between two parallel fractures becomes larger when fractures penetrate deeper into the rock mass, as some fractures stop growing. Fractures form a polygonal pattern. Salt slabs are created, with boundaries formed by the opened fractures. As long as the depth of penetration of the fracture remains small, these slabs remain strongly bonded to the rock mass, and it is believed that, in many cases, their weights are not large enough to allow them to break off the cavern wall. 	
1308.1288v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.1288v1	2013	Strain engineering of topological properties in lead-salt semiconductors	Paolo Barone|Domenico Di Sante|Silvia Picozzi	  Rock-salt chalcogenide SnTe represents the simplest realization of a topological insulator where a crystal symmetry allows for the appearence of topologically protected metallic states with an even number of Dirac cones on high-symmetry crystal surfaces. Related rock-salt lead chalcogenides have been predicted as well to undergo a phase-transition to a topological crystalline insulating phase after band inversion induced by alloying and pressure. Here we theoretically predict that strain, as realized in thin films grown on (001) substrates, may induce such topological phase-transitions. Furthermore, relevant topological properties of the surface states, such as the location of the Dirac cones on the surface Brillouin zone or the decay length of edge states, appear to be tunable with strain, with potential implications for technological devices benefiting from those additional degrees of freedom.

To date, TCI behaviors have been observed in SnTe and the related alloys Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$Se/Te, which incorporate heavy elements with large spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Here, by combining first-principles and {\it ab initio} tight-binding calculations, we report the formation of a TCI in the relatively lighter rock-salt SnS and SnSe. This TCI is characterized by an even number of Dirac cones at the high-symmetry (001), (110) and (111) surfaces, which are protected by the reflection symmetry with respect to the ($\bar{1}$10) mirror plane. We find that both SnS and SnSe have an intrinsically inverted band structure and the SOC is necessary only to open the bulk band gap. The bulk band gap evolution upon volume expansion reveals a topological transition from an ambient pressure TCI to a topologically trivial insulator. Our results indicate that the SOC alone is not sufficient to drive the topological transition.

The analysis of several rock drawings lets us date them. The priests Hina Mango and Rahu (Rahi) were not only experts on the script, but also great astronomers. There is abundant evidence that the priests-astronomers used the astrolabe in their studies. The local astronomical terminology has been decoded. The observatory at the ceremonial platform Ahu Tongariki has been investigated carefully. The orientation of a female statue on the slope of the Rano Raraku volcano allows us to suggest that it was an image of the Moon (the moon goddess). A number of additional astronomical and calendar records in the rock art and in the writing have been deciphered.

In this Comment we show that neglecting (i) the strongly pronounced kinetic features of the pressure-induced phase transition in ZnO at room temperature and (ii) results of calorimetric measurements available in the literature [Russ.

Here, we report high-quality epitaxial films of the tetragonal beta-BaZn2As2 were grown on single-crystal MgO (001) substrates by a reactive solid-phase epitaxy technique. Out-of-plane and in-plane epitaxial relationships between the film and the substrate were BaZn2As2 (00l)//MgO (001) and BaZn2As2 [200]//MgO [200], respectively. The full-widths at half maximum were 0.082o for a 008 out-of-plane rocking curve and 0.342o for a 200 in-plane rocking curve. A step-and-terrace structure was observed by atomic force microscopy. The band gap of beta-BaZn2As2 was evaluated to be around 0.2 eV, which is much smaller than that of a family compound LaZnOAs (1.5 eV). Density functional theory calculation using the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof hybrid functionals supports the small band gap.

Török	  River-bed sediments display two universal downstream trends: fining, in which particle size decreases; and rounding, where pebble shapes evolve toward ellipsoids. Rounding is known to result from transport-induced abrasion; however many researchers argue that the contribution of abrasion to downstream fining is negligible. This presents a paradox: downstream shape change indicates substantial abrasion, while size change apparently rules it out. Here we use laboratory experiments and numerical modeling to show quantitatively that pebble abrasion is a curvature-driven flow problem. As a consequence, abrasion occurs in two well-separated phases: first, pebble edges rapidly round without any change in axis dimensions until the shape becomes entirely convex; and second, axis dimensions are then slowly reduced while the particle remains convex. Explicit study of pebble shape evolution helps resolve the shape-size paradox by reconciling discrepancies between laboratory and field studies, and enhances our ability to decipher the transport history of a river rock.

Bishop	  The Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) has returned observations of the Nili Fossae region indicating the presence of Mg- carbonate in small (<10km sq2), relatively bright rock units that are commonly fractured (Ehlmann et al., 2008b). We have analyzed spectra from CRISM images and used co-located HiRISE images in order to further characterize these carbonate-bearing units. We applied absorption band mapping techniques to investigate a range of possible phyllosilicate and carbonate minerals that could be present in the Nili Fossae region. We also describe a clay-carbonate hydrothermal alteration mineral assemblage in the Archean Warrawoona Group of Western Australia that is a potential Earth analog to the Nili Fossae carbonate-bearing rock units. We discuss the geological and biological implications for hydrothermal processes on Noachian Mars.

Main	  We investigate the scaling properties of the sources of crackling noise in a fully-dynamic numerical model of sedimentary rocks subject to uniaxial compression. The model is initiated by filling a cylindrical container with randomly-sized spherical particles which are then connected by breakable beams. Loading at a constant strain rate the cohesive elements fail and the resulting stress transfer produces sudden bursts of correlated failures, directly analogous to the sources of acoustic emissions in real experiments. The source size, energy, and duration can all be quantified for an individual event, and the population analyzed for their scaling properties, including the distribution of waiting times between consecutive events. Despite the non-stationary loading, the results are all characterized by power law distributions over a broad range of scales in agreement with experiments. As failure is approached temporal correlation of events emerge accompanied by spatial clustering.

Rondinelli	  High-temperature electronic materials are in constant demand as the required operational range for various industries increases. Here we design $(A,A^\prime)B_2$O$_6$ perovskite oxides with [111] ``rock salt" $A$-site cation order and predict them to be potential high-temperature piezoelectric materials. By selecting bulk perovskites which have a tendency towards only out-of-phase $B$O$_6$ rotations, we avoid possible staggered ferroelectric to paraelectric phase transitions while also retaining non-centrosymmetric crystal structures necessary for ferro- and piezoelectricity. Using density functional theory calculations, we show that (La,Pr)Al$_2$O$_6$ and (Ce,Pr)Al$_2$O$_6$ display spontaneous polarizations in their polar ground state structures; we also compute the dielectric and piezoelectric constants for each phase. Additionally, we predict the critical phase transition temperatures for each material from first-principles to demonstrate that the piezoelectric responses, which are comparable to traditional lead-free piezoelectrics, should persist to high temperature. These features make the rock salt $A$-site ordered aluminates candidates for high-temperature sensors, actuators, or other electronic devices.

Collins	  The Pluto-Charon system, likely formed from an impact, has reached the endpoint of its tidal evolution. During its evolution into the dual-synchronous state, the equilibrium tidal figures of Pluto and Charon would have also evolved as angular momentum was transferred from Pluto's spin to Charon's orbit. The rate of tidal evolution is controlled by Pluto's interior physical and thermal state. We examine three interior models for Pluto: an undifferentiated rock/ice mixture, differentiated with ice above rock, and differentiated with an ocean. For the undifferentiated case without an ocean, the Pluto-Charon binary does not evolve to its current state unless its internal temperature $T_i>200$ K, which would likely lead to strong tidal heating, melting, and differentiation. Without an ocean, Pluto's interior temperature must be higher than 240 K for Charon to evolve on a time scale less than the age of the solar system. Further tidal heating would likely create an ocean. If New Horizons finds evidence of ancient tidally-driven tectonic activity on either body, the most likely explanation is that Pluto had an internal ocean during Charon's orbital evolution.

Here we show that such an undesirable destiny is avoidable in an iterated Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) game involving two players X and Y. Player X has the option of proactively adopting a cooperation-trap strategy, which enforces complete cooperation from the rational player Y and leads to a highly beneficial as well as maximally fair situation to both players. That maximal degree of cooperation is achievable in such a competitive system with cyclic dominance of actions may stimulate creative thinking on how to resolve conflicts and enhance cooperation in human societies.

Strogatz	  We analyze the replicator-mutator equations for the Rock-Paper-Scissors game. Various graph-theoretic patterns of mutation are considered, ranging from a single unidirectional mutation pathway between two of the species, to global bidirectional mutation among all the species. Our main result is that the coexistence state, in which all three species exist in equilibrium, can be destabilized by arbitrarily small mutation rates. After it loses stability, the coexistence state gives birth to a stable limit cycle solution created in a supercritical Hopf bifurcation. This attracting periodic solution exists for all the mutation patterns considered, and persists arbitrarily close to the limit of zero mutation rate and a zero-sum game.

Ludwig	  Breaking time-reversal symmetry (TRS) in the absence of a net bias can give rise to directed steady-state non-equilibrium transport phenomena such as ratchet effects. Here we present, theoretically and experimentally, the concept of a Lissajous rocking ratchet as an instrument based on breaking TRS. Our system is a semiconductor quantum dot (QD) with periodically modulated dot-lead tunnel barriers. Broken TRS gives rise to single electron tunneling current. Its direction is fully controlled by exploring frequency and phase relations between the two barrier modulations. The concept of Lissajous ratchets can be realized in a large variety of different systems, including nano-electrical, nano-electromechanical or superconducting circuits. It promises applications based on a detailed on-chip comparison of radio-frequency signals.

Such information may be obtained by remembering previous interactions. We consider a rock-scissors-paper game in which agents are able to recall their last $m$ interactions, used to estimate the behaviour of their opponents. At critical memory length, a Hopf bifurcation leads to the formation of stable limit cycles. In a mixed population, agents with longer memories have an advantage, provided the system has a stable fixed point, and there is some asymmetry in the payoffs of the pure strategies. However, at a critical concentration of long memory agents, the appearance of limit cycles destroys their advantage. By introducing population dynamics that favours successful agents, we show that the system evolves toward the bifurcation point.

Wagner|Elif Ertekin	  We present an analysis of the polymorphic energy ordering and properties of the rock salt and zincblende structures of manganese oxide using fixed node diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC). Manganese oxide is a correlated, antiferromagnetic material that has proven to be challenging to model from first principles across a variety of approaches. Unlike conventional density functional theory and some hybrid functionals, fixed node diffusion Monte Carlo finds the rock salt structure to be more stable than the zincblende structure, and thus recovers the correct energy ordering. Analysis of the site-resolved charge fluctuations of the wave functions according to DMC and other electronic structure descriptions give insights into elements that are missing in other theories. While the calculated band gaps within DMC are in agreement with predictions that the zincblende polymorph has a lower band gap, the gaps themselves overestimate reported experimental values.

Yung	  The climate of Mars likely evolved from a warmer, wetter early state to the cold, arid current state. However, no solutions for this evolution have previously been found to satisfy the observed geological features and isotopic measurements of the atmosphere. Here we show that a family of solutions exist, invoking no missing reservoirs or loss processes. Escape of carbon via CO photodissociation and sputtering enriches heavy carbon (13C) in the Martian atmosphere, partially compensated by moderate carbonate precipitation. The current atmospheric 13C/12C and rock and soil carbonate measurements indicate an early atmosphere with a surface pressure <1 bar. Only scenarios with large amounts of carbonate formation in open lakes permit higher values up to 1.8 bar. The evolutionary scenarios are fully testable with data from the MAVEN mission and further studies of the isotopic composition of carbonate in the Martian rock record through time.

We here consider such a system for a broad range of interaction rates. When one species grows very slowly, this species and its prey dominate the system by self-organizing into a labyrinthine configuration in which the third species propagates. The cluster size distributions of the two dominating species have heavy tails and the configuration is stabilized through a complex, spatial feedback loop. We introduce a new statistical measure that quantifies the amount of clustering in the spatial system by comparison with its mean field approximation. Hereby, we are able to quantitatively explain how the labyrinthine configuration slows down the dynamics and stabilizes the system.

Bigoni	  An elasto-plastic model for concrete, based on a recently-proposed yield surface and simple hardening laws, is formulated, implemented, numerically tested and validated against available test results. The yield surface is smooth and particularly suited to represent the behaviour of rock-like materials, such as concrete, mortar, ceramic and rock. A new class of isotropic hardening laws is proposed, which can be given both an incremental and the corresponding finite form. These laws describe a smooth transition from linear elastic to plastic behaviour, incorporating linear and nonlinear hardening, and may approach the perfectly plastic limit in the latter case. The reliability of the model is demonstrated by its capability of correctly describing the results yielded by a number of well documented triaxial tests on concrete subjected to various confinement levels. Thanks to its simplicity, the model turns out to be very robust and well suited to be used in complex design situations, as those involving dynamic loads.

This transport is an ingredient of several perspective quantum devices including atomic chips. Here we examine coherent transport of ultra-cold atoms in a rocking quantum ratchet. This is realized by loading a rubidium atomic Bose-Einstein condensate into a periodic optical potential subjected to a biharmonic temporal drive. The achieved long-time coherence allows us to resolve resonance enhancement of the atom transport induced by avoided crossings in the Floquet spectrum of the system. By tuning the strength of the temporal modulations, we observe a bifurcation of a single resonance into a doublet. Our measurements reveal the role of interactions among Floquet eigenstates for quantum ratchet transport.

Herrmann	  A multi-scale scheme for the invasion percolation of rock fracture networks with heterogeneous fracture aperture fields is proposed. Inside fractures, fluid transport is calculated on the finest scale and found to be localized in channels as a consequence of the aperture field. The channel network is characterized and reduced to a vectorized artificial channel network (ACN). Different realizations of ACNs are used to systematically calculate efficient apertures for fluid transport inside differently sized fractures as well as fracture intersection and entry properties. Typical situations in fracture networks are parameterized by fracture inclination, flow path length along the fracture and intersection lengths in the entrance and outlet zones of fractures. Using these scaling relations obtained from the finer scales, we simulate the invasion process of immiscible fluids into saturated discrete fracture networks, which were studied in previous works.

Klain	  The present paper summarizes results of the studies on the intensity of geomagnetic field in the (167 - 23) Ma interval by sedimentary rocks of the Russian Plate and adjacent territories. The joint analysis of the data paleointensity obtained by sedimentary and thermomagnetized (from PINT12) rocks within this temporal interval is conducted. It is shown that the changes of the paleointensity were occurred chaotically. Alternating bursts and periods of quiet regime of the geomagnetic field are typical for intermittent processes and is a characteristic of the geological interval Jurassic-beginning of Paleogene. The distributions of the paleointensity corresponding to different intervals of geologic time were investigated. It is revealed that the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the paleointensity values is best approximated by a power function. The indices of the power functions varied depending on geologic time intervals.The analysis of the paleomagnetic data suggests that the medium in which the geomagnetic field is generated is turbulent. Turbulence in the Earth's liquid core is enhanced in the Cretaceous compared with Jurassic and Paleogene.

Antipov|J. E. Butler|A. V. Kolyadin|A. Katrusha	  We report fabrication and results of high-resolution X-ray topography characterization of diamond single crystal plates with a large surface area (10$\times$10 mm$^2$) and (111) crystal surface orientation for applications in high-heat-load X-ray crystal optics. The plates were fabricated by laser cutting of the (111) facets of diamond crystals grown using high-pressure high-temperature method. The intrinsic crystal quality of a selected 3$\times$7~mm$^2$ crystal region of one of the studied samples was found to be suitable for applications in wavefront-preserving high-heat-load crystal optics. The wavefront characterization was performed using sequential X-ray diffraction topography in the pseudo plane wave configuration and data analysis using rocking curve topography. The variation of the rocking curve width and peak position measured with a spatial resolution of 13$\times$13 $\mu m^2$ over the selected region were found to be less than one microradian.

Jougnot|J. Irving	  Numerous field experiments suggest that the self-potential (SP) geophysical method may allow for the detection of hydraulically active fractures and provide information about fracture properties. However, a lack of suitable numerical tools for modeling streaming potentials in fractured media prevents quantitative interpretation and limits our understanding of how the SP method can be used in this regard. To address this issue, we present a highly efficient two-dimensional discrete-dual-porosity approach for solving the fluid flow and associated self-potential problems in fractured rock. Our approach is specifically designed for complex fracture networks that cannot be investigated using standard numerical methods. We then simulate SP signals associated with pumping conditions for a number of examples to show that (i) accounting for matrix fluid flow is essential for accurate SP modeling and (ii) the sensitivity of SP to hydraulically active fractures is intimately linked with fracture-matrix fluid interactions. This implies that fractures associated with strong SP amplitudes are likely to be hydraulically conductive, attracting fluid flow from the surrounding matrix.

Abrudan|Orfeas Kypris|Niki Trigoni|Andrew Markham	  In this paper, we analyze the effect of different underground materials on very-low and low frequency magnetic fields used in the contexts of magneto-inductive localization and communication applications, respectively. We calculate the attenuation that these magnetic fields are subject to while passing through most common rocks and minerals. Knowing the attenuation properties is crucial in the design of underground magneto-inductive communication systems. In addition, we provide means to predict the distortions in the magnetic field that impair localization systems. The proposed work offers basic design guidelines for communication and localization systems in terms of channel path-loss, operation frequencies and bandwidth. For the sake of the reproducibility of the results, we provide the raw data and processing source code to be used by the two research communities.

Hanowski|Oliver Sander	  We introduce a coupled system of PDEs for the modeling of the fluid-fluid and fluid-solid interaction in a poroelastic material with a single static fracture. The fluid flow in the fracture is modeled by a lower-dimensional Darcy equation, which interacts with the surrounding rock matrix and the fluid it contains. We explicitly allow the fracture to end within the domain, and the fracture width is an unknown of the problem. The resulting weak problem is nonlinear, elliptic and symmetric, and can be given the structure of a fixed-point problem. We show that the coupled fluid-fluid problem has a solution in a specially crafted Sobolev space, even though the fracture width cannot be bounded away from zero near the crack tip.   For numerical simulations, we combine XFEM discretizations for the rock matrix deformation and pore pressure with a standard lower-dimensional finite element method for the fracture flow problem. The resulting coupled discrete system consists of linear subdomain problems coupled by nonlinear coupling conditions. We solve the coupled system with a substructuring solver and observe very fast convergence. We also observe optimal mesh dependence of the discretization errors even in the presence of crack tips.

Min Hong|Zhi-Gang Chen|Yanzhong Pei|Lei Yang|Jin Zou	  Rock-salt structured chalcogenides, such as PbTe, PbSe, and SnTe, are the top candidates for mid-temperature thermoelectric applications, and their p-type thermoelectric efficiencies can be enhanced via aligning the valence bands. Here, we provided comprehensive numerical investigations on the effects of band convergence on electronic properties. We found that the extra valance band can indeed significantly enhance the power factor. Nevertheless, the extra valance band can also increase the electronic thermal conductivity, which partially offsets the enhanced power factor for the overall figure-of-merit. Finally, we predicted that the maximum figure-of-merit for PbTe, PbSe, and SnTe can reach to 2.2, 1.8, and 1.6, re-spectively, without relying on the reduction in lattice thermal conductivity.

Up to 520 features were tested using 4 different filters and all 31 different combinations were verified. The classification process relies on a Naive Bayes classifier. We performed two kinds of optimizations: statistical optimization with covariance-based Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and a genetic optimization, for 10,000 randomly defined samples, achieving a final maximum classification success of 91% against the original 70% success ratio (without any optimization nor filters used). After the optimization 9 types of features emerged as most relevant.

Palermo|M. A. Rincon|R. M. S. Rosa	  A Stokes-type problem for a viscoelastic model of salt rocks is considered, and existence, uniqueness and regularity are investigated in the scale of $L^2$-based Sobolev spaces. The system is transformed into a generalized Stokes problem, and the proper conditions on the parameters of the model that guarantee that the system is uniformly elliptic are given. Under those conditions, existence, uniqueness and low-order regularity are obtained under classical regularity conditions on the data, while higher-order regularity is proved under less stringent conditions than classical ones. Explicit estimates for the solution in terms of the data are given accordingly.

It is hard to obtain data to learn a multi-layer decomposition. Instead, we can learn to decompose an image into layers that are "like this" by authoring generative models for each layer using proxy examples that capture the Platonic ideal (Mondrian images for albedo; rendered 3D primitives for shading; material swatches for shading detail). Our method then generates image layers, one from each model, that explain the image. Our approach rests on innovation in generative models for images. We introduce a Convolutional Variational Auto Encoder (conv-VAE), a novel VAE architecture that can reconstruct high fidelity images. The approach is general, and does not require that layers admit a physical interpretation.

Baron	  Identifying transport pathways in fractured rock is extremely challenging as flow is often organized in a few fractures that occupy a very small portion of the rock volume. We demonstrate that saline tracer experiments combined with single-hole ground penetrating radar (GPR) reflection imaging can be used to monitor saline tracer movement within mm-aperture fractures. A dipole tracer test was performed in a granitic aquifer by injecting a saline solution in a known fracture, while repeatedly acquiring single-hole GPR sections in the pumping borehole located 6 m away. The final depth-migrated difference sections make it possible to identify consistent temporal changes over a 30 m depth interval at locations corresponding to fractures previously imaged in GPR sections acquired under natural flow and tracer-free conditions. The experiment allows determining the dominant flow paths of the injected tracer and the velocity (0.4-0.7 m/min) of the tracer front.

Farfurnik|G. Haim|R. Shaar|N. Bar-Gill	  Magnetization in rock samples is crucial for paleomagnetometry research, as it harbors valuable geological information on long term processes, such as tectonic movements and the formation of oceans and continents. Nevertheless, current techniques are limited in their ability to measure high spatial resolution and high-sensitivity quantitative vectorial magnetic signatures from such samples. As a result, our understanding of this magnetization is limited, specifically for the case of multi-domain samples. In this work we use a newly developed nitrogen-vacancy magnetic microscope, capable of quantitative vectorial magnetic imaging with optical resolution. We demonstrate direct imaging of the vectorial magnetic field of a single, multi-domain dendrite, as well as the measurement and calculation of the weak magnetic moments of individual grains on the micron scale. These results pave the way for future applications in paleomagnetometry, and for the fundamental understanding of magnetization in multi-domain samples.

The paper concerns (i) the macroscopic candidate for sedimentary meteorite in the epicenter of the 1908 Tunguska catastrophe; (ii) potential parent bodies for sedimentary meteorites; (iii) isotopic heterogeneity of unmixed silicate reservoirs on Mars; (iv) possible terrestrial loss or contamination in the noble gas signatures in new type meteorites that spent time in extreme weather conditions; (v) cosmogenic isotopes and shielding; and (vi) pseudo meteorites. We conclude that the list of candidate parent bodies for sedimentary meteorites includes, but is not limited by the Earth, Mars, Enceladus, Ganymede, Europa, and hypothetical planets that could exist between orbits of Mars and Jupiter in the past. A parent body for extraterrestrial sedimentary rocks on the Earth should be identified based on the entire body of evidence which is not limited solely by tests of oxygen and noble gas isotopes whose signatures may undergo terrestrial contamination and may exhibit significant heterogeneity within the parent bodies. Observed fall of cosmic body, evidence of hypervelocity impact complying with the criteria of impact structures, and the presence of fusion crust on the fragments should be considered as priority signs of meteoritic origin.

Santos	  This work deals with a system of three distinct species that changes in time under the presence of mobility, reproduction and predation, as in the popular rock-paper-scissors game. The novelty of the current study is the modification of the mobility rule to the case of directional mobility in which the species move following the direction associated to a larger (averaged) number density of preys in the surrounding neighborhood. Directional mobility can be used to simulate eyes that see or a nose that smells, and we show how it may contribute to limit biodiversity.

Hipiny	  Classification of rocks is one of the fundamental tasks in a geological study. The process requires a human expert to examine sampled thin section images under a microscope. In this study, we propose a method that uses microscope automation, digital image acquisition, edge detection and colour analysis (histogram). We collected 60 digital images from 20 standard thin sections using a digital camera mounted on a conventional microscope. Each image is partitioned into a finite number of cells that form a grid structure. Edge and colour profile of pixels inside each cell determine its classification. The individual cells then determine the thin section image classification via a majority voting scheme. Our method yielded successful results as high as 90% to 100% precision.

Vazirani|Peter Yunker	  We model a situation in which a collection of species derive their fitnesses via a rock-paper-scissors-type game; however, the precise payoffs are a function of the environment. The new aspect of our model lies in adding a feedback loop: the environment changes according to the relative fitnesses of the species; in particular, it gives a boost to the species having small populations. We cast our model in the setting of a differential game and we show that for a certain setting of parameters, this dynamics cycles. Our model is a natural one, since depletion of resources used by more frequent species will shift the payoff matrix towards favoring less frequent ones. Since the dynamics cycles, no species goes extinct and diversity is maintained.

Guzina	  This study examines the feasibility of the full-field ultrasonic characterization of fractures in rock. To this end, a slab-like specimen of granite is subjected to in-plane, O(10$^4$Hz) excitation while monitoring the induced 2D wavefield by a Scanning Laser Doppler Vibrometer (SLDV) with sub-centimeter spatial resolution. Upon suitable filtering and interpolation, the observed wavefield is verified to conform with the plane-stress approximation and used to: (i) compute the maps of elastic modulus in the specimen (before and after fracturing) via a rudimentary application of the principle of elastography; (ii) reconstruct the fracture geometry; (iii) expose the fracture's primal (traction-displacement jump) contact behavior, and (iv) identify its profiles of shear and normal specific stiffness. Through the use of full-field ultrasonic data, the approach provides an unobscured, high-resolution insight into the fracture's contact behavior, foreshadowing in-depth laboratory exploration of interdependencies between the fracture geometry, aperture, interphase properties, and its seismic characteristics.

Katz	  Geological features have been interpreted as evidence of channelized magma flow in the mantle, which is a compacting porous medium. Aharonov et al. (1995) developed a simple model of reactive porous flow and numerically analysed its instability to channels in a limited parameter space. The instability relies on magma advection against a chemical solubility gradient and the porosity-dependent permeability of the porous host rock. We extend the previous analysis by systematically mapping out the parameter space. Crucially, we augment numerical solutions with asymptotic analysis to better understand the physical controls on the instability. We derive scalings for critical conditions of the instability, and also for the wavelength and growth rate of the channel structures that emerge. We obtain quantitative theories and a physical understanding of: first, how advection or diffusion over the reactive time scale set the horizontal length scale of channels; second, the role of viscous compaction of the host rock. These scalings allow us to derive estimates of the spacing of emergent channels that can be compared to the geologic record across all possible parameter regimes.

Muon data were acquired at four locations within a tunnel beneath Los Alamos, New Mexico, and used in a 3D tomographic inversion to recover the spatial variation in the overlying rock-air interface, and compared with a priori knowledge of the topography. Densities obtained exhibit good agreement with preliminary results of the gravity modeling, which will be presented elsewhere, and are compatible with values reported in the literature. The modeled rock-air interface matches that obtained from LIDAR within 4 m, our resolution, over much of the model volume. This experiment demonstrates the power of cosmic ray muons to image shallow geological targets using underground detectors, whose development as borehole devices will be an important new direction of passive geophysical imaging.

Saltzberg|R. C. Field|E. Guillian|R. Milincic|D. Walz|D. Williams	  We report on further SLAC measurements of the Askaryan effect: coherent radio emission from charge asymmetry in electromagnetic cascades. We used synthetic rock salt as the dielectric medium, with cascades produced by GeV bremsstrahlung photons at the Final Focus Test Beam. We extend our prior discovery measurements to a wider range of parameter space and explore the effect in a dielectric medium of great potential interest to large scale ultra-high energy neutrino detectors: rock salt (halite), which occurs naturally in high purity formations containing in many cases hundreds of cubic km of water-equivalent mass. We observed strong coherent pulsed radio emission over a frequency band from 0.2-15 GHz. A grid of embedded dual-polarization antennas was used to confirm the high degree of linear polarization and track the change of direction of the electric-field vector with azimuth around the shower. Coherence was observed over 4 orders of magnitude of shower energy. The frequency dependence of the radiation was tested over two orders of magnitude of UHF and microwave frequencies. We have also made the first observations of coherent transition radiation from the Askaryan charge excess, and the result agrees well with theoretical predictions. Based on these results we have performed a detailed and conservative simulation of a realistic GZK neutrino telescope array within a salt-dome, and we find it capable of detecting 10 or more contained events per year from even the most conservative GZK neutrino models.

Shikhin|V. E. Yants|J. Peltoniemi|T. Keranen	  A natural neutron flux is one of significant kind of background in high-sensitive underground experiments. Therefore, when scheduling a delicate underground measurements one needs to measure neutron background. Deep underground the most significant source of neutrons are the U-Th natural radioactive chains giving a fission spectrum with the temperature of 2-3 MeV. Another source is the U-Th alpha-reactions on light nuclei of mine rock giving neutrons with different spectra in the 1-15 MeV energy region. Normal basalt mine rocks contain 1 ppm g/g of U-238 and less. Deep underground those rocks produce natural neutron fluxes of 10^{-7} - 10^{-6} cm^{-2}s^{-1} above 1 MeV. To measure such a background one needs a special techniques. In the Institute for Nuclear Research, Moscow, the neutron spectrometer was developed and built which is sensitive to such a low neutron fluxes. At the end of 2001 the collection of neutron data at the Pyhasalmi mine was started for the CUPP project. During 2002 the background and rough energy spectra of neutron at underground levels 410, 660, 990 and 1410 m were measured. The result of the measurement of the neutron background at different levels of the Pyhasalmi mine is presented and discussed. Data analysis is performed in different energy ranges from thermal neutrons up to 25 MeV and above.

Durisen	  We investigate the coupling between rock-size solids and gas during the formation of gas giant planets by disk fragmentation in the outer regions of massive disks. In this study, we use three-dimensional radiative hydrodynamics simulations and model solids as a spatial distribution of particles. We assume that half of the total solid fraction is in small grains and half in large solids. The former are perfectly entrained with the gas and set the opacity in the disk, while the latter are allowed to respond to gas drag forces, with the back reaction on the gas taken into account. To explore the maximum effects of gas-solid interactions, we first consider 10cm-size particles. We then compare these results to a simulation with 1 km-size particles, which explores the low-drag regime. We show that (1) disk instability planets have the potential to form large cores due to aerodynamic capturing of rock-size solids in spiral arms before fragmentation; (2) that temporary clumps can concentrate tens of $M_{\oplus}$ of solids in very localized regions before clump disruption; (3) that the formation of permanent clumps, even in the outer disk, is dependent on the grain-size distribution, i.e., the opacity; (4) that nonaxisymmetric structure in the disk can create disk regions that have a solids-to-gas ratio greater than unity; (5) that the solid distribution may affect the fragmentation process; (6) that proto-gas giants and proto-brown dwarfs can start as differentiated objects prior to the H$_2$ collapse phase; (7) that spiral arms in a gravitationally unstable disk are able to stop the inward drift of rock-size solids, even redistributing them to larger radii; and, (8) that large solids can form spiral arms that are offset from the gaseous spiral arms. We conclude that planet embryo formation can be strongly affected by the growth of solids during the earliest stages of disk accretion.

Jenkins|Felipe Rojas|Paula Jofré|Thomas Mädler|Markus Rabus|Julio Chanamé|Blake Pantoja|Maritza G. Soto|Katie M. Morzinski|Jared R. Males|Kimberly Ward-Duong|Laird M. Close	  We report the discovery of BD+20594b, a high density sub-Neptune exoplanet, made using photometry from Campaign 4 of the two-wheeled Kepler (K2) mission, ground-based radial velocity follow-up from HARPS and high resolution lucky and adaptive optics imaging obtained using AstraLux and MagAO, respectively. The host star is a bright ($V=11.04$, $K_s = 9.37$), slightly metal poor ([Fe/H]$=-0.15\pm 0.05$ dex) solar analogue located at $152.1^{+9.7}_{-7.4}$ pc from Earth, for which we find a radius of $R_*=0.928^{+0.055}_{-0.040}R_\odot$ and a mass of $M_* = 0.961^{+0.032}_{-0.029}M_\odot$. A joint analysis of the K2 photometry and HARPS radial velocities reveal that the planet is in a $\approx 42$ day orbit around its host star, has a radius of $2.23^{+0.14}_{-0.11}R_\oplus$, and a mass of $16.3^{+6.0}_{-6.1}M_\oplus$. Although the data at hand puts the planet in the region of the mass-radius diagram where we could expect planets with a pure rock (i.e. magnesium silicate) composition using two-layer models (i.e., between rock/iron and rock/ice compositions), we discuss more realistic three-layer composition models which can explain the high density of the discovered exoplanet. The fact that the planet lies in the boundary between "possibly rocky" and "non-rocky" exoplanets, makes it an interesting planet for future RV follow-up.

Redmer	  The strikingly low luminosity of Uranus (Teff ~ Teq) constitutes a long-standing challenge to our understanding of Ice Giant planets. Here we present the first Uranus structure and evolution models that are constructed to agree with both the observed low luminosity and the gravity field data. Our models make use of modern ab initio equations of state at high pressures for the icy components water, methane, and ammonia. Proceeding step by step, we confirm that adiabatic models yield cooling times that are too long, even when uncertainties in the ice:rock ratio (I:R) are taken into account. We then argue that the transition between the ice/rock-rich interior and the H/He-rich outer envelope should be stably stratified. Therefore, we introduce a simple thermal boundary and adjust it to reproduce the low luminosity. Due to this thermal boundary, the deep interior of the Uranus models are up to 2--3 warmer than adiabatic models, necessitating the presence of rocks in the deep interior with a possible I:R of $1\times$ solar. Finally, we allow for an equilibrium evolution (Teff ~ Teq) that begun prior to the present day, which would therefore no longer require the current era to be a "special time" in Uranus' evolution. In this scenario, the thermal boundary leads to more rapid cooling of the outer envelope. When Teff ~ Teq is reached, a shallow, subadiabatic zone in the atmosphere begins to develop. Its depth is adjusted to meet the luminosity constraint. This work provides a simple foundation for future Ice Giant structure and evolution models, that can be improved by properly treating the heat and particle fluxes in the diffusive zones.

Kiss	  With seven planets, the TRAPPIST-1 system has the largest number of exoplanets discovered in a single system so far. The system is of astrobiological interest, because three of its planets orbit in the habitable zone of the ultracool M dwarf. Assuming the planets are composed of non-compressible iron, rock, and H$_2$O, we determine possible interior structures for each planet. To determine how much tidal heat may be dissipated within each planet, we construct a tidal heat generation model using a single uniform viscosity and rigidity for each planet based on the planet's composition. With the exception of TRAPPIST-1c, all seven of the planets have densities low enough to indicate the presence of significant H$_2$O in some form. Planets b and c experience enough heating from planetary tides to maintain magma oceans in their rock mantles; planet c may have eruptions of silicate magma on its surface, which may be detectable with next-generation instrumentation. Tidal heat fluxes on planets d, e, and f are lower, but are still twenty times higher than Earth's mean heat flow. Planets d and e are the most likely to be habitable. Planet d avoids the runaway greenhouse state if its albedo is $\gtrsim$ 0.3. Determining the planet's masses within $\sim0.1$ to 0.5 Earth masses would confirm or rule out the presence of H$_2$O and/or iron in each planet, and permit detailed models of heat production and transport in each planet. Understanding the geodynamics of ice-rich planets f, g, and h requires more sophisticated modeling that can self-consistently balance heat production and transport in both rock and ice layers.

Ronga|for the MACRO Collaboration	  We look for space-time correlations between 2233 gamma-bursts in the Batse Catalogs and 894 upward-going muons produced by neutrino interactions in the rock below or inside MACRO. Considering a search cone of 10 degrees around GRB directions and a time window of 200 s we find 0 events to be compared to 0.035 expected background events due to atmospheric neutrinos. The corresponding upper limit (90% c.l.) is 0.87 * 10^-9 cm^-2 upward-going muons per average burst.

Weimann	  The strong piezoelectric fields accompanying a surface acoustic wave on a semiconductor quantum well structure are employed to dissociate optically generated excitons and efficiently trap the created electron hole pairs in the moving lateral potential superlattice of the sound wave. The resulting spatial separation of the photogenerated ambipolar charges leads to an increase of the radiative lifetime by orders of magnitude as compared to the unperturbed excitons. External and deliberate screening of the lateral piezoelectric fields triggers radiative recombination after very long storage times at a remote location on the sample.

Sole	  The analysis of some species-rich, well-defined food webs shows that they display the so called Small World behavior shared by a number of disparate complex systems. The three systems analysed (Ythan estuary web, Silwood web and the Little Rock lake web) have different levels of taxonomic resolution, but all of them involve high clustering and short path lengths between species. Additionally, the distribution of connections with fat-tail power law behavior. These features suggest that communities might be self-organized in such a way that high homeostasis to perturbations (with short transient times to recovery) would be at work. The consequences for ecological theory are outlined.

Neda	  A fascinating class of patterns, often encountered in nature as meandering cracks on rocks, dried-out fields and tectonic plates is produced by the fracture of solids. Here we report the observation and modeling of an unusual type of patterns consisting of spiral cracks within fragments of a thin layer of drying precipitate. We find that this symmetry-breaking cracking mode arises naturally not from twisting forces, but from a propagating stress front induced by the fold-up of the fragments.

Molenkamp	  We perform high resolution X-ray diffraction on GaMnAs mixed crystals as well as on GaMnAs/GaAs and GaAs/MnAs superlattices for samples grown by low temperature molecular beam epitaxy under different growth conditions. Although all samples are of high crystalline quality and show narrow rocking curve widths and pronounced finite thickness fringes, the lattice constant variation with increasing manganese concentration depends strongly on the growth conditions: For samples grown at substrate temperatures of 220 and 270 degrees C the extrapolated relaxed lattice constant of Zincblende MnAs is 0.590 nm and 0.598 nm respectively. This is in contrast to low temperature GaAs, for which the lattice constant decreases with increasing substrate temperature.

Tarafdar	  The restructuring process of diagenesis in the sedimentary rocks is studied using a percolation type model. The cementation and dissolution processes are modeled by the culling of occupied sites in rarefied and growth of vacant sites in dense environments. Starting from sub-critical states of ordinary percolation the system evolves under the diagenetic rules to critical percolation configurations. Our numerical simulation results in two dimensions indicate that the stable configuration has the same critical behaviour as the ordinary percolation.

Yaroslav Tserkovnyak|David Linton Johnson	  The theory of the acoustics of patchy-saturation in porous media is used to analyze experimental data on wave velocity and attenuation in partially water saturated limestones. It is demonstrated that the theory can be used to deduce the value of V/A, the ratio of the volume to area of the water patch, and l_f, the Poisson size of the water patch. One can ``hear'' the shape of a patch if the properties of the rock and the measurement frequencies are such as to satisfy the specific requirements for the validity of the theory.

Charalambous|E. M. Forgan|G. Lazard|P. Mathieu|A. Brulet	  We report Small-Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS) measurements on the vortex lattice in a PbIn polycrystal in the presence of an applied current. Using the rocking curves as a probe of the distribution of current in the sample, we observe that vortex pinning is due to the surface roughness. This leads to a surface current that persists in the flux flow region. We show the influence of surface treatments on the distribution of this current.

Gratier	  We study the roughness of stylolite surfaces (i.e. natural pressure-dissolution surfaces in sedimentary rocks) from profiler measurements at laboratory scales. The roughness is shown to be nicely described by a self-affine scaling invariance. At large scales, the roughness exponent is $\zeta_1 \approx 0.5$ and very different from that at small scales where $\zeta_2 \approx 1.1$. A cross-over length scale at around $\lambda_c =1$mm is well characterized and interpreted as a possible fossil stress measurement if related to the Asaro-Tiller-Grinfeld stress-induced instability. Measurements are consistent with a Langevin equation that describes the growth of stylolite surfaces in a quenched disordered material with long range elastic correlations.

Halsey	  We study the shape and growth rate of necks between sintered spheres with dissolution-precipitation dynamics in the reaction-limited regime. We determine the critical shape that separates those initial neck shapes that can sinter from those that necessarily dissolve, as well as the asymptotic evolving shape of sinters far from the critical shape. We compare our results with past results for the asymptotic neck shape in closely related but more complicated models of surface dynamics; in particular we confirm a scaling conjecture, originally due to Kuczinsky. Finally, we consider the relevance of this problem to the diagenesis of sedimentary rocks and other applications.

Johnson	  The transition from linear to nonlinear dynamical elasticity in rocks is of considerable interest in seismic wave propagation as well as in understanding the basic dynamical processes in consolidated granular materials. We have carried out a careful experimental investigation of this transition for Berea and Fontainebleau sandstones. Below a well-characterized strain, the materials behave linearly, transitioning beyond that point to a nonlinear behavior which can be accurately captured by a simple macroscopic dynamical model. At even higher strains, effects due to a driven nonequilibrium state, and relaxation from it, complicate the characterization of the nonlinear behavior.

Fraundorf	  This paper explores tools for modeling and measuring the compositional heterogeneity of a rock, or other solid specimen. Intuitive ``variation per decade'' plots, simple expressions for containment probability, generalization for familiar error-in-the-mean expressions, and a useful dimensionless sample bias coefficient all emerge from the analysis. These calculations have also inspired subsequent work on log-log roughness spectroscopy (with applications to scanning probe microscope data), and on angular correlation mapping of lattice fringe images (with applications in high resolution transmission electron microscopy). It was originally published as Appendix E of a dissertation on ``Microcharacterization of interplanetary dust collected in the earth's stratosphere''.

The aim of paper is to present a numerical algorithm based on the Monte Carlo integration and contrainted-least-squares methods to resolve the spectral density function for a given system. The numerical method is verified by comparing the results with those of Maxwell-Garnett effective permittivity expression. Later, it is applied to a well-studied rock-and-brine system to instruct its utility. The presented method yields significant microstructural information in improving our understanding how microstructure influences the macroscopic behaviour of composites without any intricate mathematics.

Ploog	  We analyze the lineshape of x-ray diffraction profiles of GaN epitaxial layers with large densities of randomly distributed threading dislocations. The peaks are Gaussian only in the central, most intense part of the peak, while the tails obey a power law. The $q^{-3}$ decay typical for random dislocations is observed in double-crystal rocking curves. The entire profile is well fitted by a restricted random dislocation distribution. The densities of both edge and screw threading dislocations and the ranges of dislocation correlations are obtained.

Scales|Michael Batzle	  Natural sedimentation processes give rise to fine layers in shales. If these layers alternate between organic-rich and organic-poor sediments, then the contrast in dielectric properties gives rise to an effective birefringence as the presence of hydrocarbons suppresses the dielectric constant of the host rock. We have measured these effects with a quasioptical millimeter wave setup that is rapid and noncontacting. We find that the strength of this birefringence and the overall dielectric permittivity provide two useful diagnostic of the organic content of oil shales.

Broussard	  The electrical resistivity of La$_{1-x}$Ca$_{x}$MnO$_{3}$ thin films grown on (001) NdGaO$_{3}$ and (100) SrTiO$_{3}$ substrates by off-axis sputtering has been studied as a function of the Calcium doping level. The samples have very narrow rocking curves and excellent in plane registry with the substrate. A strong correlation between the peak resistance temperature and the polaronic hopping energy is seen which is not simply linear. The low temperature resistivity is seen to be fit better by a model of single magnon scattering, and a near linear correlation between the resistivity due to magnon scattering and static impurities is observed.

It is demonstrated that each equilibrium configuration is stable with respect to a special class of variations introduced by Gibbs. This basic result is compared with the opposite result on the universal morphological instability of phase interface separating a stressed crystal with its melt. Some plausible manifestations of the instabilities implied by the Gibbs model are qualitatively discussed.

Our quasiparticle gaps support recent experimental observations that ScN has a much lower indirect band gap than previously thought. The results are analyzed in terms of the influence of different approximations for exchange and correlation taken in the computational approach on the electronic structure of ScN.

Lischka	  Cubic InN films were grown on top of a c-GaN buffer layer by rf-plasma assisted MBE at different growth temperatures. X-Ray diffraction investigations show that the c-InN layers consist of a nearly phase-pure zinc blende (cubic) structure with a small fraction of the wurtzite (hexagonal) phase grown on the (111) facets of the cubic layer. The content of hexagonal inclusions is decreasing with decreasing growth temperature. The full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of c-InN (002) rocking curve is about 50 arcmin. Low temperature photoluminescence measurements reveal a band gap of about 0.61eV for cubic InN.

Values of R=sigma_L/sigma_T were extracted in this kinematic range by comparing these data to cross sections measured at a higher beam energy by the NMC collaboration.

Exploiting the dependence of magnitude of the matter effect on oscillation channel, and using a set of 809 upward-going muons observed in MACRO, we show that the two flavor neutrino-mu ==> neutrino-sterile oscillation is disfavored with 99% C.L. with respect to neutrino-mu ==> neutrino-tau.

Vasantha Kandasamy|Florentin Smarandache	  The introduction of Fuzzy Relational Equations (FREs) has made problems that were unsolvable using algebraic linear equations into solvable ones. FREs have been applied to problemsin medicine, industry, transportation and all types of social problems where the data is an unsupervised one. Yet, FREs lack the capacity to tackle problems where an element of indeterminacy is involved. This book develops the new concept of Neutrosophic Relational Equations (NREs) that have the capacity to analyze problems with indeterminacy. Here, earlier models on FREs are analyzed and new NRE models, with practical applications, are presented.

We describe a method for measuring the complex impedance of these devices. In previous work, stray impedances and readout electronics of the measurement apparatus have resulted in artifacts in the impedance data. The new technique allows experimenters to find an independent Thevenin or Norton equivalent circuit for each frequency. This method allows experimenters to easily isolate the device impedance from the effects of parasitic impedances and frequency dependent gains in amplifiers.

The waiting-time distribution follows that observed for fracture in rock and for earthquakes.

The estimates on error in approximation of the data generating function by CHFIS are found when there is a perturbation in independent, dependent and hidden variables. It is proved that any small perturbation in any of the variables of generalized interpolation data results in only small perturbation of CHFIS.

Freeland	  Through the utilization of element-resolved polarized x-ray probes, the electronic and magnetic state of an artificial La2FeCrO6 double perovskite were explored. Applying unit-cell level control of thin film growth on SrTiO3 (111), the rock salt double perovskite structure can be created for this system, which does not have an ordered perovskite phase in the bulk. We find that the Fe and Cr are in the proper 3+ valence state, but, contrary to previous studies, the element-resolved magnetic studies find the moments in field are small and show no evidence of a sizable magnetic moment in the remanent state. 	
1103.0737v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1103.0737v1	2011	Potentially Significant Source of Error in Magnetic Paleolatitude   Determinations	J. Marvin Herndon	  The discovery of close-to-star gas-giant exo-planets lends support to the idea of Earth's origin as a Jupiter-like gas giant and to the consequences of its compression, including whole-Earth decompression dynamics that gives rise, without requiring mantle convection, to the myriad measurements and observations whose descriptions are attributed to plate tectonics. I show here that paleolatitude determinations, used extensively in Pangaea-like reconstructions and in paleoclimate considerations, may be subject to potentially significant errors if rock-magnetization was acquired at Earth-radii less than present.

An upper bound has been set on the velocity of the OPERA neutrinos by using the deformed dispersion relation suggested by the result of the experiment OPERA itself.

Myers	  Periodic structures of GdN particles encapsulated in a single crystalline GaN matrix were prepared by plasma assisted molecular beam epitaxy. High resolution X-ray diffractometery shows that GdN islands, with rock salt structure are epitaxially oriented to the wurtzite GaN matrix. Scanning transmission electron microscopy combined with in-situ reflection high energy electron diffraction allows for the study of island formation dynamics, which occurs after 1.2 monolayers of GdN coverage. Magnetometry reveals two ferromagnetic phases, one due to GdN particles with Curie temperature of 70K and a second, anomalous room temperature phase. 	
1207.0037v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.0037v1	2012	The Uniform Distribution in Incentive Dynamics	Dashiell E. A. Fryer	  The uniform distribution is an important counterexample in game theory as many of the canonical game dynamics have been shown not to converge to the equilibrium in certain cases. In particular none of the canonical game dynamics converge to the uniform distribution in a form of rock-paper-scissors where the amount an agent can lose is more than the agent can win, despite this fact, it is the unique Nash equilibrium. I will show that certain incentive dynamics are asymptotically stable at the uniform distribution when it is an incentive equilibrium.

Blatt	  A scheme for entangling distant atoms is realized, as proposed in the seminal paper by Cabrillo et al. [Phys. Rev. A 59, 1025 (1999)]. The protocol is based on quantum interference and detection of a single photon scattered from two effectively one meter distant laser-cooled and trapped atomic ions. The detection of a single photon heralds entanglement of two internal states of the trapped ions with high rate and with a fidelity limited mostly by atomic motion. Control of the entangled state phase is demonstrated by changing the path length of the single-photon interferometer.

Blatt	  Faraday rotation of a laser field induced by a single atom is demonstrated by tightly focussing a linearly polarized laser beam onto a laser-cooled ion held in a harmonic Paul trap. The polarization rotation signal is further used to measure the phase-shift associated with electromagnetically-induced-transparency and to demonstrate read-out of the internal state on the qubit transition with a detection fidelity of 98 $\pm$ 1%. These results have direct implications for single atom magnetometery and dispersive read-out of atomic superpositions.

Klain	  Behavior of the geomagnetic field intensity in the Paleogene from sedimentary rocks of the Russian Plate was investigated. It is revealed that in the beginning of the Paleogene alternating of paleointensity variations of little amplitude (about 0.5 Ho, where Ho is the value of modern geomagnetic field taken as 40 mkT) and bursts of large amplitude (up to 5 Ho) took place. At the end of the Paleogene paleointensity variations occur only with a little amplitude.

Phys. {\bf 42}, 335 (2004)] generalized the Marinatto-Weber quantum scheme for $2 \times 2$ games in order to study bimatrix games of $3 \times 3$ dimension, in particular the Rock-Paper-Scissors game. In our paper we show that Iqbal and Toor's generalization exhibits certain undesirable property that can considerably influence the game result. To support our argumentation, in the further part of the paper we construct the protocol corresponding to the MW concept for any finite bimatrix game that is free from the fault.

It will be built in the Agua Negra tunnel planned between Argentina and Chile, and operated by the CLES, a Latin American consortium. With 1750m of rock overburden, and no close- by nuclear power plant, it will provide an extremely radiation quiet environment for neutrino and dark matter experiments. In particular, its location in the southern hemisphere should play a major role in understanding dark matter modulation signals.

After correct two mathematical mistakes in their cycles tripwire algorithm, we research the cycles by scanning the tripwire in the full strategy space of the games and we find significant cycles missed by the authors. So we suggest that, all of the treatments (using simultaneous matching in discrete time) exhibit significant cycles.

In this study, we investigate the characteristics of all 32 possible strategies with a single-step memory by observing the results when each strategy encounters another one. Based on these results, we define similarity measures between the 32 strategies and perform a network analysis of the relationship between the strategies by constructing a strategies network. Interestingly, we find that a win-lose circulation, like rock-paper-scissors, exists between strategies and that the circulation results from one unusual strategy.

Halpern|Rafael Pass	  We develop a general game-theoretic framework for reasoning about strategic agents performing possibly costly computation. In this framework, many traditional game-theoretic results (such as the existence of a Nash equilibrium) no longer hold. Nevertheless, we can use the framework to provide psychologically appealing explanations of observed behavior in well-studied games (such as finitely repeated prisoner's dilemma and rock-paper-scissors). Furthermore, we provide natural conditions on games sufficient to guarantee that equilibria exist.

Also heat generation/consumption/transfer is considered. Damage is modelled as rate-independent. The applications include metal-hydrogen systems with metal/hydride phase transformation, poroelastic rocks, structural and ferro/para-magnetic phase transformation, water and heat transport in concrete, and, if diffusion is neglected, plasticity with damage and viscoelasticity, etc. For the ensuing system of partial differential equations and inclusions, we prove existence of solutions by a carefully devised semi-implicit approximation scheme of the fractional-step type.

We provide a simple individual based stochastic model of clonal interference taking into account a wide variety of competitive interactions which can be found in nature. In particular, we relax the classical assumption of transitivity between the different mutations. It allows us to predict genetic patterns, such as coexistence of several mutants or emergence of Rock-Paper-Scissors cycles, which were not explained by existing models. In addition, we call into questions some classical preconceived ideas about fixation time and fixation probability of competing mutations.

This is a layered compound consisting of alternate stacking structure of rock-salt-type BiS2 superconducting layer and fluorite-type Bi(O,F) blocking layer. Bi2(O,F)S2 was obtained as the main phase by topotactic fluorination of undoped Bi2OS2 using XeF2, which is the first topotactic synthesis of an electron-doped superconductor via reductive fluorination.

In this paper, I collect accounts of the Aurora Australis from the literature regarding Aboriginal culture. Using previous studies of meteors, eclipses, and comets in Aboriginal traditions, I anticipate that the physical properties of aurora, such as their generally red colour as seen from southern Australia, will be associated with fire, death, blood, and evil spirits. The survey reveals this to be the case and also explores historical auroral events in Aboriginal cultures, aurorae in rock art, and briefly compares Aboriginal auroral traditions with other global indigenous groups, including the Maori of New Zealand.

A simple macroscopic non-equilibrium thermodynamic model with a single internal variable reproduces instantaneous jump and relaxation. Velocity weakening appears as a consequence of a plasticity related nonlinear coefficient. Permanent part of displacement corresponds to plastic strain, and relaxation effects are analogous to creep in thermodynamic rheology.

Ford	  We present a solution to the long outstanding meter barrier problem in planet formation theory. As solids spiral inward due to aerodynamic drag, they will enter disk regions that are characterized by high temperatures, densities, and pressures. High partial pressures of rock vapor can suppress solid evaporation, and promote collisions between partially molten solids, allowing rapid growth. This process should be ubiquitous in planet-forming disks, which may be evidenced by the abundant class of Systems with Tightly-packed Inner Planets (STIPs) discovered by the NASA Kepler mission.

Next, we prove that complex hyperplanes are diffeomorphic to their degeneration called phase tropical hyperplanes. More generally, using Mikhalkin's decomposition into pairs-of-pants of smooth algebraic hypersurfaces, we show that phase tropical hypersurfaces with smooth tropicalization, possess naturally a smooth differentiable structure. Moreover, we prove that phase tropical hypersurfaces possess a natural symplectic structure.

Skordas	  Ab initio detailed calculations of the elastic properties of AgCl_{x}Br_{1-x} alloys recently appeared using density-functional perturbation theory and employing the virtual crystal approximation or by means of the full potential linearized augmented plane wave method. Here, we suggest a simple theoretical model that enables the estimation of the isothermal compressibility of these alloys in terms of the elastic data of end members alone. The calculated values are in satisfactory agreement with the experimental ones. The present model makes use of an early suggestion that interconnects the Gibbs energy for the formation and/or migration of defects in solids with bulk properties.

Monte-Carlo simulation reveals that a difference in the given elastic constants of the diagonal springs, each of which connects the same cations or anions, is responsible for the linear flexoelectric effect in the model. We show the quadratic flexoelectric effect is present only in non-centrosymmetric systems and it can overwhelm the linear effect in feasibly large strain gradients.

In particular, we prove Born's conjecture about the optimality of the rock-salt alternate distribution of charges on a cubic lattice (and more generally on a d-dimensional orthorhombic lattice). Furthermore, we study this problem on the two-dimensional triangular lattice and we prove the optimality of a two-component honeycomb distribution of charges. The results holds for a class of completely monotone interaction potentials which includes Coulomb type interactions. In a more general setting, we derive a connection between the optimal charge problem and a minimization problem for the translated lattice theta function.

Wright|Gregory W. Henry|Greg Laughlin|Jack Lissauer	  We report precise Doppler measurements of GJ 436 (M2.5V) obtained at Keck Observatory. The velocities reveal a planetary companion with orbital period of 2.644 d, eccentricity of 0.12 (consistent with zero) and velocity semi-amplitude of $K =18.1$ \ms. The minimum mass (\msini) for the planet is 0.067 \mjup = 1.2 M$_{\rm NEP}$ = 21 M$_{\rm EARTH}$, making it the lowest mass exoplanet yet found around a main sequence star and the first candidate in the Neptune mass domain. GJ 436 (Mass = 0.41 \msune) is only the second M dwarf found to harbor a planet, joining the two--planet system around GJ 876. The low mass of the planet raises questions about its constitution, with possible compositions of primarily H and He gas, ice/rock, or rock--dominated. The implied semi--major axis is $a$ = 0.028 AU = 14 stellar radii, raising issues of planet formation, migration, and tidal coupling with the star. GJ 436 is $>3$ Gyr old, based on both kinematic and chromospheric diagnostics. The star exhibits no photometric variability on the 2.644-day Doppler period to a limiting amplitude of 0.0004 mag, supporting the planetary interpretation of the Doppler periodicity. Photometric transits of the planet across the star are ruled out for gas giant compositions and are also unlikely for solid compositions. As the third closest known planetary system, GJ 436 warrants follow--up observations by high resolution optical and IR 	
0410009v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0410009v1	2004	Mercury's Protoplanetary Mass	J. Marvin Herndon	  Major element fractionation among chondrites has been discussed for decades as ratios relative to Si or Mg. Recently, by expressing ratios relative to Fe, I discovered a new relationship admitting the possibility that ordinary chondrite meteorites are derived from two components, a relatively oxidized and undifferentiated, primitive component and a somewhat differentiated, planetary component, with oxidation state like the highly reduced enstatite chondrites, which I suggested was identical to Mercury's complement of lost elements. Here, on the basis of that relationship, I derive expressions, as a function of the mass of planet Mercury and the mass of its core, to estimate the mass of Mercury's lost elements, the mass of Mercury's alloy and rock protoplanetary core, and the mass of Mercury's gaseous protoplanet. Although Mercury's mass is well known, its core mass is not, being widely believed to be in the range of 70-80 percent of the planet mass. For a core mass of 75 percent, the mass of Mercury's lost elements is about 1.32 times the mass of Mercury, the mass of the alloy and rock protoplanetary core is about 2.32 times the mass of Mercury, and the mass of the gaseous protoplanet of Mercury is about 700 times the mass of Mercury. Circumstantial evidence is presented in support of the supposition that Mercury's lost elements is identical to the planetary component of ordinary chondrite formation.

(2005b) and derived from Alibert et al. (2004,2005a). This model takes into account the vertical structure of the subnebula, as well as the evolution of the surface density as given by an $\alpha$-disk model and is used to calculate the thermodynamical conditions in the subdisk, for different values of the viscosity parameter. We show that the Jovian subnebula evolves in two different phases during its lifetime. In the first phase, the subnebula is fed through its outer edge by the solar nebula as long as it has not been dissipated. In the second phase, the solar nebula has disappeared and the Jovian subdisk expands and gradually clears with time as Jupiter accretes the remaining material. We also demonstrate that early generations of satellites formed during the beginning of the first phase of the subnebula cannot survive in this environment and fall onto the proto-Jupiter. As a result, these bodies may contribute to the enrichment of Jupiter in heavy elements. Moreover, migration calculations in the Jovian subnebula allow us to follow the evolution of the ices/rocks ratios in the proto-satellites as a function of their migration pathways. By a tempting to reproduce the distance distribution of the Galilean satellites, as well as their ices/rocks ratios, we obtain some constraints on the viscosity parameter of the Jovian subnebula.

In neutrino interactions at these energies, the secondary electromagnetic cascade produces a coherent radio pulse well above ambient thermal noise via the Askaryan effect. We describe measurements of radio-frequency attenuation lengths and ambient thermal noise in two salt formations. Measurements in the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), located in an evaporite salt bed in Carlsbad, NM yielded short attenuation lengths, 3-7 m over 150-300 MHz. However, measurements at United Salt's Hockley mine, located in a salt dome near Houston, Texas yielded attenuation lengths in excess of 250 m at similar frequencies. We have also analyzed early ground-penetrating radar data at Hockley mine and have found additional evidence for attenuation lengths in excess of several hundred meters at 440 MHz. We conclude that salt domes, which may individually contain several hundred cubic kilometer water-equivalent mass, provide attractive sites for next-generation high-energy neutrino detectors.

Zichichi	  The importance of an adequate CNGS beam monitor at the Gran Sasso Laboratory has been stressed in many papers. Since the number of internal $\nu_\mu$ CC and NC interactions in the various detectors will not allow to collect statistics rapidly, one should also be able to detect the $\nu_\mu$ CC interactions in the upstream rock. In this study we have investigated the performances of the LVD detector as a monitor for the CNGS neutrino beam. Thanks to its wide area ($13 \times 11 m^2$ orthogonal to the beam direction) LVD can detect about 120 muons per day originated by $\nu_\mu$ CC interactions in the rock. The LVD total mass is $\sim2 kt$. This allows to get 30 more CNGS events per day as internal $(NC + CC)$ $\nu_\mu$ interactions, for a total of $\sim 150$ events per day. A 3% statistical error can be reached in 7 days. Taking into account the time characteristics of the CNGS beam, the cosmic muon background can be reduced to a negligible level, of the order of 1.5 events per day.

Rock	  For a Borel measure on the unit interval and a sequence of scales that tend to zero, we define a one-parameter family of zeta functions called multifractal zeta functions. These functions are a first attempt to associate a zeta function to certain multifractal measures. However, we primarily show that they associate a new zeta function, the topological zeta function, to a fractal string in order to take into account the topology of its fractal boundary. This expands upon the geometric information garnered by the traditional geometric zeta function of a fractal string in the theory of complex dimensions. In particular, one can distinguish between a fractal string whose boundary is the classical Cantor set, and one whose boundary has a single limit point but has the same sequence of lengths as the complement of the Cantor set. Later work will address related, but somewhat different, approaches to multifractals themselves, via zeta functions, partly motivated by the present paper.

Alonso	  The structural and bonding properties of small neutral alkali-halide clusters (AX)n, with n less than or equal to 10, A=Li, Na, K, Rb and X=F, Cl, Br, I, are studied using the ab initio Perturbed Ion (aiPI) model and a restricted structural relaxation criterion. A trend of competition between rock-salt and hexagonal ring-like isomers is found and discussed in terms of the relative ionic sizes. The main conclusion is that an approximate value of r_C/r_A=0.5 (where r_C and r_A are the cationic and anionic radii) separates the hexagonal from the rock-salt structures. The classical electrostatic part of the total energy at the equilibrium geometry is enough to explain these trends. The magic numbers in the size range studied are n= 4, 6 and 9, and these are universal since they occur for all alkali-halides and do not depend on the specific ground state geometry. Instead those numbers allow for the formation of compact clusters. Full geometrical relaxations are considered for (LiF)n (n=3-7) and (AX)_3 clusters, and the effect of Coulomb correlation is studied in a few selected cases. These two effects preserve the general conclusions achieved thus far.

The 1D signals obtained were statistically analyzed to determine the scaling behavior and calculate a roughness exponent, also called Hurst exponent. Statistical methods based on the characterization of a single Hurst exponent imply strong assumptions on the mathematical characteristics of the signal: the derivative of the signal (or local increments) should be stationary and have finite variance. The analysis of the measured stylolites show that these properties are not always verified simultaneously. The stylolite profiles show persistence and jumps and several stylolites are not regular, with alternating regular and irregular portions. A new statistical method is proposed here, based on a non-stationary but Gaussian model, to estimate the roughness of the profiles and quantify the heterogeneity of stylolites. This statistical method is based on two parameters: the local roughness (H) which describes the local amplitude of the stylolite, and the amount of irregularities on the signal (\mu), which can be linked to the heterogeneities initially present in the rock before the stylolite formed. Using this technique, a classification of the stylolites in two families is proposed: those for which the morphology is homogeneous everywhere and those with alternating regular and irregular portions.

Weinstein|Philip Rosenau	  In this article we discuss a new Hamiltonian PDE arising from a class of equations appearing in the study of magma, partially molten rock, in the Earth's interior. Under physically justifiable simplifications, a scalar, nonlinear, degenerate, dispersive wave equation may be derived to describe the evolution of $\phi$, the fraction of molten rock by volume, in the Earth. These equations have two power nonlinearities which specify the constitutive realitions for bulk viscosity and permeability in terms of $\phi$. Previously, they have been shown to admit solitary wave solutions. For a particular relation between exponents, we observe the equation to be Hamiltonian; it can be viewed as a generalization of the Benjamin-Bona-Mahoney equation.   We prove that the solitary waves are nonlinearly stable, by showing that they are constrained local minimizers of an appropriate time-invariant Lyapunov functional. A consequence is an extension of the regime of global in time well-posedness for this class of equations to (large) data, which include a neighborhood of a solitary wave. Finally, we observe that these equations have {\it compactons}, solitary traveling waves with compact spatial support at each time.

In this manner, based on some hidden metric spaces (similarity measurements) between apertures profiles, we make evolutionary network in two directions (in parallel and perpendicular to the shear direction) and on the measured apertures profiles. Evaluation of the emerged network shows the connectivity degree (distribution) of network, after a transition step; fall in to the stable states which are coincided with the Gaussian distribution. Based on this event and real observations of the complex network changes, a simple model has been proposed in which evolving (decaying) of network is accomplished using a preferential detachment of edges. This suggests that destroying of surfaces is accomplished in a manner that is followed as a combination of random and preferential selection of each element. Also, evolving of cluster coefficients and number of edges displays similar patterns as well as are appeared in shear stress, hydraulic conductivity and dilation changes, which can be engaged to estimate shear strength distribution of asperities. Distinguishing of the contact profiles (or their equivalent : percolating clusters) and their changes, despite the former case, disclosed new side of a network, namely growing networks, which shed light the details of changes within intra-topology of profiles.

0905.2597v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/0905.2597v1	2009	The role of magnetic fields for planetary formation	Anders Johansen	  The role of magnetic fields for the formation of planets is reviewed. Protoplanetary disc turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability has a huge influence on the early stages of planet formation. Small dust grains are transported both vertically and radially in the disc by turbulent diffusion, counteracting sedimentation to the mid-plane and transporting crystalline material from the hot inner disc to the outer parts. The conclusion from recent efforts to measure the turbulent diffusion coefficient of magnetorotational turbulence is that turbulent diffusion of small particles is much stronger than naively thought. Larger particles -- pebbles, rocks and boulders -- get trapped in long-lived high pressure regions that arise spontaneously at large scales in the turbulent flow. These gas high pressures, in geostrophic balance with a sub-Keplerian/super-Keplerian zonal flow envelope, are excited by radial fluctuations in the Maxwell stress. The coherence time of the Maxwell stress is only a few orbits, where as the correlation time of the pressure bumps is comparable to the turbulent mixing time-scale, many tens or orbits on scales much greater than one scale height. The particle overdensities contract under the combined gravity of all the particles and condense into gravitationally bound clusters of rocks and boulders. These planetesimals have masses comparable to the dwarf planet Ceres. I conclude with thoughts on future priorities in the field of planet formation in turbulent discs.

One of the critical assumptions often made is that the diffusion of fluid molecules is sufficiently fast to warrant the condition for direct mapping between the surface-enhanced relaxation rate and the pore geometry. In pores satisfying such a condition, but having a significant spatial variation of surface relaxivity (rho), one can show that the one-to-one mapping may break down. The degree to which the NMR logging interpretation is affected has not been systematically studied until now. In this work, we theoretically investigate the interplay between the pore geometry, internal field and the inhomogeneous surface relaxivity. We develop a perturbative framework and compare its results with exact solutions obtained for a class of rho textures in a pore with simple geometry. Its effect is quantified for a wide range of diffusivity and/or rho strength. The result allows us to set the bounds for the change in the final slope of the relaxation curve and may serve as a useful guide for logging applications in real rocks with a wide range of pore sizes and fluid diffusivity. We further employ large scale numerical simulations to perform virtual experiments on more complex situations. Internal field and its gradient distributions were obtained and analyzed for up to 1.5^3 cm^3 based on tomograms of carbonate rocks. We find that the texture of rho based on the internal field gradient induces a small, but observable shift, compared to a random noise generated texture for which no shift is observed.

Mean   field approximation and rock-paper-scissors dynamics	Ihor Lubashevsky|Shigeru Kanemoto	  A continuous time model for multiagent systems governed by reinforcement learning with scale-free memory is developed. The agents are assumed to act independently of one another in optimizing their choice of possible actions via trial-and-error search. To gain awareness about the action value the agents accumulate in their memory the rewards obtained from taking a specific action at each moment of time. The contribution of the rewards in the past to the agent current perception of action value is described by an integral operator with a power-law kernel. Finally a fractional differential equation governing the system dynamics is obtained. The agents are considered to interact with one another implicitly via the reward of one agent depending on the choice of the other agents. The pairwise interaction model is adopted to describe this effect. As a specific example of systems with non-transitive interactions, a two agent and three agent systems of the rock-paper-scissors type are analyzed in detail, including the stability analysis and numerical simulation. Scale-free memory is demonstrated to cause complex dynamics of the systems at hand. In particular, it is shown that there can be simultaneously two modes of the system instability undergoing subcritical and supercritical bifurcation, with the latter one exhibiting anomalous oscillations with the amplitude and period growing with time. Besides, the instability onset via this supercritical mode may be regarded as "altruism self-organization". For the three agent system the instability dynamics is found to be rather irregular and can be composed of alternate fragments of oscillations different in their properties.

Errandonea|A. Segura|D. Martinez-Garcia|V. Munoz	  We carried out high-pressure resistivity and Hall-effect measurements in single crystals of CdTe and ZnTe up to 12 GPa. Slight changes of transport parameters in the zincblende phase of CdTe are consitent with the shallow character of donor impurities. Drastic changes in all the transport parameters of CdTe were found around 4 GPa, i.e. close to the onset of the cinnabar to rock-salt transition. In particular, the carrier concentration increases by more than five orders of magnitude. Additionally, an abrupt decrease of the resistivity was detected around 10 GPa. These results are discussed in comparison with optical, thermoelectric, and x-ray diffraction experiments. The metallic character of the Cmcm phase of CdTe is confirmed and a semi-metallic character is determined for the rock-salt phase. In zincblende ZnTe, the increase of the hole concentration by more than two orders of magnitude is proposed to be due to a deep-to-shallow transformation of the acceptor levels. Between 9 and 11 GPa, transport parameters are consistent with the semiconducting character of cinnabar ZnTe. A two orders of magnitude decrease of the resistivity and a carrier-type inversion occurs at 11 GPa, in agreement with the onset of the transition to the Cmcm phase of ZnTe. A metallic character for this phase is deduced.

Nitish Reddy|Thilo Gross	  The Rock-Paper-Scissors(RPS) game is a paradigmatic model for cyclic dominance in biological systems. Here we consider this game in the social context of competition between opinions in a networked society. In our model, every agent has an opinion which is drawn from the three choices: rock, paper or scissors. In every timestep a link is selected randomly and the game is played between the nodes connected by the link. The loser either adopts the opinion of the winner or rewires the link. These rules define an adaptive network on which the agent's opinions coevolve with the network topology of social contacts. We show analytically and numerically that nonequilibrium phase transitions occur as a function of the rewiring strength. The transitions separate four distinct phases which differ in the observed dynamics of opinions and topology. In particular, there is one phase where the population settles to an arbitrary consensus opinion. We present a detailed analysis of the corresponding transitions revealing an apparently paradoxial behavior. The system approaches consensus states where they are unstable, whereas other dynamics prevail when the consensus states are stable.

Young	  Complexity of fluid flow in a rough fracture is induced by the complex configurations of opening areas between the fracture planes. In this study, we model fluid flow in an evolvable real rock joint structure, which under certain normal load is sheared. In an experimental study, information regarding about apertures of the rock joint during consecutive 20 mm displacements and fluid flow (permeability) in different pressure heads have been recorded by a scanner laser. Our aim in this study is to simulate the fluid flow in the mentioned complex geometries using the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), while the characteristics of the aperture field will be compared with the modeled fluid flow permeability To characterize the aperture, we use a new concept in the graph theory, namely: complex networks and motif analysis of the corresponding networks. In this approach, the similar aperture profile along the fluid flow direction is mapped in to a network space. The modeled permeability using the LBM shows good correlation with the experimental measured values. Furthermore, the two main characters of the obtained networks, i.e., characteristic length and number of edges show the same evolutionary trend with the modeled permeability values. Analysis of motifs through the obtained networks showed the most transient sub-graphs are much more frequent in residual stages. This coincides with nearly stable fluid flow and high permeability values.

Rock|Darko Žubrinić	  We discuss a number of techniques for determining the Minkowski dimension of bounded subsets of some Euclidean space of any dimension, including: the box-counting dimension and equivalent definitions based on various box-counting functions; the similarity dimension via the Moran equation (at least in the case of self-similar sets); the order of the (box-)counting function; the classic result on compact subsets of the real line due to Besicovitch and Taylor, as adapted to the theory of fractal strings; and the abscissae of convergence of new classes of zeta functions. Specifically, we define box-counting zeta functions of infinite bounded subsets of Euclidean space and discuss results pertaining to distance and tube zeta functions. Appealing to an analysis of these zeta functions allows for the development of theories of complex dimensions for bounded sets in Euclidean space, extending techniques and results regarding (ordinary) fractal strings obtained by the first author and van Frankenhuijsen.

Rudnick|William F. McDonough	  The recent geoneutrino experimental results from KamLAND and Borexino detectors reveal the usefulness of analyzing the Earth geoneutrino flux, as it provides a constraint on the strength of the radiogenic heat power and this, in turn, provides a test of compositional models of the bulk silicate Earth (BSE). This flux is dependent on the amount and distribution of heat producing elements (HPEs: U, Th and K) in the Earth interior. We have developed a geophysically-based, three-dimensional global reference model for the abundances and distributions of HPEs in the BSE. The structure and composition of the outermost portion of the Earth, the crust and underlying lithospheric mantle, is detailed in the reference model, this portion of the Earth has the greatest influence on the geoneutrino fluxes. The reference model combines three existing geophysical models of the global crust and yields an average crustal thickness of 34.4+-4.1 km in the continents and 8.0+-2.7 km in the oceans. In situ seismic velocity provided by CRUST 2.0 allows us to estimate the average composition of the deep continental crust by using new and updated compositional databases for amphibolite and granulite facies rocks in combination with laboratory ultrasonic velocities measurements. An updated xenolithic peridotite database is used to represent the average composition of continental lithospheric mantle. Monte Carlo simulation is used to predict the geoneutrino flux at 16 selected locations and to track the asymmetrical uncertainties of radiogenic heat power due to the log-normal distributions of HPE concentrations in crustal rocks. 	
1307.5146v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1307.5146v1	2013	The long wavelength view of GG Tau A: Rocks in the Ring World	Anna M. M. Scaife	  We present the first detection of GG Tau A at centimeter-wavelengths, made with the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager Large Array (AMI-LA) at a frequency of 16 GHz ({\lambda} = 1.8 cm). The source is detected at > 6 {\sigma}_{rms} with an integrated flux density of S = 249+/-45 {\mu}Jy. We use these new centimetre-wave data, in conjunction with additional measurements compiled from the literature, to investigate the long wavelength tail of the dust emission from this unusual proto-planetary system. We use an MCMC based method to determine maximum likelihood parameters for a simple parametric spectral model and consider the opacity and mass of the dust contributing to the microwave emission. We derive a dust mass of approximately 0.1 solar masses, constrain the dimensions of the emitting region and find that the opacity index at {\lambda} > 7mm is less than unity, implying a contribution to the dust population from grains exceeding 4 cm in size. We suggest that this indicates coagulation within the GG Tau A system has proceeded to the point where dust grains have grown to the size of small rocks with dimensions of a few centimetres. Considering the relatively young age of the GG Tau association, in combination with the low derived disk mass, we suggest that this system may provide a useful test case for rapid core accretion planet formation models.

John Anfinogenov|Larisa Budaeva|Dmitry Kuznetsov|Yana Anfinogenova	  The aim of the study was to discover remnants of the 1908 Tunguska meteorite. Main objective of the field studies was identification of exotic rocks, furrows, and penetration funnels reported by the first eyewitnesses, residents of the area with severe forest destruction. Main methods included decoding of aerial survey photographs, systematic survey of the epicenter area of the Tunguska explosion, exploratory excavations of the objects of interest, reconstruction studies of exotic boulder by using its splinters, mineralogical and spectral analysis of specimens, experimental attempt of plasma-induced reproduction of the fusion crust on specimen. The authors present results on discovery of penetration funnel-like structures; exotic boulder (known as John's Stone)) with its shear-fractured splinters and fresh furrow in the permafrost; several splinters with glassy coatings; evidence of high-speed John's Stone deceleration in the permafrost; and clear consistency in geometry of spacial arrangements of all splinters, furrows, cleaved pebbles according to data of reconstruction studies. John's Stone is composed of highly silicified gravelite sandstone (98.5% SiO2) with grain size of 0.5 to 1.5 cm. Outer surface of several splinters showed continuous glassy coating similar to shiny fusion crust reminiscent of freshly applied enamel. Plasma-induced heating of John's Stone specimen led to its explosive disintegration; residue presented with whitish semi-transparent pumice-like grains and irregularly shaped fused particles. Overall, our data suggest that John's Stone is Tunguska meteorite candidate. Recent discoveries of sedimentary rocks, lithified gravelite sandstone, clay, and quartz on Mars provide rationale for search and identification of silica-rich Martian meteorites of sedimentary origin.

Seigar|Patrick Treuthardt|Ivanio Puerari	  In this paper, we apply a method identified by Puerari & Dottori (1997) to find the corotation radii (CR) in spiral galaxies. We apply our method to 57 galaxies, 17 of which have already have their CR locations determined using other methods. The method we adopted entails taking Fourier transforms along radial cuts in the u, g, r, i, and z wavebands and comparing the phase angles as a function of radius between them. The radius at which the phase angles cross indicates the location of the corotation radius. We then calculated the relative bar pattern speed, $\mathcal{R}$, and classified the bar as "fast", where $\mathcal{R} < 1.4$, slow, where $\mathcal{R} \geq 1.4$, or intermediate, where the errors on $\mathcal{R}$ are consistent with the bar being "slow" or "fast". For the 17 galaxies that had their CR locations previously measured, we found that our results were consistent with the values of $\mathcal{R}$ obtained by the computer simulations of Rautiainen, Salo & Laurikainen (2008). For the larger sample, our results indicate that 34 out of 57 galaxies (~60%) have fast bars. We discuss these results in the context of its implications for dark matter concentrations in disk galaxies. We also discuss these results in the context of different models for spiral structure in disk galaxies. 	
1509.01357v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.01357v1	2015	Impact-driven planetary desiccation: The origin of the dry Venus	Kosuke Kurosawa	  The fate of surface water on Venus is one of the most important outstanding problems in comparative planetology. Here a new concept is proposed to explain water removal on a steam-covered proto Venus, referred to as impact-driven planetary desiccation. Since a steam atmosphere is photochemically unstable, water vapor dissociates into hydrogen and oxygen. Then, hydrogen escapes easily into space through hydrodynamic escape driven by strong extreme ultraviolet radiation from the young Sun. The focus is on the intense impact bombardment during the terminal stage of planetary accretion as generators of a significant amount of reducing agent. The fine-grained ejecta remove the residual oxygen, the counter part of escaped hydrogen, via the oxidation of iron-bearing rocks in a hot atmosphere. Thus, hypervelocity impacts cause net desiccation of the planetary surface. I constructed a stochastic cratering model using a Monte Carlo approach to investigate the cumulative mass of nonoxidized, ejected rocks due to the intense impact bombardment. It is shown that a thick steam atmosphere with a mass equivalent to that of the terrestrial oceans would be removed. The cumulative mass of rocky ejecta released into the atmosphere reaches 1 wt% of the host planet, which is 10000 times of the current mass of the Earths atmosphere. These results strongly suggest that chemical reactions between such large amounts of ejecta and planetary atmospheres are among the key factors required to understand atmospheric mass and its composition, not only in the Solar System but also in extrasolar systems.

Rock	  The theory of complex dimensions of fractal strings developed by Lapidus and van Frankenhuijsen has proven to be a powerful tool for the study of Minkowski measurability of fractal subsets of the real line. In a very general setting, the Minkowski measurability of such sets is characterized by the structure of corresponding complex dimensions. Also, this tool is particularly effective in the setting of self-similar fractal subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ which have been shown to be Minkowski measurable if and only if they are nonlattice. This paper features a survey on the pertinent results of Lapidus and van Frankenhuijsen and a preliminary extension of the theory of complex dimensions to subsets of Euclidean space, with an emphasis on self-similar sets that satisfy various separation conditions. This extension is developed in the context of box-counting measurability, an analog of Minkowski measurability, which is shown to be characterized by complex dimensions under certain mild conditions. 	
0802.1931v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/0802.1931v1	2008	Petrophysical analysis of regional-scale thermal properties for improved   simulations of geothermal installations and basin-scale heat and fluid flow	Andreas Hartmann|Renate Pechnig|Christoph Clauser	  Development of geothermal energy and basin-scale simulations of fluid and heat flow both suffer from uncertain physical rock properties at depth. Therefore, building better prognostic models are required. We analysed hydraulic and thermal properties of the major rock types in the Molasse Basin in Southern Germany. On about 400 samples thermal conductivity, density, porosity, and sonic velocity were measured. Here, we propose a three-step procedure with increasing complexity for analysis of the data set: First, univariate descriptive statistics provides a general understanding of the data structure, possibly still with large uncertainty. Examples show that the remaining uncertainty can be as high as 0.8 W/(m K) or as low as 0.1 W/(m K). This depends on the possibility to subdivide the geologic units into data sets that are also petrophysically similar. Then, based on all measurements, cross-plot and quick-look methods are used to gain more insight into petrophysical relationships and to refine the analysis. Because these measures usually imply an exactly determined system they do not provide strict error bounds. The final, most complex step comprises a full inversion of select subsets of the data comprising both laboratory and borehole measurements. The example presented shows the possibility to refine the used mixing laws for Petrophysical properties and the estimation of mineral properties. These can be estimated to an accuracy of 0.3 W/(m K). The predictive errors for the measurements are 0.07 W/(m K), 70 m/s, and 8 kg/m^3 for thermal conductivity, sonic velocity, and bulk density, respectively.

Viewing the set of all games as a vector space, we exhibit explicit orthonormal bases for the subspaces of potential games, zero-sum games, and their orthogonal complements which we call anti-potential games and anti-zero-sum games, respectively. Perhaps surprisingly, every anti-potential game comes either from the Rock-Paper-Scissors type games (in the case of symmetric games) or from the Matching Pennies type games (in the case of asymmetric games). Using these decompositions, we prove old (and some new) cycle criteria for potential and zero-sum games (as orthogonality relations between subspaces). We illustrate the usefulness of our decomposition by (a) analyzing the generalized Rock-Paper-Scissors game, (b) completely characterizing the set of all null-stable games, (c) providing a large class of strict stable games, (d) relating the game decomposition to the decomposition of vector fields for the replicator equations, (e) constructing Lyapunov functions for some replicator dynamics, and (f) constructing Zeeman games -games with an interior asymptotically stable Nash equilibrium and a pure strategy ESS.

De Benedetti|Annibale Mottana	  This work relates the occurrence and the characterization of fibrous tremolite within the latest pyroclastic deposits of the Colli Albani (Alban Hills) volcano, to the south-east of Rome (Italy). These mineralizations were observed during a systematic rock-sampling undertaken to complete the geological survey for the new 1:50 000 map of this volcanic area. The examined specimens were collected inside distal deposits correlated to the last Albano Maar activity, which are geographically located within the boundaries of the Nemi community. Tremolite occurs within both carbonate ejecta and the host pyroclastic rocks. It shows up as whitish to light gray coloured aggregates of crystals with fibrous aspect and sericeous brightness. Due to the extremely small crystal dimensions, never exceeding 0.5 micron in diameter, the micro-chemical composition of the fibres could be obtained only by combining P-XRD, SEM-EDX and FTIR methods. Infrared spectroscopy, in particular, proved to be a valuable technique to characterize the studied amphibole. The composition determined is that of a Fe-free F-rich (c. 53%) tremolite with significant (c. 20%) richterite components in solid-solution. The occurrence of fibrous tremolite in an inhabited place, occurring as natural geological material rather than being due to anthropogenic pollution, should be examined with concern, because it implies complex health and legal responsibilities in the case of mobilization due to extreme climatic events.

Wang	  During 2013-2015 an expansion of the China JinPing underground Laboratory (CJPL) will be undertaken along a main branch of a bypass tunnel in the JinPing tunnel complex. This second phase of CJPL will increase laboratory space to approximately 96,000 m^3, which can be compared to the existing CJPL-I volume of 4,000 m^3. One design configuration has eight additional hall spaces, each over 60 m long and approximately 12 m in width, with overburdens of about 2.4 km of rock, oriented parallel to and away from the main water transport and auto traffic tunnels. Concurrent with the excavation activities, planning is underway for dark matter and other rare-event detectors, as well as for geophysics/engineering and other coupled multi-disciplinary sensors. In the town meeting on 8 September, 2013 at Asilomar, CA, associated with the 13th International Conference on Topics in Astroparticle and Underground Physics (TAUP), presentations and panel discussions addressed plans for one-ton expansions of the current CJPL germanium detector array of the China Darkmatter EXperiment (CDEX) collaboration and of the duel-phase xenon detector of the Panda-X collaboration, as well as possible new detector initiatives for dark matter studies, low-energy solar neutrino detection, neutrinoless double beta searches, and geoneutrinos. JinPing was also discussed as a site for a low-energy nuclear astrophysics accelerator. Geophysics/engineering opportunities include acoustic and micro-seismic monitoring of rock bursts during and after excavation, coupled-process in situ measurements, local, regional, and global monitoring of seismically induced radon emission, and electromagnetic signals.

For the fundamental model system of Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) game, classic game theory of infinite rationality predicts the Nash equilibrium (NE) state with every player randomizing her choices to avoid being exploited, while evolutionary game theory of bounded rationality in general predicts persistent cyclic motions, especially for finite populations. However, as empirical studies on human subjects have been relatively sparse, it is still a controversial issue as to which theoretical framework is more appropriate to describe decision making of human subjects. Here we observe population-level cyclic motions in a laboratory experiment of the discrete-time iterated RPS game under the traditional random pairwise-matching protocol. The cycling direction and frequency are not sensitive to the payoff parameter a. This collective behavior contradicts with the NE theory but it is quantitatively explained by a microscopic model of win-lose-tie conditional response without any adjustable parameter. Our theoretical calculations reveal that this new strategy may offer higher payoffs to individual players in comparison with the NE mixed strategy, suggesting that high social efficiency is achievable through optimized conditional response.

One hypothesis for the disappearance of the continental crust is excavation/melting by the Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB), a concentration of impacts in the last phase of the Hadean eon. In this paper, we calculate the effects of LHB on Hadean continental crust in order to investigate this hypothesis. Approximating the size-frequency distribution of the impacts by a power-law scaling with an exponent {\alpha} as a parameter, we have derived semi-analytical expressions for the effects of LHB impacts. We calculated the total excavation/melting volume and area affected by the LHB from two constraints of LHB on the moon, the size of the largest basin during LHB, and the density of craters larger than 20 km. We also investigated the effects of the value of {\alpha}. Our results show that LHB does not excavate/melt all of Hadean continental crust directly, but over 70% of the Earth's surface area can be covered by subsequent melts in a broad range of {\alpha}. If there have been no overturns of the continental crust until today, LHB could be responsible for the absence of Hadean rocks because most of Hadean continental crust is not be exposed on the Earth's surface in this case.

Schaefer|Katharina Lodders	  Extensive experimental studies show all major rocky elements (Si, Mg, Fe, Ni, Ca, Al, Na, K) dissolve in steam to a greater or lesser extent. We use these results to compute chemical equilibrium abundances of rocky element-bearing gases in steam atmospheres equilibrated with silicate magma oceans. Rocky elements partition into steam atmospheres as volatile hydroxide gases and via reaction with HF or HCl as volatile halide gases in much larger amounts than expected from their vapor pressures over volatile-free solid or molten rock at the same temperature. We compute the extent of fractional vaporization by defining gas to magma partition coefficients and show Earth's sub-solar Si to Mg bulk elemental ratio may be due to loss of a primordial steam atmosphere. We conclude hot rocky exoplanets that are undergoing or have undergone escape of steam atmospheres may experience fractional vaporization and loss of Si, Mg, Fe, Ni, Ca, Al, Na, and K. This loss may modify their bulk composition, density, heat balance, and internal structure.

Vican|B. T. Gänsicke|N. Smith|G. Walth|E. Breedt	  The Teff = 20,800 K white dwarf WD 1536+520 is shown to have broadly solar abundances of the major rock forming elements O, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, and Fe, together with a strong relative depletion in the volatile elements C and S. In addition to the highest metal abundances observed to date, including log(O/He) = -3.4, the helium-dominated atmosphere has an exceptional hydrogen abundance at log(H/He) = -1.7. Within the uncertainties, the metal-to-metal ratios are consistent with the accretion of an H2O-rich and rocky parent body, an interpretation supported by the anomalously high trace hydrogen. The mixed atmosphere yields unusually short diffusion timescales for a helium atmosphere white dwarf, of no more than a few hundred yr, and equivalent to those in a much cooler, hydrogen-rich star. The overall heavy element abundances of the disrupted parent body deviate modestly from a bulk Earth pattern, and suggest the deposition of some core-like material. The total inferred accretion rate is 4.2e9 g/s, and at least 4 times higher than any white dwarf with a comparable diffusion timescale. Notably, when accretion is exhausted in this system, both metals and hydrogen will become undetectable within roughly 300 Myr, thus supporting a scenario where the trace hydrogen is related to the ongoing accretion of planetary debris. 	
1610.03457v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.03457v1	2016	A finite volume/discontinuous Galerkin method for the advective   Cahn-Hilliard equation with degenerate mobility on porous domains stemming   from micro-CT imaging	Florian Frank|Chen Liu|Faruk O. Alpak|Beatrice Riviere	  A numerical method is formulated for the solution of the advective Cahn-Hilliard (CH) equation with constant and degenerate mobility in three-dimensional porous media with non-vanishing velocity on the exterior boundary. The CH equation describes phase separation of an immiscible binary mixture at constant temperature in the presence of a mass constraint and dissipation of free energy. Porous media/pore-scale problems specifically entail high-resolution images of rocks in which the solid matrix and pore spaces are fully resolved. The interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin method is used for the spatial discretization of the CH equation in mixed form, while a semi-implicit convex-concave splitting is utilized for temporal discretization. The spatial approximation order is arbitrary, while it reduces to a finite volume scheme for the choice of elementwise constants. The resulting nonlinear systems of equations are reduced using the Schur complement and solved via Newton's method. The numerical scheme is first validated using numerical convergence tests and then applied to a number of fundamental problems for validation and numerical experimentation purposes including the case of degenerate mobility. First-order physical applicability and robustness of the numerical method are shown in a breakthrough scenario on a voxel set obtained from a micro-CT scan of a real sandstone rock sample.

Doetsch|T. Le Borgne|O. Bour	  The sparsely spaced highly permeable fractures of the granitic rock aquifer at Stang-er-Brune (Brittany, France) form a well-connected fracture network of high permeability but unknown geometry. Previous work based on optical and acoustic logging together with single-hole and cross-hole flowmeter data acquired in 3 neighboring boreholes (70-100 m deep) have identified the most important permeable fractures crossing the boreholes and their hydraulic connections. To constrain possible flow paths by estimating the geometries of known and previously unknown fractures, we have acquired, processed and interpreted multifold, single- and cross-hole GPR data using 100 and 250 MHz antennas. The GPR data processing scheme consisting of time-zero corrections, scaling, bandpass filtering and F-X deconvolution, eigenvector filtering, muting, pre-stack Kirchhoff depth migration and stacking was used to differentiate fluid-filled fracture reflections from source-generated noise. The final stacked and pre-stack depth-migrated GPR sections provide high-resolution images of individual fractures (dipping 30-90{\deg}) in the surroundings (2-20 m for the 100 MHz antennas; 2-12 m for the 250 MHz antennas) of each borehole in a 2D plane projection that are of superior quality to those obtained from single-offset sections. Most fractures previously identified from hydraulic testing can be correlated to reflections in the single-hole data. Several previously unknown major near vertical fractures have also been identified away from the boreholes.

Shakas|N. Linde	  We propose a new approach to model ground penetrating radar signals that propagate through a homogeneous and isotropic medium, and are scattered at thin planar fractures of arbitrary dip, azimuth, thickness and material filling. We use analytical expressions for the Maxwell equations in a homogeneous space to describe the propagation of the signal in the rock matrix, and account for frequency-dependent dispersion and attenuation through the empirical Jonscher formulation. We discretize fractures into elements that are linearly polarized by the incoming electric field that arrives from the source to each element, locally, as a plane wave. To model the effective source wavelet we use a generalized Gamma distribution to define the antenna dipole moment. We combine microscopic and macroscopic Maxwell's equations to derive an analytic expression for the response of each element, which describes the full electric dipole radiation patterns along with effective reflection coefficients of thin layers. Our results compare favorably with finite-difference time-domain modeling in the case of constant electrical parameters of the rock-matrix and fracture filling. Compared with traditional finite-difference time-domain modeling, the proposed approach is faster and more flexible in terms of fracture orientations. A comparison with published laboratory results suggests that the modeling approach can reproduce the main characteristics of the reflected wavelet.

Gaensicke	  High-metallicity pollution is common in white dwarf (WD) stars hosting remnant planetary systems. However, they rarely have detectable debris accretion discs, possibly because much of the influx is fast steeply-infalling debris in star-grazing orbits, producing a more tenuous signature than a slowly accreting disk. Processes governing such deposition between the Roche radius and photosphere have so far received little attention and we model them here analytically by extending recent work on sun-grazing comets to WD systems. We find that the evolution of cm-to-km size (a_0) infallers most strongly depends on two combinations of parameters, which effectively measure sublimation rate and binding strength. We then provide an algorithm to determine the fate of infallers for any WD, and apply the algorithm to four limiting combinations of hot versus cool (young/old) WDs with snowy (weak, volatile) versus rocky (strong, refractory) infallers. We find: (i) Total sublimation above the photosphere befalls all small infallers across the entire WD temperature (T_WD) range, the threshold size rising with T_WD and 100X larger for rock than snow. (ii) All very large objects fragment tidally regardless of T_WD: for rock, a_0 >= 10^5 cm; for snow, a_0 >= 10^3 -- 3x10^4 cm across all WD cooling ages. (iii) A considerable range of a_0 avoids fragmentation and total sublimation, yielding impacts or grazes with cold WDs. This range narrows rapidly with increasing T_WD, especially for snowy bodies. Finally, we discuss briefly how the various forms of deposited debris may finally reach the photosphere surface itself. 	
1703.00468v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.00468v1	2017	An Innovative Computational Approach for Modeling Thermo-hydro Processes   within Enhanced Geothermal System	Kamran Jahan Bakhsh|Masami Nakagawa|Mahmood Arshad|Lucila Dunnington	  An innovative computational approach to capturing the essential aspects of an Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS) is formulated. The modified finite element method is utilized to model transient heat and fluid flow within an EGS reservoir. Three main features are modified to determine their impact on the reservoir: the fracture model, the porous model, and the coupling physical model. For the first feature, the fractures are modeled as a two-dimensional subdomain embedded in a vast three-dimensional rock mass. The fracture model eliminates the need to create slender fractures with a high aspect ratio by allowing reduction of the spatial discretization of the fractures from three- to two-dimensional finite elements. In this model, pseudo three-dimensional equations are adopted to drive the physics of heat and fluid flow in the fractures. In the second feature, a porous subdomain with effective transport properties is modeled to integrate a thermally-shocked region in the reservoir simulation. In the third feature, three-dimensional heat flow in the rock mass is coupled to the two-dimensional heat and fluid flow in the fractures. Numerical examples are computed to illustrate the computational capability of the proposed model to simulate heat and fluid flow in an EGS. Results show that the proposed model is capable of both effectively integrating thermal fractures into reservoir simulation, as well as efficiently tackling the computational burden exerted by high aspect ratio geometries. A parametric analysis is also performed in which the effect of thermal fractures and thermally-shocked region on reservoir performance is evaluated.

Moyano-Cambero|Josep M. Trigo-Rodríguez|M. Isabel Benito|Jacinto Alonso-Azcárate|Martin R. Lee|Narcís Mestres|Marina Martínez-Jiménez|F. Javier Martín-Torres|Jordi Fraxedas	  Martian meteorites can provide valuable information about past environmental conditions on Mars. Allan Hills 84001 formed more than 4 Gyr ago, and owing to its age and long exposure to the Martian environment, this meteorite has features that may record early processes. These features include a highly fractured texture, gases trapped during one or more impact events or during formation of the rock, and spherical Fe-Mg-Ca carbonates. Here we have concentrated on providing new insights into the context of these carbonates using a range of techniques to explore whether they record multiple precipitation and shock events. The petrographic features and compositional properties of these carbonates indicate that at least two pulses of Mg- and Fe-rich solutions saturated the rock. Those two generations of carbonates can be distinguished by a very sharp change in compositions, from being rich in Mg and poor in Fe and Mn, to being poor in Mg and rich in Fe and Mn. Between these two generations of carbonate is evidence for fracturing and local corrosion.

These are encountered e.g. in hydraulic fracturing, geologic carbon storage and well stimulation in enhanced oil recovery. The surface area of the rocks changes as the pore structure evolves. We combined a reactor network model with grey scale tomography to seek the morphological interpretation for differences among geometric, reactive and apparent surface areas of dissolving natural porous materials. The approach allowed us to delineate the experimentally convoluted variables and study independently the effects of initial geometry and macroscopic flowrate. Simulations based on North Sea chalk microstructure showed that geometric surface not only serves as the interface for water-rock interactions but also represents the regional transport heterogeneities that can be amplified indefinitely by dissolutive percolation. Hence, RII leads to channelization of the solid matrix, which results in fluid focusing and an increase in geometric surface area. Fluid focusing reduces the reactive surface area and the residence time of reactants, both of which amplify the differences in question, i.e. they are self-supporting. Our results also suggested that the growing and merging of microchannels near the fluid entrance leads to the macroscopic "fast initial dissolution" of chemically homogeneous materials.

Stipp|Henning O. Sørensen	  The dissolution of porous materials in a flow field shapes the morphologies of many geologic landscapes. Identifying the dissolution front, the interface between the reactive and the unreactive regions in a dissolving medium, is a prerequisite for studying dissolution kinetics. Despite its fundamental importance, the dynamics of a dissolution front in an evolving natural microstructure has never been reported. Here we show an unexpected spontaneous migration of the dissolution front against the pressure gradient of a flow field. This retraction stems from the infiltration instability induced surface generation, which can lead to a reactive surface dramatically greater than the ex situ geometric surface. The results are supported by a very good agreement between observations made with real time X-ray imaging and simulations based on static images of a rock determined by nanoCT. They both show that the in situ specific surface area of natural porous media is dependent on the flow field and reflects a balancing between surface generation and destruction. The reported dynamics challenge many long-held understanding of water-rock interactions and shed light on reconciling the discrepancies between field and laboratory measurements of reaction kinetics.

Kuroiwa|Y. Goto|A. Miura|S. Lee|S. Torii|T. Kamiyama|C. H. Lee|M. Ochi|K. Kuroki	  We have investigated the crystal structure of LaOBiPbS3 using neutron diffraction and synchrotron X-ray diffraction. From structural refinements, we found that the two metal sites, occupied by Bi and Pb, were differently surrounded by the sulfur atoms. Calculated bond valence sum suggested that one metal site was nearly trivalent and the other was nearly divalent. Neutron diffraction also revealed site selectivity of Bi and Pb in the LaOBiPbS3 structure. These results suggested that the crystal structure of LaOBiPbS3 can be regarded as alternate stacks of the rock-salt-type Pb-rich sulfide layers and the LaOBiS2-type Bi-rich layers. From band calculations for an ideal (LaOBiS2)(PbS) system, we found that the S bands of the PbS layer were hybridized with the Bi bands of the BiS plane at around the Fermi energy, which resulted in the electronic characteristics different from that of LaOBiS2. Stacking the rock-salt type sulfide (chalcogenide) layers and the BiS2-based layered structure could be a new strategy to exploration of new BiS2-based layered compounds, exotic two-dimensional electronic states, or novel functionality.

Obtaining and analyzing rock samples can provide unprecedented insight into the geology, geo-history and prospects for finding past life and water. Current methods of exploration rely on mission scientists to identify objects of interests and this presents major operational challenges. Finding objects of interests will require systematic and efficient methods to quickly and correctly evaluate the importance of hundreds if not thousands of samples so that the most interesting are saved for further analysis by the mission scientists. In this paper, we propose an automated information theoretic approach to identify shapes of interests using a library of predefined interesting shapes. These predefined shapes maybe human input or samples that are then extrapolated by the shape matching system using the Superformula to judge the importance of newly obtained objects. Shape samples are matched to a library of shapes using the eigenfaces approach enabling categorization and prioritization of the sample. The approach shows robustness to simulated sensor noise of up to 20%. The effect of shape parameters and rotational angle on shape matching accuracy has been analyzed. The approach shows significant promise and efforts are underway in testing the algorithm with real rock samples.

Here, we model the atmosphere of a core that grows by accreting ice-rich pebbles. The ice fraction of pebbles evaporates in warm regions of the atmosphere, saturating it with water vapor. Excess water precipitates to lower altitudes. Beneath an outer radiative region, the atmosphere is convective, following a moist adiabat in saturated regions due to water condensation and precipitation. Atmospheric mass, density and temperature increase with core mass. For nominal model parameters, planets with core masses (ice + rock) between 0.08 and 0.16 Earth masses have surface temperatures between 273 K and 647 K and form an ocean. In more massive planets, water exists as a super-critical convecting fluid mixed with gas from the disk. Typically, the core mass reaches a maximum (the critical mass) as a function of the total mass when the core is 2-5 Earth masses. The critical mass depends in a complicated way on pebble size, mass flux, and dust opacity due to the occasional appearance of multiple core-mass maxima. The core mass for an atmosphere of 50 percent hydrogen and helium may be a more robust indicator of the onset of gas accretion. This mass is typically 1-3 Earth masses for pebbles that are 50 percent ice by mass, increasing with opacity and pebble flux, and decreasing with pebble ice/rock ratio. 	
1711.05257v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.05257v1	2017	Similarity Analysis of Discrete Fracture Networks	Younes Fadakar Alghalandis|Davide Elmo|Erik Eberhardt	  Applications of Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) modeling are becoming increasingly prevalent in engineering analyses involving fractured rock masses. For example, kinematic evaluations of slope or underground excavation stability and the modeling of fluid flow in fractured rock have been shown to benefit significantly from the explicit representation of DFN realizations in the simulations. In practice, due to high computing costs, namely time, a balance must be struck that limits analyses to the consideration of only a few realizations as input. As a stochastic representation, a single realization is only one possibility. It is therefore critical that the selected realizations (possibilities) are able to summarize the range of variations present in the input parameters adequately for the purpose of study or practice. That is, the significance of diversity (dissimilarity) in the generated fracture networks is of great importance and should be assessed prior to further often time-consuming processing stages. We demonstrate here a novel development in the analysis of the similarity between three-dimensional fracture networks, which provides an accurate, efficient and practical solution with comprehensive coverage of model variations. Several examples are presented together with a comparison between the proposed three-dimensional method and existing methods limited to two-dimensional assumptions. It is shown that the two-dimensional similarity methods despite their popularity are heavily biased and poorly represent the reality.

Cavallo	  Glass stability (GS) indicates the glass reluctance or ability to crystallise upon heating; it can be characterised by several methods and parameters and is frequently used to retrieve glass-forming ability (GFA) of corresponding liquids as the case with which such liquids can be made crystal free via melt-quenching. Here, GS has been determined for the first time on six sub-alkaline glasses having complex (natural) compositions, the most widespread and abundant on Earth. KT, KH, KW, KLL and w2 GS parameters increase linearly and monotonically as a function of SiO2, with very high correlations. Moreover, Tx values and GS parameters highly correlate with GFA via Rc (critical cooling rate), previously determined with ex-situ cooling-induced experiments. Therefore, GS scales with GFA for natural silicate compositions. In addition, the in-situ Rc value of B100 measured with DSC results > 45 {\deg}C/min (> 2700 {\deg}C/h), broadly corroborating the Rc of about 150 {\deg}C/min (9000 {\deg}C/h) determined ex-situ. In turn, relevant solidification parameters on heating or cooling can be obtained by DSC investigations also for chemically complex (natural) systems, similar to simple silicate systems. These outcomes are relevant for lavas or magmas that re-heat glass-bearing volcanic rocks, as well as for fabricate glass-ceramic materials with desirable texture and composition of phases starting from abundant and very cheap raw volcanic rocks.

We are interested in flow in discrete fracture networks, which explicitly represent flow in fracture surfaces, but ignore the impact of the surrounding host rock. Fracture networks, generated from observations or stochastic simulations, will contain intersections of arbitrary length, and intersection lines can further cross, forming a highly complex geometry. As the flow exchange between fractures, thus in the network, takes place in these intersections, an adequate representation of the geometry is critical for simulation accuracy. In practice, the intersection dynamics must be handled by a combination of the simulation grid, which may or may not resolve the intersection lines, and the numerical methods applied on the grid. In this work, we review different classes of numerical approaches proposed in recent years, covering both methods that conform to the grid, and non-matching cases. Specific methods considered herein include finite element, mixed and virtual finite elements and control volume methods. We expose our methods to an extensive set of test cases, ranging from artificial geometries designed to test difficult configurations, to a network extruded from a real fracture outcrop. The main outcome is guidances for choice of simulation models and numerical discretization with a trade off on the computational cost and solution accuracy.

The used observables are the air shower size (Ne) measured by EAS-TOP and the muon number (Nmu) recorded by MACRO. The two detectors are separated on average by 1200 m of rock, and located at a respective zenith angle of about 30 degrees. The energy threshold at the surface for muons reaching the MACRO depth is approximately 1.3 TeV. Such muons are produced in the early stages of the shower development and in a kinematic region quite different from the one relevant for the usual Nmu-Ne studies. The measurement leads to a primary composition becoming heavier at the knee of the primary spectrum, the knee itself resulting from the steepening of the spectrum of a primary light component (p, He). The result confirms the ones reported from the observation of the low energy muons at the surface (typically in the GeV energy range), showing that the conclusions do not depend on the production region kinematics. Thus, the hadronic interaction model used (CORSIKA/QGSJET) provides consistent composition results from data related to secondaries produced in a rapidity region exceeding the central one. Such an evolution of the composition in the knee region supports the "standard" galactic acceleration/propagation models that imply rigidity dependent breaks of the different components, and therefore breaks occurring at lower energies in the spectra of the light nuclei.

Weiler	  Detection of ultra-high energy neutrinos will be useful for unraveling the dynamics of the most violent sources in the cosmos and for revealing the neutrino cross-section at extreme energy. Above ~ 10^20 eV, neutrinos may well be the only cosmic primariies. Thus, it is important to know the acceptances (event rate/flux) of proposed air-shower experiments for detecting ``horizontal'' neutrino events initiated in our atmosphere, and ``Earth-skimming'' events initiated in the Earth's surface rock or ocean. We calculate these acceptances for fluorescence detectors, both space-based as with the EUSO and OWL proposals, and ground-based, as with Auger, HiRes and Telescope Array. The neutrino cross-section sigma_nuN is not measured at energies above 5.2 x 10^13 eV. Although QCD extrapolations offer motivated guesses for sigma_nuN, new physics could intervene to provide a surprise. Therefore, we present the acceptances of horizontal (HAS) and upgoing (UAS) air showers as a function of sigma_nuN over the interesting range 10^(-34) to 10^(-30) cm^2. The dependences of acceptances on neutrino energy, shower-threshold energy, shower length and column density, and cloud layers are also studied. For UAS, we present acceptances for events over land (rock), and over the ocean (water). The latter are larger by about an order of magnitude, thus favoring space-based detectors. We revisit the idea of Kusenko and Weiler to infer sigma_nuN at E_nu ~ 10^20 eV from the ratio of HAS-to-UAS events, and find favorable results. Our calculation is mostly analytic. Included in the UAS calculation are realistic energy-losses for taus, and Earth-curvature effects.

Marley|Jason W. Barnes	  To aid in the physical interpretation of planetary radii constrained through observations of transiting planets, or eventually direct detections, we compute model radii of pure hydrogen-helium, water, rock, and iron planets, along with various mixtures. Masses ranging from 0.01 Earth masses to 10 Jupiter masses at orbital distances of 0.02 to 10 AU are considered. For hydrogen-helium rich planets, our models are the first to couple planetary evolution to stellar irradiation over a wide range of orbital separations (0.02 to 10 AU) through a non-gray radiative-convective equilibrium atmosphere model. Stellar irradiation retards the contraction of giant planets, but its effect is not a simple function of the irradiation level: a planet at 1 AU contracts as slowly as a planet at 0.1 AU. For hydrogen-helium planets, we consider cores up to 90% of the total planet mass, comparable to those of Uranus and Neptune. If "hot Neptunes" have maintained their original masses and are not remnants of more massive planets, radii of 0.30-0.45 times Jupiter's radius are expected. Water planets are ~40-50% larger than rocky planets, independent of mass. Finally, we provide tables of planetary radii at various ages and compositions, and for ice-rock-iron planets we fit our results to analytic functions, which will allow for quick composition estimates, given masses and radii, or mass estimates, given only planetary radii. These results will assist in the interpretation of observations for both the current transiting planet surveys as well as upcoming space missions, including CoRoT and Kepler.

Grossi	  We estimate the rate of observable Horizontal and Upward Tau Air-Showers (HORTAUs, UPTAUS) considering both the Earth opacity and the finite size of the terrestrial atmosphere. We calculate the effective target volumes and masses for Tau air-showers emerging from the Earth. The resulting model-independent masses for satellite experiments such as EUSO may encompass at E_nu_tau = 10^19 eV a very large volume, V= 1020 km^3. Adopting simple power law neutrino fluxes, E^-2 and E^-1, calibrated to GZK-like and Z-Burst-like models, we estimate that at E= 10^19 eV nearly half a dozen horizontal shower events should be detected by EUSO in three years of data collection by the "guaranteed" GZK neutrino flux. We also find that the equivalent mass for an Earth outer layer made of rock is dominant compared to the water, contrary to simplified all-rock/all-water Earth models and previous Montecarlo simulations. Therefore we expect an enhancement of neutrino detection along continental shelves nearby the highest mountain chains, also given the better geometrical acceptance for Earth skimming neutrinos. The Auger experiment might reveal such a signature at E_nu= 10^{18} eV (with 26 events in 3 yr) towards the Andes, if the angular resolution at the horizon (both in azimuth and zenith) would reach an accuracy of nearly one degree needed to disentangle tau air showers from common UHECR. The number of events increases at lower energies; therefore we suggest an extension of the EUSO and Auger sensitivity down to (or even below) E_nu = 10^19 eV and E_nu = 10^18 eV respectively.

The water-rock interactions in hydrothermal zones alter the primary minerals leading to the formation of secondary minerals. This work addresses the study of calcite precipitation in a sand composed of 98% quartz and 2% calcite using streaming potential measurements. The precipitation of calcite as a secondary mineral phase, inferred by high calcite saturation indices and by a fall in permeability, has a significant effect on the electrokinetic behaviour, leading to a significant reduction in the Zeta potential (in absolute value) and even a change in sign. The measured decrease in Zeta potential from -16 mV to -27&plusmn;4 mV takes place as the pH rises from 4 to 7, while it remains constant at -25&plusmn;1 mV as the pH increases from 8 to 10.5. For pH higher than 10.5, calcite precipitates and is expected to coat the quartz surface. The measured Zeta potential vary from -17 to +8 mV for pH ranging from 10.6 to 11.7 depending on the amount of precipitated calcite indicated by the decrease in permeability. The observed change in sign of the electrical surface potential rules out the usual qualitative interpretation of SP anomalies in order to determine fluid circulations, even at pH lower than 9 if calcite is widely present as a secondary mineral phase, since the electrical surface potential of calcite depends also on CO2 partial pressure and [Ca2+]. Therefore SP anomalies as measured in hydrothermal field, without mineralogical analyses of hydrothermal deposits, and without geochemical fluid survey, should be interpreted with caution.

We found notable differences between these two kinds of zircons exhibited by the variation trend of Raman peak intensity from core to rim of a crystal. In magmatic zircons, the intensity and the ratio H/W of Raman spectrum peaks gradually decrease from core to rim of a crystal, which is produced by an increase in metamictization degree and suggests an increase in U and Th concentrations from core to rim. In metamorphic zircons, there are two kinds of crystals according to their Raman spectra: the first group of zircons exhibits a variation trend opposite to those of magmatic zircons, tending to increase in the Raman peak intensity and H/W value from core to rim of a crystal, which is produced by a decrease in metamictization degree and indicates a decrease of U and Th concentrations from core to rim of a crystal. The second group of zircons exhibits no change in Raman peak intensity and H/W value through a crystal. The data of infrared and Raman spectra of these crystals show that they are well crystallized and have no lattice destruction induced by metamictization, and are thought to crystallize in high temperature stages of metamorphism. During these stages, the U and Th ions have been removed by metamorphic fluids from the parent rocks of these zircons. The other difference between magmatic and metamorphic zircons is the background level of their Raman spectra, which is high and sloped in magmatic zircons, but low and horizontal in metamorphic zircons. The differences between magmatic and metamorphic zircons can be used to identify the genesis of zircons and understand the origin and evolution history of their parent rocks. 	
0712.2015v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/0712.2015v2	2008	A celestial gamma-ray foreground due to the albedo of small solar system   bodies and a remote probe of the interstellar cosmic ray spectrum	Igor V. Moskalenko|Troy A. Porter|Seth W. Digel|Peter F. Michelson|Jonathan F. Ormes	  We calculate the gamma-ray albedo flux from cosmic-ray (CR) interactions with the solid rock and ice in Main Belt asteroids (MBAs), Jovian and Neptunian Trojan asteroids, and Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs) using the Moon as a template. We show that the gamma-ray albedo for the Main Belt, Trojans, and Kuiper Belt strongly depends on the small-body size distribution of each system. Based on an analysis of the Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope (EGRET) data we infer that the diffuse emission from the MBAs, Trojans, and KBOs has an integrated flux of less than ~6x10^{-6} cm^{-2} s^{-1} (100-500 MeV), which corresponds to ~12 times the Lunar albedo, and may be detectable by the forthcoming Gamma Ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST). If detected by GLAST, it can provide unique direct information about the number of small bodies in each system that is difficult to assess by any other method. Additionally, the KBO albedo flux can be used to probe the spectrum of CR nuclei at close-to-interstellar conditions. The orbits of MBAs, Trojans, and KBOs are distributed near the ecliptic, which passes through the Galactic center and high Galactic latitudes. Therefore, the asteroid gamma-ray albedo has to be taken into account when analyzing weak gamma-ray sources close to the ecliptic, especially near the Galactic center and for signals at high Galactic latitudes, such as the extragalactic gamma-ray emission. The asteroid albedo spectrum also exhibits a 511 keV line due to secondary positrons annihilating in the rock. This may be an important and previously unrecognized celestial foreground for the INTErnational Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory (INTEGRAL) observations of the Galactic 511 keV line emission including the direction of the Galactic center.

Gehman	  In this paper, we demonstrate the use of physical models to evaluate the production of $^{39}$Ar and $^{40}$Ar underground. Considering both cosmogenic $^{39}$Ar production and radiogenic $^{40}$Ar production in situ and from external sources, we can derive the ratio of $^{39}$Ar to $^{40}$Ar in underground sources. We show for the first time that the $^{39}$Ar production underground is dominated by stopping negative muon capture on $^{39}$K and ($\alpha,n)$ induced subsequent $^{39}$K(n,p)$^{39}$Ar reactions. The production of $^{39}$Ar is shown as a function of depth. We demonstrate that argon depleted in $^{39}$Ar can be obtained only if the depth of the underground resources is greater than 500 m.w.e. below the surface. Stopping negative muon capture on $^{39}$K dominates over radiogenic production at depths of less than 2000 m.w.e., and that production by muon-induced neutrons is subdominant at any depth. The depletion factor depends strongly on both radioactivity level and potassium content in the rock. We measure the radioactivity concentration and potassium concentration in the rock for a potential site of an underground argon source in South Dakota. Depending on the probability of $^{39}$Ar and $^{40}$Ar produced underground being dissolved in the water, the upper limit of the concentration of $^{39}$Ar in the underground water at this site is estimated to be in a range of a factor of 1.6 to 155 less than the $^{39}$Ar concentration in the atmosphere.   The calculation tools presented in this paper are also critical to the dating method with $^{39}$Ar.

The composition implies a mass-radius relation which relies heavily on equations of state calculated from electronic structure theory and measured experimentally on Earth. We lay out a method for deriving and testing equations of state, and deduce mass-radius and mass-pressure relations for key materials whose equation of state is reasonably well established, and for differentiated Fe/rock. We find that variations in the equation of state, such as may arise when extrapolating from low pressure data, can have significant effects on predicted mass- radius relations, and on planetary pressure profiles. The relations are compared with the observed masses and radii of planets and exoplanets. Kepler-10b is apparently 'Earth- like,' likely with a proportionately larger core than Earth's, nominally 2/3 of the mass of the planet. CoRoT-7b is consistent with a rocky mantle over an Fe-based core which is likely to be proportionately smaller than Earth's. GJ 1214b lies between the mass-radius curves for H2O and CH4, suggesting an 'icy' composition with a relatively large core or a relatively large proportion of H2O. CoRoT-2b is less dense than the hydrogen relation, which could be explained by an anomalously high degree of heating or by higher than assumed atmospheric opacity. HAT-P-2b is slightly denser than the mass-radius relation for hydrogen, suggesting the presence of a significant amount of matter of higher atomic number. CoRoT-3b lies close to the hydrogen relation. The pressure at the center of Kepler-10b is 1.5+1.2-1.0 TPa. The central pressure in CoRoT-7b is probably close to 0.8TPa, though may be up to 2TPa.

Redmer	  The planet GJ 1214b is the second known super-Earth with a measured mass and radius. Orbiting a quiet M-star, it receives considerably less mass-loss driving X-ray and UV radiation than CoRoT-7b, so that the interior may be quite dissimilar in composition, including the possibility of a large fraction of water. We model the interior of GJ 1214b assuming a two-layer (envelope+rock core) structure where the envelope material is either H/He, pure water, or a mixture of H/He and H2O. Within this framework we perform models of the thermal evolution and contraction of the planet. We discuss possible compositions that are consistent with Mp=6.55 ME, Rp=2.678 RE, an age tau=3-10 Gyr, and the irradiation level of the atmosphere. These conditions require that if water exists in the interior, it must remain in a fluid state, with important consequences for magnetic field generation. These conditions also require the atmosphere to have a deep isothermal region extending down to 80-800 bar, depending on composition. Our results bolster the suggestion of a metal-enriched H/He atmosphere for the planet, as we find water-world models that lack an H/He atmosphere to require an implausibly large water-to-rock ratio of more than 6:1. We instead favor a H/He/H2O envelope with high water mass fraction (~0.5-0.85), similar to recent models of the deep envelope of Uranus and Neptune. Even with these high water mass fractions in the H/He envelope, generally the bulk composition of the planet can have subsolar water:rock ratios. Dry, water-enriched, and pure water envelope models differ to an observationally significant level in their tidal Love numbers k2 of respectively ~0.018, 0.15, and 0.7. 	
1201.6496v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1201.6496v1	2012	Third road to the OPERA: a tunnel after all?	Giovanni Amelino-Camelia	  The debate on OPERA focused on two extremes: either "OPERA is wrong" or our formulation of the laws of physics needs a major overhaul. I here argue that some effort should be directed toward manifestations of laws that are already known, but whose implications are poorly understood in OPERA-type contexts. My preferred example of this sort is that the OPERA result might be the first observation of a previously unnoticed effect, belonging to a family of effects which includes those responsible for the well-known peculiar properties of the "tunneling time". Tentative support for this specific hypothesis comes from the presence of evanescence and "postselection", and the observation that the fraction of neutrinos absorbed in rock on the way from CERN to LNGS is of a few parts in $10^5$, i.e. comparable to the fraction of the overall travel time by which OPERA neutrinos are found to reach LNGS earlier than expected. This leads me to stress that the OPERA result is still consistent with subluminality of a suitably "postselection-corrected" velocity. Adopting the popular (but here disfavored) interpretation of the OPERA result as a "signal velocity" one could obtain superluminal values of the postselection-corrected velocity in some technologically feasible OPERA-like setups, a prediction which I propose to test. I also propose a semi-heuristic formula for the "rock dwell time" and find that it gives a result in rough agreement with the OPERA travel-time measurements. This suggests that effects similar to the ones found for OPERA's muon neutrinos should also be found, but with tangibly different magnitude, for muon anti-neutrinos under similar experimental conditions. And I argue that, whether or not they end up being relevant for the OPERA anomaly, the effects here considered should be significant in the Planck-scale realm.

Roby|John A. Rock	  The multifractal structure underlying a self-similar measure stems directly from the weighted self-similar system (or weighted iterated function system) which is used to construct the measure. This follows much in the way that the dimension of a self-similar set, be it the Hausdorff, Minkowski, or similarity dimension, is determined by the scaling ratios of the corresponding self-similar system via Moran's theorem. The multifractal structure allows for our definition of scaling regularity and scaling zeta functions motivated by geometric zeta functions and, in particular, partition zeta functions. Some of the results of this paper consolidate and partially extend the results regarding a multifractal analysis for certain self-similar measures supported on compact subsets of a Euclidean space based on partition zeta functions. Specifically, scaling zeta functions generalize partition zeta functions when the choice of the family of partitions is given by the natural family of partitions determined by the self-similar system in question. Moreover, in certain cases, self-similar measures can be shown to exhibit lattice or nonlattice structure with respect to specified scaling regularity values. Additionally, in the context provided by generalized fractal strings viewed as measures, we define generalized self-similar strings, allowing for the examination of many of the results presented here in a specific overarching context and for a connection to the results regarding the corresponding complex dimensions as roots of Dirichlet polynomials. Furthermore, generalized lattice strings and recursive strings are defined and shown to be very closely related.

Kite|Jean-Pierre Williams|Antoine Lucas|Oded Aharonson	  The decay of the martian atmosphere - which is dominated by carbon dioxide - is a component of the long-term environmental change on Mars from a climate that once allowed rivers to flow to the cold and dry conditions of today. The minimum size of craters serves as a proxy for palaeopressure of planetary atmospheres, because thinner atmospheres permit smaller objects to reach the surface at high velocities and form craters. The Aeolis Dorsa region near Gale crater on Mars contains a high density of preserved ancient craters interbedded with river deposits and thus can provide constraints on atmospheric density around the time of fluvial activity. Here we use high-resolution orthophotos and digital terrain models from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to identify ancient craters in Aeolis Dorsa that date to about 3.6 Gyr ago and compare their size distribution with models of atmospheric filtering of impactors. We obtain an upper limit of 0.9$\pm$0.1 bar, rising to 1.9$\pm$0.2 bar if rimmed circular mesas - interpreted to be erosionally-resistant fills of floors of impact craters - are excluded. We assume target properties appropriate for desert alluvium: if sediment had rock-like rock-mass strength similar to bedrock at the time of impact, the upper limit increases by a factor of up to two. If Mars did not have a stable multibar atmosphere at the time that the rivers were flowing - as suggested by our results - then the warm and wet CO2/H2O greenhouse is ruled out, and long-term average temperatures were most likely below freezing. 	
1308.6178v3	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.6178v3	2015	Russian meteorite Bronze Age (rock record)	Larisa Vodolazhskaya|Mikhail Nevsky	  This paper presents the results of a study of petroglyphs found in the quartzite grotto near the Skelnovsky small village in the Northern Black Sea in the South of Russia. The aim of the study was the analysis and interpretation of the Early Bronze Age petroglyphs using archaeoastronomical methods. The article presents a comparative analysis of Skelnovsky grotto ancient images and contemporary eyewitness accounts of the Sikhote-Alin meteorite fall and meteorite shower. Some petroglyphs were interpreted by us using ethnographic and folklore material. In this study, the magnetic declination for the geographical coordinates Skelnovsky farm was calculated, and the projection of the whole picture Skelnovskih petroglyphs on the topographical map of the area was built. The proposed location of the meteorite fall was determined with this projection. It is confirmed by satellite pictures, on which are the distinguishable terrain features, typical for the meteorite fall, are visible including the possible impact crater, and the corresponding symbols on a topographical map. The studies in the article conclude the astronomical character of the main content of the Skelnovsky petroglyphs picture which depicts the fall of a large meteoroid (bolide), similar to the Sikhote-Alin meteorite, accompanied by a meteorite shower. After a comparative analysis of the images in Sklenovsky Grotto it was discovered that the petroglyph is a copy of the figure depicted on the famous Mesopotamic clay tablet YBC 7289. We speculate that this figure is a prototype of an important building used either for ritual or farm purposes, typical for the Bronze Age and distributed as in Mesopotamia, as also on the coast of the Northern Black Sea. archaeoastronomy, petroglyphs, rock art, meteoroid, meteorite shower, impact crater, Babylonian clay tablet YBC 7289 	
1502.01946v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.01946v1	2015	The pH of Enceladus' ocean	Christopher Glein|John Baross|Hunter Waite	  Observational data from the Cassini spacecraft are used to obtain a chemical model of ocean water on Enceladus. The model indicates that Enceladus' ocean is a Na-Cl-CO3 solution with an alkaline pH of ~11-12. The dominance of aqueous NaCl is a feature that Enceladus' ocean shares with terrestrial seawater, but the ubiquity of dissolved Na2CO3 suggests that soda lakes are more analogous to the Enceladus ocean. The high pH implies that the hydroxide ion should be relatively abundant, while divalent metals should be present at low concentrations owing to buffering by clays and carbonates on the ocean floor. The high pH is interpreted to be a key consequence of serpentinization of chondritic rock, as predicted by prior geochemical reaction path models; although degassing of CO2 from the ocean may also play a role depending on the efficiency of mixing processes in the ocean. Serpentinization leads to the generation of H2, a geochemical fuel that can support both abiotic and biological synthesis of organic molecules such as those that have been detected in Enceladus' plume. Serpentinization and H2 generation should have occurred on Enceladus, like on the parent bodies of aqueously altered meteorites; but it is unknown whether these critical processes are still taking place, or if Enceladus' rocky core has been completely altered by past hydrothermal activity. The high pH also suggests that the delivery of oxidants from the surface to the ocean has not been significant, and the rocky core did not experience partial melting and igneous differentiation. On the other hand, the pH is compatible with life as we know it; life on Earth may have begun under similar conditions, and serpentinites on Earth support microbial communities that are centered on H2 that is provided by water-rock reactions. 	
1505.03813v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.03813v1	2015	The Nitrogen Budget of Earth	Ben Johnson|Colin Goldblatt	  We comprehensively compile and review N content in geologic materials to calculate a new N budget for Earth. Using analyses of rocks and minerals in conjunction with N-Ar geochemistry demonstrates that the Bulk Silicate Earth (BSE) contains \sim7\pm4 times present atmospheric N (4\times10^18 kg N, PAN), with 27\pm16\times10^18 kg N. Comparison to chondritic composition, after subtracting N sequestered into the core, yields a consistent result, with BSE N between 17\pm13\times10^18 kg to 31\pm24\times10^18 kg N. In the chondritic comparison we calculate a N mass in Earth's core (180\pm110 to 300\pm180\times10^18 kg) and discuss the Moon as a proxy for the early mantle.   Significantly, we find the majority of the planetary budget of N is in the solid Earth. The N estimate herein precludes the need for a "missing N" reservoir. Nitrogen-Ar systematics in mantle rocks and basalts identify two mantle reservoirs: MORB-source like (MSL) and high-N. High-N mantle is composed of young, N-rich material subducted from the surface and is identified in OIB and some xenoliths. In contrast, MSL appears to be made of old material, though a component of subducted material is evident in this reservoir as well.   Using our new budget, we calculate a {\delta}15N value for BSE plus atmosphere of \sim2\permil. This value should be used when discussing bulk Earth N isotope evolution. Additionally, our work indicates that all surface N could pass through the mantle over Earth history, and the mantle may act as a long-term sink for N. Since N acts as a tracer of exchange between the atmosphere, oceans, and mantle over time, clarifying its distribution in the Earth is critical for evolutionary models concerned with Earth system evolution. We suggest that N be viewed in the same vein as carbon: it has a fast, biologically mediated cycle which connects it to a slow, tectonically-controlled geologic cycle.

The generalized RPS game is a representative mathematical model to illustrate the game dynamics, appearing widely in textbook. However, how actual motions in these games depend on the incentive has never been reported quantitatively. Using the data from 7 games with different incentives, including 84 groups of 6 subjects playing the game in 300-round, with random-pair tournaments and local information recorded, we find that, both on social and individual level, the actual motions are changing continuously with the incentive. More expressively, some representative findings are, (1) in social collective strategy transit views, the forward transition vector field is more and more centripetal as the stability of the system increasing; (2) In the individual behavior of strategy transit view, there exists a phase transformation as the stability of the systems increasing, and the phase transformation point being near the standard RPS; (3) Conditional response behaviors are structurally changing accompanied by the controlled incentive. As a whole, the best response behavior increases and the win-stay lose-shift (WSLS) behavior declines with the incentive. Further, the outcome of win, tie, and lose influence the best response behavior and WSLS behavior. Both as the best response behavior, the win-stay behavior declines with the incentive while the lose-left-shift behavior increase with the incentive. And both as the WSLS behavior, the lose-left-shift behavior increase with the incentive, but the lose-right-shift behaviors declines with the incentive. We hope to learn which one in tens of learning models can interpret the empirical observation above.

In the case of extrasolar planets, the composition is important as it partly governs their potential habitability. Moreover, observational determination of chemical composition of planetary atmospheres are becoming available, especially for transiting planets. The present works aims at determining the chemical composition of planets formed in stellar systems of solar chemical composition. The main objective of this work is to provide valuable theoretical data for models of planet formation and evolution, and future interpretation of chemical composition of solar and extrasolar planets. We have developed a model that computes the composition of ices in planets in different stellar systems with the use of models of ice and planetary formation. We provide the chemical composition, ice/rock mass ratio and C:O molar ratio for planets in stellar systems of solar chemical composition. From an initial homogeneous composition of the nebula, we produce a wide variety of planetary chemical compositions as a function of the mass of the disk and distance to the star. The volatile species incorporated in planets are mainly composed of H2O, CO, CO2, CH3OH, and NH3. Icy or ocean planets have systematically higher values of molecular abundances compared to giant and rocky planets. Gas giant planets are depleted in highly volatile molecules such as CH4, CO, and N2 compared to icy or ocean planets. The ice/rock mass ratio in icy or ocean and gas giant planets is, respectively, equal at maximum to 1.01+-0.33 and 0.8+-0.5, and is different from the usual assumptions made in planet formation models, which suggested this ratio to be 2-3. The C:O molar ratio in the atmosphere of gas giant planets is depleted by at least 30% compared to solar value.

Further basic reactions include reproduction, decay and diffusion over a regular grid, without a hard constraint on the occupation number per site, so in a "bosonic" implementation. For special combinations of N and r and appropriate parameter choices we observe games within games, that is, different coexisting games, depending on the spatial resolution. As concrete and simplest example we analyze the (6,3) game. Once the players segregate from a random initial distribution, domains emerge, which effectively play a (2,1)-game on the coarse scale of domain diameters, while agents inside the domains play (3,1) (rock-paper-scissors), leading to spiral formation with species chasing each other. As the (2,1)-game has a winner in the end, the coexistence of domains is transient, while agents inside the remaining domain coexist, until demographic fluctuations lead to extinction of all but one species in the very end. This means that we observe a dynamical generation of multiple space and time scales with emerging re-organization of players upon segregation, starting from a simple set of rules on the smallest scale and changed rules from the coarser perspective. These observations are based on Gillespie simulations. We discuss the deterministic limit derived from a van Kampen expansion. The linear stability analysis predicts the number of forming domains, their composition in terms of species; it also explains the instability of interfaces between domains, which drives their extinction; spiral patterns are identified as motion along heteroclinic cycles. The numerical solutions reproduce the observed patterns of the Gillespie simulations including even extinction events, so that the mean-field analysis here is very conclusive, which is due to the specific implementation of rules.

Fischer|Francesco Vetere|Diego Perugini	  The mixing of magmas is a fundamental process in the Earth system causing extreme compositional variations in igneous rocks. This process can develop with different intensities both in space and time, making the interpretation of compositional patterns in igneous rocks a petrological challenge. As a time-dependent process, magma mixing has been suggested to preserve information about the time elapsed between the injection of a new magma into sub-volcanic magma chambers and eruptions. This allowed the use of magma mixing as an additional volcanological tool to infer the mixing-to-eruption timescales. In spite of the potential of magma mixing processes to provide information about the timing of volcanic eruptions its statistical robustness is not yet established. This represents a prerequisite to apply reliably this conceptual model. Here, new chaotic magma mixing experiments were performed at different times using natural melts. The degree of reproducibility of experimental results was tested repeating one experiment at the same starting conditions and comparing the compositional variability. We further tested the robustness of the statistical analysis by randomly removing from the analysed dataset a progressively increasing number of samples. Results highlight the robustness of the method to derive empirical relationships linking the efficiency of chemical exchanges and mixing time. These empirical relationships remain valid by removing up to 80% of the analytical determinations. Experimental results were applied to constrain the homogenization time of chemical heterogeneities in natural magmatic system during mixing. The calculations show that, when the mixing dynamics generate millimetre thick filaments, homogenization timescales of the order of a few minutes are to be expected.

ICAL being a magnetized detector is capable of identifying the charge of the particles, hence we can identify $\mu^{+}$ and $\mu^{-}$. A GEANT4 based code has been developed by the INO collaboration to simulate the ICAL geometry. In this work we have added the real topography of the hill to the detector (INO-ICAL) code and estimated the amount of energy that the muon will lose, while passing through the rock shield to reach the detector. The threshold energy of the muon for reaching the detector and momentum reconstruction from the INO peak is around 1600 GeV. A cosmic muon flux is generated at the top of the hill using CORSIKA(Cosmic ray generator) and then this flux is passed through the rock overburden to the detector. A detailed study of the muon charge ratio using CORSIKA and "pika" model is performed for INO. Highly energetic muons will enter the detector and give tracks in the detector, these tracks are reconstructed using Kalman Filter technique. Finally we have measured the energy and the number of $\mu^{+}$ and $\mu^{-}$ particles at the detector and compared our muon charge ratio results with the existing experimental data in the corresponding energy range. The estimated average muon charge ratio at ICAL detector is 1.3472$\pm $0.0194 and at the top of the hill it is 1.3575 for surface muons in the energy range 1.60-2.00TeV using CORSIKA. The same analysis is performed using "pika" model and the estimated average muon charge ratio using this model is found to be 1.4367$\pm$0.055, which is slightly higher than the muon charge ratio results estimated by available experimental data, whereas our CORSIKA results are in agreement with the experimental observations.

Armstrong|Oded Aharonson|Michael P. Lamb	  Unraveling the stratigraphic record is the key to understanding ancient climate and past climate changes on Mars. River deposits when placed in stratigraphic order could constrain the number, magnitudes, and durations of the wettest climates in Mars history. We establish the stratigraphic context of river deposits in Aeolis Dorsa sedimentary basin, 10E of Gale crater. Here, wind has exhumed a stratigraphic section of >=4 unconformity-bounded sedimentary rock packages, recording >=3 distinct episodes of surface runoff. Early deposits (>700m thick) are embayed by river deposits (>400m), which are in turn unconformably draped by fan-shaped deposits (<100m) which we interpret as alluvial fans. Yardang-forming deposits (>900 m) unconformably drape all previous deposits. River deposits embay a dissected sedimentary-rock landscape, and comprise >=2 distinguishable units. The total interval spanned by river deposits is >(1x10^6-2x10^7) yr; more if we include alluvial-fan deposits. Alluvial-fan deposits unconformably postdate thrust faults which crosscut river deposits. We infer a relatively dry interval of >4x10^7 yr after river deposits formed and before fan-shaped deposits formed. The time gap between the end of river deposition and the onset of yardang-forming deposits is constrained to >10^8 yr by the density of impact craters embedded at the unconformity. We correlate yardang-forming deposits to the upper layers of Gale crater's mound (Mt. Sharp/Aeolis Mons), and fan-shaped deposits to Peace Vallis fan. Alternations between periods of low vs. high mean obliquity may have modulated erosion-deposition cycling in Aeolis. This is consistent with results from an ensemble of simulations of Solar System orbital evolution and the resulting history of Mars obliquity. Almost all simulations yield intervals of continuously low mean Mars obliquity that are long enough to match our unconformity data.

Zioutas	  The C_{60} molecule exhibits a remarkable stability and inertness that leads to its survival in ancient carbonaceous rocks initially subject to the high temperatures requisite for its formation. Elementary particles having very high electronic stopping powers can similarly form C_{60} and higher fullerenes in their wake. Combined, these two features point at the possibility of using the C_{60} presence (or absence) in selected bulk geological samples as a new type of solid-state nuclear track detector, with applications in astro-particle physics.

Ambrosio	  High energy gamma ray astronomy is now a well established field and several sources have been discovered in the region from a few GeV up to several TeV. If sources involving hadronic processes exist, the production of photons would be accompanied by neutrinos too. Other possible neutrino sources could be related to the annihilation of WIMPs at the center of galaxies with black holes.   We present the results of a search for point-like sources using 1100 upward-going muons produced by neutrino interactions in the rock below and inside the MACRO detector in the underground Gran Sasso Laboratory. These data show no evidence for a possible neutrino point-like source or for possible correlations between gamma ray bursts and neutrinos. They have been used to set flux upper limits for candidate point-like sources which are in the range 10^-14-10^-15 cm-2 s-1.

Drobyshevski	  Strong strengthening of material under high confining pressure and jet nature of outflow from impact craters permit to show meteoroid impacts of >=10E6 Mt TNT equivalent are capable of ejecting rocks up to ~1 km in size from the Earth into space. That permits one to propose the terrestrial origin of some NEA's and SNC meteorites. It is shown the isotopic anomalies of nitrogen, argon and xenon can be related with terrestrial mantle samples. The same applies to the oxygen isotope shifts if one recalls the known manifestations of the kinetic effects of isotopic fractionation.

Chiang	  Beneath the fusion-encrusted surfaces of the most primitive stony meteorites lies not homogeneous rock, but a profusion of millimeter-sized igneous spheres. These chondrules, and their centimeter-sized counterparts, the calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions, comprise more than half of the volume fraction of chondritic meteorites. They are the oldest creations of the solar system. Their chemical composition matches that of the solar photosphere in all but the most volatile of elements, reflecting their condensation from the same pristine gas that formed the sun. In this invited editorial, we review the nebular shock wave model of Desch and Connolly (Meteoritics and Planetary Science 2002, 37, 183) that seeks to explain their origin. While the model succeeds in reproducing the unique petrological signatures of chondrules, the origin of the required shock waves in protoplanetary disks remains a mystery. Outstanding questions are summarized, with attention paid briefly to competing models.

Lee|G. -L. Lin	  We present a semi-analytic calculation of the tau-lepton flux emerging from the Earth, induced by the incident high energy neutrinos interacting inside the Earth for $10^{5} \leq E_{\nu}/{\rm GeV} \leq 10^{10}$. We obtain results for the energy dependence of the tau-lepton flux coming from the Earth-skimming neutrinos, because of the neutrino-nucleon charged-current scattering as well as the resonant $\bar{\nu}_e e^-$ scattering. We illustrate our results for several anticipated high energy astrophysical neutrino sources such as the AGNs, the GRBs, and the GZK neutrino fluxes. The tau lepton fluxes resulting from rock-skimming and ocean-skimming neutrinos are compared. Such comparisons can render useful information for the spectral indices of incident neutrino fluxes. 	
0310736v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0310736v1	2003	Status of the ANTARES Project	U. F. Katz|for the ANTARES Collaboration	  The ANTARES collaboration is constructing a neutrino telescope in the Mediterranean Sea at a depth of 2400 metres, about 40 kilometres off the French coast near Toulon. The detector will consist of 12 vertical strings anchored at the sea bottom, each supporting 25 triplets of optical modules equipped with photomultipliers, yielding sensitivity to neutrinos with energies above some 10 GeV. The effective detector area is roughly 0.1 square kilometres for neutrino energies exceeding 10 TeV. The measurement of the Cherenkov light emitted by muons produced in muon-neutrino charged-current interactions in water and under-sea rock will permit the reconstruction of the neutrino direction with an accuracy of better than 0.3 degrees at high energies. ANTARES will complement the field of view of neutrino telescopes at the South Pole in the low-background searches for point-sources of high-energy cosmic neutrinos and will also be sensitive to neutrinos produced by WIMP annihilation in the Sun or the Galactic centre. 	
0610775v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0610775v1	2006	Supersymmetry on the Rocks	Markus Ahlers	  In R-parity conserving supersymmetric (SUSY) models the lightest SUSY particle (LSP) is stable and a candidate for dark matter. Depending on the coupling and mass of this particle the life time of the next-to-lightest SUSY particle (NLSP) may be large compared to experimental time scales. In particular, if the NLSP is a charged particle and its decay length is of the order of the Earth's diameter Cherenkov telescopes might observe parallel muon-like tracks of NLSP pairs produced in neutrino-nucleon interactions in the Earth's interior. We have investigated two SUSY scenarios with a long-lived stau NLSP and a gravitino LSP in view of the observability at the IceCube detector.

Marvin Herndon	  The high occurrence on Earth of ordinary chondrite meteorites and the making of models based upon arbitrary assumptions has led to some confusion about the origin of ordinary chondrites. Major element fractionation among chondrites has been discussed for decades as ratios relative to Si or Mg. Expressing ratios relative to Fe leads to a new relationship admitting the possibility that ordinary chondrite meteorites are derived from two components: one is a relatively undifferentiated, primitive component, oxidized like the CI or C1 chondrites; the other is a somewhat differentiated, planetary component, with oxidation state like the reduced enstatite chondrites. Such a picture would seem to explain for the ordinary chondrites, their major element compositions, their intermediate states of oxidation, and their ubiquitous defiencies of refractory siderophile elements. I suggest that the planetary component of ordinary chondrite formation consists of planet Mercury's missing complement of elements, presumably separated from protoplanetary Mercury during its formation.

Al-Mushadani|B. M. Boghosian	  We develop our existing two-dimensional lattice-gas model to simulate the flow of single-phase, binary-immiscible and ternary-amphiphilic fluids. This involves the inclusion of fixed obstacles on the lattice, together with the inclusion of ``no-slip'' boundary conditions. Here we report on preliminary applications of this model to the flow of such fluids within model porous media. We also construct fluid invasion boundary conditions, and the effects of invading aqueous solutions of surfactant on oil-saturated rock during imbibition and drainage are described.

Weimann	  We report on recent experiments investigating the modification of the inter-band optical response of a piezoelectric semiconductor quantum well structure under the influence of intense short period surface acoustic waves. Experimentally, we study the photoluminescence (PL) of an undoped strained InGaAs/GaAs quantum well on which surface acoustic waves are propagated in the GHz regime. We observe a pronounced influence on the PL, both in intensity as well as in energetic position: Above a critical acoustic power density and corresponding lateral piezoelectric field strength, we observe a quenching of the excitons resulting in a strong decrease of the PL intensity. Using two transducers in a cavity resonator geometry, we can create a standing surface acoustic wave and hence control the nature and efficiency of the acoustic transport of the photoexcited electrons and holes.

Lim|Kan Chen	  We perform extended numerical simulation of the dynamics of dry friction, based on a model derived from the phenomenological description proposed by T. Baumberger et al.. In the case of small deviation from the steady sliding motion, the model is shown to be equivalent to the state- and rate-dependent friction law which was first introduced by Rice and Ruina on the basis of experiments on rocks. We obtain the dynamical phase diagram that agrees well with the experimental results on the paper-on-paper systems. In particular, the bifurcation between stick-slip and steady sliding are shown to change from a direct (supercritical) Hopf type to an inverted (subcritical) one as the driving velocity increases, in agreement with the experiments.

Weber	  Using spin density functional theory we have carried out a comparative study of chemical bonding and magnetism in Fe_4N, Fe_3N and Fe_2N. All of these compounds form close packed Fe lattices, while N occupies octahedral interstitial positions. High spin fcc Fe and hypothetical FeN with rock salt structure have been included in our study as reference systems. We find strong, covalent Fe-N bonds as a result of a substantial \sigma-type p-d hybridisation, with some charge transfer to N. Those Fe d orbitals which contribute to the p-d bonds, do no longer participate in the exchange splitting of the Fe d bands. Because of the large exchange fields, the majority spin d bands are always fully occupied, while the minority spin d bands are close to half-filling, thus optimizing the Fe d-d covalent bonding. As a consequence, in good approximation the individual Fe moments decrease in steps of 0.5 \mu_B from fcc iron (2.7 \mu_B) via Fe_4N (2.7 and 1.97 mu_B}), \chem{Fe_3N} (1.99 \mu_B) to \zeta - Fe_2N (1.43 \mu_B).

Jakob	  We prepared high epitaxial thin films of the compound Sr_2FeMoO_6 with narrow rocking curves by pulsed laser deposition. The diagonal and nondiagonal elements of the resistivity tensor were investigated at temperatures from 4 K up to room temperature in magnetic fields up to 8 T. An electronlike ordinary Hall effect and a holelike anomalous Hall contribution are observed. Both coefficients have reversed sign compared to the colossal magnetoresistive manganites. We found at 300 K an ordinary Hall coefficent of -1.87x10^{-10} m^3/As, corresponding to a nominal charge carrier density of four electrons per formula unit. At low temperature only a small negative magnetoresistance is observed which vanishes at higher temperatures. The temperature coefficient of the resistivity is negative over the whole temperature range. A Kondo like behavior is observed below 30 K while above 100 K variable range hopping like transport occurs.

Jakob	  By pulsed-laser deposition epitaxial thin films of Sr_2FeMoO_6 have been pre- pared on (100) SrTiO_3 substrates. Already for a deposition temperature of 320 C epitaxial growth is achieved. Depending on deposition parameters the films show metallic or semiconducting behavior. At high (low) deposition temperature the Fe,Mo sublattice has a rock-salt (random) structure. The metallic samples have a large negative magnetoresistance which peaks at the Curie temperature. The magnetic moment was determined to 4 mu_B per formula unit (f.u.), in agreement with the expected value for an ideal ferrimagnetic arrangement. We found an ordinary Hall coefficient of -6.01x10^{-10} m^3/As at 300 K, corresponding to an electronlike charge-carrier density of 1.3 per Fe,Mo-pair. In the semiconducting films the magnetic moment is reduced to 1 mu_B/f.u. due to disorder in the Fe,Mo sublattice. In low fields an anomalous holelike contribution dominates the Hall voltage, which vanishes at low temperatures for the metallic films only.

López|Julio A. Alonso	  An ab initio study of the doping of alkali halide crystals (AX: A = Li, Na, K, Rb; X = F, Cl, Br, I) by ns2 anions (Ag- and Cu-) is presented. Large active clusters with 179 ions embedded in the surrounding crystalline lattice are considered in order to describe properly the lattice relaxation induced by the introduction of substitutional impurities. In all the cases considered, the lattice distortions imply the concerted movement of several shells of neighbors. The shell displacements are smaller for the smaller anion Cu-, as expected. The study of the family of rock-salt alkali halides (excepting CsF) allows us to extract trends that might be useful at a predictive level in the study of other impurity systems. Those trends are presented and discussed in terms of simple geometric arguments.

In this system a Josephson vortex moves in a periodic asymmetric potential under the action of a deterministic or random force with zero time average. For some implementations the amplitude of the potential can be controlled during the experiment, thus, allowing to tune the performance of the system and build rocking as well as flashing ratchets. We present a model describing the dynamics of the fluxon in such a system, show numerical simulation results, and discuss the differences between conventional and Josephson vortex ratchets. The investigation of this system may lead to the development of the fluxon rectifier -- a device which produces a quantized dc voltage from colored noise (non-equilibrium fluctuations).

Jung|J. Y. Kim|Jae-Hyuk Choi|Sung-Ik Lee	  The infinite-layer compound ACuO$_{2}$ (A $=$ alkaline-earth ions) is regarded as the most suitable material for exploring the fundamental nature of the CuO$_2$ plane because it does not contain a charge-reservoir block, such as a rock-salt or a fluorite like block. We report that superconductivity in the infinite-layer compound Sr$_{0.9}$La$_{0.1}$CuO$_2$ is of a three-dimensional nature, in contrast to the quasi two-dimensional superconducting behavior of all other cuprates. The key observation is that the $c$-axis coherence length is longer than the $c$-axis lattice constant even at zero temperature. This means that the superconducting order parameter of one CuO$_{2}$ plane overlaps with those of neighboring CuO$_{2}$ planes all the temperatures below the $T_c$. Among all cuprates, only the infinite-layer superconductor shows such a feature.

T. Carrigan|H. Wang	  The global phase coherence in doubly-connected superconductors leads to fluxoid quantization, allowing the superfluid velocity vs to be controlled by an applied magnetic flux. In ultrasmall samples this quantization requirement leads, surprisingly, to the destruction of the phase coherence itself around half-integer flux quanta, because of the sample-size-induced growth in vs, as predicted by de Gennes. We report observations of the predicted phenomenon in ultrathin Al and Au0.7In0.3 cylinders, and the corresponding phase diagram for ultrathin superconducting cylinders. The new phase diagram features disconnected superconducting regions, as opposed to the single one seen in the conventional Little-Parks experiment.

Watanabe|A. Matsuda	  We investigated the in-plane anisotropy on the resistivity and thermopower of the Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_{8+\delta} (Bi-2212) and Bi-Sr-Co-O (BiCo) single crystals. In Bi-2212, the b-axis resistivity is higher than the a-axis resistivity, and is expressed as a sum of the a-axis resistivity and an additional residual resistivity. A downward deviation due to pseudogap is observed below a characteristic temperature T^*, which is isotropic in the form of conductivity. These results suggest that the modulation structure along the b-axis works as an anisotropic scattering center, but does not affect the pseudogap formation. On the other hand, the anisotropy of the resistivity and the thermopower in Pb-doped BiCo is substantial, probably owing to the misfit structure between the hexagonal CoO_2 layer and the rock salt Bi_2O_2 layer. However, the anisotropy in the resistivity in Pb-free BiCo is very small, suggesting that the in-plane anisotropy is averaged by the modulation structure, whose direction is tilted by 45 deg from the a- and b-axes.

The resistivity and thermopower show significantly large anisotropy, which exceeds two at maximum. This anisotropy would come from the anisotropic pseudogap formation enhanced by the misfit structure. The thermopower changes with Pb doping to take a maximum at x=0.4. The misfit structure improves the thermoelectric properties through chemical pressure. The power factor is as large as 9 muW/cmK2 at 100 K for x=0.6, which is the highest value for thermoelectric oxides at 100 K.

The crystals are large and free of sub-grains and foreign phases. The high crystal quality has been revealed by double-crystal x-ray rocking curves and Rutherford backscattering spectrometry combined with ion-beam channeling effect. We find that the evolutions of the superconducting transition width and volume fraction as a function of carrier concentration exhibit interesting anomalies in the vicinity of some magic number doping levels such as x =1/4^2 (=0.0625) and 1/3^2 (=0.111). We argue that these behaviours are of intrinsic electronic origin.

The latter can arise due to the surface tension of the membrane separating the fluids. We show that the frequency-dependent bulk modulus $\tilde{K}(\omega)$ for wave lengths longer than the characteristic structural dimensions of the fluid patches has a similar analytic behavior as in the case of a vanishing membrane stiffness and depends on the same parameters of the fluid-distribution topology. The effect of the capillary stiffness can be accounted by renormalizing the coefficients of the leading terms in the low-frequency asymptotic of $\tilde{K}(\omega)$.

The quality of the crystalline fibers was confirmed by Laue and EBSD (Electron Backscatter Diffraction) patterns. Rocking curves performed along the fiber axis revealed a half-height width of 0.073 degrees. The CMR behavior was confirmed by electrical resistivity and magnetization measurements as a function of temperature.

Subramanian	  Bulk samples of the pyrite chalcogenide solid solutions Co$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$S$_2$ 0 <= x <= 0.5, have been prepared and their crystal structures and magnetic properties studied by X-ray diffraction and SQUID magnetization measurements. Across the solution series, the distance between sulfur atoms in the persulfide (S$_2^{2-}$) unit remains nearly constant. First principles electronic structure calculations using experimental crystal structures as inputs point to the importance of this constant S-S distance, in helping antibonding S-S levels pin the Fermi energy. In contrast hypothetical rock-salt CoS is not a good half metal, despite being nearly isostructural and isoelectronic. We use our understanding of the Co$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$S$_2$ system to make some prescriptions for new ferromagnetic half-metals.

Regular step-like features in resistance vs. temperature curves taken at fixed flux values were observed near the QPT in ultrathin Al cylinders. It is proposed that these features are most likely resulted from a phase separation near the QPT in which normal regions nucleate in a homogeneous superconducting cylinder.

Wu	  With the aim of investigating the possible integration of opto-electronic devices, epitaxial GaN layers have been grown on Si(111) SOI and on Si/CoSi2/Si(111) using metalorganic chemical vapor deposition. The samples are found to possess a highly oriented wurtzite structure, a uniform thickness and abrupt interfaces. The epitaxial orientation is determined as GaN(0001)//Si(111), GaN[1120]//Si[110] and GaN[1010]//Si[112], and the GaN layer is tensily strained in the direction parallel to the interface. According to Rutherford backscattering/channeling spectrometry and (0002) rocking curves, the crystalline quality of GaN on Si(111) SOI is better than that of GaN on silicide. Room-temperature photoluminescence of GaN/SOI reveals a strong near-bandedge emission at 368 nm (3.37 eV) with an FWHM of 59 meV.

These are half-metallic ferromagnets and they have magnetic moments of 1 $\mu_{\rm B}$ per chemical formula unit. Out of the typical structures of binary compounds, the rock-salt structure is the most stable form for both CaN and SrN. The majority of the magnetic moment of these compound originates from the N sites since the $p$ states of N are spin-polarized. Their formation energies were calculated and the results show that it should be feasible to synthesize these materials. The structural stability of CaN was confirmed by performing first-principles molecular dynamics simulations. We propose a synthesis process for CaN basd on the first-principles.

In our simulations, we consider samples with different degrees of compaction and cementing materials with distinct elastic properties. The microstructure of cemented sands is taken into account while adding cement at specific locations within the pores, such as grain-to-grain contacts. Results show that acoustical properties of cemented sands are strongly dependent on the amount of cement, its relative stiffness with respect to the hosting medium, and its location within pores. Simulation results are in good correspondence available experimental data and compare favourably with some theoretical predictions for the sound velocity within a range of cement saturation, porosity and confining pressure.

Baskes|Seong-Gon Kim	  We developed new modified embedded-atom method (MEAM) interatomic potentials for the Mg-Al alloy system using a first-principles method based on density functional theory (DFT). The materials parameters, such as the cohesive energy, equilibrium atomic volume, and bulk modulus, were used to determine the MEAM parameters. Face-centered cubic, hexagonal close packed, and cubic rock salt structures were used as the reference structures for Al, Mg, and MgAl, respectively. The applicability of the new MEAM potentials to atomistic simulations for investigating Mg-Al alloys was demonstrated by performing simulations on Mg and Al atoms in a variety of geometries. The new MEAM potentials were used to calculate the adsorption energies of Al and Mg atoms on Al (111) and Mg (0001) surfaces. The formation energies and geometries of various point defects, such as vacancies, interstitial defects and substitutional defects, were also calculated. We found that the new MEAM potentials give a better overall agreement with DFT calculations and experiments when compared against the previously published MEAM potentials.

Llois	  The unusual and interesting physical properties of rare earth intemetallic compounds have their origin in the combination of strongly correlated 4f states and their hybridization with the conduction electron sea, which gives rise to their complex low temperature Kondo behavior. In particular, Ce compounds are very sensitive to the crystalline and chemical environment, as compared to other rare earth systems. The interaction of the 4f state with the conduction band plays an important role in the determination of the different magnetic, structural and transport properties of these systems. Among the cerium compounds, those of the type CeX, which crystallize in the rock salt structure, exhibit extremely unusual magnetic properties. By making use of the mixed LDA-NCA calculation technique we analyse the crystal-field splittings of CeX compounds (X=N, P, As, Sb, Bi). The obtained ab-initio hybridization functions are taken as imputs to calculate the crystal-field splittings within NCA (non crossing approximation) and the tendencies are contrasted with experiments. KEY WORDS: Highly correlated systems, crystal fields, p-electron.

Lischka	  Cubic GaN layers were grown by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy on 3C-SiC (001)substrates. In situ reflection high energy electron diffraction was used to quantitatively determine the Ga coverage of the GaN surface during growth. Using the intensity of the electron beam as a probe,optimum growth conditions of c-GaN were found when a 1 ML Ga coverage is formed at the surface. 1 micrometer thick c-GaN layers had a minimum surface roughness of 2.5 nm when a Ga coverage of 1 ML was established during growth. These samples revealed also a minimum full width at half maximum of the (002)rocking curve.

Hidden Markov Models have been used for a long time in pattern recognition, especially in speech recognition. Their main advantages over other methods (such as neural networks) are their ability to model noisy temporal signals of variable length. We show in this paper that this approach is well suited for interpretation of temporal sequences of mobile-robot sensor data. We present two distinct experiments and results: the first one in an indoor environment where a mobile robot learns to detect features like open doors or T-intersections, the second one in an outdoor environment where a different mobile robot has to identify situations like climbing a hill or crossing a rock. 	
9711002v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ex/9711002v1	1997	Initial Results from the CHOOZ Long Baseline Reactor Neutrino   Oscillation Experiment	 The CHOOZ collaboration	  Initial results are presented from CHOOZ, a long-baseline reactor-neutrino vacuum-oscillation experiment. Electron antineutrinos were detected by a liquid scintillation calorimeter located at a distance of about 1 km. The detector was constructed in a tunnel protected from cosmic rays by a 300 MWE rock overburden. This massive shielding strongly reduced potentially troublesome backgrounds due to cosmic-ray muons, leading to a background rate of about one event per day, more than an order of magnitude smaller than the observed neutrino signal. From the statistical agreement between detected and expected neutrino event rates, we find (at 90% confidence level) no evidence for neutrino oscillations in the electron antineutrino disappearance mode for the parameter region given approximately by deltam**2 > 0.9 10**(-3) eV**2 for maximum mixing and (sin(2 theta)**2) > 0.18 for large deltam**2.

Aglietta	  We present the analysis of the muon events with all muon multiplicities collected during 21804 hours of operation of the first LVD tower. The measured angular distribution of muon intensity has been converted to the `depth -- vertical intensity' relation in the depth range from 3 to 12 km w.e.. The analysis of this relation allowed to derive the power index, $\gamma$, of the primary all-nucleon spectrum: $\gamma=2.78 \pm 0.05$. The `depth -- vertical intensity' relation has been converted to standard rock and the comparison with the data of other experiments has been done. We present also the derived vertical muon spectrum at sea level.

Ambrosio et al	  An experimental study of the production of up-going charged particles in inelastic interactions of down-going underground muons is reported, using data obtained from the MACRO detector at the Gran Sasso Laboratory. In a sample of 12.2 10^6 single muons, corresponding to a detector livetime of 1.55 y, 243 events are observed having an up-going particle associated with a down-going muon. These events are analysed to determine the range and emission angle distributions of the up-going particle, corrected for detection and reconstruction efficiency. Measurements of the muon neutrino flux by underground detectors are often based on the observation of through-going and stopping muons produced in $\nu_\mu$ interactions in the rock below the detector. Up-going particles produced by an undetected down-going muon are a potential background source in these measurements. The implications of this background for neutrino studies using MACRO are discussed.

Different event topologies have been detected, due to neutrino interactions in the apparatus and in the rock below it. The upward-throughgoing muon sample is the larger one and is generated by neutrinos with an average energy of ~ 100 GeV. The observed upward-throughgoing muons are 26% fewer than expected and the zenith angle distribution does not fit with the expected one. Assuming neutrino oscillations, both measurements suggest maximum mixing and Dm2 of a few times 10-3 eV2. The other event categories due to interactions of low-energy neutrinos (average energy ~ 4 GeV) have been recently studied and the results of these new analyses are presented for the first time at this workshop. These data show a regular deficit of observed events in each angular bin, as expected assuming neutrino oscillations with maximum mixing, in agreement with the analysis of the upward-throughgoing muona sample.

We obtain results for the twist-3 reduced matrix elements d2p, d2d and d2n. The Burkhardt-Cottingham sum rule integral - int(g2(x)dx) is reported for the range 0.02 < x < 0.8.

MACRO's overburden varies from 3150 to 7000 hg/cm^2. A transition radiation detector (TRD) has been added to the MACRO detector in order to measure the residual energy of muons entering MACRO, i.e. the energy they have after passing through the Gran Sasso's rock overburden. The TRD consists of three identical modules with a total horizontal area of 36 m^2. The results presented here are referred to single and double events in MACRO with one muon crossing one of the TRD modules. Our data show that double muons are more energetic than single ones, as predicted by the interaction models of primary cosmic rays with the atmosphere.

Different event topologies have been detected, due to neutrino interactions in the apparatus and in the rock below it. The upward-throughgoing muon sample is the larger one and is generated by neutrinos with a peak energy of ~100 GeV. The observed upward-throughgoing muons are 26 % fewer than expected and the zenith angle distribution does not fit with the expected one. Assuming \mutau neutrino oscillation, the angular shape and the normalization factor suggest maximal mixing and \Delta m^2 of a few times 10^{-3} eV^2. Also the other event categories induced by low-energy neutrinos (peak energy ~ 4 GeV) show a deficit of observed events. The value of this deficit and its uniformity with respect to the angular bins are in agreement with the oscillation parameters suggested by the analysis of the upward-throughgoing muon sample.

Sioli|for the MACRO Collaboration	  Underground muon events detected by the MACRO experiment at Gran Sasso have been studied for different purposes. The studies include the vertical muon intensity measurement, multiplicity distribution, lateral and angular muon distribution and searches for substructures inside muon bundles. These analyses have contributed to bring new insights in cosmic ray physics, in particular in the framework of primary cosmic ray composition studies. Moreover, this activity allows the testing and tuning of Monte Carlo simulations, in particular for aspects associated with models of hadronic interactions and muon propagation through the rock.

Habig|for the Super-Kamiokande Collaboration	  A potential source of high energy neutrinos is the annihilation of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) collecting in gravitational potential wells such as the centers of the Earth, the Sun, or the Galaxy. A search for such a WIMP annihilation signal using the Super-Kamiokande (Super-K) detector is presented. Super-K observes 1.1 upward through-going muons per day. These events are caused by high energy (typical E_nu ~ 100 GeV) nu_mu interactions in the rock under the detector, and are generally consistent with the expected flux from atmospheric neutrinos. No enhancement of the neutrino signal due to WIMP annihilation is seen, so upper limits on the possible flux of WIMPS are set. These limits are compared to those from other such indirect searches, and a model-independent method is used to compare the Super-K results with direct-detection WIMP experiments.

We have measured the muon intensity at slant depths from 3 km w.e. to 20 km w.e. Most events are high energy downward muons produced by meson decay in the atmosphere. The analysis of these muons has revealed the power index of pion and kaon spectrum: 2.76 \pm 0.05. The reminders are horizontal muons produced by the neutrino interactions in the rock surrounding LVD. The value of this flux is obtained. The results are compared with Monte Carlo simulations and the world data.

Our measured g2 approximately follows the twist-2 Wandzura-Wilczek calculation. The twist-3 reduced matrix elements d2p and d2n are less than two standard deviations from zero. The data are inconsistent with the Burkhardt-Cottingham sum rule if there is no pathological behavior as x->0. The Efremov-Leader-Teryaev integral is consistent with zero within our measured kinematic range. The absolute value of A2 is significantly smaller than the sqrt[R(1+A1)/2] limit.

Tovey	  Simulations of the neutron background for future large-scale particle dark matter detectors are presented. Neutrons were generated in rock and detector elements via spontaneous fission and (alpha,n) reactions, and by cosmic-ray muons. The simulation techniques and results are discussed in the context of the expected sensitivity of a generic liquid xenon dark matter detector. Methods of neutron background suppression are investigated. A sensitivity of $10^{-9}-10^{-10}$ pb to WIMP-nucleon interactions can be achieved by a tonne-scale detector.

Allison	  Upward-going stopping muons initiated by atmospheric \numu and \anumu interactions in the rock below the Soudan 2 detector have been isolated, together with a companion sample of neutrino-induced single muons, created within the detector, which travel downwards and exit. The downward-going sample is consistent with the atmospheric-neutrino flux prediction, but the upward-going sample exhibits a sizeable depletion. Both are consistent with previously reported Soudan-2 neutrino-oscillation results. Inclusion of the two samples in an all-event likelihood analysis, using recent 3D-atmospheric-neutrino-flux calculations, reduces both the allowed oscillation parameter region and the probability of the no-oscillation hypothesis.

Vorob'ev	  Numerous and all unsuccessful attempts of experimental search for monopole in cosmic rays and on accelerators in high energy particle collisions have been done since the possibility of existence of a magnetic monopole has been surveyed in 1931. Also the searches have been carried out in mica for monopole tracks as well as for relict monopoles, entrapped by ferromagnetic inclusions in iron-ores, moon rock and meteorites.   A new method of search for supermassive cosmic and relict monopoles by magnetically ordered film is considered. This approach resembles the traditional method of nuclear emulsion chamber. Apparently the proposed method is particularly attractive for detection of relict monopoles, released from melting iron ore.

Seckel	  The photonuclear contribution to charged lepton energy loss has been re-evaluated taking into account HERA results on real and virtual photon interactions with nucleons. With large $Q^2$ processes incorporated, the average muon range in rock for muon energies of $10^9$ GeV is reduced by only 5% as compared with the standard treatment. We have calculated the tau energy loss for energies up to $10^9$ GeV taking into consideration the decay of the tau. A Monte Carlo evaluation of tau survival probability and range show that at energies below $10^7-10^8$ GeV, depending on the material, only tau decays are important. At higher energies the tau energy losses are significant, reducing the survival probability of the tau. We show that the average range for tau is shorter than its decay length and reduce to 17 km in water for an incident tau energy of $10^9$ GeV, as compared with its decay length of 49 km at that energy. In iron, the average tau range is 4.7 km for the same incident energy.

Spinetti	  In this paper, the possibility to exploit a high energy beta beam without massive detectors is discussed. The radioactive ions are boosted up to very high $\gamma$ with the neutrino beam pointing towards an instrumented surface located at a moderate baseline (e.g. from CERN to the Gran Sasso Laboratories). $\nu_e \to \nu_\mu$ oscillations and their CP conjugate are tagged as an excess of horizontal muons produced in the rock and tracked by the low-mass instrumented surface installed in one of the LNGS experimental halls. We show that the performance of this complex for what concerns the determination of the $\theta_{13}$ angle of the leptonic mixing matrix is comparable with the current low-$\gamma$ design based on a gigantic water Cherenkov at Frejus.

Uscinski	  Neutrino telescopes may have the potential to detect the quasi-stable staus predicted by supersymmetric models. Detection depends on stau electromagnetic energy loss and weak interactions. We present results for the weak interaction contribution to the energy loss of high energy staus as they pass through rock. We show that the neutral current weak interaction contribution to the energy loss increases with energy, but it is much smaller than the photonuclear energy loss, however, the charged current contribution may become the dominant process above the energy of $\sim 10^9$ GeV, depending on the parameters of the model. As a consequence, the stau range may be reduced above $\sim 10^9$ GeV as compared to the range neglecting weak interactions. We contrast this with the tau range which is barely changed with the inclusion of charged current interactions.

Background sources relevant to ton-scale liquid and gaseous argon detectors, such as neutrons from detector components, muon-induced neutrons and neutrons caused by radioactivity of rock, as well as the internal $^{39}Ar$ background, are studied with simulations. These background radiations are addressed with the design of an appropriate shielding as well as with different background rejection potentialities. Among them the project relies on event topology recognition, event localization, density ionization discrimination and pulse shape discrimination. Background rates, energy spectra, characteristics of the background-induced nuclear recoils in liquid argon, as well as the shielding performance and rejection performance of the detector are described.

The best previous upper bounds independent of the polynomial degrees were much larger, e.g., 248832 (for just the non-degenerate roots) via a famous general result of Khovanski. Our bound is sharp, allows real exponents, allows degeneracies, and extends to certain systems of n-variate fewnomials, giving improvements over earlier bounds by a factor exponential in the number of monomials. We also derive analogous sharpened bounds on the number of connected components of the real zero set of a single n-variate m-nomial.

M. Prostokishin	  The equation $$ \partial_tu=u\partial^2_{xx}u-(c-1)(\partial_xu)^2 $$ is known in literature as a qualitative mathematical model of some biological phenomena. Here this equation is derived as a model of the groundwater flow in a water absorbing fissurized porous rock, therefore we refer to this equation as a filtration-absorption equation. A family of self-similar solutions to this equation is constructed. Numerical investigation of the evolution of non-self-similar solutions to the Cauchy problems having compactly supported initial conditions is performed. Numerical experiments indicate that the self-similar solutions obtained represent intermediate asymptotics of a wider class of solutions when the influence of details of the initial conditions disappears but the solution is still far from the ultimate state: identical zero. An open problem caused by the nonuniqueness of the solution of the Cauchy problem is discussed.

Kramer	  The crumpling of a thin sheet can be understood as the condensation of elastic energy into a network of ridges which meet in vertices. Elastic energy condensation should occur in response to compressive strain in elastic objects of any dimension greater than 1. We study elastic energy condensation numerically in 2-dimensional elastic sheets embedded in spatial dimensions 3 or 4 and 3-dimensional elastic sheets embedded in spatial dimensions 4 and higher. We represent a sheet as a lattice of nodes with an appropriate energy functional to impart stretching and bending rigidity. Minimum energy configurations are found for several different sets of boundary conditions. We observe two distinct behaviors of local energy density fall-off away from singular points, which we identify as cone scaling or ridge scaling. Using this analysis we demonstrate that there are marked differences in the forms of energy condensation depending on the embedding dimension.

Holm	  The fractional diffusion-wave equation (FDWE) is a recent generalization of diffusion and wave equations via time and space fractional derivatives. The equation underlies Levy random walk and fractional Brownian motion and is foremost important in mathematical physics for such multidisciplinary applications as in finance, computational biology, acoustics, just to mention a few. Although the FDWE has been found to reflect anomalous energy dissipations, the physical significance of the equation has not been clearly explained in this regard. Here the attempt is made to interpret the FDWE via a new time-space fractional derivative wave equation which models forequency-dependent dissipations observed in such complex phenomena as acoustic wave propagating through human tissues, sediments, and rock layers. Meanwhile, we find a new bound (inequality (6) further below) on the orders of time and space derivatives of the FDWE, which indicates the so-called sub-diffusion process contradicts the real world frequency power law dissipation. This study also shows that the standard approach, albeit mathematically plausible, is phyiscally inappropriate to derive the normal diffusion equation from the damped wave equation, also known as the Telegrapher's equation.

Fixed a suitable threshold $\bar{A}$, we considered $N(A)$, the number of times that $A(t)>\bar{A}$, each of them we named event and $N(t)$, the distribution of times $t$ between two consecutive events. Some $N(A)$ and $N(t)$ distributions are displayed in the reported logarithmic plots, showing that jazz, pop, rock and other popular rhythms have noise-distribution, while classical pieces of music are characterized by more complex statistics. We pointed out the extraordinary case of the aria ``\textit{La calunnia \`{e} un venticello}'', where the words describe an avalanche or seismic process, calumny, and the rossinian music shows $N(A)$ and $N(t)$ distribution typical of earthquakes.

Crutchfield	  Starting with a group of reinforcement-learning agents we derive coupled replicator equations that describe the dynamics of collective learning in multiagent systems. We show that, although agents model their environment in a self-interested way without sharing knowledge, a game dynamics emerges naturally through environment-mediated interactions. An application to rock-scissors-paper game interactions shows that the collective learning dynamics exhibits a diversity of competitive and cooperative behaviors. These include quasiperiodicity, stable limit cycles, intermittency, and deterministic chaos--behaviors that should be expected in heterogeneous multiagent systems described by the general replicator equations we derive.

Starostin	  We consider the cosmic muon background for the installations located at shallow depths. We suggest a relatively simple formula for the sea-level muon spectrum, which allows calculate dependencies of the vertical muon intensity and integral muon flux density on overburden. Muon flux dependency on the zenith angle at overburden of 10 to 100 meters of standard rock shows that muon angular distribution practically does not change in this interval. We present muon angular distributions for three typical apparatus locations in measurements on the surface and at shallow depths. It is shown that for such installations the active shielding "umbrella" should overlap a zenith angle of \theta ~ 80^o to remove the cosmic muon background. 	
9507015v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/nucl-th/9507015v1	1995	Macroscopic-Microscopic Mass Models	J. Rayford Nix|Peter Moller	  We discuss recent developments in macroscopic-microscopic mass models, including the 1992 finite-range droplet model, the 1992 extended-Thomas-Fermi Strutinsky-integral model, and the 1994 Thomas-Fermi model, with particular emphasis on how well they extrapolate to new regions of nuclei. We also address what recent developments in macroscopic-microscopic mass models are teaching us about such physically relevant issues as the nuclear curvature energy, a new congruence energy arising from a greater-than-average overlap of neutron and proton wave functions, the nuclear incompressibility coefficient, and the Coulomb redistribution energy arising from a central density depression. We conclude with a brief discussion of the recently discovered rock of metastable superheavy nuclei near 272:110 that had been correctly predicted by macroscopic-microscopic models, along with a possible new tack for reaching an island near 290:110 beyond our present horizon.

Shikhin|V. E. Yants|O. S. Zaborskaya|A. A. Klimenko|S. B. Osetrov|A. A. Smolnikov|S. I. Vasiliev	  One of the main sources of a background in underground physics experiments (such as the investigation of solar neutrino flux, neutrino oscillations, neutrinoless double beta decay, and the search for annual and daily Cold Dark Matter particle flux modulation) are fast neutrons originating from the surrounding rocks. The measurements of fast neutron flux in the new DULB Laboratory situated at a depth of 4900 m w.e. in the Baksan Neutrino Observatory have been performed. The relative neutron shielding properties of several commonly available natural materials were investigated too. The preliminary results obtained with a high-sensitive fast neutron spectrometer at the level of sensitivity of about 10^(-7) neutron/ (cm^2 sec) are presented and discussed. 	
0201062v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0201062v1	2002	Cross Recurrence Plot Based Synchronization of Time Series	N. Marwan|M. Thiel|N. R. Nowaczyk	  The method of recurrence plots is extended to the cross recurrence plots (CRP), which among others enables the study of synchronization or time differences in two time series. This is emphasized in a distorted main diagonal in the cross recurrence plot, the line of synchronization (LOS). A non-parametrical fit of this LOS can be used to rescale the time axis of the two data series (whereby one of it is e.g. compressed or stretched) so that they are synchronized. An application of this method to geophysical sediment core data illustrates its suitability for real data. The rock magnetic data of two different sediment cores from the Makarov Basin can be adjusted to each other by using this method, so that they are comparable.

The particle is considered to move in a medium with periodic space dependent friction. By tuning the parameters of the system, the direction of current exhibit reversals, both as a function of temperature as well as the amplitude of rocking force. We found that the mutual interplay between the opposite driving factors is the necessary term for current reversals.

Zmeskal	  Narrow X-ray lines from helium-like argon emitted from a dedicated ECR source have been used to determine the response function of a Bragg crystal spectrometer equipped with large area spherically bent silicon (111) or quartz (10$\bar{1}$) crystals. The measured spectra are compared with simulated ones created by a ray-tracing code based on the expected theoretical crystal's rocking curve and the geometry of the experimental set-up.

Ausloos	  In this paper, we analyze web-downloaded data on people sharing their music library. By attributing to each music group usual music genres (Rock, Pop...), and analysing correlations between music groups of different genres with percolation-idea based methods, we probe the reality of these subdivisions and construct a music genre cartography, with a tree representation. We also show the diversity of music genres with Shannon entropy arguments, and discuss an alternative objective way to classify music, that is based on the complex structure of the groups audience. Finally, a link is drawn with the theory of hidden variables in complex networks.

The variable selection can be achieved by the increasing preference of variables. We show such a preference to has a unqiue form, which is given by the entropy of models associated with variables. Evaluating the entropy provides a complete ranking scheme of variables. This scheme not only indicates preferred variables but also may reveal the system's nature and properties. We illustrate the proposed scheme to analyze a set of geological data for three carbonate rock units in Texas and Oklahoma, and compare to the discriminant function analysis. The result suggests this scheme to provide a quick and robust analysis, and the use in data analysis is promising.

We used a synthetic aperture model (a self-affine model) that has been shown to be a realistic geometrical description of the fracture morphology. We developed a numerical modelling using a finite difference scheme of the hydrodynamic flow and its coupling with an advection/conduction description of the fluid heat. As a first step, temperature within the surrounding rock is supposed to be constant. Influence of the fracture roughness on the heat flux through the wall, is estimated and a thermalization length is shown to emerge. Implications for the Soultz-sous-For\^{e}ts geothermal project are discussed.

Price	  We report the discovery of methanogenic archaea that account for abrupt factor 10 increases in methane concentration found by E. Brook at depths of 2954 and 3036 m in the GISP2 (Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2) ice core. The total microbial concentration we measured with direct cell counts tracks the excesses of methanogens that we identified by their F420 fluorescence. The highly localized (<1 m thick) layers of methanogens suggest flow induced mixing of layers of microbe laden anaerobic basal ice with glacial ice. The metabolic rate we found for microbes at 2954 and 3036 m lies roughly on the Arrhenius line for microbes imprisoned in rock, sediment, and basal ice. Equating the loss rate of methane recently discovered in the Martian atmosphere to the production rate by possible methanogens, we estimate that their Martian habitat would be at a temperature of ~0 degrees C and that the concentration, if uniformly distributed in a 100 m thick layer, would be 0.04 cell per cubic centimeter.

Rivas|J. B. Goodenough	  Here we present experimental and computational evidences to support that rock-salt cubic VO is a strongly correlated metal with Non-Fermi-Liquid thermodynamics and an unusually strong spin-lattice coupling. An unexpected change of sign of metallic thermopower with composition is tentatively ascribed to the presence of a pseudogap in the density of states. These properties are discussed as signatures of the proximity to a magnetic quantum phase transition. The results are summarized in a new electronic phase diagram for the 3d monoxides, which resembles that of other strongly correlated systems. The structural and electronic simplicity of 3d monoxides make them ideal candidates to progress in the understanding of highly correlated electron systems.

Abdallah	  The DELPHI detector at LEP has been used to measure multi-muon bundles originating from cosmic ray interactions with air. The cosmic events were recorded in ``parasitic mode'' between individual e+e- interactions and the total live time of this data taking is equivalent to 1.6x10^6 seconds. The DELPHI apparatus is located about 100 metres underground and the 84 metres rock overburden imposes a cut-off of about 52 GeV/c on muon momenta. The data from the large volume Hadron Calorimeter allowed the muon multiplicity of 54201 events to be reconstructed. The resulting muon multiplicity distribution is compared with the prediction of the Monte Carlo simulation based on CORSIKA/QGSJET01. The model fails to describe the abundance of high multiplicity events. The impact of QGSJET internal parameters on the results is also studied.

Thebault	  The inner Solar System contains a cloud of small (1-100 micron) dust grains created when small bodies-asteroids, comets, and Kuiper belt objects-collide and outgas. This dust cloud, the zodiacal cloud probably has extrasolar analogs, exozodiacal clouds. Exozodiacal clouds are related to debris disks, clouds of rocks and dust orbiting main sequence stars thought to represent the debris left over from planet formation. Some debris disks appear to contain distinct inner clouds that could be considered massive exozodiacal clouds (e.g. Koerner et al. 1998, Absil et al. 2006). This white paper addresses the need for future theoretical work on the dynamics of exozodiacal clouds. This theoretical work should help us discover new planets and understand exozodiacal clouds as astrophysical noise. So far, observations of nearby stars have not provided good constraints on the structures of exozodiacal clouds. But future observations probably will demand a better theoretical understanding of these systems.

The goal of the research which we propose is the improvement of the comprehension of the effects of structure soil and litter. The effects of the litter and heterogeneities of the ground are probably important but still are very ignored. So we developed an experimental approach in laboratory and in situ. That makes it possible to take measurements for various configurations (frequency, temporal, polarization, incidence, Bi-statics, Brewster effect...) and in term of surface conditions(homogeneous or heterogeneous ground, more or less wet, presence of litter...). Measurements at the laboratory with waveguide enabled us to characterize the various components of the geological structure (ground, rocks) and to check the model of Dobson usually used.

Moallemi|Tsachy Weissman|Benjamin Van Roy	  We consider an agent interacting with an unmodeled environment. At each time, the agent makes an observation, takes an action, and incurs a cost. Its actions can influence future observations and costs. The goal is to minimize the long-term average cost. We propose a novel algorithm, known as the active LZ algorithm, for optimal control based on ideas from the Lempel-Ziv scheme for universal data compression and prediction. We establish that, under the active LZ algorithm, if there exists an integer $K$ such that the future is conditionally independent of the past given a window of $K$ consecutive actions and observations, then the average cost converges to the optimum. Experimental results involving the game of Rock-Paper-Scissors illustrate merits of the algorithm.

Tosi	  The detection of cosmic neutrinos with energies above 1017 eV got growing interest during recent years. Possible target materials for in-matter arrays of ~100 km3 size under discussion are water, ice and rock salt. Here we propose to investigate permafrost as an additional alternative, covering ~20% of Earth land surface and reaching down to more than 1000 m depth at certain locations. If sufficiently large attenuation lengths for radio and acoustic signals can be demonstrated by in-situ measurements, the construction of a large hybrid array within this material may be possible in the Northern hemisphere. Properties and problems of a possible location in Siberia are discussed below. Some acoustic data are compared to laboratory measurements using "artificial" permafrost.

We show that a power law acceleration of seismicity rate and energy in both 40 Hz-1.5 kHz and 2 Hz-10kHz frequency range, is defined on 3 order of magnitude, within 2 hours from the collapse time. Simultaneously, the average size of the seismic events increases toward the time to failure. These in-situ results are derived from the only station located within one rupture length distance from the rock fall rupture plane. They mimic the "critical point" like behavior recovered from physical and numerical experiments before brittle failures and tertiary creep failures. Our analysis of this first seismic monitoring data of a cliff collapse suggests that the thermodynamic phase transition models for failure may apply for cliff collapse.

Benjamin|Dan McCammon|Lindsay Rocks|John S. Gallagher, III	  We apply a wind model, driven by combined cosmic-ray and thermal-gas pressure, to the Milky Way, and show that the observed Galactic diffuse soft X-ray emission can be better explained by a wind than by previous static gas models. We find that cosmic-ray pressure is essential to driving the observed wind. Having thus defined a "best-fit" model for a Galactic wind, we explore variations in the base parameters and show how the wind's properties vary with changes in gas pressure, cosmic-ray pressure and density. We demonstrate the importance of cosmic rays in launching winds, and the effect cosmic rays have on wind dynamics. In addition, this model adds support to the hypothesis of Breitschwerdt and collaborators that such a wind may help explain the relatively small gradient observed in gamma-ray emission as a function of galactocentric radius.

The experiments are conducted using a flow through reactor, thereby allowing the dissolution reactions to occur at a fixed pH and at constant, but variable saturation states. Preliminary results indicate that at far-from-equilibrium conditions, the dissolution kinetics of albite are defined by a rate plateau, with R \approx 5.0 x 10^{-10} mol m^{-2} s^{-1} at -70 < \Delta G < -40 kJ mol^{-1}. At \Delta G > -40 kJ mol^{-1}, the rates decrease sharply, revealing a strong inverse relation between the dissolution rate and free energy. Based on the experiments carried out to date, the dissolution rate-free energy data correspond to a highly non-linear and sigmoidal relation, in accord with recent studies.

Despite many studies, their genesis is still debated, particularly the time scales of their formation and the relationship between this time and their morphology. We developed a new discrete simulation technique to explore the dynamic growth of the stylolite roughness, starting from an initially flat dissolution surface. We demonstrate that the typical steep stylolite teeth geometry can accurately be modelled and reproduce natural patterns. The growth of the roughness takes place in two successive time regimes: i) an initial non-linear increase in roughness amplitude that follows a power-law in time up to ii) a critical time where the roughness amplitude saturates and stays constant. 	
0801.1020v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/0801.1020v2	2008	Magnetism of CoO polymorphs	Thomas Archer|Ruairi Hanafin|Stefano Sanvito	  A microscopic explanation for the room temperature ferromagnetism in diluted ZnO:Co is at present rather elusive. Although standard secondary phases can usually be ruled out, it is less clear whether regions with high Co concentration coexist with undoped portions of the film, i.e. whether some form of CoO polymorph can be responsible for the magnetic signal. Since X-ray usually excludes the presence of the native rock-salt phase, the study of CoO polymorphs becomes particularly interesting. In this work we investigate theoretically the magnetism of CoO in both the wurtzite and zincblende phases. By using a combination of density functional theory with the LDA+$U$ approximation and Monte Carlo simulations we demonstrate that wurtzite and zincblende CoO have a complex frustrated anti-ferromagnetic ground state with no net magnetic moment in the bulk. Most importantly the estimated critical temperatures are well below room temperature for both cases. This suggests that bulk CoO polymorphs are not responsible for the room temperature magnetism observed for ZnO:Co, although the role of clusters with uncompensated spins or arranged in a spinodal decomposed structure still remains an open question.

The factors responsible for formation of solitons induced by a moving ship are analyzed. Emphasis is given to a phenomenon observed by John Scott Russell more 170 years ago when a sudden stop of a boat preceded the occurrence of exotic water dome. In dramatic changes of polemic about the stability and mathematical description of a solitary wave, the question why "Russell's wave" occurred has not been raised, though attempts its recreation invariably suffered failure. In our report the conditions disclosing the principle of the famous event as a critical phenomenon are described. In a reservoir of uniform depth a ship can confront by a dynamic barrier within narrow limits of ship's speed and acceleration. In a wider interval of parameters a ship generates a satellite wave, which can be transformed in a different-locking soliton. These phenomena can be classified into an extensive category of dynamic barrier effects including the transition of aircrafts through the sound barrier.

Onose|Y. Tokura	  Correlation between dielectric and magnetic properties was investigated on the triangular lattice antiferromagnets ACrO2 (A= Cu, Ag, Li, or Na) showing 120-degree spiral spin structure with easy-axis anisotropy. For the A= Cu and Ag compounds with delafossite structure, ferroelectric polarization emerges upon the spiral spin order, implying the strong coupling between the ferroelectricity and spiral spin structure. On the other hand, for the A = Li and Na compounds with ordered rock salt structure, no polarization but only clear anomalies in dielectric constant can be observed upon the spiral spin order. The absence of polarization can be interpreted as the antiferroelectric state induced by the alternate stacking of Cr3+ layer with opposite spin vector chirality. These results imply that a vast range of trigonally stacked triangular-lattice systems with 120-degree spin structure can be multiferroic, irrespective of their magnetic anisotropy.

Balancing of crisp granules and sub- fuzzy granules, within non fuzzy information (initial granulation), is rendered in open-close iteration. Using two criteria, "simplicity of rules "and "suitable adaptive threshold error level", stability of algorithm is guaranteed. In other part of paper, rough set theory (RST), to approximate analysis, has been employed >.Validation of the proposed methods, on the large data set of in-situ permeability in rock masses, in the Shivashan dam, Iran, has been highlighted.

Schimansky-Geier|P. Hänggi	  The nonintegrable Hamiltonian dynamics of particles placed in a symmetric, spatially periodic potential and subjected to a periodically varying field is explored. Such systems can exhibit a rich diversity of unusual transport features. In particular, depending on the setting of the initial phase of the drive, the possibility of a giant transient directed transport in a symmetric, space-periodic potential when driven with an adiabatically varying field arises. Here, we study the escape scenario and corresponding mean escape times of particles from a trapping region with the subsequent generation of a transient directed flow of an ensemble of particles. It is shown that for adiabatically slow inclination modulations the unidirectional flow proceeds over giant distances. The direction of escape and, hence, of the flow is entirely governed whether the periodic force, modulating the inclination of the potential, starts out initially positive or negative. In the phase space, this transient directed flow is associated with a long-lasting motion taking place within ballistic channels contained in the non-uniform chaotic layer. We demonstrate that for adiabatic modulations all escaping particles move ballistically into the same direction, leading to a giant directed current.

Thomson|Waldemar Ogloza|Krysztof Kaminski|Piotr Ligeza	  Radial-velocity measurements and sine-curve fits to the orbital radial velocity variations are presented for ten close binary systems: EG Cep,V1191 Cyg, V1003 Her, BD+7_3142, V357 Peg, V407 Peg, V1123 Tau, V1128 Tau, HH UMa, and PY Vir. While most of the studied eclipsing systems are contact binaries, EG Cep is a detached or a semi-detached double-lined binary and V1003 Her is a close binary of an uncertain type seen at a very low inclination angle. We discovered two previously unknown triple systems, BD+7_3142 and PY Vir, both with late spectral-type (K2V) binaries. Of interest is the low-mass ratio (q = 0.106) close binary V1191 Cyg showing an extremely fast period increase; the system has a very short period for its spectral type and shows a W-type light curve, a feature rather unexpected for such a low mass-ratio system.

Seigar	  In this paper we derive a possible mass profile for the low surface brightness galaxy, Malin 1, based upon previously published space-based and ground-based photometric properties and kinematics. We use properties of the bulge, normal disk, outer extended disk and \ion{H}{1} mass as inputs into mass profile models. We find that the dark matter halo model of Malin 1 is best described by a halo profile that has undergone adiabatic contraction, inconsistent with the findings for most disk galaxies to date, yet consistent with rotation curve studies of M31. More importantly, we find that Malin 1 is baryon dominated in its central regions out to a radius of $\sim10$ kpc (in the bulge region). Low-surface brightness galaxies are often referred to as being dark matter dominated at all radii. If this is the case, then Malin 1 would seem to have characteristics similar to those of normal barred disk galaxies, as suggested by other recent work. We also find that Malin 1 also falls on the rotation curve shear versus spiral arm pitch angle relation for normal galaxies, although more LSB galaxies need to be studied to determine if this is typical.

K. Kremer|R. Lauck|G. Siegle|J. Serrano|X. C. Gonze	  During the past five years the low temperature heat capacity of simple semiconductors and insulators has received renewed attention. Of particular interest has been its dependence on isotopic masses and the effect of spin- orbit coupling in ab initio calculations. Here we concentrate on the lead chalcogenides PbS, PbSe and PbTe. These materials, with rock salt structure, have different natural isotopes for both cations and anions, a fact that allows a systematic experimental and theoretical study of isotopic effects e.g. on the specific heat. Also, the large spin-orbit splitting of the 6p electrons of Pb and the 5p of Te allows, using a computer code which includes spin-orbit interaction, an investigation of the effect of this interaction on the phonon dispersion relations and the temperature dependence of the specific heat and on the lattice parameter. It is shown that agreement between measurements and calculations significantly improves when spin-orbit interaction is included.

Halpern|Rafael Pass	  We develop a general game-theoretic framework for reasoning about strategic agents performing possibly costly computation. In this framework, many traditional game-theoretic results (such as the existence of a Nash equilibrium) no longer hold. Nevertheless, we can use the framework to provide psychologically appealing explanations to observed behavior in well-studied games (such as finitely repeated prisoner's dilemma and rock-paper-scissors). Furthermore, we provide natural conditions on games sufficient to guarantee that equilibria exist. As an application of this framework, we consider a notion of game-theoretic implementation of mediators in computational games. We show that a special case of this notion is equivalent to a variant of the traditional cryptographic definition of protocol security; this result shows that, when taking computation into account, the two approaches used for dealing with "deviating" players in two different communities -- Nash equilibrium in game theory and zero-knowledge "simulation" in cryptography -- are intimately related.

Rabe|David Vanderbilt	  The ideal intrinsic barriers to domain switching in c-phase PbTiO_3 (PTO), PbZrO_3 (PZO), and PbZr_{1-x}Ti_xO_3 (PZT) are investigated via first-principles computational methods. The effects of epitaxial strain on the atomic structure, ferroelectric response, barrier to coherent domain reversal, domain-wall energy, and barrier to domain-wall translation are studied. It is found that PTO has a larger polarization, but smaller energy barrier to domain reversal, than PZO. Consequentially the idealized coercive field is over two times smaller in PTO than PZO. The Ti--O bond length is more sensitive to strain than the other bonds in the crystals. This results in the polarization and domain-wall energy in PTO having greater sensitivity to strain than in PZO. Two ordered phases of PZT are considered, the rock-salt structure and a (100) PTO/PZO superlattice. In these simple structures we find that the ferroelectric properties do not obey Vergard's law, but instead can be approximated as an average over individual 5-atom unit cells.

Porter	  We calculate the gamma-ray albedo due to cosmic-ray interactions with debris (small rocks, dust, and grains) in the Oort Cloud. We show that under reasonable assumptions a significant proportion of what is called the "extragalactic gamma-ray background" could be produced at the outer frontier of the solar system and may be detectable by the Large Area Telescope, the primary instrument on the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope. If detected it could provide unique direct information about the total column density of material in the Oort Cloud that is difficult to access by any other method. The same gamma ray production process takes place in other populations of small solar system bodies such as Main Belt asteroids, Jovian and Neptunian Trojans, and Kuiper Belt objects. Their detection can be used to constrain the total mass of debris in these systems.

For $k>3\times10^{14}$ eV, $\Delta k$ is small enough that the interaction cannot be localized to a single nucleus. At still higher energies, photons may coherently scatter elastically from bulk matter and emerge as a $\rho^0$, in a manner akin to kaon regeneration. Constructive interference from the different nuclei coherently raises the cross section and the interaction probability rises linearly with energy. At energies above $10^{23}$ eV, coherent conversion is the dominant process; photons interact predominantly as $\rho^0$. We compute the coherent scattering probabilities in slabs of lead, water and rock, and discuss the implications of the increased hadronic interaction probabilities for photons on ultra-high energy shower development.

In order to obtain LSCO single crystals of high quality, we have made much effort to optimize the preparation procedures. For example, we have adopted sol-gel route to prepare highly fine and homogeneous LSCO precursor powder, and used quite slow growth rate. The sizable grown crystal ingots are typically about 6.6 mm in diameter and 100 mm in length, and no impurity phases were detected. The high quality of grown crystals has been verified by double-crystal x-ray rocking curves, with full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) being only 113 ~ 150 arcseconds (or 0.03 deg - 0.04 deg), which are the best data reported so far for LSCO crystals. The superconducting critical temperatures (TC's) of the cuprate crystals are 30 K for x = 0.11, 31 K for x = 0.12 and 38.5 K for x = 0.16 samples according to magnetic measurements.

Evgin	  A complex network approach is proposed to study the shear behavior of a rough rock joint. Similarities between aperture profiles are established and a general network in two directions (in parallel and perpendicular to the shear direction) is constructed. Evaluation of this newly formed network shows that the degree distribution of the network, after a transition stage falls into a quasi stable state which is roughly obeying a Gaussian distribution. In addition, the growth of the clustering coefficient and the number of edges are approximately scaled with the development of shear strength and hydraulic conductivity, which can be utilized to estimate, shear distribution over asperities. Furthermore, we characterize the contact profiles using the same approach. Despite the former case, the later networks are following a growing network mode.

Sinitsyna	  The SHALON Cherenkov telescope has recorded over 2x10^6 extensive air showers during the past 17 years. The analysis of the signal at different zenith angles (\theta) has included observations from the sub-horizontal direction \theta=97^o. This inclination defines an Earth skimming trajectory with 7 km of air and around 1000 km of rock in front of the telescope. During a period of 324 hours of observation, after a cut of shower-like events that may be caused by chaotic sky flashes or reflections on the snow of vertical showers, we have detected 5 air showers of TeV energies. We argue that these events may be caused by the decay of a long-lived penetrating particle entering the atmosphere from the ground and decaying in front of the telescope. We show that this particle can not be a muon or a tau lepton. As a possible explanation, we discuss two scenarios with an unstable neutrino of mass m\approx 0.5 GeV and c\tau\approx 30 m. Remarkably, one of these models has been recently proposed to explain an excess of electron-like neutrino events at MiniBooNE.

Van Elewyck	  The detection of Earth-skimming tau neutrinos has turned into a very promising strategy for the observation of UHE cosmic neutrinos. The sensitivity of this channel crucially depends on the parameters of the propagation of the tau neutrino (and the tau lepton) through the terrestrial crust, which governs the flux of emerging tau leptons that can be detected. This propagation problem is usually treated in a simplified framework where several effects are neglected, e.g. the possibility of multiple regenerations of the tau neutrino, the weak interactions of the tau lepton, as well as the stochastic nature of its energy losses. We discuss here the validity of such approximations by studying the propagation in standard rock of tau leptons and neutrinos with both mono-energetic and power-law spectra. We also investigate the impact of such simplifications in non-standard scenarios for the neutrino-nucleon interactions as well as for the tau energy losses.

Henk|M. Daene|M. Lueders|P. Bruno|W. Hergert|I. Mertig|Z. Szotek|W. M. Temmerman	  The structural phase transitions and the fundamental band gaps of Mg(x)Zn(1-x)O alloys are investigated by detailed first-principles calculations in the entire range of Mg concentrations x, applying a multiple-scattering theoretical approach (Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker method). Disordered alloys are treated within the coherent potential approximation (CPA). The calculations for various crystal phases have given rise to a phase diagram in good agreement with experiments and other theoretical approaches. The phase transition from the wurtzite to the rock-salt structure is predicted at the Mg concentration of x = 0.33, which is close to the experimental value of 0.33 - 0.40. The size of the fundamental band gap, typically underestimated by the local density approximation, is considerably improved by the self-interaction correction. The increase of the gap upon alloying ZnO with Mg corroborates experimental trends. Our findings are relevant for applications in optical, electrical, and in particular in magnetoelectric devices.

Roy	  In this article, we correlate the internal stress and the characteristics of a vibrational mode in wet foam. Using microscope images, we estimate the average size of the bubbles in wet foam, at specific time intervals, over a duration of twenty four hours. Raman spectra are also recorded at the same time intervals, over the same time frame. We show that the internal stress, originated from the macroscopic structural change of foam with ageing, can be related to the observed Raman shift of the low frequency methylene rocking mode of the constituent surfactant molecules in foam. In this report we also show the capability of the Raman spectroscopy to reveal the crystallinity in foamy materials, when studied for a longer period of time.

Goodman	  The MINOS experiment has observed a rise in the underground muon charge ratio $r_\mu$ = ${\mu^+/\mu^-}$. This ratio can be related to the atmospheric production ratios of ${\pi^+/\pi^-}$ and ${K^+/K^-}$. Our analysis indicates that the relevant variable for studying the charge ratio+ $\ecos$, rather than $\emu$. We compare a simple energy dependent parameterization of the rise in the charge ratio with more detailed previously published Monte Carlo simulations and an analytical calculation. We also estimate the size of two previously neglected effects in this context: the charge sign dependency of the dE/dx in rock, and the energy dependence of heavy primaries on the derived ${K^+/K^-}$ ratio.

We consider model-independent direct neutrino production and secondary neutrino production from the decay of taus produced in the annihilation of dark matter. We illustrate how muon energy distribution from dark matter annihilation has a very different shape than muon flux from atmospheric neutrinos. We consider both the upward muon flux, when muons are created in the rock below the detector, and the contained flux when muons are created in the (ice) detector. We contrast our results to the ones previously obtained in the literature, illustrating the importance of properly treating muon propagation and energy loss. We comment on neutrino flavor dependence and their detection.

Bustamante	  We study the dynamics of a spherical rigid body that rocks and rolls on a plane under the effect of gravity. The distribution of mass is non-uniform and the centre of mass does not coincide with the geometric centre.   The symmetric case, with moments of inertia I_1=I_2, is integrable and the motion is completely regular. Three known conservation laws are the total energy E, Jellett's quantity Q_J and Routh's quantity Q_R.   When the inertial symmetry I_1=I_2 is broken, even slightly, the character of the solutions is profoundly changed and new types of motion become possible. We derive the equations governing the general motion and present analytical and numerical evidence of the recession, or reversal of precession, that has been observed in physical experiments.   We present an analysis of recession in terms of critical lines dividing the (Q_R,Q_J) plane into four dynamically disjoint zones. We prove that recession implies the lack of conservation of Jellett's and Routh's quantities, by identifying individual reversals as crossings of the orbit (Q_R(t),Q_J(t)) through the critical lines. Consequently, a method is found to produce a large number of initial conditions so that the system will exhibit recession.

Norgren	  Linear acoustic wave-splitting is an often used tool in describing sound-wave propagation through earth's subsurface. Earth's subsurface is in general anisotropic due to the presence of water-filled porous rocks. Due to the complexity and the implicitness of the wave-splitting solutions in anisotropic media, wave-splitting in seismic experiments is often modeled as isotropic. With the present paper, we have derived a simple wave-splitting procedure for an instantaneously reacting anisotropic media that includes spatial variation in depth, yielding both a traditional (approximate) and a `true amplitude' wave-field decomposition. One of the main advantages of the method presented here is that it gives an explicit asymptotic representation of the linear acoustic-admittance operator to all orders of smoothness for the smooth, positive definite anisotropic material parameters considered here. Once the admittance operator is known we obtain an explicit asymptotic wave-splitting solution.

Hardy|D. A. Bonn	  Highly-perfect platelet single crystals of Tl_2Ba_2CuO_{6+d} (Tl-2201) were grown by a self-flux technique. A novel encapsulation scheme allowed the precursors to react prior to the sealing required to contain volatile thallium oxides, and permitted the removal of melt at the conclusion of growth, reproducibly producing high yields of clean crystals. The crystals were annealed under well-controlled oxygen partial pressures, then characterised. They have sharp superconducting transitions, narrow X-ray rocking curves and a low 4% substitution of thallium by copper, all evidence of their high perfection and homogeneity. The crystals are orthorhombic at most dopings, and a previously unreported commensurate superlattice distortion is observed.

Levison	  The habitability of planets is strongly affected by impacts from comets and asteroids. Indications from the ages of Moon rocks suggest that the inner Solar System experienced an increased rate of impacts roughly 3.8 Gya known as the Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB). Here we develop a model of how the Solar System would have appeared to a distant observer during its history based on the Nice model of Gomes et al. (2005). We compare our results with observed debris discs. We show that the Solar System would have been amongst the brightest of these systems before the LHB. Comparison with the statistics of debris disc evolution shows that such heavy bombardment events must be rare occurring around less than 12% of Sun-like stars.

Munoz|A. H. Romero|A. Schindler	  We have measured the specific heat of zincblende ZnS for several isotopic compositions and over a broad temperature range (3 to 1100 K). We have compared these results with calculations based on ab initio electronic band structures, performed using both LDA and GGA exchange- correlation functionals. We have compared the lattice dynamics obtained in this manner with experimental data and have calculated the one-phonon and two-phonon densities of states. We have also calculated mode Grueneisen parameters at a number of high symmetry points of the Brillouin zone. The electronic part of our calculations has been used to investigate the effect of the 3d core electrons of zinc on the spin-orbit splitting of the top valence bands. The effect of these core electrons on the band structure of the rock salt modification of ZnS is also discussed.

Gray	  Measuring external sources of background for a deep underground laboratory at the Homestake Mine is an important step for the planned low-background experiments. The naturally occurring $\gamma$-ray fluxes at different levels in the Homestake Mine are studied using NaI detectors and Monte Carlo simulations. A simple algorithm is developed to convert the measured $\gamma$-ray rates into $\gamma$-ray fluxes. A good agreement between the measured and simulated $\gamma$-ray fluxes is achieved with the knowledge of the chemical composition and radioactivity levels in the rock. The neutron fluxes and $\gamma$-ray fluxes are predicted by Monte Carlo simulations for different levels including inaccessible levels that are under construction for the planned low background experiments.

By considering different noisy quantum channels we analyze that how a two-player, three-strategy Rock-Scissor-Paper game is influenced by the quantum noise. We consider the winning non-transitive strategies R, S and P such as R beats S, S beats P, and P beats R. The game behaves as a noiseless game for maximum value of the quantum noise parameter. It is seen that Alice's payoff is heavily influenced by the depolarizing noise as compared to the amplitude damping noise. Depolarizing channel causes a monotonic decrease in players payoffs as we increase the amount of of quantum noise. In case of amplitude damping channel, the Alice's payoff function reaches its minimum for alpha=0.5 and is symmetrical. This means that larger values of quantum noise influence the game weakly. On the other hand, phase damping channel does not influence the game's payoff. Furthermore, the game's Nash equilibrium and non-transitive character of the game are not affected under the influence of quantum noise.

Ghaffari|Mamadou Fall	  In this study, over different scenarios we will simulate a week coupling of hydromechanical loads in a long term CO2 injection with a hypothetical reservoir while the effect of pore water pressure and then multi-phase flow procedure has been ignored. In the first basic case the homogenous case has been considered when the theory of poroelasticity was employed. Second case covers the effects of directional heterogeneity, constructed by random faults, on the flow paths of gas and other attributes of the system. Also, in the latter case the impact of stress state as an active loads (body loads) has been regarded. Thanks to multiple directional heterogeneity, which induces only one heterogenic parameter (intrinsic permeability), distinguishable flow paths can be recognized. In another process, the failure ability of system regard to Mohr-Columb criterion is measured as well as options that, presumably, the system has continuum faults (zero cohesion). The results over different cases shows absedince of ground surface (heave), more probable propagation of failure area and the role of directional heterogeneity to change the evolution path of system.

Bergin|Hideko Nomura	  Despite a surface dominated by carbon-based life, the bulk composition of the Earth is dramatically carbon poor when compared to the material available at formation. Bulk carbon deficiency extends into the asteroid belt representing a fossil record of the conditions under which planets are born. The initial steps of planet formation involve the growth of primitive sub-micron silicate and carbon grains in the Solar Nebula. We present a solution wherein primordial carbon grains are preferentially destroyed by oxygen atoms ignited by heating due to stellar accretion at radii < 5 AU. This solution can account for the bulk carbon deficiency in the Earth and meteorites, the compositional gradient within the asteroid belt, and for growing evidence for similar carbon deficiency in rocks surrounding other stars.

Tejeda|A. Taleb-Ibrahimi|P. Le Fèvre|F. Bertran|C. Chambon|S. Kubsky|S. Hébert|H. Muguerra|D. Grebille	  We study with ARPES the electronic structure of CoO2 slabs, stacked with rock-salt (RS) layers exhibiting a different (misfit) periodicity. Fermi Surfaces (FS) in phases with different doping and/or periodicities reveal the influence of the RS potential on the electronic structure. We show that these RS potentials are well ordered, even in incommensurate phases, where STM images reveal broad stripes with width as large as 80\AA. The anomalous evolution of the FS area at low dopings is consistent with the localization of a fraction of the electrons. We propose that this is a new form of electronic ordering, induced by the potential of the stacked layers (RS or Na in NaxCoO2) when the FS becomes smaller than the Brillouin Zone of the stacked structure.

Heimpel|Johannes Wicht	  The transition from liquid metal to silicate rock in the cores of the terrestrial planets is likely to be accompanied by a gradient in the composition of the outer core liquid. The electrical conductivity of a volatile enriched liquid alloy can be substantially lower than a light-element-depleted fluid found close to the inner core boundary. In this paper, we investigate the effect of radially variable electrical conductivity on planetary dynamo action using an electrical conductivity that decreases exponentially as a function of radius. We find that numerical solutions with continuous, radially outward decreasing electrical conductivity profiles result in strongly modified flow and magnetic field dynamics, compared to solutions with homogeneous electrical conductivity. The force balances at the top of the simulated fluid determine the overall character of the flow. The relationship between Coriolis and Lorentz forces near the outer boundary controls the flow and magnetic field intensity and morphology of the system. Our results imply that a low conductivity layer near the top of Mercury's liquid outer core is consistent with its weak magnetic field.

The orbit reveals a surpsingly high Quaoar-Weywot system mass of 1.6{\pm}0.3{\times}10^21 kg. Using the surface properties of the Uranian and Neptunian satellites as a proxy for Quaoar's surface, we reanalyze the size estimate from Brown and Trujillo (2004). We find, from a mean of available published size estimates, a diameter for Quaoar of 890 {\pm} 70 km.

The crystal structure of (Fe2As2)(Ca5(Mg,Ti)4Oy) is identical to that of (Fe2As2)(Ca5(Sc,Ti)4Oy), which was reported in our previous study. The lattice constants of this compound are a = 3.86(4) A and c = 41.05(2) A. In addition, another phase with a thicker blocking layer was found. The structure of the compound and its derivative was tentatively assigned through STEM observation as (Fe2As2)(Ca8(Mg,Ti)6Oy) with sextuple perovskite-type sheets divided by a rock salt layer. The interlayer Fe-Fe distance of this compound is ~30 A. The compound and its derivative exhibited bulk superconductivity, as found from magnetization and resistivity measurements.

We combined high temperature Hall-effect, electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity measurements to show that K-Na co-doping do not form resonance states but2 can control the energy difference of the maxima of the two primary valence sub-bands in PbTe. This leads to an enhanced interband interaction with rising temperature and a significant rise in the thermoelectric figure of merit of p-type PbTe. The experimental data can be explained by a combination of a single and two-band model for the valence band of PbTe depending on hole density that varies in the range of 1-15 x 10^19 cm^-3.

Mitra	  Cairns-Smith (2008) has argued for a pre-Darwinian era, with a simpler basis for life's functioning via primitive "crystal genes" (information transfer, kinetic control on metabolic reactions). At the other extreme, guided by the structural similarity of clusters in early-evolved enzymes to iron-sulphide minerals like greigite, the hydrothermal mound scenario of Russell and coworkers (1994) presents how non-equilibrium forces rooted in geochemistry could be extrapolated to understand the metabolic functioning of living systems. The informational vs metabolic aspects of life in these respective scenarios can be linked together via a framboid-based theory of Sawlowicz (2000), as these assemblies typically form in colloidal environments. In this background, we consider the ramifications of a magnetic rock field on the mound scenario, asking if soft matter assemblies are compatible with a coherent order.

Gibson|Jamie Wallis|Shirwan Al-Mufti|Nori Miyake	  Three decades ago the first convincing evidence of microbial fossils in carbonaceous chondrites was discovered and reported by Hans Dieter Pflug and his collaborators. In addition to morphology, other data, notably laser mass spectroscopy, confirmed the identification of such structures as putative bacterial fossils. Balloon-borne cryosampling of the stratosphere enables recovery of fragile cometary dust aggregates with their structure and carbonaceous matter largely intact. Scanning electron microscope studies of texture and morphology of particles in the Cardiff collection, together with Energy Dispersive X-ray identifications, show two main types of putative bio-fossils - firstly organic-walled hollow spheres around 10 microns across, secondly siliceous diatom skeletons similar to those found in carbonaceous chondrites and terrestrial sedimentary rocks and termed "acritarchs". Since carbonaceous chondrites (particularly Type 1 chondrites) are thought to be extinct comets the data reviewed in this article provide strong support for theories of cometary panspermia.

Anderson|Morris Podolak|Gerald Schubert	  'Empirical' models (pressure vs. density) of Uranus and Neptune interiors constrained by the gravitational coefficients J_2, J_4, the planetary radii and masses, and Voyager solid-body rotation periods are presented. The empirical pressure-density profiles are then interpreted in terms of physical equations of state of hydrogen, helium, ice (H_2O), and rock (SiO_2) to test the physical plausibility of the models. The compositions of Uranus and Neptune are found to be similar with somewhat different distributions of the high-Z material. The big difference between the two planets is that Neptune requires a non-solar envelope while Uranus is best matched with a solar composition envelope. Our analysis suggests that the heavier elements in both Uranus' and Neptune's interior might increase gradually towards the planetary centers. Indeed it is possible to fit the gravitational moments without sharp compositional transitions.

Caldwell|Tangali Sudarshan	  Thick, high quality 4H-SiC epilayers have been grown in a vertical hot-wall chemical vapor deposition system at a high growth rate on (0001) 80 off-axis substrates. We discuss the use of dichlorosilane as the Si-precursor for 4H-SiC epitaxial growth as it provides the most direct decomposition route into SiCl2, which is the predominant growth species in chlorinated chemistries. A specular surface morphology was attained by limiting the hydrogen etch rate until the system was equilibrated at the desired growth temperature. The RMS roughness of the grown films ranged from 0.5-2.0 nm with very few morphological defects (carrots, triangular defects, etc.) being introduced, while enabling growth rates of 30-100 \mum/hr, 5-15 times higher than most conventional growths. Site-competition epitaxy was observed over a wide range of C/Si ratios, with doping concentrations < 1x1014 cm-3 being recorded. X-ray rocking curves indicated that the epilayers were of high crystallinity, with linewidths as narrow as 7.8 arcsec being observed, while microwave photoconductive decay (\muPCD) measurements indicated that these films had high injection (ambipolar) carrier lifetimes in the range of 2 \mus.

Strong variations of physical conditions (temperature, density, ionization rate, UV/X-rays intensities) make a variety of chemical processes active in disks, producing simple molecules in the gas phase and complex polyatomic (organic) species on the surfaces of dust particles. In this entry, we summarize the major modern observational methods and theoretical paradigms used to investigate disk chemical composition and evolution, and present the most important results. Future research directions that will become possible with the advent of the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) and other forthcoming observational facilities are also discussed. 	
1011.6501v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1011.6501v1	2010	Temperature induced pore fluid pressurization in geomaterials	Siavash Ghabezloo|Jean Sulem	  The theoretical basis of the thermal response of the fluid-saturated porous materials in undrained condition is presented. It has been demonstrated that the thermal pressurization phenomenon is controlled by the discrepancy between the thermal expansion of the pore fluid and of the solid phase, the stress-dependency of the compressibility and the non-elastic volume changes of the porous material. For evaluation of the undrained thermo-poro-elastic properties of saturated porous materials in conventional triaxial cells, it is important to take into account the effect of the dead volume of the drainage system. A simple correction method is presented to correct the measured pore pressure change and also the measured volumetric strain during an undrained heating test. It is shown that the porosity of the tested material, its drained compressibility and the ratio of the volume of the drainage system to the one of the tested sample, are the key parameters which influence the most the error induced on the measurements by the drainage system. An example of the experimental evaluation of undrained thermoelastic parameters is presented for an undrained heating test performed on a fluid-saturated granular rock. 	
1012.0276v3	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1012.0276v3	2011	Evolution and stability of altruist strategies in microbial games	Christoph Adami|Jory Schossau|Arend Hintze	  When microbes compete for limited resources, they often engage in chemical warfare using bacterial toxins. This competition can be understood in terms of evolutionary game theory (EGT). We study the predictions of EGT for the bacterial "suicide bomber" game in terms of the phase portraits of population dynamics, for parameter combinations that cover all interesting games for two-players, and seven of the 38 possible phase portraits of the three-player game. We compare these predictions to simulations of these competitions in finite well-mixed populations, but also allowing for probabilistic rather than pure strategies, as well as Darwinian adaptation over tens of thousands of generations. We find that Darwinian evolution of probabilistic strategies stabilizes games of the rock-paper-scissors type that emerge for parameters describing realistic bacterial populations, and point to ways in which the population fixed point can be selected by changing those parameters. 	
1012.5070v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1012.5070v1	2010	Theory of prospective tetrahedral perovskite ferroelectrics	Anindya Roy|David Vanderbilt	  Using first-principles methods, we predict the energy landscape and ferroelectric states of double perovskites of the form AA$'$BB$'$O$_6$ in which the atoms on both the A and B sites are arranged in rock-salt order. While we are not aware of compounds that occur naturally in this structure, we argue that they might be realizable by directed synthesis. The high-symmetry structure formed by this arrangement belongs to the tetrahedral $F\bar{4}3m$ space group. If a ferroelectric instability occurs, the energy landscape will tend to have minima with the polarization along tetrahedral directions, leading to a rhombohedral phase, or along Cartesian directions, leading to an orthorhombic phase. We find that the latter scenario applies to CaBaTiZrO$_6$ and KCaZrNbO$_6$, which are weakly ferroelectric, and the former one applies to PbSnTiZrO$_6$, which is strongly ferroelectric. The results are modeled with a fourth- or fifth-order Landau-Devonshire expansion, providing good agreement with the first-principles calculations. Computations of zone-center soft modes are also carried out in order to characterize the polar and octahedral-rotation instabilities in more detail. Prospects for synthesis of ferroelectric materials belonging to this class are discussed.

Hoard|B. Klein|D. Koester	  Spitzer observations reveal the presence of warm debris from a tidally destroyed rocky and possibly icy planetary body orbiting the white dwarf GD 61. Ultraviolet and optical spectroscopy of the metal-contaminated stellar photosphere reveal traces of hydrogen, oxygen, magnesium, silicon, iron, and calcium. The nominal ratios of these elements indicate an excess of oxygen relative to that expected from rock-forming metal oxides, and thus it is possible that water was accreted together with the terrestrial-like debris. Iron is found to be deficient relative to magnesium and silicon, suggesting the material may have originated as the outer layers of a differentiated parent body, as is widely accepted for the Moon.

An elastic layer is forced by overburden pressure against a V-shaped rigid obstacle. Energy minimization leads to representation as a nonlinear fourth-order ordinary differential equation, for which we prove their exists a unique solution. Drawing parallels with the Kuhn-Tucker theory, virtual work, and ideas of duality, we highlight the physical significance of this differential equation. Finally we show this equation scales to a single parametric group, revealing a scaling law connecting the size of the void with the pressure/stiffness ratio. This paper is seen as the first step towards a full multilayered model with the possibility of voiding. 	
1102.0208v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1102.0208v1	2011	Overview of the European Underground Facilities	L. Pandola	  Deep underground laboratories are the only places where the extremely low background radiation level required for most experiments looking for rare events in physics and astroparticle physics can be achieved. Underground sites are also the most suitable location for very low background gamma-ray spectrometers, able to assay trace radioactive contaminants. Many operational infrastructures are already available worldwide for science, differing for depth, dimension and rock characteristics. Other underground sites are emerging as potential new laboratories. In this paper the European underground sites are reviewed, giving a particular emphasis on their relative strength and complementarity. A coordination and integration effort among the European Union underground infrastructures was initiated by the EU-funded ILIAS project and proved to be very effective. 	
1103.3257v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1103.3257v1	2011	The Joker effect: cooperation driven by destructive agents	Alex Arenas|Juan Camacho|José A. Cuesta|Rubén Requejo	  Understanding the emergence of cooperation is a central issue in evolutionary game theory. The hardest setup for the attainment of cooperation in a population of individuals is the Public Goods game in which cooperative agents generate a common good at their own expenses, while defectors "free-ride" this good. Eventually this causes the exhaustion of the good, a situation which is bad for everybody. Previous results have shown that introducing reputation, allowing for volunteer participation, punishing defectors, rewarding cooperators or structuring agents, can enhance cooperation. Here we present a model which shows how the introduction of rare, malicious agents -that we term jokers- performing just destructive actions on the other agents induce bursts of cooperation. The appearance of jokers promotes a rock-paper-scissors dynamics, where jokers outbeat defectors and cooperators outperform jokers, which are subsequently invaded by defectors. Thus, paradoxically, the existence of destructive agents acting indiscriminately promotes cooperation.

We say that $M$ has $R_\infty$ property if the Reidemeister number $R(f) = \infty$ for every homeomorphism $f \colon M \to M.$ In this paper, we investigate a relation between the holonomy representation $\rho$ of a flat manifold $M$ and the $R_\infty$ property. In case when the holonomy group of $M$ is solvable we show that, if $\rho$ has a unique $\mathbb{R}$-irreducible subrepresentation of odd degree, then $M$ has $R_\infty$ property. The result is related to conjecture 4.8 from [1].   [1] K. Dekimpe, B. De Rock, P. Penninckx, \emph{The $R_{\infty}$ property for infra-nilmanifolds}, Topol.

Rauer	  The present study takes the CoRoT-7b exoplanet as an analogue for massive terrestrial planets to investigate conditions, under which intrinsic magnetic fields could be sustained in liquid cores. We examine the effect of depth-dependent transport parameters (e.g., activation volume of mantle rock) on a planet's thermal structure and the related heat flux across the core mantle boundary. For terrestrial planets more massive than the Earth, our calculations suggest that a substantial part of the lowermost mantle is in a sluggish convective regime, primarily due to pressure effects on viscosity. Hence, we find substantially higher core temperatures than previously reported from parameterized convection models. We also discuss the effect of melting point depression in the presence of impurities (e.g., sulfur) in iron-rich cores and compare corresponding melting relations to the calculated thermal structure. Since impurity effects become less important at the elevated pressure and temperature conditions prevalent in the deep interior of CoRoT-7b, iron-rich cores are likely solid, implying that a self-sustained magnetic field would be absent.

Böni|U. Keiderling|K. Everschor|M. Garst|A. Rosch	  We report small angle neutron scattering of the skyrmion lattice in MnSi using an experimental set-up that minimizes the effects of demagnetizing fields and double scattering. Under these conditions the skyrmion lattice displays resolution-limited Gaussian rocking scans that correspond to a magnetic correlation length in excess of several hundred {\mu}m. This is consistent with exceptionally well-defined long-range order. We further establish the existence of higher-order scattering, discriminating parasitic double-scattering with Renninger scans. The field and temperature dependence of the higher-order scattering arises from an interference effect. It is characteristic for the long-range crystalline nature of the skyrmion lattice as shown by simple mean field calculations.

Their electric and magnetic dipolar modes can couple to oscillatory (electric-organic-dipoles), and/or rotary (magnetic-mineral-dipoles), besides responding to magnetic potentials. Thus, imprinted electromagnetic patterns of catalytic colloids - c.f. Cairns-Smith's "crystal-scaffold"- on their structured water partners could have equipped the latter with a selection-basis for 'choosing' their context-based "soft-matter" (de Gennes) replacements. We consider the potential of the scenario of an external control on magnetic colloids forming in the Hadean hydrothermal setting (of Russell and coworkers) - via a magnetic-rock-field - conceptually enabling self-assembly, induction of asymmetries, response effects towards close-to-equilibrium dynamics, associative-networks, besides providing a coherent environment for stabilizing associated symmetry-broken quanta, and their feedback-interactions with those of coherent water-domains, to address the emergence of metabolism and replication.

Neutron diffraction study shows that the shift of the Neel temperature of these materials from 150 (x = 0) to 200 K (x = 0.29) under the action of chemical pressure (x) is accompanied by a decrease in the cubic NaCl lattice parameters. The structural transition with a change in crystal symmetry and a decrease in resistance before the magnetic transition at x = 0.25 is found. Therefore, FeXMn1-XS are interesting materials for both fundamental study of the interrelation between the magnetic, electrical, and structural properties in systems with the strong electron correlations of a MnO-type and application.

Młyńczak|B. Strzelczyk|M. Zajac|J. Korecki	  Ultrathin (111)-oriented polar iron oxide films were grown on a Pt(111) single crystal either by the reactive deposition of iron or oxidation of metallic iron monolayers. These films were characterized using low energy electron diffraction, scanning tunneling microscopy and conversion electron Mossbauer spectroscopy. The reactive deposition of Fe led to the island growth of Fe3O4, in which the electronic and magnetic properties of the bulk material were modulated by superparamagnetic size effects for thicknesses below 2 nm, revealing specific surface and interface features. In contrast, the oxide films with FeO stoichiometry, which could be stabilized as thick as 4 nm under special preparation conditions, had electronic and magnetic properties that were very different from their bulk counterpart, w\"ustite. Unusual long range magnetic order appeared at room temperature for thicknesses between three and ten monolayers, the appearance of which requires severe structural modification from the rock-salt structure.

Hamilton	  We study the stability of charged dust grains orbiting a planet and subject to gravity and the electromagnetic force. Our numerical models cover a broad range of launch distances from the planetary surface to beyond synchronous orbit, and the full range of charge-to-mass ratios from ions to rocks. Treating the spinning planetary magnetic field as an aligned dipole, we map regions of radial and vertical instability where dust grains are driven to escape or crash into the planet. We derive the boundaries between stable and unstable trajectories analytically, and apply our models to Jupiter, Saturn and the Earth, whose magnetic fields are reasonably well represented by aligned dipoles.

Lozza|for the SNO+ collaboration	  The SNO+ experiment is the follow up of the SNO experiment, replacing the heavy water volume with about 780 tons of liquid scintillator (LAB) in order to shift the sensitive threshold to lower energy range. The 6000 m.w.e. natural rock shielding, and the use of ultra- clean materials makes the detector suitable for the detection of pep and CNO solar neutrinos, geo-neutrinos, reactor neutrinos and the possible observation of neutrinos from supernovae. Complementing this program, SNO+ will also search for 150Nd (5.6% abundance) neutrinoless double beta decay, loading the liquid scintillator with 0.1% of natural Neodymium. After a review of the general SNO+ setup, the physics of the solar neutrino phase will be presented.

Blatt	  Efficient self-interference of single-photons emitted by a sideband-cooled Barium ion is demonstrated. First, the technical tools for performing efficient coupling to the quadrupolar transition of a single $^{138}$Ba$^{+}$ ion are presented. We show efficient Rabi oscillations of the internal state of the ion using a highly stabilized 1.76 $\mu m$ fiber laser resonant with the S$_{1/2}$-D$_{5/2}$ transition. We then show sideband cooling of the ion's motional modes and use it as a means to enhance the interference contrast of the ion with its mirror-image to up to 90%. Last, we measure the dependence of the self-interference contrast on the mean phonon number, thereby demonstrating the potential of the set-up for single-atom thermometry close to the motional ground state. 	
1203.2301v3	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.2301v3	2013	Existence of equilibria in countable games: an algebraic approach	Valerio Capraro|Marco Scarsini	  Although mixed extensions of finite games always admit equilibria, this is not the case for countable games, the best-known example being Wald's pick-the-larger-integer game. Several authors have provided conditions for the existence of equilibria in infinite games. These conditions are typically of topological nature and are rarely applicable to countable games. Here we establish an existence result for the equilibrium of countable games when the strategy sets are a countable group and the payoffs are functions of the group operation. In order to obtain the existence of equilibria, finitely additive mixed strategies have to be allowed. This creates a problem of selection of a product measure of mixed strategies. We propose a family of such selections and prove existence of an equilibrium that does not depend on the selection. As a byproduct we show that if finitely additive mixed strategies are allowed, then Wald's game admits an equilibrium. We also prove existence of equilibria for nontrivial extensions of matching-pennies and rock-scissors-paper. Finally we extend the main results to uncountable games.

Scholl	  The Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) aboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory observed the transits of Mercury on 2003 May 7 and 2006 November 8. Contact times between Mercury and the solar limb have been used since the 17th century to derive the Sun's size but this is the first time that high-quality imagery from space, above the Earth's atmosphere, has been available. Unlike other measurements this technique is largely independent of optical distortion. The true solar radius is still a matter of debate in the literature as measured differences of several tenths of an arcsecond (i.e., about 500 km) are apparent. This is due mainly to systematic errors from different instruments and observers since the claimed uncertainties for a single instrument are typically an order of magnitude smaller. From the MDI transit data we find the solar radius to be 960".12 +/- 0".09 (696,342 +/- 65 km). This value is consistent between the transits and consistent between different MDI focus settings after accounting for systematic effects. 	
1206.0386v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.0386v1	2012	Transport of fullerene molecules along graphene nanoribbons	Alexander V. Savin|Yuri S. Kivshar	  We study the motion of C60 fullerene molecules (buckyballs) and short-length carbon nanotubes on graphene nanoribbons. We demonstrate that the nanoribbon edge creates an effective potential that keeps the carbon structures on the surface. We reveal that the character of the motion of C60 molecules depends on temperature: for low temperatures (T<150K) the main type of motion is sliding along the surface, but for higher temperatures the sliding is replaced by rocking and rolling. Modeling of the buckyball with an included metal ion, such as Fe@C60, demonstrates that this molecular complex undergoes a rolling motion along the nanoribbon with the constant velocity under the action of a constant electric field. The similar effect is observed in the presence of the heat gradient applied to the nanoribbon, but mobility of carbon structures in this case depends largely on their size and symmetry, such that larger and more asymmetric structures demonstrate much lower mobility. Our results suggest that both electorphoresis and thermophoresis can be employed to control the motion of carbon molecules and fullerenes and, for example, sort them by their size, shape, and possible inclusions.

Amato et al	Franco Pavese	  It is shown that the evidence asserted in the Comment [arXiv:1205.6418] on the chemical composition data published by Carpinteri et al. [Strain 47 (Suppl. 2), 282 (2011)]-that the data "cannot be the result of independent measurements as claimed by the authors" -may be not necessarily true. A simpler fact could explain the identical assay values found for some of the chemical components, without this implying the asserted impossible correlations. The simpler reason does not invalidate the published numerical data, being related only to incorrect notation. On the other hand, it is out the scope of the present comment implying any evaluation about the physical validity of the data or about the conclusions drawn in the original paper. 	
1206.5898v3	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.5898v3	2013	Cyclic game dynamics driven by iterated reasoning	Seth Frey|Robert L. Goldstone	  Recent theories from complexity science argue that complex dynamics are ubiquitous in social and economic systems. These claims emerge from the analysis of individually simple agents whose collective behavior is surprisingly complicated. However, economists have argued that iterated reasoning--what you think I think you think--will suppress complex dynamics by stabilizing or accelerating convergence to Nash equilibrium. We report stable and efficient periodic behavior in human groups playing the Mod Game, a multi-player game similar to Rock-Paper-Scissors. The game rewards subjects for thinking exactly one step ahead of others in their group. Groups that play this game exhibit cycles that are inconsistent with any fixed-point solution concept. These cycles are driven by a "hopping" behavior that is consistent with other accounts of iterated reasoning: agents are constrained to about two steps of iterated reasoning and learn an additional one-half step with each session. If higher-order reasoning can be complicit in complex emergent dynamics, then cyclic and chaotic patterns may be endogenous features of real-world social and economic systems.

In the optional public goods game, the rock-scissors-paper cycles of different strategies yield oscillatory cooperation but not stable cooperation. In this paper, by incorporating population density and individual mobility into the spatial optional public goods game, we study the coevolutionary dynamics of strategy updating and benefit-seeking migration. With low population density and slow movement, an optimal level of cooperation is easy to be reached. An increase in population density and speed-up of free-floating of competitive agents will suppress cooperation. A log-log relation between the levels of cooperation and the free-floating probability is found. Theoretical analysis indicates that the decrease of cooperator frequency in the present model should result from the increased interactions between different agents, which may originate from the increased cluster size or the speed-up of random-movement.

Nunokawa|R. Zukanovich Funchal	  The construction of the Agua Negra tunnels that will link Argentina and Chile under the Andes, the world longest mountain range, opens the possibility to build the first deep underground labo- ratory in the Southern Hemisphere. This laboratory has the acronym ANDES (Agua Negra Deep Experiment Site) and its overburden could be as large as \sim 1.7 km of rock, or 4500 mwe, providing an excellent low background environment to study physics of rare events like the ones induced by neutrinos and/or dark matter. In this paper we investigate the physics potential of a few kiloton size liquid scintillator detector, which could be constructed in the ANDES laboratory as one of its possible scientific programs. In particular, we evaluate the impact of such a detector for the studies of geoneutrinos and galactic supernova neutrinos assuming a fiducial volume of 3 kilotons as a reference size. We emphasize the complementary roles of such a detector to the ones in the Northern Hemisphere neutrino facilities through some advantages due to its geographical location.

Mayrhofer	  In this Letter we present first principle calculation of surface energies of rock-salt (B1), zinc-blende (B3), and wurtzite (B4) AlN allotropes. Out of several low-index facets, the highest energies are obtained for mono-atomic surfaces (i.e. only by either Al or N atoms): $\gamma_{\{111\}}^{\rm B1}=410\uu{meV/\AA}^2$, $\gamma_{\{100\}}^{\rm B3}=346\uu{meV/\AA}^2$, $\gamma_{\{111\}}^{\rm B3}=360\uu{meV/\AA}^2$, and $\gamma_{\{0001\}}^{\rm B4}=365\uu{meV/\AA}^2$. The difference between Al- and N-terminated surfaces in these cases is less then $20\uu{meV/\AA}^2$. The stoichiometric facets have energies lower by $100\uu{meV/\AA}^2$ or more. The obtained trends could be rationalised by a simple nearest-neighbour broken-bond model.

Bin Xu|Zhijian Wang	  This question is raised by Cason, Friedman and Hopkins (CFH, 2012) after they firstly found and indexed quantitatively the cycles in a continuous time experiment. To answer this question, we use the data from standard RPS experiment. Our experiments are of the traditional setting - in each of repeated rounds, the subjects are paired with random matching, using pure strategy and must choose simultaneously, and after each round, each subject obtains only private information. This economics environment is a decartelized and low-information one.   Using the cycle rotation indexes (CRI, developed by CFH) method, we find, the cycles not only exist but also persist in our experiment. Meanwhile, the cycles' direction are consistent with 'standard' learning models. That is the answer to the CHF question: Cycles do not dissipate in the simultaneously choose game.   In addtion, we discuss three questions (1) why significant cycles are uneasy to be obtained in traditional setting experiments; (2) why CRI can be an iconic indexing-method for 'standard' evolution dynamics; and (3) where more cycles could be expected.

Here we are going to trace the current position of the player to rectify the traffic while playing the game. There are different types of measures for different applications, those can be normalized and compared with one another but my application can resolve the inconsistency by knowing the positions quickly and focus on quality of network (QON) which affects a player to leave the game in middle because of poor quality of service (QOS). The existing model leads to leave the game because of network loss from both sides. The proposed model can resolve this problem by applying the replacement of TCP along with the dejitter buffer (DB) it can reduce the network loss and by applying the DEAD RECKONING (DR) vector we can recover the network access because it can view the current position of the player through this we can rectify why the player leaving the game and checks the network conditions and try to reactive the game by using mobile devices automatically or else they receive the message according to the network conditions.

Gavrichkov|Yu. S. Orlov|I. A. Nekrasov|Z. V. Pchelkina	  High-$T_c$ superconductors with CuO$_2$ layers, manganites La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$MnO$_3$, and cobaltites LaCoO$_3$ present several mysteries in their physical properties. Most of them are believed to come from the strongly-correlated nature of these materials. From the theoretical viewpoint, there are many hidden rocks in making the consistent description of the band structure and low-energy physics starting from the Fermi-liquid approach. Here we discuss the alternative method -- multielectron approach to the electronic structure calculations for the Mott insulators -- called LDA+GTB (local density approximation + generalized tight-binding) method. Its origin is a straightforward generalization of the Hubbard perturbation theory in the atomic limit and the multiband $p-d$ Hamiltonian with the parameters calculated within LDA. We briefly discuss the method and focus on its applications to cuprates, manganites, and cobaltites.

The nonstationary stochastic method previously developed by Pousse et al. (2006) has been updated. This method has the advantage of being both simple, fast and taking into account the basic concepts of seismology (Brune's source, realistic time envelope function, nonstationarity and ground-motion variability). Time-domain simulations are derived from the signal spectrogram and depend on few ground-motion parameters: Arias intensity, significant relative duration and central frequency. These indicators are obtained from empirical attenuation equations that relate them to the magnitude of the event, the source-receiver distance, and the site conditions. We improve the nonstationary stochastic method by using new functional forms (new surface rock dataset, analysis of both intra-event and inter-event residuals, consideration of the scaling relations and VS30), by assessing the central frequency with S-transform and by better considering the stress drop variability.

Schumacher|T. Borzenko|C. Bruene|H. Buhmann|C. Gould|K. Brunner|L. W. Molenkamp	  Epitaxial layers of the topological insulator Bi2Se3 have been grown by molecular beam epitaxy on laterally lattice-matched InP(111)B substrates. High resolution X-ray diffraction shows a significant improvement of Bi2Se3 crystal quality compared to layers deposited on other substrates. The measured full width at half maximum of the rocking curve is Delta omega=13 arcsec, and the (omega-2theta) scans exhibit clear layer thickness fringes. Atomic force microscope images show triangular twin domains with sizes increasing with layer thickness. The structural quality of the domains is confirmed on the microscopic level by transmission electron microscopy.

Hoover|Andrew Oldroyd|Daryl H. Wallis|Anil Samaranayake|K. Wickramarathne|M. K. Wallis|Carl H. Gibson|N. C. Wickramasinghe	  Results of X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis, Triple Oxygen Isotope analysis and Scanning Electron Microscopic (SEM) studies are presented for stone fragments recovered from the North Central Province of Sri Lanka following a witnessed fireball event on 29 December 2012. The existence of numerous nitrogen depleted highly carbonaceous fossilized biological structures fused into the rock matrix is inconsistent with recent terrestrial contamination. Oxygen isotope results compare well with those of CI and CI-like chondrites but are inconsistent with the fulgurite hypothesis.

Pride derived the governing models, in which Maxwell equations are coupled with Biot equations through the electro-kinetic mobility parameter. The inverse problem of the linearized electro-seismic conversion consists in two step, namely the inversion of Biot equations and the inversion of Maxwell equations. We analyze the reconstruction of conductivity and electro-kinetic mobility parameter in Maxwell equations with internal measurements, while the internal measurements are provided by the results of the inversion of Biot equations. We show that knowledge of two internal data based on well-chosen boundary conditions uniquely determine these two parameters. Moreover, a Lipschitz type stability is proved based on the same sets of well-chosen boundary conditions.

Veerappa Gowda	  We propose a high resolution finite volume scheme for a (m+1)x(m+1) system of non strictly hyperbolic conservation laws which models multicomponent polymer flooding in enhanced oil-recovery process in two dimensions. In the presence of gravity the flux functions need not be monotone and hence the exact Riemann problem is complicated and computationally expensive. To overcome this difficulty, we use the idea of discontinuous flux to reduce the coupled system into uncoupled system of scalar conservation laws with discontinuous coefficients. High order accurate scheme is constructed by introducing slope limiter in space variable and a strong stability preserving Runge-Kutta scheme in the time variable. The performance of the numerical scheme is presented in various situations by choosing a heavily heterogeneous hard rock type medium. Also the significance of dissolving multiple polymers in aqueous phase is presented

We demonstrate how such process leads macroscopically to a variant of the replicator equation, with an additional term accounting for player turnover. We study how Nash equilibria and the dynamics of the system are modified by this additional term, for prototypical examples such as the rock-scissor-paper game and different classes of two-action games played between two distinct populations. We conclude by showing how player turnover can account for non-trivial departures from Nash equilibria observed in data from lowest unique bid auctions.

Buczko	  Using a tight-binding approach we study theoretically the nature of surface states in Pb0.4Sn0.6Te - the newly discovered topological-crystalline-insulator. Apart from the studied before (001) surface states, two other surface families, {011} and {111}, in which the mirror symmetry of the crystal's rock-salt structure plays the same role in topological protection, are considered. Our calculations show that while in (111) surface states of (Pb,Sn)Te four single topologically protected Dirac-cones should appear, for the (110) surface states the protection is lifted for two L points. In this case, instead of the Dirac points energy gaps occur in the surface states, due to the interaction between the two L valleys. In all studied cases a chiral spin texture is obtained.

Sreekumar|V. Radhakrishnaa|A. Tyagi|B. J. Kellett|the CLASS team	  Surface chemistry of airless bodies in the solar system can be derived from remote x-ray spectral measurements from an orbiting spacecraft. X- rays from planetary surfaces are excited primarily by solar x-rays. Several experiments in the past have used this technique of x-ray fluorescence for deriving abundances of the major rock forming elements. The Chandrayaan- 2 orbiter carries an x-ray fluorescence experiment named CLASS that is designed based on results from its predecessor C1XS flown on Chandrayaan-1. We discuss the new aspects of lunar science that can be potentially achieved with CLASS.

Zeilinger	  The twentieth century saw two fundamental revolutions in physics -- relativity and quantum. Daily use of these theories can numb the sense of wonder at their immense empirical success. Does their instrumental effectiveness stand on the rock of secure concepts or the sand of unresolved fundamentals? Does measuring a quantum system probe, or even create, reality, or merely change belief? Must relativity and quantum theory just co-exist or might we find a new theory which unifies the two? To bring such questions into sharper focus, we convened a conference on Quantum Physics and the Nature of Reality. Some issues remain as controversial as ever, but some are being nudged by theory's secret weapon of experiment.

Rogers|Alan Levine|Joshua N. Winn	  The requirement that a planet must orbit outside of its Roche limit gives a lower limit on the planet's mean density. The minimum density depends almost entirely on the orbital period and is immune to systematic errors in the stellar properties. We consider the implications of this density constraint for the newly-identified class of small planets with periods shorter than half a day. When the planet's radius is known accurately, this lower limit to the density can be used to restrict the possible combinations of iron and rock within the planet. Applied to KOI 1843.03, with a radius of 0.6 Earth radii and the shortest known orbital period of 4.245 hr, the planet's mean density must be greater than approximately 7 g/cm^3. By modeling the planetary interior subject to this constraint, we find the composition of the planet must be mostly iron, with at most a modest fraction of silicates (less than approximately 30% by mass).

Kjelstrup	  We determine thermodynamic stability conditions in terms of Helmholtz and Gibbs energies for sI clathrate hydrates with CH$_4$ and CO$_2$ at 278 K. Helmholtz energies are relevant for processing from porous rocks (constant volume), while Gibbs energies are relevant for processing from layers on the ocean floor (constant pressure). We define three steps leading to hydrate formation, and find Helmholtz energy differences from molecular simulations for two of them using grand-canonical Monte Carlo simulations at constant temperature and volume; while the third step was calculated from literature data. The Gibbs energy change for the same steps are also determined. From the variations in the total Helmholtz and Gibbs energies we suggest thermodynamic paths for exchange of CH$_4$ by CO$_2$ in the isothermal hydrate, for constant volume or pressure, respectively. We show how these paths for the mixed hydrate can be understood from single-component occupancy isotherms, where CO$_2$, but not CH$_4$, can distinguish between large and small cages. The strong preference for CH$_4$ for a range of compositions can be explained by these.

Ortiz|A. J. Castro-Tirado|S. Pastor|J. A. de los Reyes|J. Cabrera-Cano	  We present the analysis of the atmospheric trajectory and orbital data of four bright bolides observed over Spain, one of which is a potential meteorite dropping event. Their absolute magnitude ranges from -10 to -11. Two of these are of sporadic origin, although a Geminid and a kappa-Cygnid fireball are also considered. These events were recorded in the framework of the continuous fireball monitoring and spectroscopy campaigns developed by the SPanish Meteor Network (SPMN) between 2010 and 2012. The tensile strength of the parent meteoroids is estimated and the abundances of the main rock-forming elements in these particles are calculated from the emission spectrum obtained for three of these events. This analysis revealed a chondritic nature for these meteoroids.

The composition classes characterize the rock, ice, and gas properties of planetary bodies. The planetary mass scale includes five mass classes with upper and lower mass limits derived from recent studies of the exoplanet mass radius and mass density relationships and the physical characteristics of planets, dwarf planets, and spherical moons in the Solar System. The combined mass and composition codes provide a geophysical classification that allows for comparison of the global mass and composition characteristics of exoplanets with the Solar System's planets, dwarf planets, and spherical moons. The system is flexible and can be combined with additional codes characterizing other physical, dynamical, or biological characteristics of planets.

The evolution of the spatial distribution of species is governed by site exchange and invasion between the neighboring predator-prey pairs, where the cyclic symmetry can be characterized by two different invasion rates. The mean-field analysis has indicated periodic oscillations in the species densities with a frequency becoming zero for a specific ratio of invasion rates. When varying the ratio of invasion rates, the appearance of this zero-eigenvalue mode is accompanied by neutrality between the species associations. Monte Carlo simulations of the spatial system reveal diverging fluctuations at a specific invasion rate, which can be related to the vanishing dominance between all pairs of species associations.

House	  Material from the surface of a planet can be ejected into space by a large impact, and could carry primitive life forms with it. We performed n-body simulations of such ejecta to determine where in the Solar System rock from Earth and Mars may end up. We find that, in addition to frequent transfer of material among the terrestrial planets, transfer of material from Earth and Mars to the moons of Jupiter and Saturn is also possible, but rare. We expect that such transfer is most likely during the Late Heavy Bombardment or during the next one or two billion years. At this time, the icy moons were warmer and likely had little or no icy shell to prevent meteorites from reaching their liquid interiors. We also note significant rates of re-impact in the first million years after ejection. This could re-seed life on a planet after partial or complete sterilization by a large impact, which would aid the survival of early life during the Late Heavy Bombardment.

Pillay	  A high efficiency, low background counting setup has been made at TIFR consisting of a special HPGe detector ($\sim$ 70%) surrounded by a low activity copper+lead shield. Detailed measurements are performed with point and extended geometry sources to obtain a complete response of the detector. An effective model of the detector has been made with GEANT4 based Monte Carlo simulations which agrees with experimental data within 5%. This setup will be used for qualification and selection of radio-pure materials to be used in a cryogenic bolometer for the study of Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay in $^{124}$Sn as well as for other rare event studies. Using this setup, radio-impurities in the rock sample from India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO) site have been estimated.

The TO and LO at Gamma point and other optical phonon frequencies increase linearly while the LO TO splitting decreases with pressure. The recorded Raman modes have been used to determine the mode Gruneisen parameters and also the value of Borns transverse effective charge. The calculated Borns transverse effective charge exhibits a linear reduction with increasing pressure implying an increase in covalency of nanowires under compression. The intensity of the Raman modes shows a strong enhancement as the energy of E1 band gap approaches the excitation energy, which has been discussed in terms of resonant Raman scattering. An indication of structural phase transformation has been observed above pressure 10.87 GPa. We propose this transformation may be from wurtzite to rock salt phase although further experimental and theoretical confirmations are needed.

A showering muon is one which deposits at least 3 GeV in the detector in addition to ionization energy. We find that 20 percent of muons are showering and a further 10 percent of muon events are muon bundles of which more than one muon enters the detector. In this range the showering and bundle fractions are robust against changes in the depth and topography, thus the total shower and bundle rate for a given experiment can be obtained by combining our results with an estimate for the total muon flux. One consequence is that a straightforward adaptation of the full detector showering muon cuts used by KamLAND to JUNO or RENO 50 would yield a nearly vanishing detector efficiency.

Our main goal is to investigate whether high-frequency trading exacerbates market volatility and generates flash crashes. In the model, low-frequency agents adopt trading rules based on chronological time and can switch between fundamentalist and chartist strategies. On the contrary, high-frequency traders activation is event-driven and depends on price fluctuations. High-frequency traders use directional strategies to exploit market information produced by low-frequency traders. Monte-Carlo simulations reveal that the model replicates the main stylized facts of financial markets. Furthermore, we find that the presence of high-frequency trading increases market volatility and plays a fundamental role in the generation of flash crashes. The emergence of flash crashes is explained by two salient characteristics of high-frequency traders, i.e. their ability to i) generate high bid-ask spreads and ii) synchronize on the sell side of the limit order book. Finally, we find that higher rates of order cancellation by high-frequency traders increase the incidence of flash crashes but reduce their duration.

Gu|Tonica Valla	  Narrow gap semiconductor Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$Se was investigated for topologically protected surface states in its rock-salt structural phase for x=0.45, 0.23, 0.15, and 0. Angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy of intrinsically p-doped samples showed clear indication of two Dirac cones, eccentric about the time-reversal invariant point X of the surface Brillouin zone for all but the x=0 sample. Adsorption of alkalies gradually filled the surface bands with electrons, driving the x>0 topological crystalline insulator systems through Lifshitz transitions, and from a hole- to electron-like Fermi surface. The electron-doped bands in x>0 samples exhibited the full configuration of the Dirac cones, also confirming electron-hole symmetry of the surface bands.

One of the boundary conditions, which accounts for the energy required to break the rock, involves the toughness coefficient $K\geq 0$. Mathematically, this condition plays the same role as the contact angle condition in the thin film equation. We consider two situations: The zero toughness ($K=0$) and the finite toughness $K\in(0,\infty)$ cases. In the first case, we prove the existence of self-similar solutions with constant mass. In the second case, we prove that for all $K\textgreater{}0$ there exists an injection rate for the fluid such that self-similar solutions exist.

Bigoni	  The constitutive modelling of granular, porous and quasi-brittle materials is based on yield (or damage) functions, which may exhibit features (for instance, lack of convexity, or branches where the values go to infinity, or false elastic domains) preventing the use of efficient return-mapping integration schemes. This problem is solved by proposing a general construction strategy to define an implicitly defined convex yield function starting from any convex yield surface. Based on this implicit definition of the yield function, a return-mapping integration scheme is implemented and tested for elastic-plastic (or -damaging) rate equations. The scheme is general and, although it introduces a numerical cost when compared to situations where the scheme is not needed, is demonstrated to perform correctly and accurately.

E. Camino|J. M. Tranquada|G. D. Gu	  Indium substitution turns the topological crystalline insulator (TCI) Pb$_{0.5}$Sn$_{0.5}$Te into a possible topological superconductor. To investigate the effect of the indium concentration on the crystal structure and superconducting properties of (Pb$_{0.5}$Sn$_{0.5}$)$_{1-x}$In$_{x}$Te, we have grown high-quality single crystals using a modified floating-zone method, and have performed systematic studies for indium content in the range $0\leq x\leq 0.35$. We find that the single crystals retain the rock salt structure up to the solubility limit of indium ($x\sim0.30$). Experimental dependences of the superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) and the upper critical magnetic field ($H_{c2}$) on the indium content $x$ have been measured. The maximum $T_c$ is determined to be 4.7 K at $x=0.30$, with $\mu_0H_{c2}(T=0)\approx 5$ T.

Pelkey	  In this article, the results from a series of muon flux measurements conducted at the Kimballton Underground Research Facility (KURF), Virginia, United States, are presented. The detector employed for these investigations, is made of plastic scintillator bars readout by wavelength shifting fibers and multianode photomultiplier tubes. Data was taken at several locations inside KURF, spanning rock overburden values from ~ 200 to 1450 m.w.e. From the extracted muon rates an empirical formula was devised, that estimates the muon flux inside the mine as a function of the overburden. The results are in good agreement with muon flux calculations based on analytical models and MUSIC.

Ciraci	  Silica or SiO$_2$, the main constituent of earth's rocks has several 3D complex crystalline and amorphous phases, but it does not have a graphite like layered structure in 3D. Our theoretical analysis and numerical calculations from the first-principles predict a single-layer honeycomb like allotrope, h$\alpha$-silica, which can be viewed to be derived from the oxidation of silicene and it has intriguing atomic structure with re-entrant bond angles in hexagons. It is a wide band gap semiconductor, which attains remarkable electromechanical properties showing geometrical changes under external electric field. In particular, it is an auxetic metamaterial with negative Poisson's ratio and has a high piezoelectric coefficient. While it can form stable bilayer and multilayer structures, its nanoribbons can show metallic or semiconducting behavior depending on their chirality. Coverage of dangling Si orbitals by foreign adatoms can attribute new functionalities to h$\alpha$-silica. In particular, Si$_2$O$_5$, where Si atoms are saturated by oxygen atoms from top and bottom sides alternatingly can undergo a structural transformation to make silicatene, another stable, single layer structure of silica.

Majumder	  Sub-relativistic magnetic monopoles are predicted from the GUT era by theory. To date there have been no confirmed observations of such exotic particles. The Iron CALorimeter (ICAL) at India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO) aims to measure the neutrino oscillation parameters precisely. As it is a tracking detector there is also the possibility of detecting magnetic monopoles in the sub-relativistic region. Using ICAL the magnetic monopole event is characterised by the large time intervals of upto 30 microsec between the signals in successive layers of the active detectors. The aim of this study is to identify the sensitivity of ICAL for a particle carrying magnetic charge in the mass range from 10^{5} to 10^{17} GeV with beta ranging from 10^{-5} to 9 x 10^{-1} for ICAL at INO. A similar study has also been carried out for the ICAL prototype which will be placed overground. Due to the rock cover of approximately 1.3 km, ICAL at INO will not be able to place bounds on the flux of the lower mass magnetic monopoles. This mass region is however addressed by the prototype ICAL.

It is very sensitive to microstructural changes and damage. The goal of this paper is to propose a physical model describing the longitudinal vibrations of this class of material, and to develop a numerical strategy for solving the evolution equations. The theory relies on the coupling between two processes with radically-different time scales: a fast process at the frequency of the excitation, governed by nonlinear elasticity and viscoelasticity; a slow process, governed by the evolution of defects. The evolution equations are written as a nonlinear hyperbolic system with relaxation. A time-domain numerical scheme is developed, based on a splitting strategy. The numerical simulations show qualitative agreement with the features observed experimentally by Dynamic Acousto-Elastic Testing.

In the giant strongly-connected component of the win/lose network, we find win-lose circulations similar to rock-paper-scissors and analyze the fixed point and its stability. Applying the network motif concept, we introduce dynamic motifs, which describe the population dynamics relations among the three strategies. Through exact enumeration, we find 22 dynamic motifs and display their phase portraits. Visualization using directed networks and motif analysis is a useful method to make complex dynamic behavior simple in order to understand it more intuitively. Dynamic motifs can be building blocks for dynamic behavior among strategies when they are applied to other types of games.

This process is accompanied by a luminous phenomena in the atmosphere, called bolides or fireballs. Observations of bolides provide pre-atmospheric orbits of meteorites, physical and chemical properties of small asteroids, and the flux (i.e. frequency of impacts) of bodies at the Earth in the centimeter to decameter size range. In this chapter we explain the processes occurring during the penetration of cosmic bodies through the atmosphere and review the methods of bolide observations. We compile available data on the fireballs associated with 22 instrumentally observed meteorite falls. Among them are the heterogeneous falls Almahata Sitta (2008 TC$_3$) and Bene\v{s}ov, which revolutionized our view on the structure and composition of small asteroids, the P\v{r}\'{\i}bram-Neuschwanstein orbital pair, carbonaceous chondrite meteorites with orbits on the asteroid-comet boundary, and the Chelyabinsk fall, which produced a damaging blast wave. While most meteoroids disrupt into fragments during atmospheric flight, the Carancas meteoroid remained nearly intact and caused a crater-forming explosion on the ground.

They are an important rock-forming mineral group, fundamentally distinct from silicates in Earth's crust in that carbon binds to three oxygen atoms, while silicon is bonded to four oxygens. Here, we present experimental evidence that under the sufficiently high pressures and high temperatures existing in the lower mantle, ferromagnesian carbonates transform to a phase with tetrahedrally coordinated carbons. Above 80 GPa, in situ synchrotron infrared experiments show the unequivocal spectroscopic signature of the high-pressure phase of (Mg,Fe)CO$_3$. Using ab-initio calculations, we assign the new IR signature to C-O bands associated with tetrahedrally coordinated carbon with asymmetric C-O bonds. Tetrahedrally coordinated carbonates are expected to exhibit substantially different reactivity than low pressure three-fold coordinated carbonates, as well as different chemical properties in the liquid state. Hence this may have significant implications on carbon reservoirs and fluxes and the global geodynamic carbon cycle.

Chou	  Following the identification of the pi bond in graphene, in this work, a pi bond constructed through side-to-side overlap of half-filled 6pz orbitals was observed in a non-carbon crystal of Pb1-xSnxSe (x=0.34) (PSS), a prototype topological crystalline insulator (TCI) and thermoelectric material with a high figure-of-merit (ZT). PSS compounds with a rock-salt type cubic crystal structure was found to consist of sigma bond connected covalent chains of Pb(Sn)-Se with an additional pi bond that is shared as a conjugated system among the four nearest neighbor Pb pairs in square symmetry within all (001) monoatomic layers per cubic unit cell. The pi bond formed with half-filled 6pz orbitals between Pb atoms is consistent with the calculated results from quantum chemistry. The presence of pi bonds was identified and verified with electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) through plasmonic excitations and electron density (ED) mapping via an inverse Fourier transform of X-ray diffraction.

Sultan	  The prediction of permeability (i.e., apparent permeability) for the shale gas is challenging due to the Klinkenberg slippage effect that depends on the pore size and gas pressure. A recent Monte Carlo molecular simulation method (i.e., DSBGK method) is employed to accurately compute the permeability by the pore-scale simulations at different pressures. The computed results of a benchmark problem proposed here are used to verify the accuracy of the simple Klinkenberg correlation model, which relates the permeability to the intrinsic permeability (i.e., liquid permeability) and pressure. The verification shows that the Klinkenberg correlation model as a fitting formula is appropriate for the industry applications since the relative error is small in the whole range of the flow regime as long as it has been calibrated for each particular rock sample at the two ends with low and high pressures, respectively, by determining the model parameters using accurate permeability data that can be obtained by the scheme presented herein.

Agapito|Laalitha S. I. Liyanage|Marco Buongiorno Nardelli	  We study the physical properties of Zn$X$ ($X$=O, S, Se, Te) and Cd$X$ ($X$=O, S, Se, Te) in the zinc-blende, rock-salt, and wurtzite structures using the recently developed fully $ab$ $initio$ pseudo-hybrid Hubbard density functional ACBN0. We find that both the electronic and vibrational properties of these wide-band gap semiconductors are systematically improved over the PBE values and reproduce closely the experimental measurements. Similar accuracy is found for the structural parameters, especially the bulk modulus. ACBN0 results compare well with hybrid functional calculations at a fraction of the computational cost.

We analyze the shapes and growth velocities of such fingers within the thin-front approximation, in which the reaction is assumed to take place instantaneously with the reactants fully consumed at the dissolution front. We concentrate on the case when the main flow is driven by the constant pressure gradient far from the finger, and the permeability contrast between the inside and the outside of the finger is finite. Using Ivantsov ansatz and conformal transformations we find the family of steadily translating fingers characterized by a parabolic shape. We derive the reactant concentration field and the pressure field inside and outside of the fingers and show that the flow within them is uniform. The advancement velocity of the finger is shown to be inversely proportional to its radius of curvature in the small P\'{e}clet number limit and constant for large P\'{e}clet numbers.

In this formulation, a probabilistic program is a black-box stochastic simulator for both the problem domain and the agent. We relate classic policy gradient techniques to recently introduced black-box variational methods which generalize to probabilistic program inference. We present case studies in the Canadian traveler problem, Rock Sample, and a benchmark for optimal diagnosis inspired by Guess Who. Each study illustrates how programs can efficiently represent policies using moderate numbers of parameters.

I. Bakiyanov|I. V. Florinsky	  Geophysical and geochemical anomalies may have a mutagenic effect on plants growing in active fault zones being the factors of evolutionary transformation of plant populations. To test this assumption we evaluated the mutation activity of a Lonicera caerulea natural population in one of the active fault zones in the Altai Mountains. We derived principal cytogenetic indices (i.e., mitotic, prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase indices as well as proportion and range of abnormal mitoses) for meristematic cells of Lonicera caerulea seedlings. We found that the local geological and geophysical environment (i.e., mineralogical composition of rocks and anomalies of the magnetic field) increases the mitotic activity and the number of abnormal mitoses in the meristematic cells. The results may help to clarify the role of environmental conditions of tectonically active regions in microevolutionary processes.

Zakharov|A. V. Leont'eva|A. Yu. Prokhorov	  We show that studying of low-frequency internal friction (LFIF) of solid samples at low temperatures allows determining the presence of various gases absorbed, for some reasons, in pores and caverns of the solids. The gases come over to a solid state (cryocrystals) and exist in the pores under corresponding thermodynamic conditions giving an additional contribution to the LFIF spectra. The spectra reflect the special points of the gases (temperatures of melting or phase transitions). This information gives a real opportunity for identification of gas in the matrix, i.e. the studied solids. This may be of great importance for investigations of cosmic or geological samples, for instance, asteroids, meteorites, rock formations, etc. The LFIF method allows identification of gas media surrounding the studied sample.

We find that in thin films with rock-salt ordering of Fe and Cr the ground state is characterised by C-type anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) order. This is in contrast to the bulk form of the material which was predicted to be a ferrimagnet with G-type AFM order. Furthermore, the cation ordered thin-films undergo a transition with epitaxial strain from C to A-type AFM order. Other magnetic orders appear as thermally accessible excited states. We also find that $B$-site cation disordered structures are more stable in coherent epitaxial strains thereby explaining the lowered magnetic moments observed in these samples at room temperature. Strain varies both the sign as well as strength of the Fe-Cr superexchange coupling resulting in a very interesting phase diagram for Bi$_2$FeCrO$_6$ thin films.

Meanwhile the existence of its three-dimensional analogue, known as the magnetic monopole, has been suggested by various indirect experimental sig- natures in MnGe compound. Theoretically, Ginzburg-Landau arguments in favor of the formation of a three-dimensional crystal of monopoles and anti-monopoles have been put forward, however no microscopic model Hamiltonian was shown to support such a phase. Here we present strong numerical evidence from Monte Carlo simulations for the formation of a rock-salt crystal structure of monopoles and anti-monopoles in short-period chiral magnets. Real-time simulation of the spin dynamics suggests there is only one collective mode in the monopole crystal state in the frequency range of several GHz for the material parameters of MnGe.

Nonequilibrium continuum thermodynamics provides a consistent way to describe all these aspects in a unified framework. This we present here in a formulation where the kinematic quantities allow arbitrary nonzero initial (e.g., in situ) stresses and such initial configurations which - as a consequence of thermal or remanent stresses - do not satisfy the kinematic compatibility condition. The various characteristic effects accounted by the obtained theory are illustrated via experimental results where loaded solid samples undergo elastic, thermal expansion and plastic deformation and exhibit rheological behaviour. From the experimental data, the rheological coefficients are determined, and the measured temperature changes are also explained by the theory.

Filip|Amir Abbas Haghighirad|Nobuya Sakai|Bernard Wenger|Henry J. Snaith|Feliciano Giustino	  Lead-based halide perovskites are emerging as the most promising class of materials for next generation optoelectronics. However, despite the enormous success of lead-halide perovskite solar cells, the issues of stability and toxicity are yet to be resolved. Here we report on the computational design and the experimental synthesis of a new family of Pb-free inorganic halide double-perovskites based on bismuth or antimony and noble metals. Using first-principles calculations we show that this hitherto unknown family of perovskites exhibits very promising optoelectronic properties, such as tunable band gaps in the visible range and low carrier effective masses. Furthermore, we successfully synthesize the double perovskite Cs2BiAgCl6, we perform structural refinement using single-crystal X-ray diffraction, and we characterize its optical properties via optical absorption and photoluminescence measurements. This new perovskite belongs to the Fm-3m space group, and consists of BiCl6 and AgCl6 octahedra alternating in a rock-salt face-centered cubic structure. From UV-Vis and PL measurements we obtain an indirect gap of 2.2 eV. The new compound is very stable under ambient conditions.

For this purpose, an adaptation of the existing 21CM Array (China) is presently under achievment. In an exceptionally low electromagnetic noise level, 10160 log-periodic 50-200 MHz antennas sit along two high valleys, surrounded by mountain chains. This lay-out results in 30-60 km effective rock thicnesses for neutrino interactions with low incidence trajectories along the direction of two 4-6 km baselines. We will present first in-situ radio measurements demonstrating that this environment shows particularly favourable conditions for the observation of electromagnetic decay signals of taus originating from the interaction of 10^17-20 eV tau neutrinos.

We show that the majority of the pieces reveal characteristics that allow us to classify them as physical processes called the 1/f (pink) noise. However, this is not true for classical music represented here by Frederic Chopin's works and for some jazz pieces that are much more correlated than the pink noise. We also perform a multifractal (MFDFA) analysis of these music pieces. We show that all the pieces reveal multifractal properties. The richest multifractal structures are observed for pop and rock music. Also the viariably of multifractal features is best visible for popular music genres. This can suggest that, from the multifractal perspective, classical and jazz music is much more uniform than pieces of the most popular genres of music.

Liu|S. K. Bose|J. Kudrnovský	  This work presents results for the magnetic properties of the compound GeTe doped with 3d transition metals V, Cr and Mn from the viewpoint of potential application in spintronics. We report a systematic density-functional study of the electronic structure, magnetic and cohesive properties of these ternary compounds in both rock salt and zinc blende structures. In both cases, it is the Ge sublattice that is doped with the three transition metals. Some of these compounds are found to be half-metallic at their optimized cell volumes. For these particular cases, we calculate both exchange interactions and the Curie temperatures in order to provide some theoretical guidance to experimentalists trying to fabricate materials suitable for spintronic devices. Discussions relating our results to the existing experimental studies are provided whenever applicable and appropriate. Apparent discrepancy between experimental observations and our theoretical result for the case of Mn-doping is discussed in detail, pointing out various physical reasons and possible resolutions of the apparent discrepancy.

Their creep functions, which are known in a closed form, share a similar time dependence and asymptotic behavior. This is also found for the relaxation functions, obtained by solving numerically a Volterra equation of the second kind. We show that the two rheologies constitute a clear example of broadly similar creep and relaxation patterns associated with neatly distinct retardation spectra, for which analytical expressions are available.

Hamacher|Reg Abrahams	  Wurdi Youang is an egg-shaped Aboriginal stone arrangement in Victoria, Australia. Here we present a new survey of the site, and show that its major axis is aligned within a few degrees of east-west. We confirm a previous hypothesis that it contains alignments to the position on the horizon of the setting sun at the equinox and the solstices, and show that two independent sets of indicators are aligned in these directions. We show that these alignments are unlikely to have arisen by chance, and instead the builders of this stone arrangement appear to have deliberately aligned the site on astronomically significant positions.

Laughlin	  Close-in super-Earths, with radii R = 2-5 R_Earth and orbital periods P < 100 days, orbit more than half, and perhaps nearly all Sun-like stars in the universe. We use this omnipresent population to construct the minimum-mass extrasolar nebula (MMEN), the circumstellar disk of solar-composition solids and gas from which such planets formed, if they formed near their current locations and did not migrate. In a series of back-of-the-envelope calculations, we demonstrate how in-situ formation in the MMEN is fast, efficient, and can reproduce many of the observed properties of close-in super-Earths, including their gas-to-rock fractions. Testable predictions are discussed.

Seo|I. Pletikosic|T. Valla|G. D. Gu|A. Yazdani	  Topological crystalline insulators represent a novel topological phase of matter in which the surface states are protected by discrete point group-symmetries of the underlying lattice. Rock-salt lead-tin-selenide alloy is one possible realization of this phase which undergoes a topological phase transition upon changing the lead content. We used scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) to probe the surface states on (001) Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$Se in the topologically non-trivial (x=0.23) and topologically trivial (x=0) phases. We observed quasiparticle interference with STM on the surface of the topological crystalline insulator and demonstrated that the measured interference can be understood from ARPES studies and a simple band structure model. Furthermore, our findings support the fact that Pb$_{0.77}$Sn$_{0.23}$Se and PbSe have different topological nature.

Krasnenko|M. G. Brik	  The structural, electronic, and elastic properties of three mixed transition metal carbonitrides TiNxC1-x, ZrNxC1-x, and HfNxC1-x (0<x<1) with the rock-salt structure were calculated at ambient and elevated up to 50 GPa hydrostatic pressures in the framework of the density functional theory methods. The lattice constants, densities, and bulk moduli of the considered compounds were shown to behave as linear functions of the nitrogen concentration x. The obtained linear dependencies of all these parameters allow for getting their estimates at any value of x in the range from 0 to 1. Gradual enhancement of the ionicity of the chemical bonds with gradual replacement of carbon by nitrogen was demonstrated by calculating the bond orders and electron density difference distributions.

This paper includes not only necessary ethnological data, but also some results on the archaeoastronomy. The research of some lines marked on a stone calendar from the Mataveri area, an archaic zone of the bird-man cult, allows to insist that the natives watched at least the stars Canopus and Aldebaran. There are strong grounds for believing that, among others, the Sun, the Moon as well as Beta and Alpha Centauri were the matter for quasi-scientific enquiry.

In particular, they give rise to non-quasiparticle states above (or below) the Fermi energy at finite temperatures that reduce the spin polarization and, as a consequence, the efficiency of spintronics devices. Employing the constrained random-phase approximation (cRPA) within the full-potential linearized augmented-plane-wave (FLAPW) method using maximally localized Wannier functions, we calculate the strength of the effective on-site Coulomb interaction (Hubbard $U$ and Hund exchange $J$) between localized electrons in different classes of HM magnets considering: (i) \emph{sp}-electron ferromagnets in rock-salt structure, (ii) zincblende 3\emph{d} binary ferromagnets, as well as (iii) ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic semi- and full-Heusler compounds.

Oliveira	  In this work we investigate the development of stable dynamical structures along interfaces separating domains belonging to enemy partnerships, in the context of cyclic predator-prey models with an even number of species $N \ge 8$. We use both stochastic and field theory simulations in one and two spatial dimensions, as well as analytical arguments, to describe the association at the interfaces of mutually neutral individuals belonging to enemy partnerships and to probe their role in the development of the dynamical structures at the interfaces. We identify an interesting behaviour associated to the symmetric or asymmetric evolution of the interface profiles depending on whether $N/2$ is odd or even, respectively. We also show that the macroscopic evolution of the interface network is not very sensitive internal structure of the interfaces. Although this work focus on cyclic predator prey-models with an even number of species, we argue that the results are expected to be quite generic in the context of spatial stochastic May-Leonard models.

Mundy|Javier Junquera|Philippe Ghosez|Xiaoxing Xi|Kyle M. Shen|David A. Muller|Darrell G. Schlom	  Complex oxide heterostructures display some of the most chemically abrupt, atomically precise interfaces, which is advantageous when constructing new interface phases with emergent properties by juxtaposing incompatible ground states. One might assume that atomically precise interfaces result from stoichiometric growth, but here we show that the most precise control is obtained for non-stoichiometric growth where differing surface energies can be compensated by surfactant-like effects. For the precise growth of Sr$_{n+1}$Ti$_n$O$_{3n+1}$ Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) phases, stoichiometric deposition leads to the loss of the first RP rock-salt double layer, but growing with a strontium-rich surface layer restores the bulk stoichiometry and ordering of the subsurface RP structure. Our results dramatically expand the materials that can be prepared in epitaxial heterostructures with precise interface control---from just the $n=\infty$ end members (perovskites) to the entire RP family---enabling the exploration of novel quantum phenomena at a richer variety of oxide interfaces.

Kirsch|Hannes Payer|Harald Röck|Ana Sokolova	  We study, formally and experimentally, the trade-off in temporal and spatial overhead when managing contiguous blocks of memory using the explicit, dynamic and real-time heap management system Compact-fit (CF). The key property of CF is that temporal and spatial overhead can be bounded, related, and predicted in constant time through the notion of partial and incremental compaction. Partial compaction determines the maximally tolerated degree of memory fragmentation. Incremental compaction of objects, introduced here, determines the maximal amount of memory involved in any, logically atomic, portion of a compaction operation. We explore CF's potential application space on (1) multiprocessor and multicore systems as well as on (2) memory-constrained uniprocessor systems. For (1), we argue that little or no compaction is likely to avoid the worst case in temporal as well as spatial overhead but also observe that scalability only improves by a constant factor. Scalability can be further improved significantly by reducing overall data sharing through separate instances of Compact-fit. For (2), we observe that incremental compaction can effectively trade-off throughput and memory fragmentation for lower latency.

Using the tilting and twisting angles of X-ray diffraction rocking curves, we quantitatively analyzed the crystallinity of each film. We found that the optimal deposition rate, which could be tuned by pulse energy, was independent of laser wavelength. The high-quality film grown at the optimal pulse energy (i.e., the optimum deposition rate) exhibited high critical current density over 1 MA/cm2 irrespective of the laser wavelength.

Bigoni	  Inelastic deformation of ceramic powders (and of a broad class of rock-like and granular materials), can be described with the yield function proposed by Bigoni and Piccolroaz (2004, Yield criteria for quasibrittle and frictional materials. Int. J. Solids and Structures, 41, 2855-2878). This yield function is not defined outside the yield locus, so that 'gradient-based' integration algorithms of elastoplasticity cannot be directly employed. Therefore, we propose two ad hoc algorithms: (i.) an explicit integration scheme based on a forward Euler technique with a 'centre-of-mass' return correction and (ii.) an implicit integration scheme based on a 'cutoff-substepping' return algorithm. Iso-error maps and comparisons of the results provided by the two algorithms with two exact solutions (the compaction of a ceramic powder against a rigid spherical cup and the expansion of a thick spherical shell made up of a green body), show that both the proposed algorithms perform correctly and accurately.

By applying the proposed method to ternary chalcogenide alloys, we predict a substantial robustness of spectral features close to the Fermi energy against substitutional disorder. Supplementing our first-principles calculations with the analysis of the $k \cdot p$ model for rock-salt chalcogenides, we show that the disorder self-energy is vanishingly small close to the band gap, thus allowing for bulk Rashba-like spin splitting to be observed in ferroelectric alloys, such as PbS$_x$Te$_{1-x}$, and protecting the band-character inversion related to the topological transition in the recently discovered Topological Crystalline Insulator Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$Te.

Wiegert	  <Abridged> The impact of a meteoroid onto an asteroid transfers linear and angular momentum to the larger body, which may affect its orbit and its rotational state. Here we show that the meteoroid environment of our Solar System can have an effect on small asteroids that is comparable to the Yarkovsky and Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack (YORP) effects under certain conditions.   The momentum content of the meteoroids themselves is expected to generate an effect much smaller than that of the Yarkovsky effect. However, momentum transport by ejecta may increase the net effective force by two orders of magnitude for impacts into bare rock surfaces. This result is sensitive to the extrapolation of laboratory microcratering experiment results to real meteoroid-asteroid collisions and needs further study. If this extrapolation holds, then meteoroid impacts are more important to the dynamics of small asteroids than had previously been considered.

For obvious reasons there is a great interest to study these processes for materials that are used in satellite construction. However, also the influence of particle and electromagnetic radiation on the weathering of extraterrestrial rocks and on organic and biological tissues is the research topic of various scientific disciplines. To strengthen the comprehensive and systematic investigation of degradation processes a new laboratory, the complex irradiation facility (CIF), has been designed, set up, tested, and put into operation at the DLR-Institute of Space Systems in Bremen (Germany). The CIF allows the simultaneous irradiation with three light sources and with a dual beam irradiation system for the bombardment of materials with electrons and protons having energies up to 100 keV. It is eminently suitable to perform a large variety of irradiation procedures that are similar to those which appear at different distances to the Sun. This paper is devoted to potential users in order to inform them about the capabilities of the CIF.

In this context, the LAGO project, begun in 2005 with the aim of studying the high-energy component of gamma ray bursts (GRBs). This observatory consists of different arrays of water-Cherenkov detectors installed in high altitude mountains throughout Latin America. Recently, it has demonstrated the feasibility of conducting studies on the solar modulation of the galactic cosmic ray flux. Currently more than 80 scientists and students from Mexico, Guatemala, Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia and Argentina are integrated into the LAGO Collaboration. The high level of regional integration in the scientific community reached thanks to this kind of major projects, has led to the recent formation of the CLES (Consorcio Latinoamericano de Experimentos Subterr\'{a}neos). This organization promotes the creation and installation of the ANDES Underground Laboratory to be built inside the projected International Agua Negra tunnel between Argentina and Chile. The ANDES laboratory with over 1750 meters of rock cover, will be the first laboratory of its kind to be installed in the Southern Hemisphere.

This has led to development and use of empirical equations like Tixier, Timur, among others. In order to improve the inference of permeability we used a hybrid Neuro-Fuzzy System (NFS). The NFS allowed us to infer permeability of well, from data of porosity ($\phi$) and water saturation ($Sw$). The work was performed with data from wells VCL-1021 (P21) and VCL-950 (P50), Block III, Maracaibo Lake, Venezuela. We evaluated the NFS equations ($k_{P50,i}(\phi_i,Sw_i)$) with neighboring well data ($P21$), in order to verify the validity of the equations in the area. We have used ANFIS in MatLab.

While unstructured grids allow for a more efficient geometrical representation of complex boundaries, the lattice Boltzmann methods is often implemented using regular grids. Here we analyze two implementations of the lattice Boltzmann method on unstructured grids, the standard forward Euler method and the operator splitting method. We derive the evolution of the macroscopic variables by means of the Chapman-Enskog expansion, and we prove that it yields the Navier-Stokes equation and is first order accurate in terms of the temporal discretization and second order in terms of the spatial discretization. Relations between the kinetic viscosity and the integration time step are derived for both the Euler method and the operator splitting method. Finally we suggest an improved version of the bounce-back boundary condition. We test our implementations in both standard benchmark geometries and in the pore network of a real sample of a porous rock.

Jackson|Dimitri Veras|Mark Wyatt	  The Oort cloud is usually thought of as a collection of icy comets inhabiting the outer reaches of the Solar system, but this picture is incomplete. We use simulations of the formation of the Oort cloud to show that ~4% of the small bodies in the Oort cloud should have formed within 2.5 au of the Sun, and hence be ice-free rock-iron bodies. If we assume these Oort cloud asteroids have the same size distribution as their cometary counterparts, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope should find roughly a dozen Oort cloud asteroids during ten years of operations. Measurement of the asteroid fraction within the Oort cloud can serve as an excellent test of the Solar system's formation and dynamical history. Oort cloud asteroids could be of particular concern as impact hazards as their high mass density, high impact velocity, and low visibility make them both hard to detect and hard to divert or destroy. However, they should be a rare class of object, and we estimate globally catastrophic collisions should only occur about once per billion years.

Trodahl|B. J. Ruck|F. Natali	  We report the growth by molecular beam epitaxy of highly resistive GdN, using intentional doping with magnesium. Mg-doped GdN layers with resistivities of 1000 {\Omega}.cm and carrier concentrations of 10E16 cm-3 are obtained for films with Mg concentrations up to 5 x 10E19 atoms/cm3. X-ray diffraction rocking curves indicate that Mg-doped GdN films have crystalline quality very similar to undoped GdN films, showing that the Mg doping did not affect the structural properties of the films. A decrease of the Curie temperature with decreasing the electron density is observed, supporting a recently suggested magnetic polaron scenario [F. Natali et al., Phys. Rev. B 87, 035202 (2013)]. 	
1411.5564v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.5564v1	2014	Climate Stability of Habitable Earth-like Planets	Kristen Menou	  The carbon-silicate cycle regulates the atmospheric $CO_2$ content of terrestrial planets on geological timescales through a balance between the rates of $CO_2$ volcanic outgassing and planetary intake from rock weathering. It is thought to act as an efficient climatic thermostat on Earth and, by extension, on other habitable planets. If, however, the weathering rate increases with the atmospheric $CO_2$ content, as expected on planets lacking land vascular plants, the carbon-silicate cycle feedback can become severely limited. Here we show that Earth-like planets receiving less sunlight than current Earth may no longer possess a stable warm climate but instead repeatedly cycle between unstable glaciated and deglaciated climatic states. This has implications for the search for life on exoplanets in the habitable zone of nearby stars.

Bui|Jayantha Kodikara	  A mix-mode cohesive fracture model considering tension, compression and shear material behaviour is presented, which has wide applications to geotechnical problems. The model considers both elastic and inelastic displacements. Inelastic displacement comprises fracture and plastic displacements. The norm of inelastic displacement is used to control the fracture behaviour. Meantime, a failure function describing the fracture strength is proposed. Using the internal programming FISH, the cohesive fracture model is programmed into a hybrid distinct element algorithm as encoded in Universal Distinct Element Code (UDEC). The model is verified through uniaxial tension and direct shear tests. The developed model is then applied to model the behaviour of a uniaxial compression test on Gosford sandstone. The modelling results indicate that the proposed cohesive fracture model is capable of simulating combined failure behaviour applicable to rock.

The supervised pattern recognition is thus based on the theory of continuous belief functions, which is a way to consider imprecision and uncertainty of data. The distributions of features are supposed to be unimodal and estimated by a single Gaussian and $\alpha$-stable model. Experimental results are first obtained from synthetic data by combining two features of one dimension and by considering a vector of two features. Mass functions are calculated from plausibility functions by using the generalized Bayes theorem. The same study is applied to the automatic classification of three types of sea floor (rock, silt and sand) with features acquired by a mono-beam echo-sounder. We evaluate the quality of the $\alpha$-stable model and the Gaussian model by analyzing qualitative results, using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (K-S test), and quantitative results with classification rates. The performances of the belief classifier are compared with a Bayesian approach.

A new type of topological band crossing termed `linked nodal rings' is found in LaN when the small spin-orbital coupling (SOC) on nitrogen orbitals is neglected. Turning on SOC gaps the nodal rings at all but two points, which remain gapless due to $C_4$-symmetry and leads to a 3D Dirac semimetal. Interestingly, unlike LaN, compounds with other elements in the pnictogen group are found to be topological insulators (TIs), as a result of band reordering due to the increased lattice constant as well as the enhanced SOC on the pnictogen atom. These TI compounds exhibit multi-valley surface Dirac cones at three $\bar{M}$-points on the $(111)$-surface.

Beyond the characteristic size of disorder, the roughness profiles are found to exhibit self-affine scaling features evolving with porosity. Starting from a null value and increasing the porosity, we quantitatively modify the self-affine scaling properties from anisotropic (at low porosity) to isotropic (for porosity larger than 10 %).

Shrivastava|K. G. Bhushan	  Radiation background studies pertaining to $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay in $^{124}$Sn have been carried out. A TiLES setup has been installed at TIFR for this purpose. Neutron-induced background is studied in the TIN.TIN detector materials using fast neutron activation technique. The neutron flux ($E_n\leq15$ MeV) resulting from SF and ($\alpha, n$) interactions for the rock in the INO cavern is estimated using MC simulations. A two layer composite shield of borated paraffin (20 cm) + Pb (5 cm) is proposed for the reduction of neutron flux.

In order to assess the instrumental performance of APXS, a ground verification test was done for two unknown samples (basaltic rock, mixed powder sample). In this paper, the details of the experiment configurations and data analysis method are presented. The results show that the elemental abundance of major elements can be well determined by the APXS with relative deviations < 15 wt. % (detection distance = 30 mm, acquisition time = 30 min). The derived detection limit of each major element is inversely proportional to acquisition time and directly proportional to detection distance, suggesting that the appropriate distance should be < 50mm. 	
1506.00463v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.00463v1	2015	Geometric theory of inversion and seismic imaging	August Lau|Chuan Yin	  The goal of inversion is to estimate the model which generates the data of observations with a specific modeling equation.   One general approach to inversion is to use optimization methods which are algebraic in nature to define an objective function. This is the case for objective functions like minimizing RMS of amplitude, residual traveltime error in tomography, cross correlation and sometimes mixing different norms (e.g. L1 of model + L2 of RMS error).   Algebraic objective function assumes that the optimal solution will come up with the correct geometry. It is sometimes difficult to understand how one number (error of the fit) could miraculously come up with the detail geometry of the earth model. If one models the earth as binary rock parameters (only two values for velocity variation), one could see that the geometry of the rugose boundaries of the geobodies might not be solvable by inversion using algebraic objective function.

HPC system users often have no guarantee that they will be able to reproduce results at a later point in time, even on the same system-software may have been upgraded, removed, or recompiled under their feet, and they have little hope of being able to reproduce the same software environment elsewhere. We present GNU Guix and the functional package management paradigm and show how it can improve reproducibility and sharing among researchers with representative use cases.

Artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques can be leveraged for better mission planning. This paper describes the coordinated use of both global navigation and metaheuristic optimization algorithms to plan the safe, efficient missions. The aim is to determine the least-cost combination of a safe landing zone (LZ) and global path plan, where avoiding terrain hazards for the lander and rover minimizes cost. Computer vision methods were used to identify surface craters, mounds, and rocks as obstacles. Multiple search methods were investigated for the rover global path plan. Several combinatorial optimization algorithms were implemented to select the shortest distance path as the preferred mission plan. Simulations were run for a sample Google Lunar X Prize mission. The result of this study is an optimization scheme that path plans with the A* search method, and uses simulated annealing to select ideal LZ-path- goal combination for the mission. Simulation results show the methods are effective in minimizing the risk of hazards and increasing efficiency. This paper is specific to a lunar mission, but the resulting architecture may be applied to a large variety of planetary missions and rovers.

Two extinct radioactivites (129I, T1/2 = 15.6 Ma, and 244Pu, T1/2 = 80 Ma) have produced radiogenic 129Xe and fissiogenic 131-136Xe, respectively, within the Earth, which related isotope fingerprints are seen in the compositions of mantle and atmospheric Xe. Recent studies of Archean rocks suggest that xenon atoms have been lost from the Earth's atmosphere and isotopically fractionated during long periods of geological time, until at least the end of the Archean eon. Here we build a model that takes into account these results. Correction for Xe loss permits to compute new closure ages for the Earth's atmosphere that are in agreement with those computed for mantle Xe. The minimum Xe formation interval for the Earth- atmosphere is 40 (-10+20) Ma after start of solar system formation, which may also date the Moon-forming impact.

Leinhardt	  Erosive collisions among planetary embryos in the inner solar system can lead to multiple remnant bodies, varied in mass, composition and residual velocity. Some of the smaller, unbound debris may become available to seed the main asteroid belt. The makeup of these collisionally produced bodies is different from the canonical chondritic composition, in terms of rock/iron ratio and may contain further shock-processed material. Having some of the material in the asteroid belt owe its origin from collisions of larger planetary bodies may help in explaining some of the diversity and oddities in composition of different asteroid groups.

As a result, regions of fresh subsurface material can be exposed. Therefore, we searched for color variation on small and fast rotating asteroids. We describe a novel technique in which the asteroid is simultaneously observed in the visible and near-IR wavelength range. In this technique, brightness changes due to atmospheric extinction effects can be calibrated across the visible and near-IR images. We use V- and J-band filters since the distinction in color between weathered and unweathered surfaces on ordinary chondrite-like bodies is most prominent at these wavelengths and can reach ~25%. To test our method, we observed 3 asteroids with Cerro Tololo's 1.3 m telescope. We find ~5% variation of the mean V-J color, but do not find any clearly repeating color signature through multiple rotations. This suggests that no landslides occurred within the timescale of space weathering, or that Landslides occurred but the exposed patches are too small for the measurements' uncertainty.

More specifically, we consider reparametrization invariant metrics $G$ on the space $\operatorname{Imm}(S^1,\mathbb R^2)$ of parametrized regular curves. For many metrics the tangent space $T_c\operatorname{Imm}(S^1,\mathbb R^2)$ at each curve $c$ splits into vertical and horizontal components (with respect to the projection onto the shape space $B_i(S^1,\mathbb R^2)=\operatorname{Imm}(S^1,\mathbb R^2)/\operatorname{Diff}(S^1)$ of unparametrized curves and with respect to the metric $G$). In a previous article we characterized all metrics $G$ such that the induced splitting coincides with the natural splitting into normal and tangential parts. In these notes we extend this analysis to characterize all metrics that induce any prescribed splitting of the tangent bundle.

Vartanyants	  Variation of the phase of the beam transmitted through a crystalline material as a function of the rocking angle is a well known dynamical effect in x-ray scattering. Unfortunately, it is not so easy to measure directly these phase variations in a conventional scattering experiment. It was recently suggested that the transmitted phase can be directly measured in ptychography experiments performed on nanocrystal samples. Results of such experiment for different crystal thickness, reflections and incoming photon energies, in principle, can be fully described in the frame of dynamical theory. However, dynamical theory does not provide a simple analytical expression for the further analysis. We develop here quasi-kinematical theory approach that allows to describe correctly the phase of the transmitted beam for the crystal thickness less than extinction length that is beyond applicability of the conventional kinematical theory.

In LaBi, a semimetal with a band inversion equivalent to a topological insulator, we observe surface state like behavior in the magnetoresistance. The electrons responsible for this pseudo two dimensional transport, however, originate from the bulk states rather topological surface states, which is witnessed by the angle dependent quantum oscillations of the magnetoresistance and ab initio calculations. As a consequence, the magnetoresistance exhibits strong anisotropy with large amplitude (~ 10^5 %).

Haldolaarachchige|R. J. Cava	  The recent discovery of extreme magnetoresistance in LaSb introduced lanthanum monopnictides as a new platform to study topological semimetals (TSMs). In this work we report the discovery of extreme magnetoresistance in LaBi, confirming lanthanum monopnictides as a promising family of TSMs. These binary compounds with the simple rock-salt structure are ideal model systems to search for the origin of extreme magnetoresistance. Through a comparative study of magnetotransport effects in LaBi and LaSb, we construct a triangular temperature-field phase diagram that illustrates how a magnetic field tunes the electronic behavior in these materials. We show that the triangular phase diagram can be generalized to other topological semimetals with different crystal structures and different chemical compositions. By comparing our experimental results to band structure calculations, we suggest that extreme magnetoresistance in LaBi and LaSb originates from a particular orbital texture on their qasi-2D Fermi surfaces. The orbital texture, driven by spin-orbit coupling, is likely to be a generic feature of various topological semimetals.

Current low-frequency (0.05 T) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) laboratory and logging methods are incapable of quantitatively separating the different phases. We demonstrate the utility of high-field (9 T) NMR 2D T1-T2 measurements for separating hydrocarbon and the clay-interacting aqueous phases in shale based on the difference in the frequency dependence of the spin-lattice relaxation time. Furthermore, we demonstrate 23Na NMR as a promising complementary technique to conventional 1H NMR for shale fluid typing, taking advantage of the fact that sodium ions are only present in the aqueous phase. We validate high-field (9 T) 23Na-1H NMR relaxometry for assessing brine-filled porosity and brine salinity in various porous materials, including porous glass, conventional rocks, clays, and shale, and apply it for differentiating hydrocarbon versus aqueous components and also the clay-associated versus free water in Eagle Ford shale cores. This work lays the groundwork for developing future downhole 23Na-1H NMR logging techniques.

Moram	  We have performed density functional calculations on the group II-IV nitride MgSiN$_{2}$. At a pressure of about 20~GPa the ground state wurtzite derived MgSiN$_{2}$ structure (LP-MgSiN$_{2}$) transforms into a rock-salt derived structure (HP-MgSiN$_{2}$) in agreement with previous theoretical and experimental studies. Both phases are wide band gap semiconductors with indirect band gaps at equilibrium of 5.58 eV (LP-MgSiN$_{2}$) and 5.87 eV (HP-MgSiN$_{2}$), respectively. As the pressure increases, the band gaps become larger for both phases, however, the band gap in LP-MgSiN$_{2}$ increases faster than the gap in HP-MgSiN$_{2}$ and with a high enough pressure the band gap in LP-MgSiN$_{2}$ becomes larger than the band gap in HP-MgSiN$_{2}$.

Shchegolev|V. P. Sulakov	  It is known that neutron background is a big problem for low-background experiments in underground Laboratories. Our global net of en-detectors sensitive to thermal neutrons includes the detectors running both on the surface and at different depths underground. We present here results obtained with the en-detector of 0.75 m^2 which is running more than 3 years in underground room at a depth of 25 m of water equivalent in Skobeltsyn Institute of Nuclear Physics, Moscow. Spontaneous increases in thermal neutron flux up to a factor of 3 were observed in delayed anti-correlation with barometric pressure. The phenomenon can be explained by a radon barometric pumping effect resulting in similar effect in neutron flux produced in (alpha,n)-reactions by alpha-decays of radon and its daughters in surrounding rock

Castro	  The stability of heteroclinic cycles may be obtained from the value of the local stability index along each connection of the cycle. We establish a way of calculating the local stability index for quasi-simple cycles: cycles whose connections are 1-dimensional and contained in flow-invariant spaces of equal dimension. These heteroclinic cycles exist both in symmetric and non-symmetric contexts. We make one assumption on the dynamics along the connections to ensure that the transition matrices have a convenient form. Our method applies to all simple heteroclinic cycles of type Z and to various heteroclinic cycles arising in population dynamics, namely non-simple heteroclinic cycles, as well as to cycles that are part of a heteroclinic network. We illustrate our results with a non-simple cycle present in a heteroclinic network of the Rock-Scissors-Paper game.

Ronning	  There has been considerable interest in topological semi-metals that exhibit extreme magnetoresistance (XMR). These have included materials lacking inversion symmetry such as TaAs, as well Dirac semi-metals such as Cd3As2. However, it was reported recently that LaSb and LaBi also exhibit XMR, even though the rock-salt structure of these materials has inversion symmetry, and the band-structure calculations do not show a Dirac dispersion in the bulk. Here, we present magnetoresistance and specific heat measurements on NdSb, which is isostructural with LaSb. NdSb has an antiferromagnetic groundstate, and in analogy with the lanthanum monopnictides, is expected to be a topologically non-trivial semi-metal. We show that NdSb has an XMR of 10^4 %, even within the AFM state, illustrating that XMR can occur independently of the absence of time reversal symmetry breaking in zero magnetic field. The persistence of XMR in a magnetic system offers promise of new functionality when combining topological matter with electronic correlations. We also find that in an applied magnetic field below the Neel temperature there is a first order transition, consistent with evidence from previous neutron scattering work.

Kite|Bruce Fegley Jr.|Laura Schaefer|Eric Gaidos	  We provide estimates of atmospheric pressure and surface composition on short-period rocky exoplanets with dayside magma pools and silicate vapor atmospheres. Atmospheric pressure tends toward vapor-pressure equilibrium with surface magma, and magma-surface composition is set by the competing effects of fractional vaporization and surface-interior exchange. We use basic models to show how surface-interior exchange is controlled by the planet's temperature, mass, and initial composition. We assume that mantle rock undergoes bulk melting to form the magma pool, and that winds flow radially away from the substellar point. With these assumptions, we find that: (1) atmosphere-interior exchange is fast when the planet's bulk-silicate FeO concentration is low, and slow when FeO concentration is high; (2) magma pools are compositionally well-mixed for substellar temperatures $\lesssim$ 2400 K, but compositionally variegated and rapidly variable for substellar temperatures $\gtrsim$ 2400 K; (3) currents within the magma pool tend to cool the top of the solid mantle ("tectonic refrigeration"); (4) contrary to earlier work, many magma planets have time-variable surface compositions.

Averbukh	  Mountain echoes are a well-known phenomenon, where an impulse excitation is mirrored by the rocks to generate a replica of the original stimulus, often with reverberating recurrences. For spin echoes in magnetic resonance and photon echoes in atomic and molecular systems the role of the mirror is played by a second, time delayed pulse which is able to reverse the ow of time and recreate the original event. Recently, laser-induced rotational alignment and orientation echoes were introduced for molecular gases, and discussed in terms of rotational-phase-space filamentation. Here we present, for the first time, a direct spatiotemporal analysis of various molecular alignment echoes by means of coincidence Coulomb explosion imaging. We observe hitherto unreported spatially rotated echoes, that depend on the polarization direction of the pump pulses, and find surprising imaginary echoes at negative times.

SNO+ will be the first long baseline experiment to measure a reactor signal dominated by CANDU cores ($\sim$55\% of the total reactor signal), which generally burn natural uranium. Approximately 18\% of the total geoneutrino signal is generated by the U and Th present in the rocks of the Huronian Supergroup-Sudbury Basin: the 60\% uncertainty on the signal produced by this lithologic unit plays a crucial role on the discrimination power on the mantle signal as well as on the geoneutrino spectral shape reconstruction, which can in principle provide a direct measurement of the Th/U ratio in the Earth.

Our algorithm does not rely on prior knowledge of the foothold, but information about an expected foothold can be used to improve the stepping performance. After a step is taken, the robot explores the new contact surface by attempting to shift the center of pressure around the foot. The available foothold is inferred by the way in which the foot rotates about contact edges and/or by the achieved center of pressure locations on the foot during exploration. This estimated contact area is then used by a whole body momentum-based control algorithm. To walk and balance on partial footholds, we combine fast, dynamic stepping with the use of upper body angular momentum to regain balance. We applied this method to the Atlas humanoid designed by Boston Dynamics to walk over small contact surfaces, such as line and point contacts. We present experimental results and discuss performance limitations.

Contreras-Torres	  The stress-strain anisotropy -including both elastic properties and dislocation distributions- of crystalline systems can be studied using a dislocation model proposed by Ung\'ar and Borb\'ely. However this model requires fundamental parameters (i.e., contrast factors), which take into account both the elastic properties and symmetry for each system. In this study, such contrast factors were calculated from first principles for cubic slip-systems through the evaluation of the distortion tensor in a dislocation-dependent coordinate set. Moreover, a straightforward expression for the computation of contrast factors is provided. Further analysis of the microstructural parameters was carried out using the modified Williamson-Hall method to characterize rock-salt materials.

We develop a means to estimate thermal inertia values of asteroids and use it to show that thermal inertia appears to increase with spin period in the case of main-belt asteroids (MBAs). Similar behavior is found on the basis of thermophysical modeling for near-Earth objects (NEOs). We interpret our results in terms of rapidly increasing material density and thermal conductivity with depth, and provide evidence that thermal inertia increases by factors of 10 (MBAs) to 20 (NEOs) within a depth of just 10 cm. Our results are consistent with a very general picture of rapidly changing material properties in the topmost regolith layers of asteroids and have important implications for calculations of the Yarkovsky effect, including its perturbation of the orbits of potentially hazardous objects and those of asteroid family members after the break-up event. Evidence of a rapid increase of thermal inertia with depth is also an important result for studies of the ejecta-enhanced momentum transfer of impacting vehicles ("kinetic impactors") in planetary defense.

We show that thermal phase curve observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) from 5-12 microns can be used to test the existence of such an atmosphere. We predict the thermal variation for a bare rock versus a planet with 35% heat redistribution to the nightside and show that a JWST phase curve measurement can distinguish between these cases at $4\sigma$ confidence, assuming photon-limited precision. We also consider the case of an Earth-like atmosphere, and find that the ozone 9.8 micron band could be detected with longer integration times (a few months). We conclude that JWST observations have the potential to put the first constraints on the possibility of life around the nearest star to the Solar System.

The computational challenge is due to the high-dimensional random effects and because Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms for these models tend to be slow mixing. Moreover, spatial confounding inflates the variance of fixed effect (regression coefficient) estimates. Our approach addresses both the computational and confounding issues by replacing the high-dimensional spatial random effects with a reduced-dimensional representation based on random projections. Standard MCMC algorithms mix well and the reduced-dimensional setting speeds up computations per iteration. We show, via simulated examples, that Bayesian inference for this reduced-dimensional approach works well both in terms of inference as well as prediction; our methods also compare favorably to existing "reduced-rank" approaches. We also apply our methods to two real world data examples, one on bird count data and the other classifying rock types.

Pettinelli|F. Soldovieri|F. Cantini|A. P. Rossi|R. Orosei	  The paper deals with the investigation of the Mars subsurface by means of data collected by the Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding working at few MHz frequencies. A data processing strategy, which combines a simple inversion model and an accurate procedure for data selection is presented. This strategy permits to mitigate the theoretical and practical difficulties of the inverse problem arising because of the inaccurate knowledge of the parameters regarding both the scenario under investigation and the radiated electromagnetic field impinging on the Mars surface. The results presented in this paper show that, it is possible to reliably retrieve the electromagnetic properties of deeper structures, if such strategy is accurately applied. An example is given here, where the analysis of the data collected on Gemina Lingula, a region of the North Polar layer deposits, allowed us to retrieve permittivity values for the basal unit in agreement with those usually associated to the Earth basaltic rocks. 	
1610.02905v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.02905v2	2017	Dual virtual element method for discrete fractures networks	Alessio Fumagalli|Eirik Keilegavlen	  Discrete fracture networks is a key ingredient in the simulation of physical processes which involve fluid flow in the underground, when the surrounding rock matrix is considered impervious. In this paper we present two different models to compute the pressure field and Darcy velocity in the system. The first allows a normal flow out of a fracture at the intersections, while the second grants also a tangential flow along the intersections. For the numerical discretization, we use the mixed virtual finite element method as it is known to handle grid elements of, almost, any arbitrary shape. The flexibility of the discretization allows us to loosen the requirements on grid construction, and thus significantly simplify the flow discretization compared to traditional discrete fracture network models. A coarsening algorithm, from the algebraic multigrid literature, is also considered to further speed up the computation. The performance of the method is validated by numerical experiments.

Golovin	  It is usually assumed that hydraulic fracture has two symmetrical wings with respect to the fluid injection point. Hence, authors limit themselves to modelling of one half of the fracture. In our work we demonstrate that the case of a symmetrical fracture occurs only in a homogeneous reservoir with constant physical parameters and confining {\it in situ} stress. Otherwise, inhomogeneity in the stress or the rock permeability can significantly change the dynamics of the fracture propagation. The mathematical model of the hydraulic fracturing used in the paper is adopted from our earlier work \cite{Golovin_Baykin_2016_Pore}. In present paper we perform numerical experiments demonstrating that in case of non-constant confining stress or reservoir permeability the fracture is developing non-symmetrically. An important role is played by the action of the backstress that is formed near the fracture due to the pore pressure. To support this observation we give a formal definition of the backstress and compare the values of the backstress acting on the two different fracture wings. These numerical experiments underline the importance of the proper modelling of the interaction between pore and fracturing fluids for the correct simulation of the hydraulic fracturing.

P. Burton|Eric Cockayne|D. B. Gopman|Gunay Dogan|Sarah Hood	  In previous work, molecular dynamics simulations based on a first-principles-derived effective Hamiltonian for $Pb_{1-X}(Sc_{1/2}Nb_{1/2})O_{3-X}$~ (PSN), with nearest-neighbor Pb-O divacancy pairs, was used to calculate $X_{\rm [Pb-O]}$~vs.~T, phase diagrams for PSN with: ideal rock-salt type chemical order; nanoscale chemical short-range order; and random chemical disorder. Here, we show that the phase diagrams should include additional regions in which a glassy relaxor-phase (or state) is predicted. With respect to phase diagram topology, these results strongly support the analogy between relaxors and magnetic spin-glass-systems.

From helioseismology and observations of apparently "rooted" solar magnetic tracers we know that the surface rotates more slowly than much of the interior. The cause of this slow-down is not understood but it is important for understanding stellar rotation generally and any plausible theory of the solar interior. A new analysis using 5-min solar p-mode limb oscillations as a rotation "tracer" finds an even larger velocity gradient in a thin region at the top of the photosphere. This shear occurs where the solar atmosphere radiates energy and angular momentum. We suggest that the net effect of the photospheric angular momentum loss is similar to Poynting-Robertson "photon braking" on, for example, Sun-orbiting dust. The resultant photospheric torque is readily computed and, over the Sun's lifetime, is found to be comparable to the apparent angular momentum deficit in the near-surface shear layer.

An ultrafast time-resolved x-ray diffraction study	Runze Li|Omar A. Ashour|Jie Chen|H. E. Elsayed-Ali|Peter M. Rentzepis	  Femtosecond, 8.04 KeV x-ray pulses are used to probe the lattice dynamics of 150 nm Cu (111) single crystal on mica substrate irradiated with 400 nm, 100 fs laser pulses. For pump fluencies below the damage and melting threshold, we observed lattice contraction due to the formation of a blast force, and coherent acoustic phonons with a period of ~69 ps. At larger pump fluence, solid to liquid phase transition, annealing, and recrystallization were measured in real time by monitoring the intensity evolution of the probing fs x-ray rocking curves and agreed with theoretical simulation results. The experimental data suggest the melting process is a purely thermal phase transition. This study provides, in real time, an ultrafast time-resolved detailed description of the significant processes that occurs as a result of a femtosecond light-pulse interacts with the Cu (111) crystal surface.

Paleoproterozoic spherule layers from Greenland (Graenseso) and Russia (Zaonega), as well as some distal ejecta deposits (Lake Superior region) from the Sudbury impact (1,849 +/- 0.3 Ma) event, have been analyzed for their Cr isotope compositions. Our results suggest that 1) these distal ejecta deposits are all of impact origin, 2) the Graenseso and Zaonega spherule layers contain a distinct carbonaceous chondrite component, and are possibly related to the same impact event, which could be Vredefort (2,023 +/- 4 Ma) or another not yet identified large impact event from that of similar age, and 3) the Sudbury ejecta record a complex meteoritic signature, which is different from the Graenseso and Zaonega spherule layers, and could indicate the impact of a heterogeneous chondritic body. 	
1612.07373v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.07373v2	2016	Numerical analysis of a two-phase flow discrete fracture model	Jerome Droniou|Julian Hennicker|Roland Masson	  We present a new model for two phase Darcy flows in fractured media, in which fractures are modelled as submanifolds of codimension one with respect to the surrounding domain (matrix). Fractures can act as drains or as barriers, since pressure discontinuities at the matrix-fracture interfaces are permitted. Additionally, a layer of damaged rock at the matrix-fracture interfaces is accounted for. The numerical analysis is carried out in the general framework of the Gradient Discretisation Method. Compactness techniques are used to establish convergence results for a wide range of possible numerical schemes; the existence of a solution for the two phase flow model is obtained as a byproduct of the convergence analysis. A series of numerical experiments conclude the paper, with a study of the influence of the damaged layer on the numerical solution.

Nielsen|Davide Ceresoli|Jens-Erik Jørgensen|Clemens Prescher|Vitali B. Prakapenka|Martin Bremholm	  The crystal structure of CeN was investigated up to pressures of 82 GPa, using diamond anvil cell powder X-ray diffraction in two experiments with He and Si-oil as the pressure transmitting media. In contrast to previous reports, we do not observe the B2 (CsCl type) structure at high pressure. Instead, the structural phase transition, starting at 65 GPa, from the ambient rock salt B1 structure results in a distorted CsCl-like B10 structure, irrespective of the pressure medium. Our result unambiguously confirms two recent density functional theory (DFT) studies predicting the B10 phase to be stable at these pressures, rather than the B2 (CsCl type) phase previously reported. The B10 structure appears to approach the B2 structure as pressure is increased further, but DFT calculations indicate that an L1 0 structure (AuCu type) is energetically favored.

However, by cleverly corrupting a subset of data used as input to a target's ML algorithms, an adversary can perturb outcomes and compromise the effectiveness of ML technology. While prior work in the field of adversarial machine learning has studied the impact of input manipulation on correct ML algorithms, we consider the exploitation of bugs in ML implementations. In this paper, we characterize the attack surface of ML programs, and we show that malicious inputs exploiting implementation bugs enable strictly more powerful attacks than the classic adversarial machine learning techniques. We propose a semi-automated technique, called steered fuzzing, for exploring this attack surface and for discovering exploitable bugs in machine learning programs, in order to demonstrate the magnitude of this threat. As a result of our work, we responsibly disclosed five vulnerabilities, established three new CVE-IDs, and illuminated a common insecure practice across many machine learning systems. Finally, we outline several research directions for further understanding and mitigating this threat.

Affordance extraction via word embeddings	Nancy Fulda|Daniel Ricks|Ben Murdoch|David Wingate	  Autonomous agents must often detect affordances: the set of behaviors enabled by a situation. Affordance detection is particularly helpful in domains with large action spaces, allowing the agent to prune its search space by avoiding futile behaviors. This paper presents a method for affordance extraction via word embeddings trained on a Wikipedia corpus. The resulting word vectors are treated as a common knowledge database which can be queried using linear algebra. We apply this method to a reinforcement learning agent in a text-only environment and show that affordance-based action selection improves performance most of the time. Our method increases the computational complexity of each learning step but significantly reduces the total number of steps needed. In addition, the agent's action selections begin to resemble those a human would choose.

The growth process was monitored in-situ during deposition by means of x-ray diffraction. While the magnetite film grown at 400$^\circ$C shows a fully relaxed vertical lattice constant already in the early growth stages, the film deposited at 270$^\circ$C exhibits a strong vertical compressive strain and relaxes towards the bulk value with increasing film thickness. Furthermore, a lateral tensile strain was observed under these growth conditions although the inverse behavior is expected due to the lattice mismatch of -7.5%. Additionally, the occupancy of the A and B sublattices of magnetite with tetrahedral and octahedral sites was investigated showing a lower occupancy of the A sites compared to an ideal inverse spinel structure. The occupation of A sites decreases for a higher growth temperature. Thus, we assume a relocation of the iron ions from tetrahedral sites to octahedral vacancies forming a deficient rock salt lattice.

M. Kyba	  Near all-sky imaging photometry was performed from a boat on the Gulf of Aqaba to measure the night sky brightness in a coastal environment. The boat was not anchored, and therefore drifted and rocked. The camera was mounted on a tripod without any inertia/motion stabilization. A commercial digital single lens reflex (DSLR) camera and fisheye lens were used with ISO setting of 6400, with the exposure time varied between 0.5 s and 5 s. We find that despite movement of the vessel the measurements produce quantitatively comparable results apart from saturation effects. We discuss the potential and limitations of this method for mapping light pollution in marine and freshwater systems. This work represents the proof of concept that all-sky photometry with a commercial DSLR camera is a viable tool to determine light pollution in an ecological context from a moving boat.

Rayaprol|V. Siruguri|E. V. Sampathkumaran	  We report the results of neutron diffraction, ac and dc magnetization, heat-capacity, complex permittivity, and pyrocurrent measurements on an oxide, Li3NiRuO5, hitherto not paid much attention in the literature, except for a previous report on its promising electrochemical performance. We emphasize on the following findings: (i) Observation of re-entrant spin-glass behavior; that is, this oxide undergoes ferrilmagnetic ordering below 8- K, entering spin-glass regime around 12 K. (ii) There is no prominent feature in the complex dielectric permittivity (in particular, at the magnetic transitions) in the absence of external magnetic field, indicative of the absence of ferroelectricity. However, there is a distinct evidence for magneto-dielectric (MDE) coupling. The sign of MDE coupling also changes as the sample is cooled from ferrimagnetic state to spin-glass regime. (iii) There are pyroelectric anomalies in the vicinity of 30-70 K, presumably from thermally stimulated depolarization current.

Lopes|Alípio Jorge	  The main task in oil and gas exploration is to gain an understanding of the distribution and nature of rocks and fluids in the subsurface. Well logs are records of petro-physical data acquired along a borehole, providing direct information about what is in the subsurface. The data collected by logging wells can have significant economic consequences, due to the costs inherent to drilling wells, and the potential return of oil deposits. In this paper, we describe preliminary work aimed at building a general framework for well log prediction.   First, we perform a descriptive and exploratory analysis of the gaps in the neutron porosity logs of more than a thousand wells in the North Sea. Then, we generate artificial gaps in the neutron logs that reflect the statistics collected before. Finally, we compare Artificial Neural Networks, Random Forests, and three algorithms of Linear Regression in the prediction of missing gaps on a well-by-well basis.

Arzola|Mario Villasante-Barahona|Karen Volke-Sepúlveda|Petr Jákl|Pavel Zemánek	  A fully reconfigurable two-dimensional (2D) rocking ratchet system created with holographic optical micromanipulation is presented. We can generate optical potentials with the geometry of any Bravais lattice in 2D and introduce a spatial asymmetry with arbitrary orientation. Nontrivial directed transport of Brownian particles along different directions is demonstrated numerically and experimentally, including on-axis, perpendicular and oblique with respect to an unbiased ac driving. The most important aspect to define the current direction is shown to be the asymmetry and not the driving orientation, and yet we show a system in which the asymmetry orientation of each potential well does not coincide with the transport direction, suggesting an additional symmetry breaking as a result of a coupling with the lattice configuration. Our experimental device, due to its versatility, opens up a new range of possibilities in the study of nonequilibrium dynamics at the microscopic level.

Du|Peng-Cheng Chen|Brian Meckes|Zhuang Xie|Jinghan Zhu|Yuan Liu|Vinayak P. Dravid|Chad A. Mirkin	  Multicomponent nanoparticles can be synthesized with either homogeneous or phase-segregated architectures depending on the synthesis conditions and elements incorporated. To understand the parameters that determine their structural fate, multicomponent metal-oxide nanoparticles consisting of combinations of Co, Ni, and Cu were synthesized via scanning probe block copolymer lithography and characterized using correlated electron microscopy. These studies revealed that the miscibility, ratio of the metallic components, and the synthesis temperature determine the crystal structure and architecture of the nanoparticles. A Co-Ni-O system forms a rock salt structure largely due to the miscibility of CoO and NiO, while Cu-Ni-O, which has large miscibility gaps, forms either homogeneous oxides, heterojunctions, or alloys depending on the annealing temperature and composition. Moreover, a higher ordered structure, Co-Ni-Cu-O, was found to follow the behavior of lower ordered systems.

They enable us to analyze people's music listening behavior based on play logs. Although it is known that people listen to music based on topic (e.g., rock or jazz), we assume that when a user is addicted to an artist, s/he chooses the artist's songs regardless of topic. Based on this assumption, in this paper, we propose a probabilistic model to analyze people's music listening behavior. Our main contributions are three-fold. First, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study modeling music listening behavior by taking into account the influence of addiction to artists. Second, by using real-world datasets of play logs, we showed the effectiveness of our proposed model. Third, we carried out qualitative experiments and showed that taking addiction into account enables us to analyze music listening behavior from a new viewpoint in terms of how people listen to music according to the time of day, how an artist's songs are listened to by people, etc. We also discuss the possibility of applying the analysis results to applications such as artist similarity computation and song recommendation.

We demonstrate that the strength of the trade-off has a fundamental impact on eco-evolutionary dynamics, as it imposes four phases of diversity, including a sharp phase transition. Despite its minimalism, ITEEM produces without further ad hoc features a remarkable range of observed patterns of eco-evolutionary dynamics. Most notably we find self-organization towards structured communities with high and sustainable diversity, in which competing species form interaction cycles similar to rock-paper-scissors games.

We simulate wave propagation in three different real microearthquake environments using a spectral-element method. In the first example, we compute the full wavefield in 2D and 3D models of an underground ore mine, namely the Pyhaesalmi mine in Finland. In the second example, we simulate wave propagation in a homogeneous velocity model including the actual topography of an unstable rock slope at Aaknes in western Norway. Finally, we compute the full wavefield for a weakly anisotropic cylindrical sample at laboratory scale, which was used for an acoustic emission experiment under triaxial loading. We investigate the characteristic features of wave propagation in those models and compare synthetic waveforms with observed waveforms wherever possible. We illustrate the challenges associated with the spectral-element simulation in those models.

In this paper, we extend this setting by considering the environment is not given, but controllable and learnable through its interaction with the agent at the same time. Theoretically, we find a dual Markov decision process (MDP) w.r.t. the environment to that w.r.t. the agent, and solving the dual MDP-policy pair yields a policy gradient solution to optimizing the parametrized environment. Furthermore, environments with discontinuous parameters are addressed by a proposed general generative framework. While the idea is illustrated by an extended two-agent rock-paper-scissors game, our experiments on a Maze game design task show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in generating diverse and challenging Mazes against different agents with various settings.

Although these categories are not mutually exclusive, most related research is traditionally focused on classifying tracks into a single class. Furthermore, these categories (e.g., Pop, Rock) tend to be too broad for certain applications. In this work we aim to expand this task by categorizing musical items into multiple and fine-grained labels, using three different data modalities: audio, text, and images. To this end we present MuMu, a new dataset of more than 31k albums classified into 250 genre classes. For every album we have collected the cover image, text reviews, and audio tracks. Additionally, we propose an approach for multi-label genre classification based on the combination of feature embeddings learned with state-of-the-art deep learning methodologies. Experiments show major differences between modalities, which not only introduce new baselines for multi-label genre classification, but also suggest that combining them yields improved results.

To prove it, we analyze a collection of English and Russian Twitter and Vkontakte community pages by interests of their followers. First, we create a model of Major Interests (MaIs) with the help of expert analysis and then classify a set of pages using machine learning algorithms (SVM, Neural Network, Naive Bayes, and some other). We take three interest domains that are typical of both English and Russian-speaking communities: football, rock music, vegetarianism. The results of classification show a greater correlation between Russian-Vkontakte and Russian-Twitter pages while English-Twitterpages appear to provide the highest score.

Klain	  The results of paleointensity determinations of the geomagnetic field, which are obtained by sedimentary rocks in the Middle Jurassic - Neogene (167-12) Ma, are summarized. It was found that in the interval (167-67) Ma (Middle Jurassic - Cretaceous) mean values and amplitudes of paleointensity variations increased. Mean values of paleointensity reached a maximum in front of the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary. During the Paleogene the mean values and amplitudes of paleointensity variations decreased. In the Cretaceous - the beginning of the Paleogene cyclic changes in the amplitudes of paleointensity variations with characteristic times of several million years have been observed. It is shown that the duration of cycles of the paleointensity changes coincided with transgressive-regressive cycles (T-R cycles). This can be considered as a confirmation of the hypothesis on a relation between processes in the Earth's core and tectonic processes.

The mean-field replicator equations are valid in the limit of large populations and, in the presence of mutation and unbalanced payoffs, they exhibit an attracting limit cycle. The period of this cycle depends on the rate of mutation; specifically, the period grows logarithmically as the mutation rate tends to zero. We find that this behaviour is not reproduced in stochastic simulations with a fixed finite population size. Instead, demographic noise present in the individual-based model dramatically slows down the progress of the limit cycle, with the typical period growing as the reciprocal of the mutation rate. Here we develop a theory that explains these scaling regimes and delineates them in terms of population size and mutation rate. We identify a further intermediate regime in which we construct a stochastic differential equation model describing the transition between stochastically-dominated and mean-field behaviour.

Davis	  Using data from the $\nu$-cleus detector, based on the surface of the Earth, we place constraints on dark matter in the form of Strongly Interacting Massive Particles (SIMPs) which interact with nucleons via nuclear-scale cross sections. For large SIMP-nucleon cross sections the sensitivity of traditional direct dark matter searches using underground experiments is limited by the energy loss experienced by SIMPs, due to scattering with the rock overburden and experimental shielding on their way to the detector apparatus. Hence a surface-based experiment is ideal for a SIMP search, despite the much larger background, resulting from the lack of shielding. We show using data from a recent surface run of a low-threshold cryogenic detector that values of the SIMP-nucleon cross section up to approximately $10^{-27}$ cm$^2$ can be excluded for SIMPs with masses above 100 MeV.

Tchelepi|Daniel W. Meyer	  In the context of stochastic two-phase flow in porous media, we introduce a novel and efficient method to estimate the probability distribution of the wetting saturation field under uncertain rock properties in highly heterogeneous porous systems, where streamline patterns are dominated by permeability heterogeneity, and for slow displacement processes (viscosity ratio close to unity). Our method, referred to as the frozen streamline distribution method (FROST), is based on a physical understanding of the stochastic problem. Indeed, we identify key random fields that guide the wetting saturation variability, namely fluid particle times of flight and injection times. By comparing saturation statistics against full-physics Monte Carlo simulations, we illustrate how this simple, yet accurate FROST method performs under the preliminary approximation of frozen streamlines. Further, we inspect the performance of an accelerated FROST variant that relies on a simplification about injection time statistics. Finally, we introduce how quantiles of saturation can be efficiently computed within the FROST framework, hence leading to robust uncertainty assessment.

From the non-spin-polarized structural relaxations, I find that several structures with different Glazer tilts lie close in energy. The $Pnma$ structure is marginally favored compared to the $R\overline{3}c$ structure in my calculations, suggesting the presence of finite-temperature structural fluctuations and a possible proximity to a structural quantum critical point. In the spin-polarized relaxations, both structures exhibit the $\uparrow\!\!0\!\!\downarrow\!\!0$ antiferromagnetic ordering with a rock-salt arrangement of the octahedral breathing distortions. The energy gain due to the breathing distortions is larger than that due to the antiferromagnetic ordering. These phases are semimetallic with small three-dimensional Fermi pockets, which is largely consistent with the recent observation of the coexistence of antiferromagnetism and metallicity in LaNiO$_3$ single crystals by Li \textit{et al.} [arXiv:1705.02589].

Both static and moving obstacles are present including humans, mannequin dolls, rocks, barrels, buildings, vehicles, and vegetation. All obstacles have ground truth object labels and geographic coordinates.

However, the molecular scale details of these processes, especially with heavy and large anionic complexes, are not well-understood. We studied the adsorption of $PtCl_6^{2-}$ anionic complexes to floating DPTAP monolayers in the presence of excess $Cl^-$ as a function of the bulk chlorometalate concentration. In situ x-ray scattering and fluorescence measurements, which are element and depth sensitive, show that the chlorometalate ions only adsorb in the diffuse layer at lower concentrations, while they adsorb predominantly in the Stern layer at higher concentrations. The response of DPTAP molecules to the adsorbed ions is determined independently by grazing incidence x-ray diffraction, and supports this picture. Molecular dynamics simulations further elucidate the nanoscale structure of the interfacial complexes. The results suggest that ion hydration and ion-ion correlations play a key role in the competitive adsorption process.

When viewing this imagery, a human observer can often easily identify various sea-floor textures such as sand ripple, hard-packed sand, sea grass and rock. In this paper, we present the Possibilistic Fuzzy Local Information C-Means (PFLICM) approach to segment SAS imagery into sea-floor regions that exhibit these various natural textures. The proposed PFLICM method incorporates fuzzy and possibilistic clustering methods and leverages (local) spatial information to perform soft segmentation. Results are shown on several SAS scenes and compared to alternative segmentation approaches.

Using the replicator dynamics as the equations of motion, we show that a quasi-linearization of the problem admits a special optimal control form in which explicit dynamics for the controller can be identified. We show that all optimal controls must satisfy a specific second order differential equation parameterized by the number of strategies in the game. We show that as the number of strategies increases, a limiting case admits a closed form for the open-loop optimal control. In performing our analysis we show necessary conditions on an optimal control problem that allow this analytic approach to function.

With similar amplitudes to occultations but far longer baselines, they have a higher sensitivity to planetary photons at the expense of a more challenging data reduction in terms of long-term stability. In this work, we introduce a novel non-parametric algorithm dubbed "phasma" to produce clean, robust exoplanet phase curves and apply it to 115 Neptunian and 50 Terran exoplanets observed by Kepler. We stack the signals to further improve signal-to-noise, and measure an average Neptunian albedo of Ag < 0.23 to 95% confidence, indicating a lack of bright clouds consistent with theoretical models. Our Terran sample provides the first constraint on the ensemble albedo of exoplanets which are most likely solid, constraining Ag < 0.42 to 95% confidence. In agreement with our constraint on the greenhouse effect, our work implies that Kepler's solid planets are unlikely to resemble cloudy Venusian analogs, but rather dark Mercurian rocks.

The construction of accurate simulation model for flow in fractures is challenging due to the high ratios between a fracture's length and width, which makes modeling by lower-dimensional manifolds a natural option. In this paper we present a mixed-dimensional Darcy problem able to describe pressure and Darcy velocity in all the dimensions, i.e. in the rock matrix, in the fractures, and in their intersections. Moreover, we present a mixed-dimensional transport problem which, given the Darcy velocity, describes coupled advection and diffusion of a passive scalar into the fractured porous media. The approach can handle both conducting and blocking fractures. Our computational grids are created by coarsening of simplex tessellations that conform to the fractures surfaces. An accurate choice of the discrete approximation of the previous model, by virtual finite element and finite volume, allows us to simulate complex problem with a good balance in term of accuracy and computational cost. We illustrate the performance of our method by comparing to benchmark studies for two-dimensional fractured porous media, as well as a complex three-dimensional fracture geometry.

Blunt	  Stochastic image reconstruction is a key part of modern digital rock physics and materials analysis that aims to create numerous representative samples of material micro-structures for upscaling, numerical computation of effective properties and uncertainty quantification. We present a method of three-dimensional stochastic image reconstruction based on generative adversarial neural networks (GANs). GANs represent a framework of unsupervised learning methods that require no a priori inference of the probability distribution associated with the training data. Using a fully convolutional neural network allows fast sampling of large volumetric images.We apply a GAN based workflow of network training and image generation to an oolitic Ketton limestone micro-CT dataset. Minkowski functionals, effective permeability as well as velocity distributions of simulated flow within the acquired images are compared with the synthetic reconstructions generated by the deep neural network. While our results show that GANs allow a fast and accurate reconstruction of the evaluated image dataset, we address a number of open questions and challenges involved in the evaluation of generative network-based methods.

From synchrotron X-ray diffraction and Rietveld refinement, the crystal structure of La2O2Bi3AgS6 was refined using a model of the P4/nmm space group with a = 4.0644(1) {\AA} and c = 19.412(1) {\AA}, which is similar to the related compound LaOBiPbS3, while the interlayer bonds (M2-S1 bonds) are apparently shorter in La2O2Bi3AgS6. The tunneling electron microscopy (TEM) image confirmed the lattice constant derived from Rietveld refinement (c ~ 20 {\AA}). The electrical resistivity and Seebeck coefficient suggested that the electronic states of La2O2Bi3AgS6 are more metallic than those of LaOBiS2 and LaOBiPbS3. The insertion of a rock-salt-type chalcogenide into the van der Waals gap of BiS2-based layered compounds, such as LaOBiS2, will be a useful strategy for designing new layered functional materials in the layered chalcogenide family.

Young	  Water content and the internal evolution of terrestrial planets and icy bodies are closely linked. The distribution of water in planetary systems is controlled by the temperature structure in the protoplanetary disk and dynamics and migration of planetesimals and planetary embryos. This results in the formation of planetesimals and planetary embryos with a great variety of compositions, water contents and degrees of oxidation. The internal evolution and especially the formation time of planetesimals relative to the timescale of radiogenic heating by short-lived 26Al decay may govern the amount of hydrous silicates and leftover rock-ice mixtures available in the late stages of their evolution. In turn, water content may affect the early internal evolution of the planetesimals and in particular metal-silicate separation processes. Moreover, water content may contribute to an increase of oxygen fugacity and thus affect the concentrations of siderophile elements within the silicate reservoirs of Solar System objects. Finally, the water content strongly influences the differentiation rate of the icy moons, controls their internal evolution and governs the alteration processes occurring in their deep interiors.

Clark|Ahmet Uysal	  The prolonged studies and debates on specific ion effects at charged interfaces have generally omitted heavier ions and their complexes. Although a unified theory is far from reach even for the lighter ions, trends in their interfacial behavior have been identified based on certain ion properties, such as polarizability and hydration enthalpy, which can be correlated to the empirical Hofmeister series. One such trend is that weaker hydration leads to stronger adsorption at charged aqueous interfaces. Here, a combined vibrational sum frequency generation and molecular dynamics study reveals that heavy anionic chlorometalate complexes are both strongly hydrated and strongly adsorbed to a charged Langmuir monolayer. After adsorption, these heavy anions retain part of their hydration sphere and induce a unique interfacial water structure. These results may have important implications on the relation of interfacial water structure and hydration enthalpy to the general understanding of specific ion effects.

Hydrogen isotopes in water-bearing primitive meteorites, e.g. carbonaceous chondrites, constitute a unique tool for deciphering the sources of water reservoirs at the time of asteroid formation. However, fine-scale isotopic measurements are required to unravel the effects of parent body processes on the pre-accretion isotopic distributions. Here we report in situ micrometer-scale analyses of hydrogen isotopes in six CM-type carbonaceous chondrites revealing a dominant deuterium-poor water component ({\delta}D = -350 +/- 40 permil) mixed with deuterium-rich organic matter. We suggest that this D-poor water corresponds to a ubiquitous water reservoir in the inner protoplanetary disk. A deuterium-rich water signature has been preserved in the least altered part of the Paris chondrite ({\delta}DParis > -69 +/- 163 permil) in hydrated phases possibly present in the CM rock before alteration. The presence of the D-enriched water signature in Paris might indicate that transfers of ice from the outer to the inner Solar System have been significant within the first million years of the Solar System history.

The paper reviews evidence on putative sedimentary-origin meteorites and potential parent bodies for sedimentary meteorites. Authors conclude that the list of candidate parent bodies for sedimentary meteorites includes, but is not limited by the Earth, Mars, Enceladus, Ganymede, Europa, and hypothetical planets that could exist between orbits of Mars and Jupiter in the past. Authors argue that extraterrestrial origin and a parent body for meteoritic sedimentary rocks may be identified based on the entire body of evidence which is not limited solely by tests of oxygen and noble gas isotopes whose signatures may undergo terrestrial contamination and may exhibit significant heterogeneity within the Solar system and within the parent cosmic bodies. Observed fall of a cosmic body, evidence of hypervelocity fall, signs of impact in target, and the presence of fusion crust, melting, and/or shock deformation features in the fragments should be considered as priority signs of meteoritic origin.

At this scale, the presence of surface charge, and a resultant electrical double layer, may considerably alter transport properties. However, due to the inherent non-linearity of the governing equations, numerical and theoretical studies of the coupling between electric double layers and flow have mostly been limited to two-dimensional or axisymmetric geometries. Here, we present comprehensive three-dimensional simulations of electrohydrodynamic flow in an idealized fracture geometry consisting of a sinusoidally undulated bottom surface and a flat top surface. We investigate the effects of varying the amplitude and the Debye length (relative to the fracture aperture) and quantify their impact on flow channeling. The results indicate that channeling can be significantly increased in the plane of flow. Local flow in the narrow regions can be slowed down by up to $5 \%$ compared to the same geometry without charge, for the highest amplitude considered. This indicates that electrohydrodynamics may have consequences for transport phenomena and surface growth in geophysical systems.

J. R. Prentice	  I report the results of a new set of calculations for the gravitational contraction of the proto-solar cloud to quantify the idea that Titan may be a captured moon of Saturn (Prentice 1981, 1984). It is proposed that Titan initially condensed as a secondary embryo in the same proto-solar gas ring from which the central solid core and gaseous envelope of Saturn were acquired. At the orbit of Saturn, the bulk chemical constituents of the condensate are rock (mass fraction 0.494), water ice (0.474), and graphite (0.032). The mean density is 1523 kg/m^3. Structural models for a frozen Titan yield a mean density of 2095 kg/m^3 (chemically homogeneous case) and 1904 kg/m^3 (fully differentiated 2-zone case). The agreement to one percent of the latter value with the observed mean density suggests that Titan is indeed a fully differentiated satellite. The value of C/MR^2 for this model is 0.316. It is predicted that Titan has no internal ocean or induced magnetic field but it may possess a small native dipole field of magnitude 2 x 10^11 Tesla m^3 due to thermoremanent magnetization fed by the ancient magnetic field of Saturn. Capture of Titan was achieved by gas drag at the edge of the proto-Saturnian envelope at a time when that cloud had a radius close to the present orbital size of Titan. Collisional drag was also probably an important agent in securing the capture of Titan. Perhaps Hyperion is the shattered remnant of a pre-existing native moon of Saturn that was destroyed on the arrival of Titan. Titan should thus have much the same appearance as Triton, being nearly smooth, crater-free and streaked with elemental carbon (Prentice 2004a).

Chabrier	  We present a broad suite of models of extrasolar giant planets (EGP's), ranging in mass from 0.3 to 15 Jupiter masses. The models predict luminosity (both reflected and emitted) as a function of age, mass, deuterium abundance and distance from parent stars of various spectral type. We also explore the effects of helium mass fraction, rotation rate and the presence of a rock-ice core. The models incorporate the most accurate available equation of state for the interior, including a new theory for the enhancement of deuterium fusion by electron screening which is potentially important in these low mass objects. The results of our calculations reveal the enormous sensitivity of EGP's to the presence of the parent star, particularly for G and earlier spectral types. They also show a strong sensitivity of the flux contrast in the mid-infrared between parent star and EGP to the mass and age of the EGP's. We interpret our results in terms of search strategies for ground- and space-based observatories in place or anticipated in the near future.

Beckwith|Thomas Henning|Yoshitsugu Nakagawa	  Recent research on the buildup of rocks from small dust grains has reaffirmed that grain growth in protoplanetary disks should occur quickly. Calculation of growth rates have been made for a variety of growth processes and generally predict high probabilities of sticking in low-velocity collisions that may be brought about in a number of ways in protoplanetary disks. Laboratory experiments have measured sticking coefficients for some materials largely confirming the calculations. Although the detailed velocity fields of disks are not well understood, many of the important processes leading to particle collisions and grain growth have been studied theoretically and demonstrate likely paths by which dust is assembled into planets. Calculations of the radiative properties of particles with various size distributions show that large particles should produce observable changes in the spectral energy distributions of disks. Changes of the sort predicted are, in fact, observed, but their interpretation is ambiguous; there are other ways to produce the observed changes that do not require grain growth, so the evidence is currently inconclusive. The major uncertainties can be overcome with the next generation of millimeter-wave interferometers, and it seems likely that a firm case for grain growth could be established within a decade.

Sheppard	  We present new time-resolved photometric observations of the bright trans-Neptunian object (20000) Varuna and use them to study the rotation period, shape, and color. In observations from 2001 February and April, we find a best-fit two-peaked lightcurve with period 6.3442 +-0.0002 hr. The peak-to-peak photometric range in the R-band is 0.42 +-0.02 mag. We find no rotational variation in colors over the 0.45 < lambda < 0.85 micron wavelength range. From the short double-peaked period and large amplitude we suggest that Varuna is an elongated, prolate body perhaps close in shape to one of the Jacobi ellipsoids. If so, the ratio of the axes projected into the plane of the sky is 1.5:1 and the density is near 1000 kg m^(-3). (20000) Varuna may be a rotationally distorted rubble pile, with a weak internal constitution due to fracturing by past impacts. The high specific angular momentum implied by our observations and recent detections of binary Trans-Neptunian Objects both point to an early, intense collisional epoch in which large Trans-Neptunian Objects were about 100 times more abundant than now. In order to maintain a cosmochemically plausible rock:ice mass ratio of about 0.5, Varuna must be internally porous.

Boothroyd	  The relatively warm temperatures required on early Earth and Mars have been difficult to account for via warming from greenhouse gases. We tested whether this problem can be resolved for both Earth and Mars by a young Sun that is brighter than predicted by the standard solar model. We computed high-precision solar evolutionary models with slightly increased initial masses of M_i = 1.01 to 1.07 M_sun; for each mass, we considered three different mass loss scenarios. We then tested whether these models were consistent with the current high-precision helioseismic observations. The relatively modest mass loss rates in these models are consistent with observational limits from young stars and estimates of the past solar wind obtained from lunar rocks, and do not significantly affect the solar lithium depletion. For appropriate initial masses, all three mass loss scenarios are capable of yielding a solar flux 3.8 Gyr ago high enough to be consistent with water on ancient Mars. We find that all of our mass-losing solar models are consistent with the helioseismic observations. The early solar mass loss of a few percent does indeed leave a small fingerprint on the Sun's internal structure. However, for helioseismology to significantly constrain early solar mass loss would require higher accuracy in the observed solar parameters and input physics, namely, by a factor of about 3 for the observed solar surface composition, and a factor of 2 for the solar interior opacities, the pp nuclear reaction rate, and the diffusion constants for gravitational settling.

Fargion	  EUSO experiment, while monitoring the downward Earth atmosphere layers, may observe among common Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays, UHECR, also High Energy Neutrino-Induced Showers either blazing upward to the detectors at high (PeVs) energies or at much higher GZK E >= 10^19 eV energies, showering horizontally in air or vertically downward. A small fraction of these upward, horizontal and vertical Shower maybe originated by direct astrophysical UHE neutrino interacting on terrestrial air layers itself; however the dominant UHE neutrino signal are Upward and Horizontal Tau Air-Showers, UPTAUS and HORTAUs (or Earth skimming neutrinos), born within widest Earth Crust Crown (Sea or Rock) Areas, by UHE nu_tau + Nuclei--> tau interactions, respectively at PeVs and GZK energies: their rate and signatures are shown in a neutrino fluence map for EUSO thresholds versus other UHE air interacting neutrino signals and backgrounds. The effective target Masses originating HORTAUs seen by EUSO may exceed (on sea) at 10^19 eV energy a wide and huge ring volume above 1/2*A_Euso*l_tau*(L_nu/2R_Earth)^2= 5130 km^3.   The consequent HORTAUS event rate (even at 10% EUSO duty cycle lifetime) may deeply test the expected Z-Burst models by at least a hundred of yearly events. Even rarest but inescapable GZK neutrinos (secondary of photopion production of observed cosmic UHECR) might be discovered in a few (or a tens) horizontal shower events; in this view an extension of EUSO detectability up to E > 10^19 eV threshold is to be preferred. A wider collecting EUSO telescope (3m diameter) might be considered.

Marvin Herndon	  Recently, I showed that the "standard model" of solar system formation is wrong,yielding the contradiction of terrestrial planets having insufficiently massive cores, and showed instead the consistency of Eucken's 1944 concept of planets raining out in the central regions of hot, gaseous protoplanets. Planets generally consist of concentric shells of matter, but there has been no adequate geophysical explanation to account for the Earth's non-contiguous crustal continental rock layer, except by assuming that the Earth in the distant past was smaller and subsequently expanded. Here, I show that formation of Earth, from within a Jupiter-like protoplanet, will account for the compression of the rocky Earth to about 64 percent of its current radius, yielding a closed, contiguous continental shell with concomitant Earth expansion commencing upon the subsequent removal of its protoplanetary gaseous shell. I now propose that Earth expansion progresses, not from spreading at mid-oceanic ridges as usually assumed, but primarily by the formation of expansion cracks (often near continental margins) and the in-filling of those cracks with basalt (produced from volume expansion in the mantle), which is extruded mainly at mid-oceanic ridges, solidifies and traverses the ocean floor by gravitational creep to regions of lower gravitational potential energy, ultimately plunging downward into distant expansion cracks, emulating subduction. Viewed from that perspective, most of the evidence presented in support of plate tectonics supports Earth expansion; mantle convection is not required, and the timescale for Earth expansion is no longer constrained to about 200 million years, the maximum age of the current ocean floor. 	
0410242v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0410242v1	2004	Total Mass of Ordinary Chondrite Matter Originally Present in the Solar   System	J. Marvin Herndon	  Recently, I reported the discovery of a new fundamental relationship of the major elements (Fe, Mg, Si) of chondrites that admits the possibility that ordinary chondrite meteorites are derived from two components, a relatively oxidized and undifferentiated, primitive component and a somewhat differentiated, planetary component, with oxidation state like the highly reduced enstatite chondrites, which I suggested was identical to Mercury's complement of lost elements. Subsequently, on the basis of that relationship, I derived expressions, as a function of the mass of planet Mercury and the mass of its core, to estimate the mass of Mercury's lost elements, the mass of Mercury's alloy and rock protoplanetary core, and the mass of Mercury's gaseous protoplanet. Here, on the basis of the supposition that Mercury's complement of lost elements is in fact identical to the planetary component of ordinary chondrite formation, I estimate, as a function of Mercury's core mass, the total mass of ordinary chondrite matter originally present in the Solar System. Although Mercury's mass is well known, its core mass is not, being widely believed to be in the range of 70 to 80 percent of the planet mass. For a core mass of 75 percent, the calculated total mass of ordinary chondrite matter originally present in the Solar System amounts to 1.83E24 kg, about 5.5 times the mass of Mercury. That amount of mass is insufficient in itself to form a planet as massive as the Earth, but may have contributed significantly to the formation of Mars, as well as adding to the veneer of other planets, including the Earth. Presently, only about 0.1 percent of that mass remains in the asteroid belt.

Price	  Two classes of natural solid media (glacial ice and salt domes) are under consideration as media in which to deploy instruments for detection of neutrinos with energy >1e18 eV. Though insensitive to 1e11 to 1e16 eV neutrinos for which observatories (e.g., AMANDA and IceCube) that utilize optical Cherenkov radiation detectors are designed, radio and acoustic methods are suited for searches for the very low fluxes of neutrinos with energies >1017 eV. This is because, due to the very long attenuation lengths of radio and acoustic waves in ice and salt, detection modules can be spaced very far apart. In this paper, I calculate the absorption and scattering coefficients as a function of frequency and grain size for acoustic waves in glacial ice and salt domes and show that experimental measurements on laboratory samples and in glacial ice and salt domes are consistent with theory. For South Pole ice with grain size 0.2 cm at -51 degrees C, scattering lengths are calculated to be 2000 km and 25 km at 10 kHz and 30 kHz, respectively, and the absorption length is calculated to be 9 km at frequencies above 100 Hz. For NaCl (rock salt) with grain size 0.75 cm, scattering lengths are calculated to be 120 km and 1.4 km at 10 kHz and 30 kHz, and absorption lengths are calculated to be 30,000 km and 3300 km at 10 kHz and 30 kHz. Existing measurements are consistent with theory. For ice, absorption is the limiting factor; for salt, scattering is the limiting factor.

Kaasalainen	  We obtained N- and Q-band observations of the Apollo-type asteroid 25143 Itokawa during its close Earth approach in July 2004 with TIMMI2 at the ESO 3.6 m telescope. Our photometric measurement, in combination with already published data, allowed us to derive a radiometric effective diameter of 0.32+/-0.03 km and an albedo of 0.19 +0.11/-0.03 through a thermophysical model. This effective diameter corresponds to a slightly asymmetrical and flattened ellipsoid of the approximate size of 520(+/-50) x 270(+/-30) x 230(+/-20) m, based on the Kaasalainen et al. (2005) shape model. Our studies show that the thermal observations lead to size estimates which are about 15% smaller than the radar results (Ostro et al. 2005), slightly outside the stated radar uncertainties of +/-10%. We determined a rather high thermal inertia of 750 Jm-2s-0.5K-1. This is an indication for a bare rock dominated surface, a thick dust regolith can be excluded as well as a metallic surface. From our data we constructed a 10.0 micrometer thermal lightcurve which is nicely matched in amplitude and phase by the shape and spin vector solution in combination with our TPM description. The assumed S-type bulk density in combination with radiometric size lead to a total mass estimate of 4.5 +2.0/-1.8 x 10^10 kg.

J. R. Prentice	  I report a model for the formation of Saturn's family of mid-sized icy moons to coincide with the first flypast of Rhea by the Cassini Orbiter spacecraft on 26 November 2005. It is proposed that these moons had condensed from a concentric family of orbiting gas rings that were cast off some 4600 Myr ago by the contracting proto-Saturnian cloud. Numerical and structural models for Rhea are constructed on the basis of a computed bulk chemical mix of hydrated rock (mass fraction 0.385), H2O ice (0.395), and NH3 ice (0.220). The large proportion of NH3 in the ice mass inhibits the formation of the dense crystalline phase II of H2O ice at the satellite's centre. This may explain the absence of compressional features on the surface. The favoured model of Rhea has a chemically uniform interior and is very cold. The satellite is nearly isodense and the predicted value of the axial moment-of-inertia factor is C/MR^2 = 0.399 +/- 0.004. NH3 is unstable at Saturn's distance from the Sun, except near the polar regions of the satellite. Perhaps the Cassini Orbiter will discover indirect evidence for NH3 through the sublimative escape of this ice from the outer layers, especially near the equatorial zones. Wasting of NH3 would weaken the residual soil, so making the edges of craters soft and prone to landslides. It will be exciting to learn what Cassini discovers.

Marvin Herndon	  Only three processes, operant during the formation of the Solar System, are responsible for the diversity of matter in the Solar System and are directly responsible for planetary internal-structures, including planetocentric nuclear fission reactors, and for dynamical processes, including and especially, geodynamics. These processes are: (i) Low-pressure, low-temperature condensation from solar matter in the remote reaches of the Solar System or in the interstellar medium; (ii) High-pressure, high-temperature condensation from solar matter associated with planetary-formation by raining out from the interiors of giant-gaseous protoplanets, and; (iii) Stripping of the primordial volatile components from the inner portion of the Solar System by super-intense solar wind associated with T-Tauri phase mass-ejections, presumably during the thermonuclear ignition of the Sun. As described herein, these processes lead logically, in a causally related manner, to a coherent vision of planetary formation with profound implications including, but not limited to, (a) Earth formation as a giant gaseous Jupiter-like planet with vast amounts of stored energy of protoplanetary compression in its rock-plus-alloy kernel; (b) Removal of approximately 300 Earth-masses of primordial gases from the Earth, which began Earth's decompression process, making available the stored energy of protoplanetary compression for driving geodynamic processes, which I have described by the new whole-Earth decompression dynamics and which is responsible for emplacing heat at the mantle-crust-interface at the base of the crust through the process I have described, called mantle decompression thermal-tsunami; and, (c)Uranium accumulations at the planetary centers capable of self-sustained nuclear fission chain reactions.

Brown|Adam Burrows|Greg Laughlin	  When extrasolar planets are observed to transit their parent stars, we are granted unprecedented access to their physical properties. It is only for transiting planets that we are permitted direct estimates of the planetary masses and radii, which provide the fundamental constraints on models of their physical structure. In particular, precise determination of the radius may indicate the presence (or absence) of a core of solid material, which in turn would speak to the canonical formation model of gas accretion onto a core of ice and rock embedded in a protoplanetary disk. Furthermore, the radii of planets in close proximity to their stars are affected by tidal effects and the intense stellar radiation. As a result, some of these "hot Jupiters" are significantly larger than Jupiter in radius. Precision follow-up studies of such objects (notably with the space-based platforms of the Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescopes) have enabled direct observation of their transmission spectra and emitted radiation. These data provide the first observational constraints on atmospheric models of these extrasolar gas giants, and permit a direct comparison with the gas giants of the Solar system. Despite significant observational challenges, numerous transit surveys and quick-look radial velocity surveys are active, and promise to deliver an ever-increasing number of these precious objects. The detection of transits of short-period Neptune-sized objects, whose existence was recently uncovered by the radial-velocity surveys, is eagerly anticipated. Ultra-precise photometry enabled by upcoming space missions offers the prospect of the first detection of an extrasolar Earth-like planet in the habitable zone of its parent star, just in time for Protostars and Planets VI.

Shannon	  We propose that neutral, circumpulsar debris entering the light cylinder can account for many time-dependent pulsar phenomena that are otherwise difficult to explain. Neutral material avoids propeller ejection and injects sufficient charges -- after heating, evaporation, and ionization -- to alter current flows and pair-production and thus trigger, detune, or extinguish coherent emission. Relevant phenomena, with time scales from seconds to months, include nulls, rotating radio transients (RRATs), rapid changes in pulse profile (``mode changes''), variable subpulse drift rates, quasi-periodic bursts from B1931+24, and torque variations. Over the 10 Myr lifetime of a canonical pulsar with trillion-gauss surface magnetic field, less than a millionth of an Earth mass of material is needed to modulate the Goldreich-Julian current by 100%. Circumpulsar material originates from metal-rich, supernova fallback gas that aggregates into asteroids. Debris disks can inject sufficient material on time scales of interest, yet be too tenuous to form large planets detectable in pulse timing data. Asteroid migration results from collisions and the radiation-driven Yarkovsky and Poynting-Robertson effects. For B1931+24, an asteroid in a $\sim 40$~day elliptical orbit pollutes the magnetosphere stochastically through collisions with other debris. Injection is less likely for hot, young and highly magnetized pulsars or millisecond pulsars that pre-ionize any debris material well outside their small magnetospheres. Injection effects will therefore be most prominent in long-period, cooler pulsars, consistent with the distribution of relevant objects in perid and period derivative. A pulsar's spin history and its radiation-beam orientation may influence whether it displays nulling, RRATs and other effects.

David Ehrenreich|Alain Lecavelier Des Etangs|Jean-Philippe Beaulieu|Olivier Grasset	  Extrasolar planets as light as a few Earths are now being detected. Such planets are likely not gas or ice giants. Here, we present a study on the possible properties of the small and cold extrasolar planets, applied to the case of the recently discovered planet OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb (Beaulieu et al. 2006). This planet (5.5[+5.5/-2.7] Earth masses) orbits 2.6[+1.5/-0.6]-astronomical units away from an old M-type star of the Galactic Bulge. The planet should be entirely frozen given the low surface temperature (35 to 47 K). However, depending on the rock-to-ice mass ratio in the planet, the radiogenic heating could be sufficient to make the existence of liquid water within an icy crust possible. This possibility is estimated as a function of the planetary mass and the illumination received from the parent star, both being strongly related by the observational constraints. The results are presented for water-poor and water-rich planets. We find that no oceans can be present in any cases at 9-10 Gyr, a typical age for a star of the Bulge. However, we find that, in the past when the planet was < 5-billion-years old, liquid water was likely present below an icy surface. Nevertheless, the planet is now likely to be entirely frozen.

Bullock	  We present an updated mass model for M31 that makes use of a Spitzer 3.6 $\mu$m image, a mass-to-light ratio gradient based on the galaxy's B-R colour profile, and observed rotation curve data from a variety of sources. We examine cases where the dark matter follows a pure NFW profile and where an initial NFW halo contracts adiabatically in response to the formation of the galaxy. We find that both of these scenarios can produce a reasonable fit to the observed rotation curve data. However, a pure NFW model requires a concentration c_{vir}=51 that is well outside the range predicted in LCDM cosmology and is therefore disfavoured. An adiabatically contracted NFW halo favors an initial concentration c_{vir}=20 and virial mass 8.2x10^{11} M_{\odot}, and this is in line with the cosmological expectations for a galaxy of the size of M31. The best-fit mass is consistent with published estimates from Andromeda Stream kinematics, satellite galaxy radial velocities, and planetary nebulae studies. Finally, using the known linear correlation between rotation curve shear and spiral arm pitch angle, we show that the stellar spiral arm pitch angle of M31 (which cannot be deduced from imaging data due to the galaxy's inclination) is P=24.7\pm4.4 degrees.

Leger	  Planets less massive than about 10 MEarth are expected to have no massive H-He atmosphere and a cometary composition (50% rocks, 50% water, by mass) provided they formed beyond the snowline of protoplanetary disks. Due to inward migration, such planets could be found at any distance between their formation site and the star. If migration stops within the habitable zone, this will produce a new kind of planets, called Ocean-Planets. Ocean-planets typically consist in a silicate core, surrounded by a thick ice mantle, itself covered by a 100 km deep ocean. The existence of ocean-planets raises important astrobiological questions: Can life originate on such body, in the absence of continent and ocean-silicate interfaces? What would be the nature of the atmosphere and the geochemical cycles ?   In this work, we address the fate of Hot Ocean-Planets produced when migration ends at a closer distance. In this case the liquid/gas interface can disappear, and the hot H2O envelope is made of a supercritical fluid. Although we do not expect these bodies to harbor life, their detection and identification as water-rich planets would give us insight as to the abundance of hot and, by extrapolation, cool Ocean-Planets. 	
0701745v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0701745v2	2007	The Formation of Ice Giants in a Packed Oligarchy: Instability and   Aftermath	Eric B. Ford|Eugene Chiang	  As many as 5 ice giants--Neptune-mass planets composed of 90% ice and rock and 10% hydrogen--are thought to form at heliocentric distances of 10-25 AU on closely packed orbits spaced ~5 Hill radii apart. Such oligarchies are ultimately unstable. Once the parent disk of planetesimals is sufficiently depleted, oligarchs perturb one another onto crossing orbits. We explore both the onset and the outcome of the instability through numerical integrations, including dynamical friction cooling of planets by a planetesimal disk whose properties are held fixed. To trigger instability and the ejection of the first ice giant in systems having an original surface density in oligarchs of Sigma ~ 1 g/cm^2, the disk surface density s must fall below 0.1 g/cm^2. Ejections are predominantly by Jupiter and occur within 10 Myr. To eject more than 1 oligarch requires s < 0.03 g/cm^2. Systems starting with up to 4 oligarchs in addition to Jupiter and Saturn can readily yield solar-system-like outcomes in which 2 surviving ice giants lie inside 30 AU and have their orbits circularized by dynamical friction. Our numerical simulations support the idea that planetary systems begin in more crowded and compact configurations, like those of shear-dominated oligarchies. In contrast to previous studies, we identify s < 0.1 Sigma as the regime relevant for understanding the evolution of the outer solar system, and we encourage future studies to concentrate on this regime while relaxing our assumption of a fixed planetesimal disk. 	
0003478v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0003478v2	2000	Critical Ruptures	Anders Johansen|Didier Sornette	  The fracture of materials is a catastrophic phenomenon of considerable technological and scientific importance. Here, we analysed experiments designed for industrial applications in order to test the concept that, in heterogeneous materials such as fiber composites, rocks, concrete under compression and materials with large distributed residual stresses, rupture is a genuine critical point, i.e. the culmination of a self-organization of damage and cracking characterized by power law signatures. Specifically, we analyse the acoustic emissions recorded during the pressurisation of spherical tanks of kevlar or carbon fibers pre-impregnated in a resin matrix wrapped up around a thin metallic liner (steel or titanium) fabricated and instrumented by A\'erospatiale-Matra Inc. These experiments are performed as part of a routine industrial procedure which tests the quality of the tanks prior to shipment and varies in nature. We find that the seven acoustic emission recordings of seven pressure tanks which was brought to rupture exhibit clear acceleration in agreement with a power law ``divergence'' expected from the critical point theory. In addition, we find strong evidence of log-periodic corrections that quantify the intermittent succession of accelerating bursts and quiescent phases of the acoustic emissions on the approach to rupture. An improved model accounting for the cross-over from the non-critical to the critical region close to the rupture point exhibits interesting predictive potential.

Kageyama|H. Yoshizawa|Y. Ueda	  New metal-ordered manganites RBaMn_{2}O_{6} have been synthesized and investigated in the structures and electromagnetic properties. RBaMn_{2}O_{6} can be classified into three groups from the structural and electromagnetic properties. The first group (R = La, Pr and Nd) has a metallic ferromagnetic transition, followed by an A-type antiferromagnetic transition in PrBaMn_{2}O_{6}. The second group (R = Sm, Eu and Gd) exhibits a charge-order transition, followed by an antiferromagnetic long range ordering. The third group (R = Tb, Dy and Ho) shows successive three phase transitions, the structural, charge/orbital-order and magnetic transitions, as observed in YBaMn_{2}O_{6}. Comparing to the metal-disordered manganites (R^{3+}_{0.5}A^{2+}_{0.5})MnO_{3}, two remarkable features can be recognized in RBaMn_{2}O_{6}; (1) relatively high charge-order transition temperature and (2) the presence of structural transition above the charge-order temperature in the third group. We propose a possible orbital ordering at the structural transition, that is a possible freezing of the orbital, charge and spin degrees of freedom at the independent temperatures in the third group. These features are closely related to the peculiar structure that the MnO_{2} square-lattice is sandwiched by the rock-salt layers of two kinds, RO and BaO with extremely different lattice-sizes.

Taillefer|R. J. Birgeneau|D. A. Bonn|W. N. Hardy	  We have grown cubic centimetre-size crystals of YBa2Cu3Ox suitable for neutron studies, by a top-seeded melt-growth technique. Growth conditions were optimized with an eye toward maximizing phase purity. It was found that the addition of 2% Y2BaCuO5 and 0.5% Pt (by mass) were required to prevent melt loss and to obtain the highest crystallinity. A neutron diffraction study on a mosaic of six such crystals found that the final Y2BaCuO5 concentration was 5%, while other impurity phases comprised less than 1% by volume. The oxygen content was set to x=6.5, the crystals were detwinned and then carefully annealed to give the well-ordered ortho-II phase. The neutron study determined that 70% of the mosaic's volume was in the majority orthorhomic domain. The neutron (0,0,6) and (1,1,0) rocking curve widths were ~1 degree per crystal and \~2.2 degrees for the mosaic, and the oxygen chain correlation lengths were >100 A in the a- and b-directions and ~50 A in the c-direction.

Morris	  Columnar jointing is a fracture pattern common in igneous rocks in which cracks self-organize into a roughly hexagonal arrangement, leaving behind an ordered colonnade. We report observations of columnar jointing in a laboratory analog system, desiccated corn starch slurries. Using measurements of moisture density, evaporation rates, and fracture advance rates as evidence, we suggest an advective-diffusive system is responsible for the rough scaling behavior of columnar joints. This theory explains the order of magnitude difference in scales between jointing in lavas and in starches. We investigated the scaling of average columnar cross-sectional areas due to the evaporation rate, the analog of the cooling rate of igneous columnar joints. We measured column areas in experiments where the evaporation rate depended on lamp height and time, in experiments where the evaporation rate was fixed using feedback methods, and in experiments where gelatin was added to vary the rheology of the starch. Our results suggest that the column area at a particular depth is related to both the current conditions, and hysteretically to the geometry of the pattern at previous depths. We argue that there exists a range of stable column scales allowed for any particular evaporation rate.

Habig|for the Super-Kamiokande Collaboration	  Upward-going muons observed by the Super-Kamiokande detector are produced by high-energy atmospheric neutrinos which interact in rock around the detector. Those which pass completely through the detector have a mean parent neutrino energy of ~100 GeV, while those which range out inside the detector come from neutrinos of mean energy ~10 GeV. The neutrino baseline varies with the observed muon zenith angle, allowing for an independent test via nu-mu disappearance of the neutrino oscillations observed in the Super-Kamiokande contained events. 614 upward through-going and 137 upward stopping muons were observed over 537 (516) live days, resulting in a flux of Phi_t=1.74\pm0.07(stat.)\pm0.02(sys.), Phi_s=0.380\pm0.038(stat.)^{+0.019}_{-0.016}(sys.) x10^{-13}cm^{-2}s^{-1}sr^{-1}. The observed stopping/through-going ratio R=0.218\pm0.023(stat.)^{+0.014}_{-0.013}(syst.) is 2.9 sigma lower than the expectation of 0.368^{+0.049}_{-0.044}(theo.). Both the shape of the zenith angle distribution of the observed flux and this low ratio are inconsistent with the null oscillation hypothesis, but are compatible with the previously observed nu-mu <-> nu-tau oscillations. Taken as a whole, the addition of these higher energy nu-mu data to the contained neutrino events provides a better measurement of the oscillation parameters, narrowing the allowed parameter range to sin^22theta >~0.9 and 1.5x10^{-3}eV^2 <~ \Delta m^2 <~6x10^{-3} at 90% confidence.

Lee|Dinesh Loomba	  We describe our ongoing work on, and future plans for, searches in bulk matter for fractional charge elementary particles and very massive elementary particles. Our primary interest is in searching for such particles that may have been produced in the early universe and may be found in the more primeval matter available in the solar system: meteorites, material from the moon's surface, and certain types of ancient terrestrial rocks. In the future we are interested in examining material brought back by sample return probes from asteroids. We will describe our experimental methods that are based on new modifications of the Millikan liquid drop technique and modern technology: micromachining, CCD cameras, and desktop computers. Extensions of our experimental methods and technology allow searches for very massive charged particles in primeval matter; particles with masses greater than 10**13 GeV. In the first such searches carried out on earth there will be uncertainties in the mass search range. Therefore we will also discuss the advantages of eventually carrying out such searches directly on an asteroid.

Hollingworth|J. A. Kirkpatrick|V. A. Kudryavtsev|T. B. Lawson|P. K. Lightfoot|J. E. McMillan|B. Morgan|S. M. Paling|M. Robinson|N. J. C Spooner|D. R. Tovey|E. Tziaferi	  Presented here are results of simulations of neutron background performed for a time projection chamber acting as a particle dark matter detector in an underground laboratory. The investigated background includes neutrons from rock and detector components, generated via spontaneous fission and (alpha, n) reactions, as well as those due to cosmic-ray muons. Neutrons were propagated to the sensitive volume of the detector and the nuclear recoil spectra were calculated. Methods of neutron background suppression were also examined and limitations to the sensitivity of a gaseous dark matter detector are discussed. Results indicate that neutrons should not limit sensitivity to WIMP-nucleon interactions down to a level of (1 - 3) x 10^{-8} pb in a 10 kg detector.

Rock	  We analyze the possibility of measuring the single spin asymmetry (SSA) in open charm production by linearly polarized photons in the planned E160/E161 experiments at SLAC using the inclusive spectra of secondary (decay) leptons. In leading order pQCD, the SSA in the azimuthal distribution of the charged decay lepton is predicted to be about 0.2 for SLAC kinematics. Our calculations show that the SSA in the decay lepton distribution is well defined in pQCD: it is stable both perturbatively and parametrically, and practically insensitive to theoretical uncertainties in the charm semileptonic decays. Nonperturbative contributions to the leptonic SSA due to the gluon transverse motion in the target, heavy quark fragmentation and Fermi motion of the $c$-quark inside the $D$-meson are predicted to be about 10%. We conclude that measurements of the azimuthal asymmetry in the secondary lepton distribution would provide a good test of the applicability of pQCD to open charm production at energies of fixed target experiments. Our analysis of the SLAC experimental conditions shows that this SSA can be measured in E160/E161 with an accuracy of about ten percent.

Nogga	  Cross sections were measured for the near-threshold electrodisintegration of ^3He at momentum transfer values of q=2.4, 4.4, and 4.7 fm^{-1}. From these and prior measurements the transverse and longitudinal response functions R_T and R_L were deduced. Comparisons are made against previously published and new non-relativistic A=3 calculations using the best available NN potentials. In general, for q<2 fm^{-1} these calculations accurately predict the threshold electrodisintegration of ^3He. Agreement at increasing q demands consideration of two-body terms, but discrepancies still appear at the highest momentum transfers probed, perhaps due to the neglect of relativistic dynamics, or to the underestimation of high-momentum wave-function components. 	
9610029v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/nucl-th/9610029v1	1996	From Nuclear Astrophysics to Superheavy Elements: Predictions for Nuclei   Beyond Our Shores	J. Rayford Nix|Peter Moller	  Properties of 8,979 nuclei ranging from oxygen-16 to Z = 136, A = 339 and extending from the proton drip line to the neutron drip line have been calculated by use of the 1992 version of the finite-range droplet model. The calculated quantities include the ground-state mass, deformation, microscopic correction, odd-proton and odd-neutron spins and parities, proton and neutron pairing gaps, binding energy, one- and two-neutron separation energies, quantities related to beta-delayed one- and two-neutron emission probabilities, beta-decay energy release and half-life with respect to Gamow-Teller decay, one- and two-proton separation energies, and alpha-decay energy release and half-life. For 1,654 nuclei heavier than oxygen-16 whose masses were known experimentally in 1989 and which were included in the adjustment of model constants, the theoretical error is 0.669 MeV. For 371 additional nuclei heavier than oxygen-16 whose masses have been measured between 1989 and 1996 and which were not used in the adjustment of the model constants, the theoretical error is 0.570 MeV. We also discuss the extrapolateability of two other recent global models of the macroscopic-microscopic type, and conclude with a brief discussion of the recently discovered rock of metastable superheavy nuclei near Z = 110, A = 272 that had been correctly predicted by macroscopic-microscopic models. 	
9709016v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/nucl-th/9709016v1	1997	Stability and Production of Superheavy Nuclei	Peter Moller|J. Rayford Nix	  Beyond uranium heavy elements rapidly become increasingly unstable with respect to spontaneous fission as the proton number Z increases, because of the disruptive effect of the long-range Coulomb force. However, in the region just beyond Z = 100 magic proton and neutron numbers and the associated shell structure enhances nuclear stability sufficiently to allow observation of additional nuclei. Some thirty years ago it was speculated that an island of spherical, relatively stable superheavy nuclei would exist near the next doubly magic proton-neutron combination beyond 208:Pb, that is, at proton number Z = 114 and neutron number N = 184. Theory and experiment now show that there also exists a rock of stability in the vicinity of Z = 110 and N = 162 between the actinide region, which previously was the end of the peninsula of known elements, and the predicted island of spherical superheavy nuclei slightly southwest of the magic numbers Z = 114 and N = 184. We review here the stability properties of the heavy region of nuclei. Just as the decay properties of nuclei in the heavy region depend strongly on shell structure, this structure also dramatically affects the fusion entrance channel. The six most recently discovered new elements were all formed in cold-fusion reactions. We discuss here the effect of the doubly magic structure of the target in cold-fusion reactions on the fusion barrier and on dissipation. 	
0304061v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0304061v2	2003	Mono Lake or Laschamp geomagnetic event recorded from lava flows in   Amsterdam Island (southeastern Indian Ocean)	Claire Carvallo|Pierre Camps|Gilles Ruffet|Bernard Henry|Thierry Poidras	  We report a survey carried out on basalt flows from Amsterdam Island in order to check the presence of intermediate directions interpreted to belong to a geomagnetic field excursion within the Brunhes epoch, completing this paleomagnetic record with paleointensity determinations and radiometric dating. The directional results corroborate the findings by Watkins and Nougier (1973) : normal polarity is found for two units and an intermediate direction, with associated VGPs close to the equator, for the other two units. A notable result is that these volcanic rocks are well suited for absolute paleointensity determinations. Fifty percent of the samples yields reliable intensity values with high quality factors. An original element of this study is that we made use of the PTRM-tail test of Shcherbakova et al. (2000) to help in the interpretation of the paleointensity measurements. Doing thus, only the high temperature intervals, beyond 400 degres C, were retained to obtain the most reliable estimate of the strength of the ancient magnetic field. The normal units yield Virtual Dipole Moments (VDM) of 6.2 and 7.7 10e22 Am2 and the excursional units yield values of 3.7 and 3.4 10e22 Am2. These results are quite consistent with the other Thellier determinations from Brunhes excursion records, all characterized by a decrease of the VDM as VGP latitude decreases. 40Ar/39Ar isotopic age determinations provide an estimate of 26+-15 Kyr and 18+-9 Kyr for the transitional lava flows, which could correspond to the Mono Lake excursion. However, the large error bars associated with these ages do not exclude the hypothesis that this event is the Laschamp.

Oxyexsolution of titanomagnetite resulted in the crystallization of interacting single domain particles with Curie point close to 540 C and the concomitant development of one of two types chemical remanence, depending upon thermal treatment: isothermal chemical remanence (CRM) or thermochemical remanence (TCRM), the latter acquired under the combined effects of chemical change and temperature decrease. CRM and TCRM acquired under various conditions were subjected to Thellier-type experiments. The CRM/TRM ratio is found to be less than one and increases rapidly with acquisition temperature (0.35 at 400 C, 0.65 at 450 C, and 0.90 at 500 C). Thus, very large underestimate of geomagnetic field paleostrength can occur when a natural CRM is not recognized as such and is believed to be a natural TRM. In an attempt to mimic deuteric oxyexsolution in cooling magma, TCRM was imparted from 560 to 400 C at a cooling rate of 0.1 C/mn. The TCRM/TRM is found to slightly exceed one (1.10), in agreement with the theoretically predicted effect of the difference in cooling rate.

Romero	  In recent years, the availability of highly pure stable isotopes has made possible the investigation of the dependence of the physical properties of crystals, in particular semiconductors, on their isotopic composition. Following the investigation of the specific heat ($C_p$, $C_v$) of monatomic crystals such as diamond, silicon, and germanium, similar investigations have been undertaken for the tetrahedral diatomic systems ZnO and GaN (wurtzite structure), for which the effect of the mass of the cation differs from that of the anion. In this article we present measurements for a semiconductor with rock salt structure, namely lead sulfide. Because of the large difference in the atomic mass of both constituents ($M_{\rm Pb}$= 207.21 and ($M_{\rm S}$=32.06 a.m.u., for the natural isotopic abundance) the effects of varying the cation and that of the anion mass are very different for this canonical semiconductor. We compare the measured temperature dependence of $C_p \approx C_v$, and the corresponding derivatives with respect to ($M_{\rm Pb}$ and $M_{\rm S}$), with \textit{\textit{ab initio}} calculations based on the lattice dynamics obtained from the local density approximation (LDA) electronic band structure. Quantitative deviations between theory and experiment are attributed to the absence of spin-orbit interaction in the ABINIT program used for the electronic band structure calculations. 	
0705.3815v4	http://arxiv.org/pdf/0705.3815v4	2007	Measurement of the Atmospheric Muon Charge Ratio at TeV Energies with   MINOS	 MINOS Collaboration	  The 5.4 kton MINOS far detector has been taking charge-separated cosmic ray muon data since the beginning of August, 2003 at a depth of 2070 meters-water-equivalent in the Soudan Underground Laboratory, Minnesota, USA. The data with both forward and reversed magnetic field running configurations were combined to minimize systematic errors in the determination of the underground muon charge ratio. When averaged, two independent analyses find the charge ratio underground to be 1.374 +/- 0.004 (stat.) +0.012 -0.010(sys.). Using the map of the Soudan rock overburden, the muon momenta as measured underground were projected to the corresponding values at the surface in the energy range 1-7 TeV. Within this range of energies at the surface, the MINOS data are consistent with the charge ratio being energy independent at the two standard deviation level. When the MINOS results are compared with measurements at lower energies, a clear rise in the charge ratio in the energy range 0.3 -- 1.0 TeV is apparent. A qualitative model shows that the rise is consistent with an increasing contribution of kaon decays to the muon charge ratio.

Porter	  We use the GEANT4 Monte Carlo framework to calculate the gamma-ray albedo of the Moon due to interactions of cosmic ray (CR) nuclei with moon rock. Our calculation of the albedo spectrum agrees with the EGRET data. We show that the spectrum of gamma rays from the Moon is very steep with an effective cutoff around 4 GeV (600 MeV for the inner part of the Moon disc). Apart from other astrophysical sources, the albedo spectrum of the Moon is well understood, including its absolute normalisation; this makes it a useful "standard candle" for gamma-ray telescopes, such as the forthcoming Gamma Ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST). The albedo flux depends on the incident CR spectrum which changes over the solar cycle. Therefore, it is possible to monitor the CR spectrum using the albedo gamma-ray flux. Simultaneous measurements of CR proton and helium spectra by the Payload for Antimatter Matter Exploration and Light-nuclei Astrophysics (PAMELA), and observations of the albedo gamma rays by the GLAST Large Area Telescope (LAT), can be used to test the model predictions and will enable the GLAST LAT to monitor the CR spectrum near the Earth beyond the lifetime of PAMELA.

Our calculation of the albedo spectrum agrees with the EGRET data. We show that the spectrum of gamma rays from the Moon is very steep with an effective cutoff around 3-4 GeV (600 MeV for the inner part of the Moon disk) and exhibits a narrow pion-decay line at 67.5 MeV, perhaps unique in astrophysics. Apart from other astrophysical sources, the albedo spectrum of the Moon is well understood, including its absolute normalisation; this makes it a useful "standard candle" for gamma-ray telescopes. The steep albedo spectrum also provides a unique opportunity for energy calibration of gamma-ray telescopes, such as the forthcoming Gamma Ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST).

Greedan|Lachlan M. D. Cranswick	  Li5OsO6 and Li5ReO6 polycrystalline samples were synthesized by conventional solid state methods. Employing powder neutron diffraction data, the crystal structure of Li5OsO6 was re-investigated. Li5OsO6 crystallizes in C2/m space group in an ordered NaCl structure type where a = 5.0472(1) A, b = 8.7827(2) A, c = 5.0079(1) A, Beta = 109.777(2) degree and V = 208.90(1).A^3 Magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity data indicate an AFM long range order below 40K although there is evidence for low dimensional short range order above 80K. As well, the frustration index, f = |theta|/TN ~1, in contrast to the isostructural and isoelectronic compound, Li4MgReO6, which is a spin glass below 12K and has f ~ 14. An attempt was made to rationalize these differences using spin dimer analysis. The key results are that the spin exchange interactions in the Re-based compound are stronger and are consistent with a frustrated triangular lattice model while a low dimensional short range order model is better for Li5OsO6. The main reason for this is a strong Jahn-Teller distortion in the OsO6 octahedron material which constrains the unpaired electron to occupy the dxy orbital.

Ismat Shah	  Nanostructured TiO2 thin films were prepared by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) on indium doped tin oxide (ITO) substrates. Results from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) show that Ti 2p core level peaks shift toward the lower binding energy with decrease in the buffer gas pressure (O2:Ar = 1:1). This suggests that oxygen vacancies are created under insufficient oxygen conditions. Anatase to rutile ratio is also found to be system pressure dependent. Under deposition pressure of 750 mTorr only anatase phase was observed even at 1073 K substrate temperature which is much higher that the bulk anatase to rutile phase transformation temperature. The deposited TiO2 thin films were fabricated as photoanodes for photoelectrochemical (PEC) studies. PEC measurements on TiO2 photoanodes show that the flatband potential (Vfb) increases by 0.088 eV on absolute vacuum energy scale (AVS) with decrease in the deposition pressure, from 750 to 250 mTorr at 873K. The highest incident photon to current conversion efficiency [IPCE(lambda)] of 2.5 to 6 % was obtained from the thin films prepared at substrate temperature of 873K. Combining the results from XPS and PEC studies, we conclude that the deposition pressure affects the concentration of the oxygen vacancies which changes the electronic structure of the TiO2. With reference to photoelectrochemical catalytic performance, our results suggest that it is possible to adjust the Fermi energy level and structure of TiO2 thin films by controlling the buffer gas pressure and temperature to align the energy of the flatband potential (Vfb) with respect to specific redox species in the electrolyte.

These results are from data taken in the southwestern region of the 1500 ft. (457 m) deep level of the mine on our third and most recent visit to the mine. We transmitted and received a fast, high-power, broadband pulse from within three vertical boreholes that were drilled to depths of 100 ft. (30 m) and 200 ft. below the 1500 ft. level using three different pairs of dipole antennas whose bandwidths span 125 to 900 MHz. By measuring the relative strength of the received pulses between boreholes with separations of 50 m and 169 m, we deduce the attenuation of the signal attributed to the salt medium. We fit the frequency dependence of the attenuation to a power law and find the best fit field attenuation lengths to be 93 \pm 7 m at 150 MHz, 63 \pm 3 m at 300 MHz, and 36 \pm 2 m at 800 MHz. This is the most precise measurement of radio attenuation in a natural salt formation to date. We assess the implications of this measurement for a future neutrino detector in salt. 	
0807.2101v3	http://arxiv.org/pdf/0807.2101v3	2009	Response of 3D Free Axisymmetric Rigid Objects under Seismic Excitations	Li Yanheng|Shi Baoping	  Previous studies of precariously balanced objects in seismically active regions provide important information for aseismatic engineering and theoretical seismology. They are almost founded on an oversimplified assumption: any 3-dimensional (3D) actual object with special symmetry could be regarded as a 2D finite object in light of the corresponding symmetry. To gain an actual evolution of precariously balanced objects subjected to various levels of ground accelerations, a 3D investigation should be performed. In virtue of some reasonable works from a number of mechanicians, we derive three resultant second-order ordinary differential equations determine the evolution of 3D responses. The new dynamic analysis is following the 3D rotation of a rigid body around a fixed point. A computer program for numerical solution of these equations is also developed to simulate the rocking and rolling response of axisymmetric objects to various levels of ground accelerations. It is shown that the 2D and 3D estimates on the minimum overturning acceleration of a cylinder under the same sets of half- and full-sine-wave pulses are almost consistent except at several frequency bonds. However, we find that the 2D and 3D responses using the actual seismic excitation have distinct differences, especially to north-south (NS) and up-down (UD) components. In this work the chosen seismic wave is the El Centro recording of the 18 May 1940 Imperial Valley Earthquake. The 3D outcome does not seem to support the 2D previous result that the vertical component of the ground acceleration is less important than the horizontal ones. We conclude that the 2D dynamic modeling is not always reliable. 	
0811.0175v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/0811.0175v1	2008	Full Numerical Simulations of Catastrophic Small Body Collisions	Zoe M. Leinhardt|Sarah T. Stewart	  The outcome of collisions between small icy bodies, such as Kuiper belt objects, is poorly understood and yet a critical component of the evolution of the trans-Neptunian region. The expected physical properties of outer solar system materials (high porosity, mixed ice-rock composition, and low material strength) pose significant computational challenges. We present results from catastrophic small body collisions using a new hybrid hydrocode to $N$-body code computational technique. This method allows detailed modeling of shock propagation and material modification as well as gravitational reaccumulation. Here, we consider a wide range of material strengths to span the possible range of Kuiper belt objects. We find that the shear strength of the target is important in determining the collision outcome for 2 to 50-km radius bodies, which are traditionally thought to be in a pure gravity regime. The catastrophic disruption and dispersal criteria, $Q_D^*$, can vary by up to a factor of three between strong crystalline and weak aggregate materials. The material within the largest reaccumulated remnants experiences a wide range of shock pressures. The dispersal and reaccumulation process results in the material on the surfaces of the largest remnants having experienced a wider range of shock pressures compared to material in the interior. Hence, depending on the initial structure and composition, the surface materials on large, reaccumulated bodies in the outer solar system may exhibit complex spectral and albedo variations. Finally, we present revised catastrophic disruption criteria for a range of impact velocities and material strengths for outer solar system bodies.

In our vision LVD could become (without affecting in any way its main purpose of SN neutrino telescope) a host for a relatively compact but massive experiment looking for rare events. The empty volume that can be obtained removing 2 modules from the most internal part of the detector is 2.1m x 6.2m x 2.8m; we will call it LVD Core Facility (LVD-CF). We have evaluated the active vetoing and shielding power of LVD, with a detailed MC simulation (based on Geant4) of the detector and the rock that surrounds it. The results show that the flux of neutrons that are not associated with a visible muon in LVD is very low; it results reduced by a factor 50, equivalent to the one present in a much deeper underground laboratory, i.e. Sudbury. Moreover we present the results of on-going measurements about the gamma contamination inside the LVD-CF: it is reduced by a factor greater than 10 with respect to the one measured outside the LVD detector.

Indeed, the south-east corners of these monuments align towards the site of the temple of Heliopolis, which was plainly visible in ancient times. It was later discovered that a similar situation occurs in the main pyramid field of the subsequent dynasty at Abu Sir. Here, the northwest corners of three chronologically successive pyramids again voluntarily align towards Heliopolis. However, the temple was in this case not visible, due to the rock outcrop today occupied by the Cairo citadel which blocks the view. In the present paper, a interdisciplinary approach based on historical, topographical and archaeoastronomical analysis is developed in an attempt at understanding such peculiar features, which governed from the very beginning the planning of these wonderful monuments. A general pattern actually arises, which appears to have inspired the choice of the sites and the disposition on the ground of almost all the funerary complexes of the kings during the Old Kingdom. In particular, this pattern helps to explain the choices in the location of the funerary complexes of Niuserre in Abusir and of Unas in Saqqara.

The normal mode analysis of the relevant Helmholtz equation under the partially absorbing, but uniform, boundary condition provides a starting framework in understanding detailed evolution dynamics of the attribute in the time domain. In particular, the boundary-localized depletion has been widely employed in practical applications that depend on geometry of various porous media such as rocks, cement, bones, and cheese. While direct relationship between the pore geometry and the diffusion-relaxation spectrum forms the basis for such applications and has been extensively studied, relatively less attention has been paid to the spatial variation of the boundary condition. In this work, we focus on the way the pore geometry and the inhomogeneous depletion strength of the boundary become intertwined and thus obscure the direct relationship between the spectrum and the geometry. It is often impossible to gauge experimentally the degree to which such interference occur. We fill this gap by perturbatively incorporating classes of spatially-varying boundary conditions and derive their consequences that are observable through numerical simulations or controlled experiments on glass bead packs and artificially fabricated porous media. We identify features of the spectrum that are most sensitive to the inhomogeneity and apply the method to the spherical pore with a simple hemi-spherical binary distribution of the depletion strength and obtain bounds for the induced change in the slowest relaxation mode.

Benz	  The hot Neptune orbiting around GJ 436 is a unique example of an intermediate mass planet. Its close-in orbit suggests that the planet has undergone migration and its study is fundamental to understanding planet formation and evolution. As it transits its parent star, it is the only Neptune-mass extrasolar planet of known mass and radius, being slightly larger and more massive than Neptune (M=22.6 M_Earth, R=4.19R_Earth). In this regime, several bulk compositions are possible: from an Earth-like core with a thick hydrogen envelope to a water-rich planet with a thin hydrogen envelope comprising a Neptune-like structure. We combine planet-structure modeling with an advanced planet-formation model to assess the likelihood of the different possible bulk compositions of GJ 436 b. We find that both an envelope-free water planet ("Ocean planet") as well as a diminute version of a gaseous giant planet are excluded. Consisting of a rocky core with a thick hydrogen/helium envelope, a "dry" composition produces not only too small a radius but is also a very unlikely outcome of planet formation around such a low-mass star. We conclude that GJ 436 b is probably of much higher rock content than Neptune (more than 45% in mass), with a small H-He envelope (10 - 20% in mass). This is the expected outcome of the gathering of materials during the migration process in the inner disk, creating a population of which the hot Neptune is representative.

Appel|Yuichi Hatsukawa|Robert Frei|Masumi Oshima|Yosuke Toh|Atsushi Kimura	  The Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB) period is the narrow time interval between 3.8 and 3.9 Gyr ago, where the bulk of the craters we see on the Moon formed. Even more craters formed on the Earth.   During a field expedition to the 3.8 Gyr old Isua greenstone belt in Greenland, we sampled three types of metasedimentary rocks, that contain direct traces of the LHB impactors by a seven times enrichment (150 ppt) in iridium compared to present day ocean crust (20 ppt).   We show that this enrichment is in agreement with the lunar cratering rate, providing the impactors were comets, but not if they were asteroids. Our study is a first direct indication of the nature of the LHB impactors, and the first to find an agreement between the LHB lunar cratering rate and the Earth's early geochemical record (and the corresponding lunar record).   The LHB comets that delivered the iridium we see at Isua will at the same time have delivered the equivalent of a km deep ocean, and we explain why one should expect a cometary ocean to become roughly the size of the Earth's present-day ocean, not only in terms of depth but also in terms of the surface area it covers.

Estrada|Sebastien Charnoz	  Here we show that Iapetus can serve to discriminate between satellite formation models. Its accretion history can be understood in terms of a two-component gaseous subnebula, with a relatively dense inner region, and an extended tail out to the location of the irregular satellites, as in the SEMM model of Mosqueira and Estrada (2003a,b). Following giant planet formation, planetesimals in the feeding zone of Jupiter and Saturn become dynamically excited, and undergo a collisional cascade. Ablation and capture of planetesimal fragments crossing the gaseous circumplanetary disks delivers enough collisional rubble to account for the mass budgets of the regular satellites of Jupiter and Saturn. This process can result in rock/ice fractionation provided the make up of the population of disk crossers is non-homogeneous, thus offering a natural explanation for the marked compositional differences between outer solar nebula objects and those that accreted in the subnebulae of the giant planets. Consequently, our model leads to an enhancement of the ice content of Iapetus, and to a lesser degree those of Ganymede, Titan and Callisto, and accounts for the (non-stochastic) compositions of these large, low-porosity outer regular satellites of Jupiter and Saturn.

Piccini|D. C. Ford|Chas. J. Yonge	  We used the quantitative theory of solubility of karst rocks of Shopov et. al, (1989, 1991a) in dependence of the temperature and other thermodynamic parameters to make reconstructions of past carbonate denudation rates. This theory produced equations assessing the carbonate denudation rates in dependence on the temperature or on the precipitation. We estimated the averaged denudation rate in the region to 14 mm/kyr or 38 t/km2 per year. We used this estimate as starting point and substituted our proxy records of the annual temperature and the annual precipitation in the equations of dependence of karst denudation rate on precipitation and temperature. This way we reconstructed variations of the annual karst denudation rate for the last 280 years in dependence on the annual precipitation and for the last 1250 years in dependence on the temperature. Both reconstructions produce quite reasonable estimate of the variations of carbonate denudation, which is within observed variation of 8- 20 mm/kyr (86% variation). Precipitation dependence of carbonate denudation produces 79 % variation in the denudation rate in result of the reconstructed variation of 300 mm/yr from the driest to the wettest year during the last 280 years. Temperature dependence of carbonate denudation due to temperature dependence of solubility of the carbonate dioxide produce only 9.3% variation in the denudation rate in result of the reconstructed variation of 4.7 deg. C during the last 1250 years, so it is negligible in respect of the precipitation dependence.

Dumas|E. M. Gonzalez|Kai Liu|C. A. Ross|Ivan K. Schuller|J. L. Vicent	  A ratchet effect (the rectification of an ac injected current) which is purely magnetic in origin has been observed in a superconducting-magnetic nanostructure hybrid. The hybrid consists of a superconducting Nb film in contact with an array of nanoscale magnetic triangles, circular rings or elliptical rings. The arrays were placed into well-defined remanent magnetic states by application of different magnetic field cycles. The stray fields from these remanent states provide a magnetic landscape which influences the motion of superconducting vortices. We examined both randomly varying landscapes from demagnetized samples, and ordered landscapes from samples at remanence after saturation in which the magnetic rings form parallel onion states containing two domain walls. The ratchet effect is absent if the rings are in the demagnetized state or if the vortices propagate parallel to the magnetic reflection symmetry axis (perpendicular to the magnetic domain walls) in the ordered onion state. On the other hand, when the vortices move perpendicular to the magnetic reflection symmetry axis in the ordered onion state (parallel to the domain walls) a clear ratchet effect is observed. This behavior differs qualitatively from that observed in samples containing arrays of triangular Ni nanostructures, which show a ratchet of structural origin. 	
1001.2853v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1001.2853v1	2010	Estimation of poroelastic parameters from seismograms using Biot theory	Louis De Barros|Michel Dietrich	  We investigate the possibility to extract information contained in seismic waveforms propagating in fluid-filled porous media by developing and using a full waveform inversion procedure valid for layered structures. To reach this objective, we first solve the forward problem by implementing the Biot theory in a reflectivity-type simulation program. We then study the sensitivity of the seismic response of stratified media to the poroelastic parameters. Our numerical tests indicate that the porosity and consolidation parameter are the most sensitive parameters in forward and inverse modeling, whereas the permeability has only a very limited influence on the seismic response. Next, the analytical expressions of the sensitivity operators are introduced in a generalized least-square inversion algorithm based on an iterative modeling of the seismic waveforms. The application of this inversion procedure to synthetic data shows that the porosity as well as the fluid and solid parameters can be correctly reconstructed as long as the other parameters are well known. However, the strong seismic coupling between some of the model parameters makes it difficult to fully characterize the medium by a multi-parameter inversion scheme. One solution to circumvent this difficulty is to combine several model parameters according to rock physics laws to invert for composite parameters. Another possibility is to invert the seismic data for the perturbations of the medium properties, such as those resulting from a gas injection.

Anisichkin|W. van Westrenen	  Recent high-precision measurements of the isotopic composition of lunar rocks demonstrate that the bulk silicate Earth and the Moon show an unexpectedly high degree of similarity. This is inconsistent with one of the primary results of classic dynamical simulations of the widely accepted giant impact model for the formation of the Moon, namely that most of the mass of the Moon originates from the impactor, not Earth.   Resolution of this discrepancy without changing the main premises of the giant impact model requires total isotopic homogenisation of Earth and impactor material after the impact for a wide range of elements including O, Si, K, Ti, Nd and W. Even if this process could explain the O isotope similarity, it is unlikely to work for the much heavier, refractory elements. Given the increasing uncertainty surrounding the giant impact model in light of these geochemical data, alternative hypotheses for lunar formation should be explored. In this paper, we revisit the hypothesis that the Moon was formed directly from terrestrial mantle material. We show that the dynamics of this scenario requires a large amount of energy, almost instantaneously generated additional energy. The only known source for this additional energy is nuclear fission. We show that it is feasible to form the Moon through the ejection of terrestrial silicate material triggered by a nuclear explosion at Earths core-mantle boundary (CMB), causing a shock wave propagating through the Earth. Hydrodynamic modelling of this scenario shows that a shock wave created by rapidly expanding plasma resulting from the explosion disrupts and expels overlying mantle and crust material.

Malomed|Bambi Hu	  We study two-dimensional (2D) matter-wave gap solitons trapped in an elliptically deformed concentric lattice potential, within the framework of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) with self-attraction or self-repulsion. For a fixed eccentricity of the lattice, soliton families are found in both the repulsive and attractive models. In the former case, the analysis reveals two kinds of gap solitons trapped in the first oval trough (the ring-shaped potential minimum closest to the center): elliptic annular solitons (EASs), and double solitons (DSs), which are formed by two tightly localized density peaks located at diametrically opposite points of the trough, with zero phase difference between them. With the decrease of the norm, the density distribution in the EAS along the azimuthal direction changes from nearly-uniform to double-peaked and, eventually, to the DS. In the attractive model, there exist only DSs in the oval trough, while EASs are not found. All such solitons without the angular momentum (l = 0) are fully stable. For l is not equal to 0, vortical solitons - both EASs with a sufficiently large norm (in the repulsive model) and DSs (in models with both signs of the nonlinearity) - are quasi-stable, exhibiting rocking motion in the elliptic trough (we consider the cases of l=1 and l=2). At smaller values of the norm, the vortical annular solitons (in the repulsive model) are unstable. Stable fundamental solitons trapped in the central potential well are investigated too, in both the attractive and repulsive models, by means of the variational approximation and numerical methods.

We consider model-independent direct neutrino production and secondary neutrino production from the decay of taus, W bosons and bottom quarks produced in the annihilation of dark matter. We illustrate how muon flux from dark matter annihilation has a very different shape than the muon flux from atmospheric neutrinos. We also discuss the dependence of the muon fluxes on the dark matter density profile and on the dark matter mass and of the total muon rates on the detector threshold. We consider both the upward muon flux, when muons are created in the rock below the detector, and the contained flux when muons are created in the (ice) detector. We also calculate the event rates for showers from neutrino interactions in the detector and show that the signal dominates over the background for $150 {\rm GeV} <m_\chi < 1$ TeV for $E_{sh}^{th} = 100$ GeV.

Hinkov	  We report superconducting (SC) properties of stoichiometric LiFeAs (Tc = 17 K) studied by small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) and angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES). Although the vortex lattice exhibits no long-range order, well-defined SANS rocking curves indicate better ordering than in chemically doped 122-compounds. The London penetration depth of 210 nm, determined from the magnetic field dependence of the form factor, is compared to that calculated from the ARPES band structure with no adjustable parameters. Its temperature dependence is best described by a single isotropic SC gap of 3.0 meV, which agrees with the ARPES value of 3.1 meV and corresponds to the ratio 2Delta/kTc = 4.1, approaching the weak-coupling limit predicted by the BCS theory. This classifies LiFeAs as a weakly coupled single-gap superconductor, similar to conventional metals.

Medvedeva|Chaminda L. Hettiarachchi	  The electronic properties of single- and multi-cation transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) are investigated using first-principles density functional approach. A detailed comparison of the electronic band structure of stoichiometric and oxygen deficient In$_2$O$_3$, $\alpha$- and $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$, rock salt and wurtzite ZnO, and layered InGaZnO$_4$ reveals the role of the following factors which govern the transport and optical properties of these TCO materials: (i) the crystal symmetry of the oxides, including both the oxygen coordination and the long-range structural anisotropy; (ii) the electronic configuration of the cation(s), specifically, the type of orbital(s) -- $s$, $p$ or $d$ -- which form the conduction band; and (iii) the strength of the hybridization between the cation's states and the p-states of the neighboring oxygen atoms. The results not only explain the experimentally observed trends in the electrical conductivity in the single-cation TCO, but also demonstrate that multicomponent oxides may offer a way to overcome the electron localization bottleneck which limits the charge transport in wide-bandgap main-group metal oxides. Further, the advantages of aliovalent substitutional doping -- an alternative route to generate carriers in a TCO host -- are outlined based on the electronic band structure calculations of Sn, Ga, Ti and Zr-doped InGaZnO$_4$. We show that the transition metal dopants offer a possibility to improve conductivity without compromising the optical transmittance.

Kudrnovský	  Using full-potential linear augmented plane wave method (FP-LAPW) and the density functional theory, we have carried out a systematic investigation of the electronic, magnetic, and cohesive properties of the chalcogenide CrTe in three competing structures: rock-salt (RS), zinc blende (ZB) and the NiAs-type (NA) hexagonal. Although the ground state is of NA structure, RS and ZB are interesting in that these fcc-based structures, which can possibly be grown on many semiconductor substrates, exhibit half-metallic phases above some critical values of the lattice parameter. We find that the NA structure is not half-metallic at its equilibrium volume, while both ZB and RS structures are. The RS structure is more stable than the ZB, with an energy that is lower by 0.25 eV/atom. While confirming previous results on the half-metallic phase in ZB structure, we provide hitherto unreported results on the half-metallic RS phase, with a gap in the minority channel and a magnetic moment of 4.0 $\mu_{B}$ per formula unit. A comparison of total energies for the ferromagnetic (FM), non-magnetic (NM), and antiferromagnetic (AFM) configurations shows the lowest energy configuration to be FM for CrTe in all the three structures. The FP-LAPW calculations are supplemented by linear muffin-tin orbital (LMTO) calculations using both local density approximation (LDA) and LDA+U method. The exchange interactions and the Curie temperatures calculated via the linear response method in ZB and RS CrTe are compared over a wide range of the lattice parameter. The calculated Curie temperatures for the RS phase are consistently higher than those for the ZB phase. 	
1005.2580v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1005.2580v1	2010	Persistence in fluctuating environments	Sebastian J. Schreiber|Michel Benaïm|Kolawolé A. S. Atchadé	  Understanding under what conditions interacting populations, whether they be plants, animals, or viral particles, coexist is a question of theoretical and practical importance in population biology. Both biotic interactions and environmental fluctuations are key factors that can facilitate or disrupt coexistence. To better understand this interplay between these deterministic and stochastic forces, we develop a mathematical theory extending the nonlinear theory of permanence for deterministic systems to stochastic difference and differential equations. Our condition for coexistence requires that there is a fixed set of weights associated with the interacting populations and this weighted combination of populations' invasion rates is positive for any (ergodic) stationary distribution associated with a subcollection of populations. Here, an invasion rate corresponds to an average per-capita growth rate along a stationary distribution. When this condition holds and there is sufficient noise in the system, we show that the populations approach a unique positive stationary distribution. Moreover, we show that our coexistence criterion is robust to small perturbations of the model functions. Using this theory, we illustrate that (i) environmental noise enhances or inhibits coexistence in communities with rock-paper-scissor dynamics depending on correlations between interspecific demographic rates, (ii) stochastic variation in mortality rates has no effect on the coexistence criteria for discrete-time Lotka-Volterra communities, and (iii) random forcing can promote genetic diversity in the presence of exploitative interactions.

These compounds have perovskite-like blocking layers between Fe2As2 layers. The structure of new compounds are tetragonal with space groups of P4/nmm for n = 2 and 4 and P4mm for n = 3, which are similar to those of (Fe2As2)(Can+1(Sc,Ti)nOy)[n = 3,4,5] found in our previous study. Compounds with n = 3 and 4 have new crystal structures with 3 and 4 sheets of perovskite layers, respectively, including a rock salt layer in each blocking layer. The a-axis lengths of the three compounds are approximately 3.8 A, which are close to those of FeSe and LiFeAs. (Fe2As2)(Ca6(Al,Ti)4Oy) exhibited bulk superconductivity in magnetization measurement with Tc(onset)~36 K and resistivity drop was observed at ~39 K. (Fe2As2)(Ca5(Al,Ti)3Oy) also showed large diamagnetism at low temperatures. These new compounds indicate considerable rooms are still remaining for new superconductors in layered iron pnictides. 	
1009.2710v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1009.2710v1	2010	Activity in Geminid Parent (3200) Phaethon	David Jewitt|Jing Li	  The asteroid (3200) Phaethon is widely recognized as the parent of the Geminid meteoroid stream. However, it has never shown evidence for on-going mass loss or for any form of comet-like activity that would indicate the continued replenishment of the stream. Following an alert by Battams and Watson (2009), we used NASA's STEREO-A spacecraft to image Phaethon near perihelion, in the period UT 2009 June 17 - 22, when the heliocentric distance was near 0.14 AU. The resulting photometry shows an unexpected brightening, by a factor of two, starting UT 2009 June 20.2+/-0.2, which we interpret as an impulsive release of dust particles from Phaethon. If the density is near 2500 kg/m^3, then the emitted dust particles must have a combined mass of ~2.5x10^8 a1 kg, where a1 is the particle radius in millimeters. Assuming a1 = 1, this is approximately 10^-4 of the Geminid stream mass and to replenish the stream in steady-state within its estimated ~1000 yr lifetime would require ~10 events like the one observed, per orbit. Alternatively, on-going mass loss may be unrelated to the event which produced the Phaethon-Geminid complex. An impact origin of the dust is highly unlikely. Phaethon is too hot for water ice to survive, rendering unlikely the possibility that dust is ejected through gas-drag from sublimated ice. Instead, we suggest that Phaethon is essentially a rock comet, in which the small perihelion distance leads both to the production of dust (through thermal fracture and decomposition-cracking of hydrated minerals) and to its ejection into interplanetary space (through radiation pressure sweeping and other effects). 	
1009.5115v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1009.5115v1	2010	Exotic phases induced by strong spin-orbit coupling in ordered double   perovskites	Gang Chen|Rodrigo Pereira|Leon Balents	  We construct and analyze a microscopic model for insulating rock salt ordered double perovskites, with the chemical formula A$_2$BB'O$_6$, where the B' atom has a 4d$^1$ or 5d$^1$ electronic configuration and forms a face centered cubic (fcc) lattice. The combination of the triply-degenerate $t_{2g}$ orbital and strong spin-orbit coupling forms local quadruplets with an effective spin moment $j=3/2$. Moreover, due to strongly orbital-dependent exchange, the effective spins have substantial biquadratic and bicubic interactions (fourth and sixth order in the spins, respectively). This leads, at the mean field level, to three main phases: an unusual antiferromagnet with dominant octupolar order, a ferromagnetic phase with magnetization along the $[110]$ direction, and a non-magnetic but quadrupolar ordered phase, which is stabilized by thermal fluctuations and intermediate temperatures. All these phases have a two sublattice structure described by the ordering wavevector ${\boldsymbol Q} =2\pi (001)$. We consider quantum fluctuations and argue that in the regime of dominant antiferromagnetic exchange, a non-magnetic valence bond solid or quantum spin liquid state may be favored instead. Candidate quantum spin liquid states and their basic properties are described. We also address the effect of single-site anisotropy driven by lattice distortions. Existing and possible future experiments are discussed in light of these results. 	
1010.1823v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1010.1823v1	2010	Yield criteria for quasibrittle and frictional materials	Davide Bigoni|Andrea Piccolroaz	  A new yield/damage function is proposed for modelling the inelastic behaviour of a broad class of pressure-sensitive, frictional, ductile and brittle-cohesive materials. The yield function allows the possibility of describing a transition between the shape of a yield surface typical of a class of materials to that typical of another class of materals. This is a fundamental key to model the behaviour of materials which become cohesive during hardening (so that the shape of the yield surface evolves from that typical of a granular material to that typical of a dense material), or which decrease cohesion due to damage accumulation. The proposed yield function is shown to agree with a variety of experimental data relative to soil, concrete, rock, metallic and composite powders, metallic foams, porous metals, and polymers. The yield function represents a single, convex and smooth surface in stress space approaching as limit situations well-known criteria and the extreme limits of convexity in the deviatoric plane. The yield function is therefore a generalization of several criteria, including von Mises, Drucker-Prager, Tresca, modified Tresca, Coulomb-Mohr, modified Cam-clay, and --concerning the deviatoric section-- Rankine and Ottosen. Convexity of the function is proved by developing two general propositions relating convexity of the yield surface to convexity of the corresponding function. These propositions are general and therefore may be employed to generate other convex yield functions. 	
1010.2532v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1010.2532v1	2010	Transport of First Rocks of The Solar System by X-winds	Renyu Hu	  It has been suggested that chondrules and calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) were formed at the inner edge of the protoplanetary disk and then entrained in magnetocentrifugal X-winds. We study trajectories of such solid bodies with the consideration of the central star gravity, the protoplanetary disk gravity, and the gas drag of the wind. The efficiency of the gas drag depends on a parameter $\eta$, which is the product of the solid body size and density. We find that the gravity of the protoplanetary disk has a non-negligible effect on the trajectories. If a solid body re-enters the flared disk, the re-entering radius depends on the stellar magnetic dipole moment, the disk's gravity, the parameter $\eta$, and the initial launching angle. The disk's gravity can make the re-entering radius lower by up to 30%. We find a threshold $\eta$, denoted as $\eta_t$, for any particular configuration of the X-wind, below which the solid bodies will be expelled from the planetary system. $\eta_t$ sensitively depends on the initial launching angle, and also depends on the mass of the disk. Only the solid bodies with a $\eta$ larger than but very close to $\eta_t$ can be launched to a re-entering radius larger than 1 AU. This size-sorting effect may explain why chondrules come with a narrow range of sizes within each chondritic class. In general, the size distributions of CAIs and chondrules in chondrites can be determined from the initial size distribution as well as the distribution over the initial launching angle. 	
1103.2338v5	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1103.2338v5	2012	The Extraordinary SVD	Carla D. Martin|Mason A. Porter	  The singular value decomposition (SVD) is a popular matrix factorization that has been used widely in applications ever since an efficient algorithm for its computation was developed in the 1970s. In recent years, the SVD has become even more prominent due to a surge in applications and increased computational memory and speed.   To illustrate the vitality of the SVD in data analysis, we highlight three of its lesser-known yet fascinating applications: the SVD can be used to characterize political positions of Congressmen, measure the growth rate of crystals in igneous rock, and examine entanglement in quantum computation. We also discuss higher-dimensional generalizations of the SVD, which have become increasingly crucial with the newfound wealth of multidimensional data and have launched new research initiatives in both theoretical and applied mathematics. With its bountiful theory and applications, the SVD is truly extraordinary.

Hansen|Norm Murray	  We demonstrate that the observed distribution of `Hot Neptune'/`Super-Earth' systems is well reproduced by a model in which planet assembly occurs in situ, with no significant migration post-assembly. This is achieved only if the amount of mass in rocky material is $\sim 50$--$100 M_{\oplus}$ interior to 1 AU. Such a reservoir of material implies that significant radial migration of solid material takes place, and that it occur before the stage of final planet assembly.   The model not only reproduces the general distribution of mass versus period, but also the detailed statistics of multiple planet systems in the sample.   We furthermore demonstrate that cores of this size are also likely to meet the criterion to gravitationally capture gas from the nebula, although accretion is rapidly limited by the opening of gaps in the gas disk. If the mass growth is limited by this tidal truncation, then the scenario sketched here naturally produces Neptune-mass objects with substantial components of both rock and gas, as is observed.   The quantitative expectations of this scenario are that most planets in the `Hot Neptune/Super-Earth' class inhabit multiple-planet systems, with characteristic orbital spacings. The model also provides a natural division into gas-rich (Hot Neptune) and gas-poor (Super-Earth) classes at fixed period. The dividing mass ranges from $\sim 3 M_{\oplus}$ at 10 day orbital periods to $\sim 10 M_{\oplus}$ at 100 day orbital periods. For orbital periods $< 10$ days, the division is less clear because a gas atmosphere may be significantly eroded by stellar radiation.

Young	  Through this research, embedded synthetic fracture networks in rock masses are studied. To analysis the fluid flow complexity in fracture networks with respect to the variation of connectivity patterns, two different approaches are employed, namely, the Lattice Boltzmann method and graph theory. The Lattice Boltzmann method is used to show the sensitivity of the permeability and fluid velocity distribution to synthetic fracture networks' connectivity patterns. Furthermore, the fracture networks are mapped into the graphs, and the characteristics of these graphs are compared to the main spatial fracture networks. Among different characteristics of networks, we distinguish the modularity of networks and sub-graphs distributions. We map the flow regimes into the proper regions of the network's modularity space. Also, for each type of fluid regime, corresponding motifs shapes are scaled. Implemented power law distributions of fracture length in spatial fracture networks yielded the same node's degree distribution in transformed networks. Two general spatial networks are considered: random networks and networks with "hubness" properties mimicking a spatial damage zone (both with power law distribution of fracture length). In the first case, the fractures are embedded in uniformly distributed fracture sets; the second case covers spatial fracture zones. We prove numerically that the abnormal change (transition) in permeability is controlled by the hub growth rate. Also, comparing LBM results with the characteristic mean length of transformed networks' links shows a reverse relationship between the aforementioned parameters. In addition, the abnormalities in advection through nodes are presented.

This opens a new field in exoplanet science: the possibility to get information about the atmosphere and surface of rocky planets, objects of prime interest. In this letter, we apply the Lava-ocean model to interpret the observed phase curve. The model, a planet with no atmosphere and a surface partially made of molten rocks, has been proposed for planets of the class of CoRoT-7b, i.e. rocky planets very close to their star (at few stellar radii). Kepler-10b is a typical member of this family. It predicts that the light from the planet has an important emission component in addition to the reflected one, even in the Kepler spectral band. Assuming an isotropical reflection of light by the planetary surface (Lambertian-like approximation), we find that a Bond albedo of \sim50% can account for the observed amplitude of the phase curve, as opposed to a first attempt where an unusually high value was found. We propose a physical process to explain this still large value of the albedo. The overall interpretation can be tested in the future with instruments as JWST or EChO. Our model predicts a spectral dependence that is clearly distinguishable from that of purely reflected light, and from that of a planet at a uniform temperature.

Theory, illustrations, and implications	F. J. Cornaton|Y. -J. Park|S. D. Normani|E. A. Sudicky|J. F. Sykes	  Long-term solutions for the disposal of toxic wastes usually involve isolation of the wastes in a deep subsurface geologic environment. In the case of spent nuclear fuel, if radionuclide leakage occurs from the engineered barrier, the geological medium represents the ultimate barrier that is relied upon to ensure safety. Consequently, an evaluation of radionuclide travel times from a repository to the biosphere is critically important in a performance assessment analysis. In this study, we develop a travel time framework based on the concept of groundwater lifetime expectancy as a safety indicator. Lifetime expectancy characterizes the time that radionuclides will spend in the subsurface after their release from the repository and prior to discharging into the biosphere. The probability density function of lifetime expectancy is computed throughout the host rock by solving the backward-in-time solute transport adjoint equation subject to a properly posed set of boundary conditions. It can then be used to define optimal repository locations. The risk associated with selected sites can be evaluated by simulating an appropriate contaminant release history. The utility of the method is illustrated by means of analytical and numerical examples, which focus on the effect of fracture networks on the uncertainty of evaluated lifetime expectancy.

It is devoted mainly to the real time spectroscopy of low energy solar neutrinos via the elastic scattering on electrons in the target mass. The data taking campaign started in 2007 and led to key measurements of 7}Be and 8B solar neutrinos as well as antineutrinos from the earth (geo-neutrinos) and from nuclear power reactors. Borexino is also a powerful tool for the study of cosmic muons that penetrate the Gran Sasso rock coverage and thereby induced signals such as neutrons and radioactive isotopes which are today of critical importance for upcoming dark matter and neutrino physics experiments. Having reached 4y of continuous data taking we analyze here the muon signal and its possible modulation. The muon flux is measured to be (3.41+-0.01)E-4/m2/s. A modulation of this signal with a yearly period is observed with an amplitude of (1.29+-0.07)% and a phase of (179+-6) d, corresponding to June 28th. Muon rate fluctuations are compared to fluctuations in the atmospheric temperature on a daily base, exploiting the most complete atmospheric data and models available. The distributions are shown to be positively correlated and the effective temperature coefficient is measured to be alpha_T = 0.93 +- 0.04. This result is in good agreement with the expectations of the kaon-inclusive model at the laboratory site and represents an improvement over previous measurements performed at the same depth.

Kramer|Vashti Sawtelle	  Developing a sense of community among students is one of the three pillars of an overall reform effort to increase participation in physics, and the sciences more broadly, at Florida International University. The emergence of a research and learning community, embedded within a course reform effort, has contributed to increased recruitment and retention of physics majors. Finn and Rock [1] link the academic and social integration of students to increased rates of retention. We utilize social network analysis to quantify interactions in Florida International University's Physics Learning Center (PLC) that support the development of academic and social integration,. The tools of social network analysis allow us to visualize and quantify student interactions, and characterize the roles of students within a social network. After providing a brief introduction to social network analysis, we use sequential multiple regression modeling to evaluate factors which contribute to participation in the learning community. Results of the sequential multiple regression indicate that the PLC learning community is an equitable environment as we find that gender and ethnicity are not significant predictors of participation in the PLC. We find that providing students space for collaboration provides a vital element in the formation of supportive learning community.

Core mass and metallicity predictions however depend on the equations of state used, and on model assumptions. We present an improved ab initio hydrogen equation of state, H-REOS.2 and compute the internal structure and thermal evolution of Jupiter within the standard three-layer approach. The advance over our previous Jupiter models with H-REOS.1 by Nettelmann et al.(2008) is that the new models are also consistent with the observed 2 or more times solar heavy element abundances in Jupiter's atmosphere. Such models have a rock core mass Mcore=0-8 ME, total mass of heavy elements MZ=28-32 ME, a deep internal layer boundary at 4 or more Mbar, and a cooling time of 4.4-5.0 Gyrs when assuming homogeneous evolution. We also calculate two-layer models in the manner of Militzer et al.(2008) and find a comparable large core of 16-21 ME, out of which ~11 ME is helium, but a significantly higher envelope metallicity of 4.5 times solar. According to our preferred three-layer models, neither the characteristic frequency (nu0 ~156 microHz) nor the normalized moment of inertia (~0.276) are sensitive to the core mass but accurate measurements could well help to rule out some classes of models.

Schreiber	  Understanding under what conditions populations, whether they be plants, animals, or viral particles, persist is an issue of theoretical and practical importance in population biology. Both biotic interactions and environmental fluctuations are key factors that can facilitate or disrupt persistence. One approach to examining the interplay between these deterministic and stochastic forces is the construction and analysis of stochastic difference equations $X_{t+1}=F(X_t,\xi_{t+1})$ where $X_t \in \R^k$ represents the state of the populations and $\xi_1,\xi_2,...$ is a sequence of random variables representing environmental stochasticity. In the analysis of these stochastic models, many theoretical population biologists are interested in whether the models are bounded and persistent. Here, boundedness asserts that asymptotically $X_t$ tends to remain in compact sets. In contrast, persistence requires that $X_t$ tends to be "repelled" by some "extinction set" $S_0\subset \R^k$. Here, results on both of these proprieties are reviewed for single species, multiple species, and structured population models. The results are illustrated with applications to stochastic versions of the Hassell and Ricker single species models, Ricker, Beverton-Holt, lottery models of competition, and lottery models of rock-paper-scissor games. A variety of conjectures and suggestions for future research are presented.

This generalized law, however, can be applied also to solid-like viscoelastic materials. We revisit the Jeffreys-Lomnitz law of creep by allowing its power law exponent $\alpha$, usually limited to the range [0,1] to all negative values. This is consistent with the linear theory of viscoelasticity because the creep function still remains a Bernstein function, that is positive with a completely monotonic derivative, with a related spectrum of retardation times. The complete range $\alpha \le 1$ yields a continuous transition from a Hooke elastic solid with no creep ($\alpha \to -\infty$) to a Maxwell fluid with linear creep ($\alpha=1$) passing through the Lomnitz viscoelastic body with logarithmic creep ($\alpha=0$), which separates solid-like from fluid-like behaviors. Furthermore, we numerically compute the relaxation modulus and provide the analytical expression of the spectrum of retardation times corresponding to the Jeffreys-Lomnitz creep law extended to all $\alpha \le 1$.

Berrier|Douglas W. Shields|Julia Kennefick|Daniel Kennefick|Marc S. Seigar|Claud H. S. Lacy|Ivânio Puerari	  A logarithmic spiral is a prominent feature appearing in a majority of observed galaxies. This feature has long been associated with the traditional Hubble classification scheme, but historical quotes of pitch angle of spiral galaxies have been almost exclusively qualitative. We have developed a methodology, utilizing two-dimensional fast Fourier transformations of images of spiral galaxies, in order to isolate and measure the pitch angles of their spiral arms. Our technique provides a quantitative way to measure this morphological feature. This will allow comparison of spiral galaxy pitch angle to other galactic parameters and test spiral arm genesis theories. In this work, we detail our image processing and analysis of spiral galaxy images and discuss the robustness of our analysis techniques.

We have found that the atmospheric evolution has two distinctly different outcomes, depending on the rocky body's mass: While the atmospheres on massive rocky bodies undergo runaway disk-gas accretion, those on light rocky bodies undergo significant erosion during disk dispersal. In the atmospheric erosion, the heat content of the rocky body that was previously neglected plays an important role. We have also realized that the atmospheric mass is rather sensitive to disk temperature in the mass range of interest in this study. Our theory is applied to recently-detected super-Earths orbiting Kepler-11 to examine the possibility that the planets are rock-dominated ones with relatively thick H-He atmospheres. The application suggests that the in-situ formation of the relatively thick H-He atmospheres inferred by structure modeling is possible only under restricted conditions; namely, relatively slow disk dissipation and/or cool environments. This study demonstrates that low-density super-Earths provide important clues to understanding of planetary accretion and disk evolution.

Kissane	  The work described is concerned with the way micron-size particles attached to a surface are resuspended when exposed to a turbulent flow. An improved version of the Rock'n'Roll model (Reeks and Hall, 2001) is developed where this model employs a stochastic approach to resuspension involving the rocking and rolling of a particle about surface asperities arising from the moments of the fluctuating drag forces acting on the particle close to the surface. In this work, the model is improved by using values of both the streamwise fluid velocity andacceleration close to the wall obtained from Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of turbulentchannel flow. Using analysis and numerical calculations of the drag force on a sphere near a wall in shear flow (O'Neill (1968) and Lee and Balachandar (2010)) these values are used to obtain the joint distribution of the moments of the fluctuating drag force and its time derivative acting on a particle attached to a surface. In so doing the influence of highly non-Gaussian forces (associated with the sweeping and ejection events in a turbulent boundary layer) on short and long term resuspension rates is examined for a sparse monolayer coverage of particles, along with the dependence of the resuspension upon the timescale of the particle motion attached to the surface, the ratio of the rms/ mean of the removal force and the distribution of adhesive forces. Model predictions of the fraction resuspended are compared with experimental results.

In a recent publication [M. Betzinger, C. Friedrich, S. Bl\"ugel, A. G\"orling, Phys. Rev. B 83, 045105 (2011)] we showed that uneconomically large basis sets were required to obtain a smooth local potential without spurious oscillations within the full-potential linearized augmented-plane-wave method (FLAPW). This could be attributed to the slow convergence behavior of the density response function. In this paper, we derive an incomplete-basis-set correction for the response, which consists of two terms: (1) a correction that is formally similar to the Pulay correction in atomic-force calculations and (2) a numerically more important basis response term originating from the potential dependence of the basis functions. The basis response term is constructed from the solutions of radial Sternheimer equations in the muffin-tin spheres. With these corrections the local potential converges at much smaller basis sets, at much fewer states, and its construction becomes numerically very stable. We analyze the improvements for rock-salt ScN and report results for BN, AlN, and GaN, as well as the perovskites CaTiO3, SrTiO3, and BaTiO3. The incomplete-basis-set correction can be applied to other electronic-structure methods with potential-dependent basis sets and opens the perspective to investigate a broad spectrum of problems in theoretical solid-state physics that involve response functions.

Kovaltsov	  The probability of occurrence of extreme solar particle events (SPEs) with the fluence of (>30 MeV) protons F30>10^{10} cm^{-2} is evaluated based on data of cosmogenic isotopes 14C and 10Be in terrestrial archives centennial-millennial time scales. Four potential candidates with F30=(1-1.5)x10^{10} cm^{-2} and no events with F30>2x10^{10} cm^{-2} are identified since 1400 AD in the annually resolved 10Be data. A strong SPE related to the Carrington flare of 1859 AD is not supported by the data. For the last 11400 years, 19 SPE candidates with F30=(1-3)x10^{10} cm^{-2} are found and clearly no event with F30>5x10^{10} cm^{-2} (50-fold the SPE of 23-Feb-1956) occurring. This values serve as an observational upper limit for the strength of SPE on the time scale of tens of millennia. Two events, ca. 780 and 1460 AD, appear in different data series making them strong candidates to extreme SPEs. We built a distribution of the occurrence probability of extreme SPEs, providing a new strict observational constraint. Practical limits can be set as F30~1x, 2-3x, and 5x10^{10} cm^{-2} for the occurrence probability ~10^{-2}, 10^{-3} and 10^{-4} year^{-1}, respectively. Because of uncertainties, our results should be interpreted as a conservative upper limit of the SPE occurrence near Earth. The mean SEP flux is evaluated as ~40 (cm2 sec)^{-1} in agreement with estimates from the lunar rocks. On average, extreme SPEs contribute about 10% to the total SEP fluence. 	
1212.0113v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1212.0113v2	2013	On the probability of habitable planets	Francois Forget	  In the past 15 years, astronomers have revealed that a significant fraction of the stars should harbor planets and that it is likely that terrestrial planets are abundant in our galaxy. Among these planets, how many are habitable, i.e. suitable for life and its evolution? These questions have been discussed for years and we are slowly making progress. Liquid water remains the key criterion for habitability. It can exist in the interior of a variety of planetary bodies, but it is usually assumed that liquid water at the surface interacting with rocks and light is necessary for the emergence of a life able to modify its environment and evolve. A first key issue is thus to understand the climatic conditions allowing surface liquid water assuming a suitable atmosphere. This have been studied with global mean 1D models which has defined the "classical habitable zone", the range of orbital distances within which worlds can maintain liquid water on their surfaces (Kasting et al. 1993). A new generation of 3D climate models based on universal equations and tested on bodies in the solar system is now available to explore with accuracy climate regimes that could locally allow liquid water. A second key issue is now to better understand the processes which control the composition and the evolution of the atmospheres of exoplanets, and in particular the geophysical feedbacks that seems to be necessary to maintain a continuously habitable climate. From that point of view, it is not impossible that the Earth's case may be special and uncommon.

Several studies reported a high abundance of 60Fe (t1/2=2.62+/-0.04 Myr) in chondrites (60Fe/56Fe~6*10-7), suggesting that planetary materials incorporated fresh products of stellar nucleosynthesis ejected by one or several massive stars that exploded in the vicinity of the newborn Sun. We measured 58Fe/54Fe and 60Ni/58Ni isotope ratios in whole rocks and constituents of differentiated achondrites (ureilites, aubrites, HEDs, and angrites), unequilibrated ordinary chondrites Semarkona (LL3.0) and NWA 5717 (ungrouped petrologic type 3.05), metal-rich carbonaceous chondrite Gujba (CBa), and several other meteorites (CV, EL H, LL chondrites; IIIAB, IVA, IVB iron meteorites). We derive from these measurements a much lower initial 60Fe/56Fe ratio of (11.5+/-2.6)*10-9 and conclude that 60Fe was homogeneously distributed among planetary bodies. This low ratio is consistent with derivation of 60Fe from galactic background (60Fe/56Fe=2.8*10-7 in the interstellar medium from gamma-ray observations) and can be reconciled with high 26Al/27Al=5*10-5 in chondrites if solar material was contaminated through winds by outer layers of one or several massive stars (e.g., a Wolf-Rayet star) rich in 26Al and poor in 60Fe. We present the first chronological application of the 60Fe-60Ni decay system to establish the time of core formation on Vesta at 3.7 (+2.5/-1.7) Myr after condensation of calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs).

Hals|Inga Berre	  An enhanced geothermal system (EGS) expands the potential of geothermal energy by enabling the exploitation of regions that lack conventional hydrothermal resources. The EGS subsurface system is created by engineering enhanced flow paths between injection and production wells. Hydraulic stimulation of existing fracture networks has been successfully achieved for unconventional geothermal resources. More recently proposed concepts increase the use of drilled wellbores in hard rock to connect the injection and production wells. The present work investigates the long-term thermal effects of deviated geothermal wellbores and studies how the cooling of the borehole wall results in thermally induced tensile fractures. The results show that induced fractures are created by a combination of in situ and thermal stresses, and that the extent to which thermally induced tensile wall fractures are created largely depends on how the wellbores are oriented with respect to the pre-existing stresses of the reservoir. If the system is not optimized with respect to in situ stresses, the risk of wellbore instability becomes severe within less than a year of production. In contrast, if the orientation of the wellbores is optimized, thermally induced instabilities can be completely excluded as potential risks for the operational lifetime of the system. Furthermore, our results show that the thermal failure process strongly depends on the temperature of the injected water but is only weakly affected by the injection rate. 	
1302.2147v3	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.2147v3	2013	Catastrophic Evaporation of Rocky Planets	Daniel Perez-Becker|Eugene Chiang	  Short-period exoplanets can have dayside surface temperatures surpassing 2000 K, hot enough to vaporize rock and drive a thermal wind. Small enough planets evaporate completely. We construct a radiative-hydrodynamic model of atmospheric escape from strongly irradiated, low-mass rocky planets, accounting for dust-gas energy exchange in the wind. Rocky planets with masses < 0.1 M_Earth (less than twice the mass of Mercury) and surface temperatures > 2000 K are found to disintegrate entirely in < 10 Gyr. When our model is applied to Kepler planet candidate KIC 12557548b --- which is believed to be a rocky body evaporating at a rate of dM/dt > 0.1 M_Earth/Gyr --- our model yields a present-day planet mass of < 0.02 M_Earth or less than about twice the mass of the Moon. Mass loss rates depend so strongly on planet mass that bodies can reside on close-in orbits for Gyrs with initial masses comparable to or less than that of Mercury, before entering a final short-lived phase of catastrophic mass loss (which KIC 12557548b has entered). Because this catastrophic stage lasts only up to a few percent of the planet's life, we estimate that for every object like KIC 12557548b, there should be 10--100 close-in quiescent progenitors with sub-day periods whose hard-surface transits may be detectable by Kepler --- if the progenitors are as large as their maximal, Mercury-like sizes (alternatively, the progenitors could be smaller and more numerous). According to our calculations, KIC 12557548b may have lost ~70% of its formation mass; today we may be observing its naked iron core.

This encouraged a greater investment in new types of game controllers such as the WiiMote, Rock Band instruments and the Kinect. However, the native software of these controllers was not originally designed to be used in other game applications. This work addresses this issue by building a middleware framework, which maps body poses or voice commands to actions in any game. This not only warrants a more natural and customized user-experience but it also defines an interoperable virtual controller. In this version of the framework, body poses and voice commands are respectively recognized through the Kinect's built-in cameras and microphones. The acquired data is then translated into the native interaction scheme in real time using a lightweight method based on spatial restrictions. The system is also prepared to use Nintendo's Wiimote as an auxiliary and unobtrusive gamepad for physically or verbally impractical commands. System validation was performed by analyzing the performance of certain tasks and examining user reports. Both confirmed this approach as a practical and alluring alternative to the game's native interaction scheme. In sum, this framework provides a game-controlling tool that is totally customizable and very flexible, thus expanding the market of game consumers.

Here we report the initial results from a silicate melt-vapor equilibrium chemistry model for such impact-generated planetary debris disks. In order to simulate the chemical behavior of a two-phase (melt+vapor) disk, we calculate the temperature-dependent pressure and chemical composition of vapor in equilibrium with molten silicate from 2000 to 4000 K. We consider the elements O, Na, K, Fe, Si, Mg, Ca, Al, Ti, and Zn for a range of bulk silicate compositions (Earth, Moon, Mars, eucrite parent body, angrites, and ureilites). In general, the disk atmosphere is dominated by Na, Zn, and O2 at lower temperatures (< 3000 K) and SiO, O2, and O at higher temperatures. The high-temperature chemistry is consistent for any silicate melt composition, and we thus expect abundant SiO, O2, and O to be a common feature of hot, impact-generated debris disks. In addition, the saturated silicate vapor is highly oxidizing, with oxygen fugacity (fO2) values (and hence H2O/H2 and CO2/CO ratios) several orders of magnitude higher than those in a solar-composition gas. High fO2 values in the disk atmosphere are found for any silicate composition because oxygen is the most abundant element in rock. We thus expect high oxygen fugacity to be a ubiquitous feature of any silicate melt-vapor disk produced via collisions between rocky planets.

Wilson|Burkhard Militzer	  The formation of the giant planets in our solar system, and likely a majority of giant exoplanets, is commonly explained by the accretion of nebular hydrogen and helium onto a large core of terrestrial-like composition. The fate of this core has important consequences for the evolution of the interior structure of the planet. It has recently been shown that H2O, MgO and SiO2 dissolve in liquid metallic hydrogen at high temperature and pressure. In this study, we perform ab initio calculations to study the solubility of an innermost metallic core. We find dissolution of iron to be strongly favored above 2000 K over the entire pressure range (0.4-4 TPa) considered. We compare with and summarize the results for solubilities on other probable core constituents. The calculations imply that giant planet cores are in thermodynamic disequilibrium with surrounding layers, promoting erosion and redistribution of heavy elements. Differences in solubility behavior between iron and rock may influence evolution of interiors, particularly for Saturn-mass planets. Understanding the distribution of iron and other heavy elements in gas giants may be relevant in understanding mass-radius relationships, as well as deviations in transport properties from pure hydrogen-helium mixtures.

Desch	  Phyllosilicates are hydrous minerals formed by interaction between rock and liquid water and are commonly found in meteorites originating in the asteroid belt. Collisions between asteroids contribute to zodiacal dust, which therefore reasonably could include phyllosilicates. Collisions between planetesimals in protoplanetary disks may also produce dust containing phyllosilicates. These minerals possess characteristic emission features in the mid-infrared and could be detectable in extrasolar protoplanetary disks. Here we determine whether phyllosilicates in protoplanetary disks are detectable in the infrared using instruments such as those on board the Spitzer Space Telescope and SOFIA (Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy). We calculate opacities for the phyllosilicates most common in meteorites and compute the emission of radiation from a protoplanetary disk using a 2-layer radiative transfer model. We find that phyllosilicates present at the 3% level lead to observationally significant differences in disk spectra, and should therefore be detectable using infrared observations and spectral modeling. Detection of phyllosilicates in a protoplanetary disk would be diagnostic of liquid water in planetesimals in that disk and would demonstrate similarity to our own Solar System. We also discuss use of phyllosilicate emission to test the "waterworlds" hypothesis, which proposes that liquid water in planetesimals should correlate with the inventory of short-lived radionuclides in planetary systems, especially 26Al. 	
1304.5000v3	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.5000v3	2013	Magnetostructural transition, metamagnetism, and magnetic phase   coexistence in Co10Ge3O16	Phillip T. Barton|Ram Seshadri|Anna Llobet|Matthew R. Suchomel	  Co10Ge3O16 crystallizes in an intergrowth structure featuring alternating layers of spinel and rock salt. Variable-temperature powder synchrotron X-ray and neutron diffraction, magnetometry, and heat capacity experiments reveal a magnetostructural transition at T_N = 203 K. This rhombohedral-to-monoclinic transition involves a slight elongation of the CoO6 octahedra along the apical axis. Below T_N, the application of a large magnetic field causes a reorientation of the Co^2+ Ising spins. This metamagnetic transition is first-order as evidenced by a latent heat observed in temperature-dependent measurements. This transition is initially seen at T = 180 K as a broad upturn in the M-H near H_C = 3.9 T. The upturn sharpens into a kink at T = 120 K and a "butterfly" shape emerges, with the transition causing hysteresis at high fields while linear and reversible behavior persists at low fields. H_C decreases as temperature is lowered and the loops at positive and negative fields merge beneath T = 20 K. The antiferromagnetism is described by k_M = (00 1/2) and below T = 20 K a small uncompensated component with k_M = (000) spontaneously emerges. Despite the Curie-Weiss analysis and ionic radius indicating the Co2+ is in its high-spin state, the low-temperature M-H trends toward saturation at M_S = 1.0 uB/Co. We conclude that the field-induced state is a ferrimagnet, rather than a S = 1/2 ferromagnet. The unusual H-T phase diagram is discussed with reference to other metamagnets and Co(II) systems. 	
1304.6472v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.6472v2	2013	Water-Trapped Worlds	Kristen Menou	  Although tidally-locked habitable planets orbiting nearby M-dwarf stars are among the best astronomical targets to search for extrasolar life, they may also be deficient in volatiles and water. Climate models for this class of planets show atmospheric transport of water from the dayside to the nightside, where it is precipitated as snow and trapped as ice. Since ice only slowly flows back to the dayside upon accumulation, the resulting hydrological cycle can trap a large amount of water in the form of nightside ice. Using ice sheet dynamical and thermodynamical constraints, I illustrate how planets with less than about a quarter the Earth's oceans could trap most of their surface water on the nightside. This would leave their dayside, where habitable conditions are met, potentially dry. The amount and distribution of residual liquid water on the dayside depend on a variety of geophysical factors, including the efficiency of rock weathering at regulating atmospheric CO2 as dayside ocean basins dry-up. Water-trapped worlds with dry daysides may offer similar advantages as land planets for habitability, by contrast with worlds where more abundant water freely flows around the globe.

We show that the large contrast in mean planetary density observed by Carter et al. (2012) can be explained as a natural consequence of photo-evaporation from planets that formed with similar initial compositions. However, rather than being due to differences in XUV irradiation between the planets, we find that this contrast is due to the difference in the masses of the planets' rock/iron cores and the impact that this has on mass loss evolution. We explore in detail how our coupled models depend on irradiation, mass, age, composition, and the efficiency of mass loss. Based on fits to large numbers of coupled evolution and mass loss runs, we provide analytic fits to understand threshold XUV fluxes for significant atmospheric loss, as a function of core mass and mass loss efficiency. Finally we discuss these results in the context of recent studies of the radius distribution of Kepler candidates. Using our parameter study, we make testable predictions for the frequency of sub-Neptune sized planets. We show that 1.8-4.0 R_earth planets should become significantly less common on orbits within 10 days and discuss the possibility of a narrow "occurrence valley" in the radius-flux distribution. Moreover, we describe how photo-evaporation provides a natural explanation for the recent observations of Ciardi et al. (2013) that inner planets are preferentially smaller within the systems.

Mermod	  The magnetic monopole was postulated in 1931 by Dirac to explain electric charge quantisation. Searches for pair-produced monopoles are performed at accelerator facilities whenever a new energy regime is made available. In addition, monopoles with masses too high to be accessible at colliders would still have been produced in the early Universe and such relics can be searched for either in flight or trapped in matter. Here we discuss recent results and future prospects for direct monopole detection at the LHC and in bulk matter searches, with emphasis on the complementarity between the various techniques. Significant improvements of the results from the ATLAS experiment are expected with the development of new triggers. Dedicated LHC experiments will allow to probe wider ranges of monopole charges and masses: the MoEDAL experiment using both nuclear-track detectors and absorbing arrays, and searches for trapped monopoles in accelerator material. Finally, it is highlighted how the first search for monopoles trapped in polar volcanic rocks allows to set new constraints on the abundance of monopoles bound to matter in the Earth's interior and by extension in the primary material that formed the Solar System.

We consider a sharp triangular asperity, invariant in one direction, perturbing an otherwise flat fracture. We investigate its influence on the macroscopic hydraulic transmissivity and heat transfer efficiency, at fixed low Reynolds number. In this study, numerical simulations are done with a coupled lattice Boltzmann method that solves both the complete Navier-Stokes and advection-diffusion equations in three dimensions. The results are compared with those obtained under lubrication approximations which rely on many hypotheses and neglect the three-dimensional (3D) effects. The lubrication results are obtained by analytically solving the Stokes equation and a two-dimensional (integrated over the thickness) advection-diffusion equation. We use a lattice Boltzmann method with a double distribution (for mass and energy transport) on hypercubic and cubic lattices. Beyond some critical slope for the boundaries, the velocity profile is observed to be far from a quadratic profile in the vicinity of the sharp asperity: the fluid within the triangular asperity is quasi-static. We find that taking account of both the 3D effects and the cooling of the rock, are important for the thermal exchange. Neglecting these effects with lubrication approximations results in overestimating the heat exchange efficiency. The evolution of the temperature over time, towards steady state, also shows complex behavior: some sites alternately reheat and cool down several times, making it difficult to forecast the extracted heat.

Sasaki	  Many extrasolar (bound) terrestrial planets and free-floating (unbound) planets have been discovered. The existence of bound and unbound terrestrial planets with liquid water is an important question, and of particular importance is the question of their habitability. Even for a globally ice-covered planet, geothermal heat from the planetary interior may melt the interior ice, creating an internal ocean covered by an ice shell. In this paper, we discuss the conditions that terrestrial planets must satisfy for such an internal ocean to exist on the timescale of planetary evolution. The question is addressed in terms of planetary mass, distance from a central star, water abundance, and abundance of radiogenic heat sources. In addition, we investigate the structures of the surface-H2O layers of ice-covered planets by considering the effects of ice under high pressure (high-pressure ice). As a fiducial case, 1M$\oplus$ planet at 1 AU from its central star and with 0.6 to 25 times the H2O mass of Earth could have an internal ocean. We find that high-pressure ice layers may appear between the internal ocean and the rock portion on a planet with an H2O mass over 25 times that of Earth. The planetary mass and abundance of surface water strongly restrict the conditions under which an extrasolar terrestrial planet may have an internal ocean with no high-pressure ice under the ocean. Such high-pressure-ice layers underlying the internal ocean are likely to affect the habitability of the planet.

The present research aims at investigating seismic motion amplification in the 2011 Tohoku earthquake through a one-directional three-component (1D-3C) wave propagation model. A 3D nonlinear constitutive relation for dry soils under cyclic loading is implemented in a quadratic line finite element model. The soil rheology is modeled by mean of a multi-surface cyclic plasticity model of the Masing-Prandtl-Ishlinskii-Iwan (MPII) type. Its major advantage is that the rheology is characterized by few commonly measured parameters. Ground motions are computed at the surface of soil profiles in the Tohoku area (Japan) by propagating 3C signals recorded at rock outcrops, during the 2011 Tohoku earthquake. Computed surface ground motions are compared to the Tohoku earthquake records at alluvial sites and the reliability of the 1D-3C model is corroborated. The 1D-3C approach is compared with the combination of three separate one-directional analyses of one motion component propagated independently (1D-1C approach). The 3D loading path due to the 3C-polarization leads to multiaxial stress interaction that reduces soil strength and increases nonlinear effects. Time histories and spectral amplitudes, for the Tohoku earthquake, are numerically reproduced. The 1D-3C approach allows the evaluation of various parameters of the 3C motion and 3D stress and strain evolution all over the soil profile.

The apparatus comprises of six horizontal layers of plastic-scintillator hodoscopes for determining the direction and position of the incident cosmic-ray muons. Sandwiched between the hodoscope planes is a neutron detector filled with 650 kg of liquid scintillator doped with about 0.06% of Gadolinium by weight for improving the efficiency of detecting the spallation neutrons. Performance of the apparatus is also presented.

Winn|Howard Isaacson|Debra A. Fischer|Benjamin J. Fulton|Evan Sinukoff|Jonathan J. Fortney	  Planets with sizes between that of Earth (with radius R$_\oplus$) and Neptune (about 4 R$_\oplus$) are now known to be common around Sun-like stars. Most such planets have been discovered through the transit technique, by which the planet's size can be determined from the fraction of starlight blocked by the planet as it passes in front of its star. Measuring the planet's mass-and hence its density, which is a clue to its composition-is more difficult. Planets of size 2-4 R$_\oplus$ have proven to have a wide range of densities, implying a diversity of compositions, but these measurements did not extend down to planets as small as Earth. Here we report Doppler spectroscopic measurements of the mass of the Earth-sized planet Kepler-78b, which orbits its host star every 8.5 hours. Given a radius of 1.20 $\pm$ 0.09 R$_\oplus$ and mass of 1.69 $\pm$ 0.41 M$_\oplus$, the planet's mean density of 5.3 $\pm$ 1.8 g cm$^{-3}$ is similar to the Earth's, suggesting a composition of rock and iron. 	
1311.0024v3	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.0024v3	2013	The Role of Carbon in Extrasolar Planetary Geodynamics and Habitability	Cayman T. Unterborn|Jason E. Kabbes|Jeffrey S. Pigott|Daniel R. Reaman|Wendy R. Panero	  The proportions of oxygen, carbon and major rock-forming elements (e.g. Mg, Fe, Si) determine a planet's dominant mineralogy. Variation in a planet's mineralogy subsequently affects planetary mantle dynamics as well as any deep water or carbon cycle. Through thermodynamic models and high pressure diamond anvil cell experiments, we demonstrate the oxidation potential of C is above that of Fe at all pressures and temperatures indicative of 0.1 - 2 Earth-mass planets. This means that for a planet with (Mg+2Si+Fe+2C)/O > 1, excess C in the mantle will be in the form of diamond. We model the general dynamic state of planets as a function of interior temperature, carbon composition, and size, showing that above a critical threshold of $\sim$3 atom% C, limited to no mantle convection will be present assuming an Earth-like geotherm. We assert then that in the C-(Mg+2Si+Fe)-O system, only a very small compositional range produce habitable planets. Planets outside of this habitable range will be dynamically sluggish or stagnant, thus having limited carbon or water cycles leading to surface conditions inhospitable to life as we know it.

Duarte Puertas|J. P. Guzman Fernandez|C. Lenfestey|G. -X. Li|F. A. Olguin|B. R. Röck|H. de Villiers|J. Williams	  Formation of stars is now believed to be tightly linked to the dynamical evolution of interstellar filaments in which they form. In this paper we analyze the density structure and kinematics of a small network of infrared dark filaments, SDC13, observed in both dust continuum and molecular line emission with the IRAM 30m telescope. These observations reveal the presence of 18 compact sources amongst which the two most massive, MM1 and MM2, are located at the intersection point of the parsec-long filaments. The dense gas velocity and velocity dispersion observed along these filaments show smooth, strongly correlated, gradients. We discuss the origin of the SDC13 velocity field in the context of filament longitudinal collapse. We show that the collapse timescale of the SDC13 filaments (from 1 Myr to 4 Myr depending on the model parameters) is consistent with the presence of Class I sources in them, and argue that, on top of bringing more material to the centre of the system, collapse could generate additional kinematic support against local fragmentation, helping the formation of starless super-Jeans cores.

Maindl|Rudolf Dvorak|Roland Speith|Christoph Schäfer	  Context. We investigate the effects of including material strength in multi-material planetesimal collisions. Aims. The differences between strengthless material models and including the full elasto-plastic model for solid bodies with brittle failure and fragmentation when treating collisions of asteroid-sized bodies as they occur frequently in early planetary systems are demonstrated. Methods. We study impacts of bodies of Ceres-mass with a solid rock impactor and a target with 30 weight-% water content as surface ice.} The initial impact velocities and impact parameters are varied between the escape velocity $v_\mathrm{esc}$ to about 6 $v_\mathrm{esc}$ and from head-on collisions to close fly-bys, respectively. We simulate the collisions using our own SPH code utilizing both strengthless material and the full elasto-plastic material model including brittle failure. Results. One of the most prominent differences is the higher degree of fragmentation and shattered debris clouds in the solid model. In most collision scenarios however, the final outcomes are very similar and differ primarily by the about one order of magnitude higher degree of fragmentation in the solid case. Also, the survivors tend to be of less mass in the solid case which also predicts a higher water loss than the strengthless hydro model. This may be an effect of the relatively low-energy impacts that cannot destroy the solid material instantly. As opposed to giant impacts we also observe an indication that some water ice gets transferred between the bodies.

Burrows|Wesley Verne	  Many exoplanets have been discovered with radii of 1-4 Earth radii, between that of Earth and Neptune. A number of these are known to have densities consistent with solid compositions, while others are "sub-Neptunes" likely to have significant hydrogen-helium envelopes. Future surveys will no doubt significantly expand these populations. In order to understand how the measured masses and radii of such planets can inform their structures and compositions, we construct models both for solid layered planets and for planets with solid cores and gaseous envelopes, exploring a range of core masses, hydrogen-helium envelope masses, and associated envelope entropies. For planets in the super-Earth/sub-Neptune regime for which both radius and mass are measured, we estimate how each is partitioned into a solid core and gaseous envelope, associating a specific core mass and envelope mass with a given exoplanet. We perform this decomposition for both "Earth-like" rock-iron cores and pure ice cores, and find that the necessary gaseous envelope masses for this important sub-class of exoplanets must range very widely from zero to many Earth masses, even for a given core mass. This result bears importantly on exoplanet formation and envelope evaporation processes.

Mueller|A. W. Harris|H. A. Smith|G. G. Fazio	  We report on Spitzer Space Telescope IRAC observations of near-Earth object (NEO) 2009 BD that were carried out in support of the NASA Asteroid Robotic Retrieval Mission (ARRM) concept. We did not detect 2009 BD in 25 hrs of integration at 4.5 micron. Based on an upper-limit flux density determination from our data, we present a probabilistic derivation of the physical properties of this object. The analysis is based on the combination of a thermophysical model with an orbital model accounting for the non-gravitational forces acting upon the body. We find two physically possible solutions. The first solution shows 2009 BD as a 2.9+/-0.3 m diameter rocky body (rho = 2.9+/-0.5 g cm-3) with an extremely high albedo of 0.85(+0.20/-0.10) that is covered with regolith-like material, causing it to exhibit a low thermal inertia (Gamma = 30(+20/-10) SI units). The second solution suggests 2009 BD to be a 4+/-1 m diameter asteroid with pV = 0.45(+0.35/-0.15) that consists of a collection of individual bare rock slabs (Gamma = 2000+/-1000 SI units, rho = 1.7(+0.7/-0.4) g cm-3). We are unable to rule out either solution based on physical reasoning. 2009 BD is the smallest asteroid for which physical properties have been constrained, in this case using an indirect method and based on a detection limit, providing unique information on the physical properties of objects in the size range smaller than 10 m.

Guin|Ashima Arora|Devendra S. Negi|Ranjan Datta|Kanishka Biswas|Goutam Sheet	  It is thought that the proposed new family of multi-functional materials namely the ferroelectric thermoelectrics may exhibit enhanced functionalities due to the coupling of the thermoelectric parameters with ferroelectric polarization in solids. Therefore, the ferroelectric thermoelectrics are expected to be of immense technological and fundamental significance. As a first step towards this direction, it is most important to identify the existing high performance thermoelectric materials exhibiting ferroelectricity. Herein, through the direct measurement of local polarization switching we show that the recently discovered thermoelectric semiconductor $AgSbSe_{2}$ has local ferroelectric ordering. Using piezo-response force microscopy, we demonstrate the existence of nanometer scale ferroelectric domains that can be switched by external electric field. These observations are intriguing as $AgSbSe_{2}$ crystalizes in cubic rock salt structure with centro-symmetric space group (Fm-3m) and therefore no ferroelectricity is expected. However, from high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) measurement we found the evidence of local superstructure formation which, we believe, leads to local distortion of the centro-symmetric arrangement in $AgSbSe_{2}$ and gives rise to the observed ferroelectricity. Stereochemically active $5s^{2}$ lone pair of Sb can also give rise to local structural distortion, which creates ferroelectricity in $AgSbSe_{2}$. 	
1405.5057v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.5057v1	2014	Instrumentational complexity of music genres and why simplicity sells	Gamaliel Percino|Peter Klimek|Stefan Thurner	  Listening habits are strongly influenced by two opposing aspects, the desire for variety and the demand for uniformity in music. In this work we quantify these two notions in terms of musical instrumentation and production technologies that are typically involved in crafting popular music. We assign a "complexity value" to each music style. A style is complex if it shows the property of having both high variety and low uniformity in instrumentation. We find a strong inverse relation between variety and uniformity of music styles that is remarkably stable over the last half century. Individual styles, however, show dramatic changes in their "complexity" during that period. Styles like "new wave" or "disco" quickly climbed towards higher complexity in the 70s and fell back to low complexity levels shortly afterwards, whereas styles like "folk rock" remained at constant high complexity levels. We show that changes in the complexity of a style are related to its number of sales and to the number of artists contributing to that style. As a style attracts a growing number of artists, its instrumentational variety usually increases. At the same time the instrumentational uniformity of a style decreases, i.e. a unique stylistic and increasingly complex expression pattern emerges. In contrast, album sales of a given style typically increase with decreasing complexity. This can be interpreted as music becoming increasingly formulaic once commercial or mainstream success sets in.

Alaria|M. O'Sullivan|N. L. O. Flack|T. D. Manning|L. J. Phillips|K. Durose|O. Lozano|S. Lucas|J. B. Claridge|M. J. Rosseinsky	  Heteroepitaxial growth of BaSnO$_3$ (BSO) and Ba$_{1-x}$La$_x$SnO$_3$ (x = 7 %) (LBSO) thin films on different perovskite single crystal (SrTiO$_3$ (001) and SmScO$_3$ (110)) substrates has been achieved by Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) under optimized deposition conditions. X-ray diffraction measurements indicate that the films on either of these substrates are relaxed due to the large mismatch and present a high degree of crystallinity with narrow rocking curves and smooth surface morphology while analytical quantification by proton induced x-ray emission (PIXE) confirms the stoichiometric La transfer from a polyphasic target, producing films with La contents above the bulk solubility limit. The films show degenerate semiconducting behavior on both substrates, with the observed room temperature resistivities, Hall mobilities and carrier concentrations of 4.4 $m \Omega cm$, 10.11 $cm^2 V^{-1} s^{-1}$, and 1.38 $\cdot 10^{20} cm^{-3}$ on SmScO$_3$ and 7.8 $m \Omega cm$, 5.8 $cm^2 V^{-1} s^{-1}$, and 1.36 $\cdot 10^{20} cm^{-3}$ on SrTiO$_3$ ruling out any extrinsic contribution from the substrate. The superior electrical properties observed on the SmScO3 substrate are attributed to reduction in dislocation density from the lower lattice mismatch.

K. Siwach|Pawan Kumar Tyagi|K. K. Maurya|H. K. Singh	  Thin films of La5/8-yPryCa3/8MnO3 (y~0.4) have been grown on single crystal SrTiO3 (001) by RF sputtering. The structural and surface characterizations confirm the epitaxial nature of these film. However, the difference between the rocking curve of the (002) and (110) peaks and the presence of pits/holes in the step-terrace type surface morphology suggests high density of defect in these films. Pronounced hysteresis between the field cool cooled (FCC) and field cooled warming (FCW) magnetization measurements suggest towards the non-ergodic magnetic state. The origin of this nonergodicity could be traced to the magnetic liquid like state arising from the delicacy of the coexisting magnetic phases, viz., ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic-charge ordered (FM/AFM-CO). The large difference between the insulator metal transitions during cooling and warming cycles (TIMC~64 K and TIMW~123 K) could be regarded as a manifestation of the nonergodicity leading to supercooling of the magnetic liquid while cooling. The nonergodicity and supercooling are weakened by the AFM-FM phase transition induced by an external magnetic field. TIM and small polaron activation energy corresponding the magnetic liquid state (cooling cycle) vary nonlinearly with the applied magnetic field but become linear in the crystalline solid state (warming cycle). The analysis of the low temperature resistivity data shows that electron-phonon interaction is drastically reduced by the applied magnetic field. The resistivity minimum in the lower temperature region of the self-field warming curve has been explained in terms of the Kondo like scattering in the magnetically inhomogeneous regime.

Herein I report on new throat finding algorithms that contribute to finding the exact flow-relevant geometrical properties of the void space, including high porosity samples of X2B images, three-dimensional synchrotron X-ray computed microtomographic images, and amounting to over 20% porosity. These new algorithms use the modified medial axis that comes from the 3DMA-Rock software package. To find accurate throats, we classify three major throat types: mostly planar and simply connected type, non-planar and simply connected type, and non-planar and non-simply connected type. For each type, we make at least one algorithm to find the throats. Here I introduce an example that has a non-planar and simply connected throat, and my solution indicated by one of my algorithms. My five algorithms each calculate the throat for each path. It selects one of them, which has the smallest inner area. New algorithms find accurate throats at least 98% among 12 high porosity samples (over 20%). Also, I introduce a new length calculation in the digitized image. The new calculation uses three mathematical concepts: i) differentiability, ii) implicit function theorem, iii) line integral. The result can convert the discrete boundary of the XMCT image to the real boundary. When the real boundary has an arc shape, the new calculation has less than 1% relative error.

Nørskov|Aleksandra Vojvodic	  We present a systematic theoretical investigation of the surface properties, stability and reactivity, of rock-salt type alkaline-earth metal oxides including MgO, CaO, SrO, and BaO. The accuracy of commonly used exchange-correlation density functionals (LDA, PBE, RPBE, PBEsol, BEEF-vdW and hybrid HSE) and random-phase approximation (RPA) is evaluated and compared to existing experimental values. Calculated surface energies of the four most stable surface facets under vacuum conditions: the (100) surface, the metal and oxygen terminated octopolar (111), and the (110) surfaces exhibit a monotonic increase in stability from MgO to BaO. On the MgO(100) surface, adsorption of CO, NO, CH4 is characterized by physisorption while H2O chemisorbs, which is in agreement with experimental findings. We further use the on-top metal adsorption of CO and NO molecules to map out the surface energetics of each alkaline-earth metal oxide surface. The considered functionals all qualitatively predict similar adsorption energy trends. The ordering between the adsorption energies on different surface facets can be attributed to differences in the local geometrical surface structure and the electronic structure of the metal constituent of the alkaline-earth metal oxide. The striking observation that CO adsorption strength is weaker than NO adsorption on the (100) terraces as the period of the alkaline-earth metal in the oxide increases, is analyzed in detail in terms of charge redistribution within the {\sigma} and {\pi} channels of adsorbates. Finally, we also present oxygen adsorption and oxygen vacancy formation energies in these oxide systems.

McGuire|John W. Freeland|Daniel Haskel|Patrick M. Woodward	  The magnetic ground state in the double perovskite system Sr2-xCaxCoOsO6 changes from an antiferromagnet (x = 0), to a spin glass (x = 1), to a ferrimagnet (x = 2) as the Ca content increases. This crossover is driven by chemical pressure effects that control the relative strength of magnetic exchange interactions. The synthesis, crystal structure, and magnetism of SrCaCoOsO6 and Ca2CoOsO6 are investigated and compared with Sr2CoOsO6. Both compounds adopt a monoclinic crystal structure with rock salt ordering of Co2+ and Os6+ and a-a-b+ octahedral tilting, but the average Co-O-Os bond angle evolves from 158.0(3) degrees in SrCaCoOsO6 to 150.54(9) degrees in Ca2CoOsO6 as the smaller Ca2+ ion replaces Sr2+. While this change may seem minor it has a profound effect on the magnetism, changing the magnetic ground state from antiferromagnetic in Sr2CoOsO6 (TN1 = 108 K, TN2 = 70 K), to a spin glass in SrCaCoOsO6 (Tf1 = 32 K, Tf2 = 13 K), to ferrimagnetic in Ca2CoOsO6 (TC = 145 K). In the first two compounds the observation of two transitions is consistent with weak coupling between the Co and Os sublattices.

Kanishka|Meghna K. K.|Vipin Bhatnagar|D. Indumathi|Nita Sinha	  The magnetized Iron CALorimeter detector (ICAL) which is proposed to be built in the India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO) laboratory, aims to study atmospheric neutrino oscillations primarily through charged current interactions of muon neutrinos and anti-neutrinos with the detector. The response of muons and charge identification efficiency, angle and energy resolution as a function of muon momentum and direction are studied from GEANT4-based simulations in the peripheral regions of the detector. This completes the characterisation of ICAL with respect to muons over the entire detector and has implications for the sensitivity of ICAL to the oscillation parameters and mass hierarchy compared to the studies where only the resolutions and efficiencies of the central region of ICAL were assumed for the entire detector.   Selection criteria for track reconstruction in the peripheral region of the detector were determined from the detector response. On applying these, for the 1--20 GeV energy region of interest for mass hierarchy studies, an average angle-dependent momentum resolution of 15--24%, reconstruction efficiency of about 60--70% and a correct charge identification of about 97% of the reconstructed muons were obtained. In addition, muon response at higher energies upto 50 GeV was studied as relevant for understanding the response to so-called rock muons and cosmic ray muons. An angular resolution of better than a degree for muon energies greater than 4 GeV was obtained in the peripheral regions, which is the same as that in the central region.

We show how the electrical conductance depends on changes in the drift velocity and the length of the electric field lines, in addition to the porosity and the conductance of the electrolyte. We characterized the length of the electric field lines by a tortuosity and the changes in drift velocity by a constriction factor. Both the tortuosity and the constriction factor are descriptors of the pore microstructure. We define a conductance reduction factor to measure the local contributions of the pore microstructure to the global conductance. It is shown that the global conductance reduction factor is the product of the tortuosity squared divided by the constriction factor, thereby proving that the combined effect of tortuosity and constriction, in addition to the porosity and conductance of the electrolyte, fully describes the effective electrical conductance of a porous medium. We show that our tortuosity, constriction factor, and conductance reduction factor reproduce the electrical conductance for idealized porous media. They are also applied to Bentheimer sandstone, where we describe a microstructure-related correlation between porosity and conductivity using both the global conductance reduction factor and the distinct contributions from tortuosity and constriction. Overall, this work shows how the empirical Archie cementation exponent can be substituted by more descriptive, physical parameters, either by the global conductance reduction factor or by tortuosity and constriction.

Scaringi|E. Breedt|J. Girven	  The cool white dwarf SDSS J124231.07+522626.6 exhibits photospheric absorption lines of 8 distinct heavy elements in medium resolution optical spectra, notably including oxygen. The Teff = 13000 K atmosphere is helium-dominated, but the convection zone contains significant amounts of hydrogen and oxygen. The four most common rock-forming elements (O, Mg, Si, and Fe) account for almost all the accreted mass, totalling at least 1.2e+24 g, similar to the mass of Ceres. The time-averaged accretion rate is 2e+10 g/s, one of the highest rates inferred among all known metal-polluted white dwarfs. We note a large oxygen excess, with respect to the most common metal oxides, suggesting that the white dwarf accreted planetary debris with a water content of ~38 per cent by mass. This star, together with GD 61, GD 16, and GD 362, form a small group of outliers from the known population of evolved planetary systems accreting predominantly dry, rocky debris. This result strengthens the hypothesis that, integrated over the cooling ages of white dwarfs, accretion of water-rich debris from disrupted planetesimals may significantly contribute to the build-up of trace hydrogen observed in a large fraction of helium-dominated white dwarf atmospheres.

Kulkarni	  We present ultraviolet photometry (NUV band, 180--280 nm) of 405 asteroids observed serendipitously by the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) from 2003--2012. All asteroids in this sample were detected by GALEX at least twice. Unambiguous visible-color-based taxonomic labels (C type versus S type) exist for 315 of these asteroids; of these, thermal-infrared-based diameters are available for 245. We derive NUV-V color using two independent models to predict the visual magnitude V at each NUV-detection epoch. Both V models produce NUV-V distributions in which the S types are redder than C types with more than 8-sigma confidence. This confirms that the S types' redder spectral slopes in the visible remain redder than the C types' into the NUV, this redness being consistent with absorption by silica-containing rocks. The GALEX asteroid data confirm earlier results from the International Ultraviolet Explorer, which two decades ago produced the only other sizeable set of UV asteroid photometry. The GALEX-derived NUV-V data also agree with previously published Hubble Space Telescope (HST) UV observations of asteroids 21 Lutetia and 1 Ceres. Both the HST and GALEX data indicate that NUV band is less useful than u band for distinguishing subgroups within the greater population of visible-color-defined C types (notably, M types and G types).

Domagal-Goldman|Ramses Ramirez|James Kasting	  A recent study by Ramirez et al. (2014) demonstrated that an atmosphere with 1.3-4 bar of CO2 and H2O, in addition to 5-20% H2, could have raised the mean annual and global surface temperature of early Mars above the freezing point of water. Such warm temperatures appear necessary to generate the rainfall (or snowfall) amounts required to carve the ancient martian valleys. Here, we use our best estimates for early martian outgassing rates, along with a 1-D photochemical model, to assess the conversion efficiency of CO, CH4, and H2S to CO2, SO2, and H2. Our outgassing estimates assume that Mars was actively recycling volatiles between its crust and interior, as Earth does today. H2 production from serpentinization and deposition of banded iron-formations is also considered. Under these assumptions, maintaining an H2 concentration of ~1-2% by volume is achievable, but reaching 5% H2 requires additional H2 sources or a slowing of the hydrogen escape rate below the diffusion limit. If the early martian atmosphere was indeed H2-rich, we might be able to see evidence of this in the rock record. The hypothesis proposed here is consistent with new data from the Curiosity Rover, which show evidence for a long-lived lake in Gale Crater near Mt. Sharp. It is also consistent with measured oxygen fugacities of martian meteorites, which show evidence for progressive mantle oxidation over time.

Their presence in the lower mantle's most abundant minerals, MgSiO_3 bridgmanite, MgSiO_3 post-perovskite and MgO periclase, alters their elastic properties. However, knowledge on the thermoelasticity of Fe- and Al-bearing MgSiO_3 bridgmanite, and post-perovskite is scarce. In this study, we perform ab initio molecular dynamics to calculate the elastic and seismic properties of pure, Fe^{3+}- and Fe^{2+}-, and Al^{3+}-bearing MgSiO_3 perovskite and post-perovskite, over a wide range of pressures, temperatures, and Fe/Al compositions. Our results show that a mineral assemblage resembling pyrolite fits a 1D seismological model well, down to, at least, a few hundred kilometers above the core-mantle boundary, i.e. the top of the D'' region. In D'', a similar composition is still an excellent fit to the average velocities and fairly approximate to the density. We also implement polycrystal plasticity with a geodynamic model to predict resulting seismic anisotropy, and find post-perovskite with predominant (001) slip across all compositions agrees best with seismic observations in the D''.

We demonstrate the capability of high field NMR relaxometry for the determination of the methane gas storage capacity and the measurement of the Hydrogen Index, to a high degree of accuracy. This helps determine the excess gas in the pore space which can be identified to exhibit Langmuir properties in the low pressure regime of 0.7 MPa to 39.6 Mpa. The Langmuir model enables us to determine the equilibrium density of the monolayer of adsorbed gas to be 8.5% lower than that of liquid methane. We also identify the signatures of multilayer adsorption at the high pressure regime from 39.6 Mpa to 89.7 Mpa and use the Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) theory to determine the number of adsorbed layers of methane gas. We show how these measurements help us differentiate the gas stored in the Vycor pore space into free and adsorbed fractions for the entire pressure range paving way for similar applications such as studying natural gas storage in gas shale rock or hydrogen storage in carbon nanotubes.

Krivtsov	  A model (further referred to as the enhanced vector-based model or EVM) for elastic bonds in solids, composed of bonded particles is presented. The model can be applied for a description of elastic deformation of rocks, ceramics, concrete, nanocomposites, aerogels and other materials with structural elements interacting via forces and torques. A material is represented as a set of particles (rigid bodies) connected by elastic bonds. Vectors rigidly connected with particles are used for description of particles orientations. Simple expression for potential energy of a bond is proposed. Corresponding forces and torques are calculated. Parameters of the potential are related to longitudinal, transverse (shear), bending, and torsional stiffnesses of the bond. It is shown that fitting parameters of the potential allows one to satisfy any values of stiffnesses. Therefore, the model is applicable to bonds with arbitrary length/thickness ratio. Bond stiffnesses are expressed in terms of geometrical and elastic properties of the bonds using three models: Bernoulli-Euler beam, Timoshenko beam, and short elastic cylinder. An approach for validation of numerical implementation of the model is presented. Validation is carried out by a comparison of numerical and analytical solutions of four test problems for a pair of bonded particles. Benchmark expressions for forces and torques in the case of pure tension/compression, shear, bending and torsion of a single bond are derived. This approach allows one to minimize the time required for a numerical implementation of the model.

Christiano	  Classical game theory treats players as special---a description of a game contains a full, explicit enumeration of all players---even though in the real world, "players" are no more fundamentally special than rocks or clouds. It isn't trivial to find a decision-theoretic foundation for game theory in which an agent's coplayers are a non-distinguished part of the agent's environment. Attempts to model both players and the environment as Turing machines, for example, fail for standard diagonalization reasons.   In this paper, we introduce a "reflective" type of oracle, which is able to answer questions about the outputs of oracle machines with access to the same oracle. These oracles avoid diagonalization by answering some queries randomly. We show that machines with access to a reflective oracle can be used to define rational agents using causal decision theory. These agents model their environment as a probabilistic oracle machine, which may contain other agents as a non-distinguished part.   We show that if such agents interact, they will play a Nash equilibrium, with the randomization in mixed strategies coming from the randomization in the oracle's answers. This can be seen as providing a foundation for classical game theory in which players aren't special.

Foley	  The long-term carbon cycle is vital for maintaining liquid water oceans on rocky planets due to the negative climate feedbacks involved in silicate weathering. Plate tectonics plays a crucial role in driving the long-term carbon cycle because it is responsible for CO$_2$ degassing at ridges and arcs, the return of CO$_2$ to the mantle through subduction, and supplying fresh, weatherable rock to the surface via uplift and orogeny. However, the presence of plate tectonics itself may depend on climate according to recent geodynamical studies showing that cool surface temperatures are important for maintaining vigorous plate tectonics. Using a simple carbon cycle model, I show that the negative climate feedbacks inherent in the long-term carbon cycle are uninhibited by climate's effect on plate tectonics. Furthermore, initial atmospheric CO$_2$ conditions do not impact the final climate state reached when the carbon cycle comes to equilibrium, as long as liquid water is present and silicate weathering can occur. Thus an initially hot, CO$_2$ rich atmosphere does not prevent the development of a temperate climate and plate tectonics on a planet. However, globally supply-limited weathering does prevent the development of temperate climates on planets with small subaerial land areas and large total CO$_2$ budgets because supply-limited weathering lacks stabilizing climate feedbacks. Planets in the supply-limited regime may become inhospitable for life and could experience significant water loss. Supply-limited weathering is less likely on plate tectonic planets, because plate tectonics promotes high erosion rates and thus a greater supply of bedrock to the surface.

Bikov|J. C. Hanson|A. M. Johannesen|J. Macy|S. Prohira|J. Stockham|M. Stockham|Al. Zheng|Am. Zheng	  Experimental efforts to measure neutrinos by radio-frequency (RF) signals resulting from neutrino interactions in-ice have intensified over the last decade. Recent calculations indicate that one may dramatically improve the sensitivity of ultra-high energy ("UHE"; >EeV) neutrino experiments via detection of radio waves trapped along the air-ice surface. Detectors designed to observe the "Askaryan effect" currently search for RF electromagnetic pulses propagating through bulk ice, and could therefore gain sensitivity if signals are confined to the ice-air boundary. To test the feasibilty of this scenario, measurements of the complex radio-frequency properties of several air-dielectric interfaces were performed for a variety of materials. Two-dimensional surfaces of granulated fused silica (sand), both in the lab as well as occurring naturally, water doped with varying concentrations of salt, natural rock salt formations, granulated salt and ice itself were studied, both in North America and also Antarctica. In no experiment do we observe unambiguous surface wave propagation, as would be evidenced by signals travelling with reduced signal loss and/or superluminal velocities, compared to conventional EM wave propagation. 	
1510.05295v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.05295v1	2015	Thermal Conductivity Of Rubble Piles	Jing Luan|Peter Goldreich	  Rubble piles are a common feature of solar system bodies. They are composed of monolithic elements of ice or rock bound by gravity. Voids occupy a significant fraction of the volume of a rubble pile. They can exist up to pressure $P\approx \epsy\mu$, where $\epsy$ is the monolithic material's yield strain and $\mu$ its rigidity. At low $P$, contacts between neighboring elements are confined to a small fraction of their surface areas. As a result, the effective thermal conductivity of a rubble pile, $\kcon\approx k(P/(\epsy\mu))^{1/2}$, can be orders of magnitude smaller than, $k$, the thermal conductivity of its monolithic elements. In a fluid-free environment, only radiation can transfer energy across voids. It contributes an additional component, $\krad=16\ell\sigma T^3/3$, to the total effective conductivity, $\keff=\kcon +\krad$. Here $\ell$, the inverse of the opacity per unit volume, is of order the size of the elements and voids. An important distinction between $\kcon$ and $\krad$ is that the former is independent of the size of the elements whereas the latter is proportional to it. Our expression for $\keff$ provides a good fit to the depth dependence of thermal conductivity in the top $140\,\mathrm{cm}$ of the lunar regolith. It also offers a good starting point for detailed modeling of thermal inertias for asteroids and satellites. Measurement of the response of surface temperature to variable insolation is a valuable diagnostic of a regolith. There is an opportunity for careful experiments under controlled laboratory conditions to test models of thermal conductivity such as the one we outline.

Kushwaha|N. Haldolaarachchige|R. J. Cava	  Time reversal symmetry (TRS) protects the metallic surface modes of topological insulators (TIs). The transport signature of robust metallic surface modes of TIs is a plateau that arrests the exponential divergence of the insulating bulk with decreasing temperature. This universal behavior is observed in all TI candidates ranging from Bi2Te2Se to SmB6. Recently, several topological semimetals (TSMs) have been found that exhibit extreme magnetoresistance (XMR) and TI universal resistivity behavior revealed only when breaking TRS, a regime where TIs theoretically cease to exist. Among these new materials, TaAs and NbP are nominated for Weyl semimetal due to their lack of inversion symmetry, Cd3As2 is nominated for Dirac semimetal due to its linear band crossing at the Fermi level, and WTe2 is nominated for resonant compensated semimetal due to its perfect electron-hole symmetry. Here we introduce LaSb, a simple rock-salt structure material without broken inversion symmetry, without perfect linear band crossing, and without perfect electron-hole symmetry. Yet LaSb portrays all the exotic field induced behaviors of the aforementioned semimetals in an archetypal fashion. It shows (a) the universal TI resistivity with a plateau at 15 K, revealed by a magnetic field, (b) ultrahigh mobility of carriers in the plateau region, (c) quantum oscillations with a non-trivial Berry phase, and (d) XMR of about one million percent at 9 tesla rivaled only by WTe2 and NbP. Due to its dramatic simplicity, LaSb is the ideal model system to formulate a theoretical understanding of the exotic consequences of breaking TRS in TSMs.

Bernstein|C. Marianno	  The potential of elastic antineutrino-electron scattering in a Gd-doped water Cherenkov detector to determine the direction of a nuclear reactor antineutrino flux was investigated using the recently proposed WATCHMAN antineutrino experiment as a baseline model. The expected scattering rate was determined assuming a 13-km standoff from a 3.758-GWt light water nuclear reactor and the detector response was modeled using a Geant4-based simulation package. Background was estimated via independent simulations and by scaling published measurements from similar detectors. Background contributions were estimated for solar neutrinos, misidentified reactor-based inverse beta decay interactions, cosmogenic radionuclides, water-borne radon, and gamma rays from the photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), detector walls, and surrounding rock. We show that with the use of low background PMTs and sufficient fiducialization, water-borne radon and cosmogenic radionuclides pose the largest threats to sensitivity. Directional sensitivity was then analyzed as a function of radon contamination, detector depth, and detector size. The results provide a list of experimental conditions that, if satisfied in practice, would enable antineutrino directional reconstruction at 3$\sigma$ significance in large Gd-doped water Cherenkov detectors with greater than 10-km standoff from a nuclear reactor.

The conventional interface condition at the jump interface is expressed as the continuous Darcy velocity and fluid pressure (named CVCM ). Our study has inspected this conclusions. First, it is revealed that the principle of mass conservation has no direct relation to the velocity conservation, and the former is not the true foundation of the later, because the former only reflects the kinetic characteristic of the fluid particles at one position(the interface), but not the neighborhood of the interface which required by the later. Then the reasonableness of CVCM is queried from the following three aspects:(1)Using Mukat's two phase seepage equation and the mathematical method of apagoge, we have disproved the continuity of each fluid velocity;(2)Since the analytical solution of the equation of Buckley-Leveret equations is acquirable, its velocity jumps at the flood front presents an appropriate example to disprove the CVCM;(3) The numerical simulation model gives impractical result that flood front would stop moving if CVCM were used to calculate the velocities at the interface between two gridcells. Subsequently, a new one, termed as Jump Velocity Condition Model (JVCM), is deduced from Muskat's two phase seepage equations and Darcy's law without taking account of the capillary force and compressibility of rocks and fluids. Finally, several cases are presented. And the comparisons of the velocity, pressure difference and the front position, which are given by JVCM, CVCM and SPU, have shown that the result of JVCM is the closest to the exact solution.

Karkut	  We have grown lead iron niobate thin films with composition Pb(Fe1/2Nb1/2)O3 (PFN) on (0 0 1) SrTiO3 substrates by pulsed laser deposition. The influence of the deposition conditions on the phase purity was studied. Due to similar thermodynamic stability spaces, a pyrochlore phase often coexists with the PFN perovskite phase. By optimizing the kinetic parameters, we succeeded in identifying a deposition window which resulted in epitaxial perovskite-phase PFN thin films with no identifiable trace of impurity phases appearing in the X-ray diffractograms. PFN films having thicknesses between 20 and 200 nm were smooth and epitaxially oriented with the substrate and as demonstrated by RHEED streaks which were aligned with the substrate axes. X-ray diffraction showed that the films were completely c-axis oriented and of excellent crystalline quality with low mosaicity (X-ray rocking curve FWHM<0.09). The surface roughness of thin films was also investigated by atomic force microscopy. The root-mean-square roughness varies between 0.9 nm for 50-nm-thick films to 16 nm for 100-nm-thick films. We also observe a correlation between grain size, surface roughness and film thickness. 	
1106.3993v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1106.3993v1	2011	Spin-orbit coupling in $d^{2}$ ordered double perovskites	Gang Chen|Leon Balents	  We construct and analyze a microscopic model for insulating rock salt ordered double perovskites, with the chemical formula A$_2$BB'O$_6$, where the magnetic ion B' has a 4d$^2$ or 5d$^2$ electronic configuration and forms a face centered cubic (fcc) lattice. For these B' ions, the combination of the triply-degenerate antisymmetric two-electron orbital states and strong spin-orbit coupling forms local quintuplets with an effective spin moment $j=2$. Moreover, due to strongly orbital-dependent exchange, the effective spins have substantial biquadratic and bicubic interactions (fourth and sixth order in the spins, respectively). This leads, at the mean field level, to a rich ground state phase diagram which includes seven different phases: a uniform ferromagnetic phase with an ordering wavevector ${\bf p} = {\bf 0}$ and uniform magnetization along $[111]$ direction, four two-sublattice phases with an ordering wavevector ${\bf p} = 2\pi(001)$ and two four-sublattice antiferromagnetic phases. Amongst the two-sublattice phases there is a quadrupolar ordered phase which preserves time reversal symmetry. Extending the mean field theory to finite temperatures, we find ten different magnetization processes with different magnetic thermal transitions. In particular, we find that thermal fluctuations stabilize the two-sublattice quadrupolar ordered phase in a large portion of phase diagram. Existing and possible future experiments are discussed in light of these theoretical predictions.

Duijn|A. V. Boukhanovsky|P. M. A. Sloot	  The criminal nature of narcotics complicates the direct assessment of a drug community, while having a good understanding of the type of people drawn or currently using drugs is vital for finding effective intervening strategies. Especially for the Russian Federation this is of immediate concern given the dramatic increase it has seen in drug abuse since the fall of the Soviet Union in the early nineties. Using unique data from the Russian social network 'LiveJournal' with over 39 million registered users worldwide, we were able for the first time to identify the on-line drug community by context sensitive text mining of the users' blogs using a dictionary of known drug-related official and 'slang' terminology. By comparing the interests of the users that most actively spread information on narcotics over the network with the interests of the individuals outside the on-line drug community, we found that the 'average' drug user in the Russian Federation is generally mostly interested in topics such as Russian rock, non-traditional medicine, UFOs, Buddhism, yoga and the occult. We identify three distinct scale-free sub-networks of users which can be uniquely classified as being either 'infectious', 'susceptible' or 'immune'.

Balázs	  We present a method for determining the background of Fermi GBM GRBs using the satellite positional information and a physical model. Since the polynomial fitting method typically used for GRBs is generally only indicative of the background over relatively short timescales, this method is particularly useful in the cases of long GRBs or those which have Autonomous Repoint Request (ARR) and a background with much variability on short timescales. We give a Direction Dependent Background Fitting (DDBF) method for separating the motion effects from the real data and calculate the duration (T90 and T50, as well as confidence intervals) of the nine example bursts, from which two resulted an ARR. We also summarize the features of our method and compare it qualitatively with the official GBM Catalogue. Our background filtering method uses a model based on the physical information of the satellite position. Therefore, it has many advantages compared to previous methods. It can fit long background intervals, remove all the features caused by the rocking behaviour of the satellite, and search for long emissions or not-triggered events. Furthermore, many part of the fitting have now been automatised, and the method have been shown to work for both Sky Survey mode and ARR mode data. Future work will provide a burst catalogue with DDBF.

Grokhovsky|Grigoriy A. Yakovlev|Jakub Haloda|Patricie Halodova|Radoslaw M. Michallik|Antti Penttilä|Karri Muinonen	  The mineralogy and physical properties of Chelyabinsk meteorites (fall, February 15, 2013) are presented. Three types of meteorite material are present, described as the light-colored, dark-colored, and impact-melt lithologies. All are of LL5 composition with the impact-melt lithology being close to whole-rock melt and the dark-colored lithology being shock-darkened due to partial melting of iron metal and sulfides. This enables us to study the effect of increasing shock on material with identical composition and origin. Based on the magnetic susceptibility, the Chelyabinsk meteorites are richer in metallic iron as compared to other LL chondrites. The measured bulk and grain densities and the porosity closely resemble other LL chondrites. Shock darkening does not have a significant effect on the material physical properties, but causes a decrease of reflectance and decrease in silicate absorption bands in the reflectance spectra. This is similar to the space weathering effects observed on asteroids. However, compared to space weathered materials, there is a negligible to minor slope change observed in impact-melt and shock-darkened meteorite spectra. Thus, it is possible that some dark asteroids with invisible silicate absorption bands may be composed of relatively fresh shock-darkened chondritic material. 	
1312.4820v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.4820v1	2013	Wave propagation in a fractional viscoelastic Andrade medium: diffusive   approximation and numerical modeling	Abderrahmin Ben Jazia|Bruno Lombard|Cédric Bellis	  This study focuses on the numerical modeling of wave propagation in fractionally-dissipative media. These viscoelastic models are such that the attenuation is frequency dependent and follows a power law with non-integer exponent. As a prototypical example, the Andrade model is chosen for its simplicity and its satisfactory fits of experimental flow laws in rocks and metals. The corresponding constitutive equation features a fractional derivative in time, a non-local term that can be expressed as a convolution product which direct implementation bears substantial memory cost. To circumvent this limitation, a diffusive representation approach is deployed, replacing the convolution product by an integral of a function satisfying a local time-domain ordinary differential equation. An associated quadrature formula yields a local-in-time system of partial differential equations, which is then proven to be well-posed. The properties of the resulting model are also compared to those of the original Andrade model. The quadrature scheme associated with the diffusive approximation, and constructed either from a classical polynomial approach or from a constrained optimization method, is investigated to finally highlight the benefits of using the latter approach. Wave propagation simulations in homogeneous domains are performed within a split formulation framework that yields an optimal stability condition and which features a joint fourth-order time-marching scheme coupled with an exact integration step. A set of numerical experiments is presented to assess the efficiency of the diffusive approximation method for such wave propagation problems. 	
1404.0800v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.0800v1	2014	Rotation of cometary meteoroids	David Capek	  The aim of this study is to estimate the rotational characteristics of meteoroids after their release from a comet during normal activity. The results can serve as initial conditions for further analyses of subsequent evolution of rotation in the interplanetary space. A sophisticated numerical model was applied to meteoroids ejected from 2P/Encke comet. The meteoroid shapes were approximated by polyhedrons with several thousands of surface elements, which have been determined by 3D laser scanning method of 36 terrestrial rock samples. These samples came from three distinct sets with different origin and shape characteristics. Two types of gas-meteoroid interactions (diffuse and specular reflection of gas molecules from the surface of meteoroid) and three gas ejection models (leading to very different ejection velocities) were assumed. The rotational characteristics of ejected meteoroid population were obtained by numerical integration of equations of motion with random initial conditions and random shape selection. It was proved, that the results do not depend on specific set of shape models and that they are applicable to (unknown) shapes of real meteoroids. A simple relationship between median of meteoroid spin frequencies $\bar{f}$ (Hz), ejection velocities $v_{\rm ej}$ (m s$^{-1}$) and sizes $D$ (m) was determined. For diffuse reflection of gas molecules from meteoroid's surface it is: $\bar{f}\simeq 2\times 10^{-3} v_{\rm ej} D^{-0.88}$, and for specular reflection of gas molecules from meteoroid's surface it is: $\bar{f}\simeq 5\times 10^{-3} v_{\rm ej} D^{-0.88}$. The distribution of spin frequencies is relatively wide; $2\sigma$-interval can be described as $\sim(0.1, 10)\times \bar{f}$. The results were determined for 2P/Encke comet, but it was shown that their validity is general.

Altieri	  The near-Earth asteroid (99942) Apophis is a potentially hazardous asteroid. We obtained far-infrared observations of this asteroid with the Herschel Space Observatory's PACS instrument at 70, 100, and 160 micron. These were taken at two epochs in January and March 2013 during a close Earth encounter. These first thermal measurements of Apophis were taken at similar phase angles before and after opposition. We performed a detailed thermophysical model analysis by using the spin and shape model recently derived from applying a 2-period Fourier series method to a large sample of well-calibrated photometric observations. We find that the tumbling asteroid Apophis has an elongated shape with a mean diameter of 375$^{+14}_{-10}$ m (of an equal volume sphere) and a geometric V-band albedo of 0.30$^{+0.05}_{-0.06}$. We find a thermal inertia in the range 250-800 Jm$^{-2}$s$^{-0.5}$K$^{-1}$ (best solution at 600 Jm$^{-2}$s$^{-0.5}$K$^{-1}$), which can be explained by a mixture of low conductivity fine regolith with larger rocks and boulders of high thermal inertia on the surface. The thermal inertia, and other similarities with (25143) Itokawa indicate that Apophis might also have a rubble-pile structure. If we combine the new size value with the assumption of an Itokawa-like density and porosity we estimate a mass between 4.4 and 6.2 10$^{10}$ kg which is more than 2-3 times larger than previous estimates. We expect that the newly derived properties will influence impact scenario studies and influence the long-term orbit predictions of Apophis.

When on the surface, dust increases the albedo of darker underlying rocks and regolith, which modifies climate energy balance and must be quantified. Remote observation of surface albedo absolute value and albedo change is however complicated by dust itself when lifted in the atmosphere. Here we present a method to calculate and map the bolometric solar hemispherical albedo of the Martian surface using the 2004 - 2010 OMEGA imaging spectrometer dataset. This method takes into account aerosols radiative transfer, surface photometry, and instrumental issues such as registration differences between visible and near-IR detectors. Resulting albedos are on average 17% higher than previous estimates for bright surfaces while similar for dark surfaces. We observed that surface albedo changes occur mostly during the storm season due to isolated events. The main variations are observed during the 2007 global dust storm and during the following year. A wide variety of change timings are detected such as dust deposited and then cleaned over a Martian year, areas modified only during successive global dust storms, and perennial changes over decades. Both similarities and differences with previous global dust storms are observed. While an optically thin layer of bright dust is involved in most changes, this coating turns out to be sufficient to mask underlying mineralogical near-IR spectral signatures. Overall, changes result from apparently erratic events; however, a cyclic evolution emerges for some (but not all) areas over long timescales.

Coulter|Efstratios Manousakis	  Finding an accurate ab initio approach for calculating the electronic properties of transition metal oxides has been a problem for several decades. In this paper, we investigate the electronic structure of the transition metal monoxides MnO, CoO, and NiO in their undistorted rock-salt structure within a fully iterated quasiparticle self-consistent GW (QPscGW) scheme. We study the convergence of the QPscGW method, i.e., how the quasiparticle energy eigenvalues and wavefunctions converge as a function of the QPscGW iterations, and we compare the converged outputs obtained from different starting wavefunctions. We find that the convergence is slow and that a one-shot G$_0$W$_0$ calculation does not significantly improve the initial eigenvalues and states. It is important to notice that in some cases the "path" to convergence may go through energy band reordering which cannot be captured by the simple initial unperturbed Hamiltonian. When we reach a fully iterated solution, the converged density of states, band-gaps and magnetic moments of these oxides are found to be only weakly dependent on the choice of the starting wavefunctions and in reasonably good agreement with the experiment. Finally, this approach provides a clear picture of the interplay between the various orbitals near the Fermi level of these simple transition metal monoxides. The results of these accurate {\it ab initio} calculations can provide input for models aiming at describing the low energy physics in these materials. 	
1410.4658v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.4658v1	2014	Hydrodynamics of Embedded Planets' First Atmospheres. I. A Centrifugal   Growth Barrier for 2D Flows	Chris W. Ormel|Rolf Kuiper|Ji-Ming Shi	  In the core accretion paradigm of planet formation, gas giants only form a massive atmosphere after their progenitors exceeded a threshold mass: the critical core mass. Most (exo)planets, being smaller and rock/ice-dominated, never crossed this line. Nevertheless, they were massive enough to attract substantial amounts of gas from the disc, while their atmospheres remained in pressure-equilibrium with the disc. Our goal is to characterise the hydrodynamical properties of the atmospheres of such embedded planets and their implication for their (long-term) evolution. In this paper -- the first in series -- we start to investigate the properties of an isothermal and inviscid flow past a small, embedded planet by conducting local, 2D hydrodynamical simulations. Using the PLUTO code we confirm that the flow is steady and bound. This steady outcome is most apparent for the log-polar grid (with the grid spacing proportional to the distance from the planet). For low-mass planets, Cartesian grids are somewhat less efficient as they have difficulty to follow the circular, large speeds in the deep atmosphere. Relating the amount of rotation to the gas fraction of the atmosphere, we find that more massive atmospheres rotate faster -- a finding consistent with Kelvin's circulation theorem. Rotation therefore limits the amount of gas that planets can acquire from the nebula. Dependent on the Toomre-Q parameter of the circumstellar disc, the planet's atmosphere will reach Keplerian rotation before self-gravity starts to become important. 	
1410.4659v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.4659v1	2014	Hydrodynamics of Embedded Planets' First Atmospheres. II. A Rapid   Recycling of Atmospheric Gas	Chris W. Ormel|Ji-Ming Shi|Rolf Kuiper	  Following Paper I we investigate the properties of atmospheres that form around small protoplanets embedded in a protoplanetary disc by conducting hydrodynamical simulations. These are now extended to three dimensions, employing a spherical grid centred on the planet. Compression of gas is shown to reduce rotational motions. Contrasting the 2D case, no clear boundary demarcates bound atmospheric gas from disc material; instead, we find an open system where gas enters the Bondi sphere at high latitudes and leaves through the midplane regions, or, vice versa, when the disc gas rotates sub-Keplerian. The simulations do not converge to a time-independent solution; instead, the atmosphere is characterized by a time-varying velocity field. Of particular interest is the timescale to replenish the atmosphere by nebular gas, $t_\mathrm{replenish}$. It is shown that the replenishment rate, $M_\mathrm{atm}/t_\mathrm{replenish}$, can be understood in terms of a modified Bondi accretion rate, $\sim$$R_\mathrm{Bondi}^2\rho_\mathrm{gas}v_\mathrm{Bondi}$, where $v_\mathrm{Bondi}$ is set by the Keplerian shear or the magnitude of the sub-Keplerian motion of the gas, whichever is larger. In the inner disk, the atmosphere of embedded protoplanets replenishes on a timescale that is shorter than the Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction (or cooling) timescale. As a result, atmospheric gas can no longer contract and the growth of these atmospheres terminates. Future work must confirm whether these findings continue to apply when the (thermodynamical) idealizations employed in this study are relaxed. But if shown to be broadly applicable, replenishment of atmospheric gas provides a natural explanation for the preponderance of gas-rich but rock-dominant planets like super-Earths and mini-Neptunes.

One of the major challenges associated with wireless sensor networks is the quality of the data and more specifically the detection of segment outliers and unusual events. Most previous research has focused on detecting outliers that are errors that are caused by unreliable sensors and sensor nodes. However, there is an urgent need for the development of new tools capable of identifying, tagging and visualizing erroneous segment outliers and unusual events from sensor data streams. In this paper, we present a SOUE Detector (Segment Outlier and Unusual Event-Detector) system for wireless sensor networks that combines statistical analyses using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) with domain expert knowledge (captured via an ontology and semantic inferencing rules). The resulting Web portal enables scientist to efficiently search across a collection of wireless sensor data streams and identify, retrieve and display segment outliers (both erroneous and genuine) within the data streams. In this paper, we firstly describe the detection algorithms, the implementation details and the functionality of the SOUE Detector system. Secondly we evaluate our approach using data that comprises sensor observations collected from a sensor network deployed in the Springbrook National Park in Queensland, Australia. The experimental results show that the SOUE-Detector can efficiently detect segment outliers and unusual events with high levels of precision and recall.

Muon tomography measures the natural flux of cosmic muons and its attenuation produced by the screening effect of the rock mass to image. Gravimetry generally consists in measurements of the vertical component of the local gravity field. Both methods are linearly linked to density, but their spatial sensitivity is very different. Muon tomography essentially works like medical X-ray scan and integrates density information along elongated narrow conical volumes while gravimetry measurements are linked to density by a 3-dimensional integral encompassing the whole studied domain. We develop the mathematical expressions of these integration formulas -- called acquisition kernels -- to express resolving kernels that act as spatial filters relating the true unknown density structure to the density distribution actually recoverable from the available data. The resolving kernels provide a tool to quantitatively describe the resolution of the density models and to evaluate the resolution improvement expected by adding new data in the inversion. The resolving kernels derived in the joined muon/gravimetry case indicate that gravity data are almost useless to constrain the density structure in regions sampled by more than two muon tomography acquisitions. Interestingly the resolution in deeper regions not sampled by muon tomography is significantly improved by joining the two techniques. Examples taken from field experiments performed on La Soufri\`ere of Guadeloupe volcano are discussed. 	
1504.01436v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.01436v1	2015	Stochastic Time-Series Spectroscopy	John Scoville	  Spectroscopically measuring low levels of non-equilibrium phenomena (e.g. emission in the presence of a large thermal background) can be problematic due to an unfavorable signal-to-noise ratio. An approach is presented to use time-series spectroscopy to separate non-equilibrium quantities from slowly varying equilibria. A stochastic process associated with the non-equilibrium part of the spectrum is characterized in terms of its central moments or cumulants, which may vary over time. This parameterization encodes information about the non-equilibrium behavior of the system.   Stochastic time-series spectroscopy (STSS) can be implemented at very little expense in many settings since a series of scans are typically recorded in order to generate a low-noise averaged spectrum. Higher moments or cumulants may be readily calculated from this series, enabling the observation of quantities that would be difficult or impossible to determine from an average spectrum or from prinicipal components analysis (PCA).   This method is more scalable than PCA, having linear time complexity, yet it can produce comparable or superior results, as shown in example applications. One example compares an STSS-derived CO$_2$ bending mode to a standard reference spectrum and the result of PCA. A second example shows that STSS can reveal conditions of stress in rocks, a scenario where traditional methods such as PCA are inadequate. This allows spectral lines and non-equilibrium behavior to be precisely resolved. A relationship between 2nd order STSS and a time-varying form of PCA is considered. Although the possible applications of STSS have not been fully explored, it promises to reveal information that previously could not be easily measured, possibly enabling new domains of spectroscopy and remote sensing.

Planets from sub-Earths to Brown Dwarfs:   structure and metallicity preferences	Sergei Nayakshin|Mark Fletcher	  We present population synthesis calculations of the Tidal Downsizing (TD) hypothesis for planet formation. Our models address the following observations: (i) most abundant planets being Super Earths; (ii) cores more massive than $\sim 5-15 M_\oplus$ are enveloped by massive atmospheres; (iii) the frequency of occurrence of close-in gas giant planets correlates strongly with metallicity of the host star; (iv) no such correlation is found for sub-Neptune planets; (v) presence of massive cores in giant planets; (vi) gas giant planets are over-abundant in metals compared to their host stars; (vii) this over-abundance decreases with planet's mass; (viii) a deep valley in the planet mass function between masses of $\sim 10-20 M_\oplus$ and $\sim 100 M_\oplus$. A number of observational predictions distinguish the model from Core Accretion: (a) composition of the massive cores is always dominated by rocks not ices; (b) the core mass function is smooth with no minimum at $\sim 3 M_\oplus$ and has no ice-dominated cores; (c) gas giants beyond 10 AU are insensitive to the host star metallicity; (d) objects more massive than $\sim 10 M_{\rm Jup}$ do not correlate or even anti-correlate with metallicity. The latter prediction is consistent with observations of low mass stellar companions. TD can also explain formation of planets in close binary systems. TD model is a viable alternative to the Core Accretion scenario in explaining many features of the observed population of exoplanets.

Westphal|Zack Gainsforth|Anna L. Butterworth	  Individual particles from comet 81P/Wild 2 collected by NASA's Stardust mission vary in size from small sub-$\mu$m fragments found in the walls of the aerogel tracks, to large fragments up to tens of $\mu$m in size found towards the termini of tracks. The comet, in an orbit beyond Neptune since its formation, retains an intact a record of early-Solar-System processes that was compromised in asteroidal samples by heating and aqueous alteration. We measured the O isotopic composition of seven Stardust fragments larger than $\sim$2 $\mu$m extracted from five different Stardust aerogel tracks, and 63 particles smaller than $\sim$2 $\mu$m from the wall of a Stardust track. The larger particles show a relatively narrow range of O isotopic compositions that is consistent with $^{16}$O-poor phases commonly seen in meteorites. Many of the larger Stardust fragments studied so far have chondrule-like mineralogy which is consistent with formation in the inner Solar System. The fine-grained material shows a very broad range of O isotopic compositions ($-70<\Delta^{17}$O$<+60$) suggesting that Wild 2 fines are either primitive outer-nebula dust or a very diverse sampling of inner Solar System compositional reservoirs that accreted along with a large number of inner-Solar-System rocks to form comet Wild 2.

Seismic attributes are available over a study area with lower vertical resolution. Conversely, well logs and lithological properties are available only at specific well locations in a study area with high vertical resolution.Sand fraction, which represents per unit sand volume within the rock, has a balanced distribution between zero to unity.The thesis addresses the issues of handling the information content mismatch between predictor and target variables and proposes regularization of target property prior to building a prediction model.In this thesis, two Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based frameworks are proposed to model sand fraction from multiple seismic attributes without and with well tops information respectively. The performances of the frameworks are quantified in terms of Correlation Coefficient, Root Mean Square Error, Absolute Error Mean, etc. 	
1506.06867v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.06867v2	2015	A Metallicity Recipe for Rocky Planets	Rebekah I. Dawson|Eugene Chiang|Eve J. Lee	  Planets with sizes between those of Earth and Neptune divide into two populations: purely rocky bodies whose atmospheres contribute negligibly to their sizes, and larger gas-enveloped planets possessing voluminous and optically thick atmospheres. We show that whether a planet forms rocky or gas-enveloped depends on the solid surface density of its parent disk. Assembly times for rocky cores are sensitive to disk solid surface density. Lower surface densities spawn smaller planetary embryos; to assemble a core of given mass, smaller embryos require more mergers between bodies farther apart and therefore exponentially longer formation times. Gas accretion simulations yield a rule of thumb that a rocky core must be at least 2$M_\oplus$ before it can acquire a volumetrically significant atmosphere from its parent nebula. In disks of low solid surface density, cores of such mass appear only after the gas disk has dissipated, and so remain purely rocky. Higher surface density disks breed massive cores more quickly, within the gas disk lifetime, and so produce gas-enveloped planets. We test model predictions against observations, using planet radius as an observational proxy for gas-to-rock content and host star metallicity as a proxy for disk solid surface density. Theory can explain the observation that metal-rich stars host predominantly gas-enveloped planets.

Malomed	  We consider self-trapping of topological modes governed by the one- and two-dimensional (1D and 2D) nonlinear-Schrodinger/Gross-Pitaevskii equation with effective single- and double-well (DW) nonlinear potentials induced by spatial modulation of the local strength of the self-defocusing nonlinearity. This setting, which may be implemented in optics and Bose-Einstein condensates, aims to extend previous studies, which dealt with single-well nonlinear potentials. In the 1D setting, we find several types of symmetric, asymmetric and antisymmetric states, focusing on scenarios of the spontaneous symmetry breaking. The single-well model is extended by including rocking motion of the well, which gives rise to Rabi oscillations between the fundamental and dipole modes. Analysis of the 2D single-well setting gives rise to stable modes in the form of ordinary dipoles, vortex-antivortex dipoles (VADs), and vortex triangles (VTs), which may be considered as produced by spontaneous breaking of the axial symmetry. The consideration of the DW configuration in 2D reveals diverse types of modes built of components trapped in the two wells, which may be fundamental states and vortices with topological charges m = 1 and 2, as well as VADs (with m = 0) and VTs (with m = 2). 	
1511.09067v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.09067v1	2015	Sparse Coral Classification Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks	Mohamed Elawady	  Autonomous repair of deep-sea coral reefs is a recent proposed idea to support the oceans ecosystem in which is vital for commercial fishing, tourism and other species. This idea can be operated through using many small autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and swarm intelligence techniques to locate and replace chunks of coral which have been broken off, thus enabling re-growth and maintaining the habitat. The aim of this project is developing machine vision algorithms to enable an underwater robot to locate a coral reef and a chunk of coral on the seabed and prompt the robot to pick it up. Although there is no literature on this particular problem, related work on fish counting may give some insight into the problem. The technical challenges are principally due to the potential lack of clarity of the water and platform stabilization as well as spurious artifacts (rocks, fish, and crabs). We present an efficient sparse classification for coral species using supervised deep learning method called Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We compute Weber Local Descriptor (WLD), Phase Congruency (PC), and Zero Component Analysis (ZCA) Whitening to extract shape and texture feature descriptors, which are employed to be supplementary channels (feature-based maps) besides basic spatial color channels (spatial-based maps) of coral input image, we also experiment state-of-art preprocessing underwater algorithms for image enhancement and color normalization and color conversion adjustment. Our proposed coral classification method is developed under MATLAB platform, and evaluated by two different coral datasets (University of California San Diego's Moorea Labeled Corals, and Heriot-Watt University's Atlantic Deep Sea).

Kempton	  Recent studies have unequivocally proven the existence of clouds in super-Earth atmospheres (Kreidberg et al. 2014). Here we provide a theoretical context for the formation of super-Earth clouds by determining which condensates are likely to form under the assumption of chemical equilibrium. We study super-Earth atmospheres of diverse bulk composition, which are assumed to form by outgassing from a solid core of chondritic material, following Schaefer & Fegley (2010). The super-Earth atmospheres that we study arise from planetary cores made up of individual types of chondritic meteorites. They range from highly reducing to oxidizing and have carbon to oxygen (C:O) ratios that are both subsolar and super-solar, thereby spanning a range of atmospheric composition that is appropriate for low-mass exoplanets. Given the atomic makeup of these atmospheres, we minimize the global Gibbs free energy of formation for over 550 gases and condensates to obtain the molecular composition of the atmospheres over a temperature range of 350-3,000 K. Clouds should form along the temperature-pressure boundaries where the condensed species appear in our calculation. We find that the composition of condensate clouds depends strongly on both the H:O and C:O ratios. For the super-Earth archetype GJ 1214b, KCl and ZnS are the primary cloud-forming condensates at solar composition, in agreement with previous work (Morley et al. 2013; Miller-Ricci Kempton et al. 2012). However, for oxidizing atmospheres, K2SO4 and ZnO condensates are favored instead, and for carbon-rich atmospheres with super-solar C:O ratios, graphite clouds appear. For even hotter planets, clouds form from a wide variety of rock-forming and metallic species.

Glinsky|Dale Baptiste|Muhlis Unaldi|Vishal Nagassar	  This paper presents a novel workflow for seismic net pay estimation with uncertainty. It is demonstrated on the Cassra/Iris Field. The theory for the stochastic wavelet derivation (which estimates the seismic noise level along with the wavelet, time-to-depth mapping, and their uncertainties), the stochastic sparse spike inversion, and the net pay estimation (using secant areas) along with its uncertainty; will be outlined. This includes benchmarking of this methodology on a synthetic model. A critical part of this process is the calibration of the secant areas. This is done in a two step process. First, a preliminary calibration is done with the stochastic reflection response modeling using rock physics relationships derived from the well logs. Second, a refinement is made to the calibration to account for the encountered net pay at the wells. Finally, a variogram structure is estimated from the extracted secant area map, then used to build in the lateral correlation to the ensemble of net pay maps while matching the well results to within the nugget of the variogram. These net pay maps are then integrated, over the area of full saturation gas, to give the GIIP distribution (Gaussian distributions for the porosity, gas expansion factor, and gas saturation for the sand end member are assumed and incorporated in the estimate of GIIP). The method is demonstrated on the Iris (UP5 turbidite) interval. The net pay is corrected for reduction in the amplitudes over part of the area due to shallow gas. The sensitivity of the GIIP to the independent stochastic variables is estimated (determining the value of information) so that business decisions can be made that maximize the value of the field.

Similar features were observed in a simple rock-salt-structure LaSb, leading to a suggestion of the possible non-trivial topology of 2D states in this compound. We show that its sister compound YSb is also characterized by giant magnetoresistance exceeding one thousand percent and low-temperature plateau of resistivity. We thus performed in-depth analysis of YSb Fermi surface by band calculations, magnetoresistance, and Shubnikov--de Haas effect measurements, which reveals only three-dimensional Fermi sheets. Kohler scaling applied to magnetoresistance data accounts very well for its low-temperature upturn behavior. The field-angle-dependent magnetoresistance demonstrates a 3D-scaling yielding effective mass anisotropy perfectly agreeing with electronic structure and quantum oscillations analysis, thus providing further support for 3D-Fermi surface scenario of magnetotransport, without necessity of invoking topologically non-trivial 2D states. We discuss data implying that analogous field-induced properties of LaSb can also be well understood in the framework of 3D multiband model.

(2014): John's stone: A possible fragment of the 1908   Tunguska meteorite	Yana Anfinogenova|John Anfinogenov|Larisa Budaeva|Dmitry Kuznetsov	  The article provides an open discussion and a critical feedback to the comments of Haack et al. (2015) and emphasizes a significance of the first macroscopic evidence for a candidate meteorite of a new type: planetary-origin meteorite composed of silica-rich sedimentary rock. Discussion concerns the arguments for (i) candidate parental bodies including the Earth, Mars and icy moons of Saturn and Jupiter; (ii) PGE anomaly versus glassy silicate microspherules and quartz grains anomaly in the area of the 1908 Tunguska catastrophe; (iii) isotopic heterogeneity of unmixed silicate reservoirs on Mars; (iv) possible terrestrial loss or contamination in the noble gas signatures in meteorites that spent time in the extreme weather conditions; (v) cosmogenic isotopes and shielding; and (vi) pseudo meteorites. We conclude that the list of candidate parental bodies for hypothetical sedimentary-origin meteorites includes, but is not limited by the Earth, Mars, Enceladus, Ganymede, and Europa. A parental body should be identified based on the entire body of evidence which is not limited solely by tests of oxygen and noble gas isotopes whose signatures may undergo terrestrial contamination and may exhibit significant heterogeneity within the parental bodies.

An agent takes adaptive actions to achieve a neighborhood to his advantage by rewiring a dissatisfying link with a probability $p$ or switching strategy with a probability $1-p$. Numerical results revealed two phases in the steady state. An active phase for $p<p_{\text{cri}}$ has one connected network of agents using different strategies who are continually interacting and taking adaptive actions. A frozen phase for $p>p_{\text{cri}}$ has three separate clusters of agents using only R, P, and S, respectively with terminated adaptive actions. A mean-field theory of link densities in co-evolving network is formulated in a general way that can be readily modified to other co-evolving network problems of multiple strategies. The analytic results agree with simulation results on ARPS well. We point out the different probabilities of winning, losing, and drawing a game among the agents as the origin of the small discrepancy between analytic and simulation results. As a result of the adaptive actions, agents of higher degrees are often those being taken advantage of. Agents with a smaller (larger) degree than the mean degree have a higher (smaller) probability of winning than losing. The results are useful in future attempts on formulating more accurate theories.

Tsirlin|Mark A. Green|Alexandros Lappas	  Birnessite compounds are stable across a wide range of compositions that produces a remarkable diversity in their physical, electrochemical and functional properties. These are hydrated analogues of the magnetically frustrated, mixed-valent manganese oxide structures, with general formula, NaxMnO2. Here we demonstrate that the direct hydration of layered rock-salt type a-NaMnO2, with the geometrically frustrated triangular lattice topology, yields the birnessite type oxide, Na0.36MnO2 0.2H2O, transforming its magnetic properties. This compound has a much-expanded interlayer spacing compared to its parent a-NaMnO2 compound. We show that while the parent a-NaMnO2 possesses a Neel temperature of 45 K as a result of broken symmetry in the Mn3+ sub-lattice, the hydrated derivative undergoes collective spin-freezing at 29 K within the Mn3+/Mn4+ sub-lattice. Scaling-law analysis of the frequency dispersion of the AC susceptibility, as well as the temperature-dependent, low-field DC magnetization confirm a cooperative spin-glass state of strongly interacting spins. This is supported by complementary spectroscopic analysis (HAADF-STEM, EDS, EELS) as well as by a structural investigation (high-resolution TEM, X-ray and neutron powder diffraction) that yield insights into the chemical and atomic structure modifications. We conclude that the spin-glass state in birnessite is driven by the spin-frustration imposed by the underlying triangular lattice topology that is further enhanced by the in-plane bond-disorder generated by the mixed-valent character of manganese in the layers.

Plotkin	  Iterated games provide a framework to describe social interactions among groups of individuals. Recent work stimulated by the discovery of "zero-determinant" strategies has rapidly expanded our ability to analyze such interactions. This body of work has primarily focused on games in which players face a simple binary choice, to "cooperate" or "defect". Real individuals, however, often exhibit behavioral diversity, varying their input to a social interaction both qualitatively and quantitatively. Here we explore how access to a greater diversity of behavioral choices impacts the evolution of social dynamics in finite populations. We show that, in public goods games, some two-choice strategies can nonetheless resist invasion by all possible multi-choice invaders, even while engaging in relatively little punishment. We also show that access to greater behavioral choice results in more "rugged " fitness landscapes, with populations able to stabilize cooperation at multiple levels of investment, such that choice facilitates cooperation when returns on investments are low, but hinders cooperation when returns on investments are high. Finally, we analyze iterated rock-paper-scissors games, whose non-transitive payoff structure means unilateral control is difficult and zero-determinant strategies do not exist in general. Despite this, we find that a large portion of multi-choice strategies can invade and resist invasion by strategies that lack behavioral diversity -- so that even well-mixed populations will tend to evolve behavioral diversity.

The iron line is generated through continuum photons reflecting off the accretion disk, and its shape is distorted by relativistic motion of the orbiting plasma and the gravitational pull of the black hole. The physical origin of the QPO has long been debated, but is often attributed to Lense-Thirring precession, a General Relativistic effect causing the inner flow to precess as the spinning black hole twists up the surrounding space-time. This predicts a characteristic rocking of the iron line between red and blue shift as the receding and approaching sides of the disk are respectively illuminated. Here we report on XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations of the black hole binary H 1743-322 in which the line energy varies systematically over the ~4 s QPO cycle (3.70 sigma significance), as predicted. This provides strong evidence that the QPO is produced by Lense-Thirring precession, constituting the first detection of this effect in the strong gravitation regime. There are however elements of our results harder to explain, with one section of data behaving differently to all the others. Our result enables the future application of tomographic techniques to map the inner regions of black hole accretion disks. 	
1607.04133v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.04133v1	2016	A hypothesis for the color bimodality of Jupiter Trojans	Ian Wong|Michael E. Brown	  One of the most enigmatic and hitherto unexplained properties of Jupiter Trojans is their bimodal color distribution. This bimodality is indicative of two sub-populations within the Trojans, which have distinct size distributions. In this paper, we present a simple, plausible hypothesis for the origin and evolution of the two Trojan color sub-populations. In the framework of dynamical instability models of early Solar System evolution, which suggest a common primordial progenitor population for both Trojans and Kuiper belt objects, we use observational constraints to assert that the color bimodalities evident in both minor body populations developed within the primordial population prior to the onset of instability. We show that, beginning with an initial composition of rock and ices, location-dependent volatile loss through sublimation in this primordial population could have led to sharp changes in the surface composition with heliocentric distance. We propose that the depletion or retention of H$_{2}$S ice on the surface of these objects was the key factor in creating an initial color bimodality. Objects that retained H$_{2}$S on their surfaces developed characteristically redder colors upon irradiation than those that did not. After the bodies from the primordial population were scattered and emplaced into their current positions, they preserved this primordial color bimodality to the present day. We explore predictions of the volatile loss model - in particular, the effect of collisions within the Trojan population on the size distributions of the two sub-populations - and propose further experimental and observational tests of our hypothesis

Rayaprol|P. L. Paulose|E. V. Sampathkumaran	  The area of research to discover new Li containing materials and to understand their physical properties has been of constant interest due to applications potential for rechargeable batteries. Here, we present the results of magnetic investigations on a Li compound, Li3Ni2RuO6, which was believed to be a ferrimagnet below 80K. While our neutron diffraction (ND) and isothermal magnetization (M) data support ferrimagnetism, more detailed magnetic studies establish that this ferrimagnetic phase exhibits some features similar to spin-glasses. In addition, we find another broad magnetic anomaly around 40-55 K in magnetic susceptibility, attributable to cluster spin-glass phenomenon. Gradual dominance of cluster spin-glass dynamics with a decrease of temperature (T) and the apparent spread in freezing temperature suggest that the ferrimagnetism of this compound is a chaotic one. The absence of a unique freezing temperature for a crystalline material is interesting. In addition, pyroelectric current data reveals a feature in the range 40-50 K, attributable to thermally stimulated depolarization current. We hope this finding motivates future work to explore whether there is any intriguing correlation of such a feature with spin-glass dynamics. We attribute these magnetic and electric dipole anomalies to the crystallographic disorder intrinsic to this compound.

The consequences of differentiation on the structure and composition of planets are typically addressed considering only the interaction of molten iron with an immiscible `rocky' phase. We demonstrate that mixing in a representative system of liquid or solid MgO and liquid iron to a single homogeneous liquid occurs at sufficiently low temperature to be present in the aftermath of a giant impact. Applying the thermodynamic integration technique to density functional theory molecular dynamics simulations, we determine the solvus closure temperature for the Fe-MgO system for pressures up to 400 GPa. Solvus closure occurs at $\sim$4000 K at low pressure, and has a weak positive pressure dependence, such that its gradient with respect to depth is less steep than an adiabatic temperature profile. This predicts a new mode of core-mantle differentiation following the most energetic giant impacts, with exsolution of iron from the mixture beginning in the outer layers of the planet. We demonstrate that high-temperature equilibration results in delivery of nominally insoluble Mg-rich material to the early core. Since MgO is the least soluble major mantle component in iron at low temperatures, these results may represent an upper bound on temperature for mixing in terrestrial planets.

This observation is consistent with previous description of d reflections. High-angle annular dark-field STEM imaging (or Z-contrast imaging) that avoids dynamic diffraction as seen in electron diffraction and high-resolution TEM imaging modes, confirms that d reflections correspond to nanoscale precipitates aligned parallel to (001) of the host dolomite. The lamellae precipitates have a cation ordering sequence of Ca-Ca-Mg-Ca-Ca- Mg along the c direction resulting in a chemical composition of Ca0.67Mg0.33CO3. This superstructure is attributed to the extra or d reflections, thus is referred to as the d superstructure in this study. The structure can be simply described as interstratified calcite/dolomite. The crystal structure of the d superstructure calculated from density functional theory (DFT) has a space group of P31c and has a and c unit-cell parameters of 4.879 and 16.260 {\AA}, respectively, values between those of dolomite and calcite. The detailed structural characteristics and parameters obtained from ab initio calculations are also reported in this paper. The method of combining Z-contrast imaging and ab initio calculations can be used for solving structures of other nano-precipitates and nano-phases.

Rappe	  We report density functional theory (DFT) investigation of $B$-site doped CaFeO$_3$, a prototypical charge-ordered perovskite. At 290 K, CaFeO$_3$ undergoes a metal-insulator transition and a charge disproportionation reaction 2Fe$^{4+}$$\rightarrow$Fe$^{5+}$+Fe$^{3+}$. We observe that when Zr dopants occupy a (001) layer, the band gap of the resulting solid solution increases to 0.93 eV due to a 2D Jahn-Teller type distortion, where FeO$_6$ cages on the $xy$ plane elongate along $x$ and $y$ alternatively between neighboring Fe sites. Furthermore, we show that the rock-salt ordering of the Fe$^{5+}$ and Fe$^{3+}$ cations can be enhanced when the $B$-site dopants are arranged in a (111) plane due to a collective steric effect that facilitates the size discrepancy between the Fe$^{5+}$O$_6$ and Fe$^{3+}$O$_6$ octahedra and therefore gives rise to a larger band gap. The enhanced charge disproportionation in these solid solutions is verified by rigorously calculating the oxidation states of the Fe cations with different octahedral cage sizes. We therefore predict that the corresponding transition temperature will increase due to the enhanced charge ordering and larger band gap. The compositional, structural and electrical relationships exploited in this paper can be extended to a variety of perovskites and non-perovskite oxides providing guidance in structurally manipulating electrical properties of functional materials.

Knapen|J. Falcon-Barroso	  We present the first single-burst stellar population models which covers the optical and the infrared wavelength range between 3500 and 50000 Angstrom and which are exclusively based on empirical stellar spectra. To obtain these joint models, we combined the extended MILES models in the optical with our new infrared models that are based on the IRTF (Infrared Telescope Facility) library. The latter are available only for a limited range in terms of both age and metallicity. Our combined single-burst stellar population models were calculated for ages larger than 1 Gyr, for metallicities between [Fe/H] = -0.40 and 0.26, for initial mass functions of various types and slopes, and on the basis of two different sets of isochrones. They are available to the scientific community on the MILES web page. We checked the internal consistency of our models and compared their colour predictions to those of other models that are available in the literature. Optical and near infrared colours that are measured from our models are found to reproduce the colours well that were observed for various samples of early-type galaxies. Our models will enable a detailed analysis of the stellar populations of observed galaxies.

Mitra|K. Mulrey|A. Nelles|J. P. Rachen|L. Rossetto|P. Schellart|O. Scholten|S. Thoudam|T. N. G. Trinh|S. ter Veen	  The low flux of the ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECR) at the highest energies provides a challenge to answer the long standing question about their origin and nature. A significant increase in the number of detected UHECR is expected to be achieved by employing Earth's moon as detector, and search for short radio pulses that are emitted when a particle interacts in the lunar rock. Observation of these short pulses with current and future radio telescopes also allows to search for the even lower fluxes of neutrinos with energies above $10^{22}$ eV, that are predicted in certain Grand-Unifying-Theories (GUTs), and e.g. models for super-heavy dark matter (SHDM). In this contribution we present the initial design for such a search with the LOFAR radio telescope. 	
1609.07503v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.07503v1	2016	Dawes Review. The tidal downsizing hypothesis of planet formation	Sergei Nayakshin	  Tidal Downsizing is the modern version of the Kuiper (1951) scenario of planet formation. Detailed simulations of self-gravitating discs, gas fragments, dust grain dynamics, and planet evolutionary calculations are summarised here and used to build a predictive planet formation model and population synthesis. A new interpretation of exoplanetary and debris disc data, the Solar System's origins, and the links between planets and brown dwarfs is offered. This interpretation is contrasted with the current observations and the predictions of the Core Accretion theory. Observations that can distinguish the two scenarios are pointed out. In particular, Tidal Downsizing predicts that presence of debris discs, sub-Neptune mass planets, planets more massive than $\sim 5$~Jupiter masses and brown dwarfs should not correlate strongly with the metallicity of the host. For gas giants of $\sim$ Saturn to a few Jupiter mass, a strong host star metallicity correlation is predicted only inwards of a few AU from the host. Composition of massive cores is predicted to be dominated by rock rather than ices. Debris discs made by Tidal Downsizing are distinct from those made by Core Accretion at birth: they have an innermost edge always larger than about 1 au, have smaller total masses and are usually in a dynamically excited state. It is argued that planet formation in surprisingly young or very dynamic systems such as HL Tau and Kepler-444 may be a signature of Tidal Downsizing. Open questions and potential weaknesses of the hypothesis are pointed out. 	
1609.09204v3	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.09204v3	2016	New class of 3D topological insulator in double perovskite	Shu-Ting Pi|Hui Wang|Jeongwoo Kim|Ruqian Wu|Yin-Kuo Wang|Chi-Ken Lu	  We predict a new class of three-dimensional topological insulators (TIs) in which the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) can more effectively generate a large band gap at $\Gamma$ point. The band gap of conventional TI such as Bi$_2$Se$_3$ is mainly limited by two factors, the strength of SOC and, from electronic structure perspective, the band gap when SOC is absent. While the former is an atomic property, we find that the latter can be minimized in a generic rock-salt lattice model in which a stable crossing of bands {\it at} the Fermi level along with band character inversion occurs for a range of parameters in the absence of SOC. Thus, large-gap TI's or TI's comprised of lighter elements can be expected. In fact, we find by performing first-principle calculations that the model applies to a class of double perovskites A$_2$BiXO$_6$ (A = Ca, Sr, Ba; X = Br, I) and the band gap is predicted up to 0.55 eV. Besides, more detailed calculations considering realistic surface structure indicate that the Dirac cones are robust against the presence of dangling bond at the boundary with a specific termination.

Vesuvius	Adriano Mazzarella|Nicola Scafetta	  We analyze hourly seismic data measured at the Osservatorio Vesuviano Ovest (OVO, 1972-2014) and at the Bunker Est (BKE, 1999-2014) stations on the Mt. Vesuvius. The OVO record is complete for seismic events with magnitude M > 1.9. We demonstrate that before 1996 this record presents a daily oscillation that nearly vanishes afterwards. To determine whether a daily oscillation exists in the seismic activity of the Mt. Vesuvius, we use the higher quality BKE record that is complete for seismic events with magnitude M > 0.2. We demonstrate that BKE confirms that the seismic activity at the Mt. Vesuvius is higher during nighttime than during day-time. The amplitude of the daily oscillation is enhanced during summer and damped during winter. We speculate possible links with the cooling/warming diurnal cycle of the volcanic edifice, with external geomagnetic field and with magnetostriction that should also stress the rocks. We find that the amplitude of the seismic daily cycle changes in time and has been increasing since 2008. Finally, we propose a seismic activity index to monitor the 24-hour oscillation that could be used to complement other methodologies currently adopted to determine the seismic status of the volcano and to prevent the relative hazard.

Aims: We wish to understand how a significant fraction of the pebbles grows into planetesimals instead of being lost to the host star. Methods:We examined analytically how the inward flow of pebbles is affected by the snow line and under which conditions dust-rich (rocky) planetesimals form. When calculating the inward drift of solids that is due to gas drag, we included the back-reaction of the gas to the motion of the solids. Results: We show that in low-viscosity protoplanetary disks (with a monotonous surface density similar to that of the minimum-mass solar nebula), the flow of pebbles does not usually reach the required surface density to form planetesimals by streaming instability. We show, however, that if the pebble-to-gas-mass flux exceeds a critical value, no steady solution can be found for the solid-to-gas ratio. This is particularly important for low-viscosity disks (alpha < 10^(-3)) where we show that inside of the snow line, silicate-dust grains ejected from sublimating pebbles can accumulate, eventually leading to the formation of dust-rich planetesimals directly by gravitational instability. Conclusions: This formation of dust-rich planetesimals may occur for extended periods of time, while the snow line sweeps from several au to inside of 1 au. The rock-to-ice ratio may thus be globally significantly higher in planetesimals and planets than in the central star. 	
1611.04327v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.04327v1	2016	On ideal dynamic climbing ropes	Davit Harutyunyan|Graeme W. Milton|Trevor J. Dick|Justin Boyer	  We consider the rope climber fall problem in two different settings. The simplest formulation of the problem is when the climber falls from a given altitude and is attached to one end of the rope while the other end of the rope is attached to the rock at a given height. The problem is then finding the properties of the rope for which the peak force felt by the climber during the fall is minimal. The second problem of our consideration is again minimizing the same quantity in the presence of a carabiner. We will call such ropes \textit{mathematically ideal.} Given the height of the carabiner, the initial height and the mass of the climber, the length of the unstretched rope, and the distance between the belayer and the carabineer, we find the optimal (in the sense of minimized the peak force to a given elongation) dynamic rope in the framework of nonlinear elasticity. Wires of shape memory materials have some of the desired features of the tension-strain relation of a mathematically ideal dynamic rope, namely a plateau in the tension over a range of strains. With a suitable hysteresis loop, they also absorb essentially all the energy from the fall, thus making them an ideal rope in this sense too.

When a quarry is deepened the water table of the exploited geological formation might be reached. A dewatering system is therefore installed so that the quarry activities can continue, possibly impacting the nearby water catchments. In order to recommend an adequate feasibility study before deepening a quarry, we propose two interaction indices between extractive activity and groundwater resources based on hazard and vulnerability parameters used in the assessment of natural hazards. The levels of each index (low, medium, high, very high) correspond to the potential impact of the quarry on the regional hydrogeology.   The first index is based on a discrete choice modelling methodology while the second is relying on an artificial neural network. It is shown that these two complementary approaches (the former being probabilistic while the latter fully deterministic) are able to predict accurately the level of interaction. Their use is finally illustrated by their application on the Boverie quarry and the Tridaine gallery located in Belgium. The indices determine the current interaction level as well as the one resulting from future quarry extensions. The results highlight the very high interaction level of the quarry with the gallery.

Falcón-Barroso	  We present UV-extended E-MILES stellar population synthesis models covering the spectral range 1680-50000A at moderately high resolution. We employ the NGSL space-based stellar library to compute spectra of single-age, single-metallicity stellar populations in the wavelength range from 1680 to 3540A. These models represent a significant improvement in resolution and age/metallicity coverage over previous studies based on earlier space-based libraries. These model spectra were joined with those we computed in the visible using MILES, and other empirical libraries for redder wavelengths. The models span the metallicity range -1.79<[M/H]<+0.26 and ages above 30 Myr, for a suite of IMF types with varying slopes. We focus on the behaviour of colours, spectra and line-strength indices in the UV range as a function of relevant stellar population parameters. Whereas some indices strengthen with increasing age and metallicity, as most metallicity indicators in the visible, other indices peak around 3 Gyr for metal-rich stellar populations, such as Mg at 2800A. Our models provide reasonably good fits to the integrated colours and most line-strengths of the stellar clusters of the Milky-Way and LMC. Our full-spectrum fits in the UV range for a representative set of ETGs of varying mass yield age and metallicity estimates in very good agreement with those obtained in the optical range. The comparison of UV colours and line-strengths of massive ETGs with our models reveals the presence of young stellar components, with ages in the range 0.1-0.5 Gyr and mass fractions 0.1-0.5%, on the top of an old stellar population.

New advancements in control and perception have enabled bipeds to walk on flat and uneven indoor environments. But tasks that require reliable contact with unstructured world surfaces, for example walking on natural rocky terrain, need new perception and control algorithms.   This thesis introduces 3D perception algorithms for contact tasks such as foot placement in rough terrain environments. We introduce a new method to identify and model potential contact areas between the robot's foot and a surface using a set of bounded curved patches. We present a patch parameterization model and an algorithm to fit and perceptually validate patches to 3D point samples. Having defined the environment representation using the patch model, we introduce a way to assemble patches into a spatial map. This map represents a sparse set of local areas potentially appropriate for contact between the robot and the surface. The process of creating such a map includes sparse seed point sampling, neighborhood searching, as well as patch fitting and validation. Various ways of sampling are introduced including a real time bio-inspired system for finding patches statistically similar to those that humans select while traversing rocky trails. These sparse patch algorithms are integrated with a dense volumetric fusion of range data from a moving depth camera, maintaining a dynamic patch map of relevant contact surfaces around a robot in real time. We integrate and test the algorithms as part of a real-time foothold perception system on a mini-biped robot, performing foot placements on rocks.

Shakhnovich	  Mutations in a microbial population can increase the frequency of a genotype not only by increasing its exponential growth rate, but also by decreasing its lag time or adjusting the yield (resource efficiency). The contribution of multiple life-history traits to selection is a critical question for evolutionary biology as we seek to predict the evolutionary fates of mutations. Here we use a model of microbial growth to show there are two distinct components of selection corresponding to the growth and lag phases, while the yield modulates their relative importance. The model predicts rich population dynamics when there are tradeoffs between phases: multiple strains can coexist or exhibit bistability due to frequency-dependent selection, and strains can engage in rock-paper-scissors interactions due to non-transitive selection. We characterize the environmental conditions and patterns of traits necessary to realize these phenomena, which we show to be readily accessible to experiments. Our results provide a theoretical framework for analyzing high-throughput measurements of microbial growth traits, especially interpreting the pleiotropy and correlations between traits across mutants. This work also highlights the need for more comprehensive measurements of selection in simple microbial systems, where the concept of an ordinary fitness landscape breaks down.

Caers	  Scientific curiosity, exploration of georesources and environmental concerns are pushing the geoscientific research community toward subsurface investigations of ever-increasing complexity. This review explores various approaches to formulate and solve inverse problems in ways that effectively integrate geological concepts with geophysical and hydrogeological data. Modern geostatistical simulation algorithms can produce multiple subsurface realizations that are in agreement with conceptual geological models and statistical rock physics can be used to map these realizations into physical properties that are sensed by the geophysical or hydrogeological data. The inverse problem consists of finding one or an ensemble of such subsurface realizations that are in agreement with the data. The most general inversion frameworks are presently often computationally intractable when applied to large-scale problems and it is necessary to better understand the implications of simplifying (1) the conceptual geological model (e.g., using model compression); (2) the physical forward problem (e.g., using proxy models); and (3) the algorithm used to solve the inverse problem (e.g., Markov chain Monte Carlo or local optimization methods) to reach practical and robust solutions given today's computer resources and knowledge. We also highlight the need to not only use geophysical and hydrogeological data for parameter estimation purposes, but also to use them to falsify or corroborate alternative geological scenarios.

Linde|L. Baron|T. Ricci|A. Finizola|A. Revil|F. Muccini|L. Cocchi|C. Carmisciano	  We present the first density model of Stromboli volcano (Aeolian Islands, Italy) obtained by simultaneously inverting land-based (543) and sea-surface (327) relative gravity data. Modern positioning technology, a 1 * 1 m digital elevation model, and a 15 * 15 m bathymetric model made it possible to obtain a detailed 3-D density model through an iteratively reweighted smoothness-constrained least-squares inversion that explained the land-based gravity data to 0.09 mGal and the sea-surface data to 5 mGal. Our inverse formulation avoids introducing any assumptions about density magnitudes. At 125 m depth from the land surface, the inferred mean density of the island is 2380 kg m-3, with corresponding 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles of 2200 and 2530 kg m-3. This density range covers the rock densities of new and previously published samples of Paleostromboli I, Vancori, Neostromboli and San Bartolo lava flows. High-density anomalies in the central and southern part of the island can be related to two main degassing faults crossing the island (N41 and N64) that are interpreted as preferential regions of dyke intrusions. In addition, two low-density anomalies are found in the northeastern part and in the summit area of the island. These anomalies seem to be geographically related with past paroxysmal explosive phreato-magmatic events that have played important roles in the evolution of Stromboli Island by forming the Scari caldera and the Neostromboli crater, respectively. 	
1701.07091v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.07091v1	2017	EUSO-TA fluorescence detector	Francesca Bisconti	  EUSO-TA is a pathfinder experiment for the space based JEM-EUSO mission for the detection of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. EUSO-TA is an high-resolution fluorescence telescope installed in front of the Black Rock Mesa fluorescence detectors of the Telescope Array (TA) experiment, in Utah (USA). At the TA site, a Central Laser Facility is installed for calibration purposes, since it emits laser beams with known energy and geometry. EUSO-TA consists of two 1 $\mbox{m}^2$ Fresnel lenses, with a field of view of 10.5{\deg} that focus the light on a Photo Detector Module (PDM). The PDM currently consists of 36 Hamamatsu Multi-Anode Photo-Multipliers Tubes (MAPMTs) with 64 channels each. Front-end readout is performed by 36 ASICS, with two FPGA boards that send the data to a CPU and a storage system. The detector was installed in February 2015. Tests using the mentioned light sources have been performed and observations of cosmic ray events, as well as those of stars with different magnitude and color index have been done. The data acquisition is triggered by TA fluorescence detectors, although a self-trigger algorithm is currently in the last phases of development and test. With TA, thanks to its large field of view and the surface detectors, the cosmic ray shower events are reconstructed and the parameters are used to perform simulations of the response of EUSO-TA detector using EUSO-Offline. Simulations of the detected events are compared with data and the results are shown in this work.

Whetton	  A pseudo-outcrop visualization is demonstrated for borehole and full-diameter rock core images to augment the ubiquitous unwrapped cylinder view and thereby to assist non-specialist interpreters. The pseudo-outcrop visualization is equivalent to a nonlinear projection of the image from borehole to earth frame of reference that creates a solid volume sliced longitudinally to reveal two or more faces in which the orientations of geological features indicate what is observed in the subsurface. A proxy for grain size is used to modulate the external dimensions of the plot to mimic profiles seen in real outcrops. The volume is created from a mixture of geological boundary elements and texture, the latter being the residue after the sum of boundary elements is subtracted from the original data. In the case of measurements from wireline microresistivity tools, whose circumferential coverage is substantially less than 100%, the missing circumferential data is first inpainted using multiscale directional transforms, which decompose the image into its elemental building structures, before reconstructing the full image. The pseudo-outcrop view enables direct observation of the angular relationships between features and aids visual comparison between borehole and core images, especially for the interested non-specialist.

Butler	  The densities of mid-sized Kuiper belt objects are a key constraint into understanding the assembly of objects in the outer solar system. These objects are critical for understanding the currently unexplained transition from the smallest Kuiper belt objects with densities lower than that of water to the largest objects with significant rock content. Mapping this transition is made difficult by the uncertainties in the diameters of these objects, which maps into an even larger uncertainty in volume and thus density. The substantial collecting area of the Atacama Large Millimeter Array allows significantly more precise measurements of thermal emission from outer solar system objects and could potentially greatly improve the density measurements. Here we use new thermal observations of four objects with satellites to explore the improvements possible with millimeter data. We find that effects due to effective emissivity at millimeter wavelengths make it difficult to use the millimeter data directly to find diameters and thus volumes for these bodies. In addition, we find that when including the effects of model uncertainty, the true uncertainties on the sizes of outer solar system objects measured with radiometry are likely larger than those previously published. Substantial improvement in object sizes will likely require precise occultation measurements. 	
1702.07623v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.07623v1	2017	A step function density profile model for the convective stability of   CO2 geological sequestration	C. Taber Wanstall|Layachi Hadji	  The convective stability associated with carbon sequestration is usually investigated by adopting an unsteady diffusive basic profile. The method of normal modes is not applicable due to the time dependence of the nonlinear base profile. Therefore, the instability is quantified either in terms of critical times at which the boundary layer instability sets in or in terms of long time evolution of initial disturbances. This paper adopts an unstably stratified basic profile having a step function density with top heavy carbon saturated layer (boundary layer) overlying a lighter carbon free layer (ambient brine). The resulting configuration resembles that of the Rayleigh-Taylor problem with buoyancy diffusion at the interface separating the two layers. The discontinuous reference state satisfies the governing system of equations and boundary conditions and pertains to an unstably stratified motionless state. Our model accounts for anisotropy in both diffusion and permeability and chemical reaction between the carbon dioxide rich brine and host mineralogy. We proceed by supposing that the carbon dioxide that has accumulated below the top cap rock forms a layer of carbon saturated brine of some thickness that overlies a carbon-free brine layer. The resulting stratification remains stable until the thickness of the carbon saturated layer is sufficient to induce the fluid to overturn. With this formulation for the reference state, the stability calculations will be in terms of critical boundary layer thickness instead of critical times, although the two formulations are homologous. This approach is tractable by the classical normal mode analysis. Even though it yields only conservative threshold instability conditions, it offers the advantage for an analytically tractable linear and weakly nonlinear studies.

Molaro|Shane Byrne|Jia-Liang Le	  This work investigates the macroscopic thermomechanical behavior of lunar boulders by modeling their response to diurnal thermal forcing. Our results reveal a bimodal, spatiotemporally-complex stress response. During sunrise, stresses occur in the boulders' interiors that are associated with large-scale temperature gradients developed due to overnight cooling. During sunset, stresses occur at the boulders' exteriors due to the cooling and contraction of the surface. Both kinds of stresses are on the order of 10 MPa in 1 m boulders and decrease for smaller diameters, suggesting that larger boulders break down more quickly. Boulders <30 cm exhibit a weak response to thermal forcing, suggesting a threshold below which crack propagation may not occur. Boulders of any size buried by regolith are shielded from thermal breakdown. As boulders increase in size (>1 m), stresses increase to several 10s of MPa as the behavior of their surfaces approaches that of an infinite halfspace. As the thermal wave loses contact with the boulder interior, stresses become limited to the near-surface. This suggests that the survival time of a boulder is not only controlled by the amplitude of induced stress, but also by its diameter as compared to the diurnal skin depth. While stresses on the order of 10 MPa are enough to drive crack propagation in terrestrial environments, crack propagation rates in vacuum are not well constrained. We explore the relationship between boulder size, stress, and the direction of crack propagation, and discuss the implications for the relative breakdown rates and estimated lifetimes of boulders on airless body surfaces.

Usually these processes are greatly affected by gravity, as foam is much lighter than the surrounding liquid. However, the growth of the foam free of gravity effects is still very relevant, as it is connected to manufacturing in space and to the forma- tion of rocks in meteorites and other small celestial bodies. The aim of this research is to investigate experimentally the growth of a bubble cloud growing in a gas-supersaturated liquid in microgravity conditions. Here, we describe the ex- periments carried out in the drop tower of the Center of Ap- plied Space Technology and Microgravity (ZARM). In few words, a foam seed is formed with spark-induced cavitation in carbonated water, whose time evolution is recorded with two high-speed cameras. Our preliminary results shed some light on how the size of the foam ball scales with time, in particular at times much longer than what could be studied in normal conditions, i.e. on the surface of the Earth, where the dynamics of the foam is already dominated by gravity after several milliseconds.

In engineering, entropy production is often used as a measure of usable energy losses. In this study we show that the analysis of the entropy production patterns can help understand the vastly diversified experimental observations of water-rock interactions in natural porous media. We first present a numerical scheme for the analysis of entropy production in dissolving porous media. Our scheme uses a greyscale digital model of natural chalk obtained by X-ray nanotomography. Greyscale models preserve structural heterogeneities with very high fidelity, which is essential for simulating a system dominated by infiltration instability. We focus on the coupling between two types of entropy production: the percolative entropy generated by dissipating the kinetic energy of fluid flow and the reactive entropy that originates from the consumption of chemical free energy. Their temporal patterns pinpoint three stages of microstructural evolution. We then show that the regional mixing deteriorates infiltration instability by reducing local variations in reactant distribution. In addition, we show that the microstructural evolution can be particularly sensitive to the initially present transport heterogeneities when the global flowrate is small. This dependence on flowrate indicates that the need to resolve the structural features of a porous system is greater when the residence time of the fluid is long.

Numerical simulation on the trajectories of interstellar grains captured by Stardust and returned to Earth constrained the $\beta$ ratio for the Stardust samples of interstellar origin. However, recent accurate calculations of radiation pressure cross sections for model dust grains have given conflicting stories in the $\beta$ ratio of interstellar grains. The $\beta$ ratio for model dust grains of so-called "astronomical silicate" in the femto-kilogram range lies below unity, in conflict with $\beta \sim 1$ for the Stardust interstellar grains. Here, I tackle this conundrum by re-evaluating the $\beta$ ratio of interstellar grains on the assumption that the grains are aggregated particles grown by coagulation and composed of amorphous MgSiO$_{3}$ with the inclusion of metallic iron. My model is entirely consistent with the depletion and the correlation of major rock-forming elements in the Local Interstellar Cloud surrounding the Sun and the mineralogical identification of interstellar grains in the Stardust and Cassini missions. I find that my model dust particles fulfill the constraints on the $\beta$ ratio derived from not only the Stardust mission but also the Ulysses and Cassini missions. My results suggest that iron is not incorporated into silicates but exists as metal, contrary to the majority of interstellar dust models available to date.

Perets	  [abridged] In the typical giant-impact scenario for the Moon formation most of the Moon's material originates from the impactor. Any Earth-impactor composition difference should, therefore, correspond to a comparable Earth-Moon composition difference. Analysis of Moon rocks shows a close Earth-Moon composition similarity, posing a challenge for the giant-impact scenario, given that impactors were thought to significantly differ in composition from the planets they impact. Here we use a large set of 140 simulations to show that the composition of impactors could be very similar to that of the planets they impact; in $4.9\%$-$18.2\%$ ($1.9\%$-$6.7\%$) of the cases the resulting composition of the Moon is consistent with the observations of $\Delta^{17}O<15$ ($\Delta^{17}O<6$ ppm). These findings suggest that the Earth-Moon composition similarity could be resolved as to arise from the primordial Earth-impactor composition similarity. Note that although we find the likelihood for the suggested competing model of very high mass-ratio impacts (producing significant Earth-impactor composition mixing) is comparable ($<6.7\%$), this scenario also requires additional fine-tuned requirements of a very fast spinning Earth. Using the same simulations we also explore the composition of giant-impact formed Mars-moons as well as Vesta-like asteroids. We find that the Mars-moon composition difference should be large, but smaller than expected if the moons are captured asteroids. Finally, we find that the left-over planetesimals ('asteroids') in our simulations are frequently scattered far away from their initial positions, thus potentially explaining the mismatch between the current position and composition of the Vesta asteroid.

Zhang	  Ultra-low-background experiments address some of the most important open questions in particle physics, cosmology and astrophysics: the nature of dark matter, whether the neutrino is its own antiparticle, and does the proton decay. These rare event searches require well-understood and minimized backgrounds. Simulations are used to understand backgrounds caused by naturally occurring radioactivity in the rock and in every piece of shielding and detector material used in these experiments. Most important are processes like spontaneous fission and ({\alpha},n) reactions in material close to the detectors that can produce neutrons. A comparison study between two dedicated software packages is detailed. The cross section libraries, neutron yields, and spectra from the Mei-Zhang-Hime and the SOURCES-4A codes are presented. The resultant yields and spectra are used as inputs to direct dark matter detector toy models in GEANT4, to study the impact of their differences on background estimates and fits. Although differences in neutron yield calculations up to 50% were seen, there was no systematic difference between the Mei-Hime-Zhang and SOURCES-4A results. Neutron propagation simulations smooth differences in spectral shape and yield, and both tools were found to meet the broad requirements of the low-background community.

First, multiscale coarse grids are independently constructed for both porous matrix and fracture networks. Then, a map between coarse- and fine-scale is obtained by algebraically computing basis functions with local support. In order to extend the localization assumption to the fractured media, four types of basis functions are investigated: (1) Decoupled-AMS, in which the two media are completely decoupled, (2) Frac-AMS and (3) Rock-AMS, which take into account only one-way transmissibilities, and (4) Coupled-AMS, in which the matrix and fracture interpolators are fully coupled. In order to ensure scalability, the F-AMS framework permits full flexibility in terms of the resolution of the fracture coarse grids. Numerical results are presented for two- and three-dimensional heterogeneous test cases. During these experiments, the performance of F-AMS, paired with ILU(0) as second-stage smoother in a convergent iterative procedure, is studied by monitoring CPU times and convergence rates. Finally, in order to investigate the scalability of the method, an extensive benchmark study is conducted, where a commercial algebraic multigrid solver is used as reference. The results show that, given an appropriate coarsening strategy, F-AMS is insensitive to severe fracture and matrix conductivity contrasts, as well as the length of the fracture networks. Its unique feature is that a fine-scale mass conservative flux field can be reconstructed after any iteration, providing efficient approximate solutions in time-dependent simulations.

Carter|Irene Papiano|Marco Cartacci|Andrea Cicchetti|Raffaella Noschese	  Lucus Planum, extending for a radius of approximately 500 km around 181{\deg} E, 5{\deg} S, is part of the Medusae Fossae Formation (MFF), a set of several discontinuous deposits of fine-grained, friable material straddling across the Martian highland-lowland boundary. The MFF has been variously hypothesized to consist of pyroclastic flows, pyroclastic airfall, paleopolar deposits, or atmospherically-deposited icy dust driven by climate cycles. MARSIS, a low-frequency subsurface-sounding radar carried by ESA's Mars Express, acquired 238 radar swaths across Lucus Planum, providing sufficient coverage for the study of its internal structure and dielectric properties. Subsurface reflections were found only in three areas, marked by a distinctive surface morphology, while the central part of Lucus Planum appears to be made of radar-attenuating material preventing the detection of basal echoes. The bulk dielectric properties of these areas were estimated and compared with those of volcanic rocks and ice-dust mixtures. Previous interpretations that east Lucus Planum and the deposits on the north-western flanks of Apollinaris Patera consist of high-porosity pyroclastic material are strongly supported by the new results. The north-western part of Lucus Planum is likely to be much less porous, although interpretations about the nature of the subsurface materials are not conclusive. The exact origin of the deposits cannot be constrained by radar data alone, but our results for east Lucus Planum are consistent with an overall pyroclastic origin, likely linked to Tharsis Hesperian and Amazonian activity.

By carefully controlling the depositions on twelve kinds of substrates using pulsed laser deposition technique, high quality single crystalline FeSe samples were fabricated with full width of half maximum 0.515? in the rocking curve and clear four-fold symmetry in phi-scan from x-ray diractions. The films have a maximum Tc 15 K on the CaF2 substrate and do not show obvious decay in the air for more than half a year. Slightly tuning the stoichiometry of the FeSe targets, the Tc becomes adjustable from 15 to < 2 K with quite narrow transition widths less than 2 K, and shows a positive relation with the out-of-plane (c-axis) lattice parameter of the films. However, there is no clear relation between the Tc and the surface atomic distance of the substrates. By reducing the thickness of the films, the Tc decreases and fades away in samples of less than 10 nm, suggesting that the strain effect is not responsible for the enhancement of Tc in our experiments.

Carvalho Jr|Kévin Payet|Andrés Romero-Wolf|Harm Schoorlemmer|Enrique Zas	  There has been a recent surge in interest in the detection of $\tau$ lepton-induced air showers from detectors at altitude. When a $\tau$ neutrino ($\nu_\tau$) enters the Earth it produces $\tau$ leptons as a result of nuclear charged current interactions. In some cases, this process results in a $\tau$ lepton exiting the surface of the Earth, which can subsequently decay in the atmosphere and produce an extensive air shower. These upward-going air showers can be detected via fluorescence, optical Cherenkov, or geomagnetic radio emission. Several experiments have been proposed to detect these signals. We present a comprehensive simulation of the production of $\tau$ leptons by $\nu_\tau$'s propagating through Earth to aid the design of future experiments. These simulations for $\nu_\tau$'s and leptons in the energy range from $10^{15}$ eV to $10^{21}$ eV treat the full range of incidence angles from Earth-skimming to diametrically-traversing. Propagation of $\nu_\tau$'s and leptons include the effects of rock and an ocean or ice layer of various thicknesses. The interaction models include $\nu_\tau$ regeneration and account for uncertainties in the Standard Model neutrino cross-section and in the photo-nuclear contribution to the $\tau$ energy loss rate. 	
1707.03266v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.03266v1	2017	A region-growing approach for automatic outcrop fracture extraction from   a three-dimensional point cloud	Xin Wang|Lejun Zou|Xiaohua Shen|Yupeng Ren|Yi Qin	  Conventional manual surveys of rock mass fractures usually require large amounts of time and labor; yet, they provide a relatively small set of data that cannot be considered representative of the study region. Terrestrial laser scanners are increasingly used for fracture surveys because they can efficiently acquire large area, high-resolution, three-dimensional (3D) point clouds from outcrops. However, extracting fractures and other planar surfaces from 3D outcrop point clouds is still a challenging task. No method has been reported that can be used to automatically extract the full extent of every individual fracture from a 3D outcrop point cloud. In this study, we propose a method using a region-growing approach to address this problem; the method also estimates the orientation of each fracture. In this method, criteria based on the local surface normal and curvature of the point cloud are used to initiate and control the growth of the fracture region. In tests using outcrop point cloud data, the proposed method identified and extracted the full extent of individual fractures with high accuracy. Compared with manually acquired field survey data, our method obtained better-quality fracture data, thereby demonstrating the high potential utility of the proposed method.

Fu|Pauli Kehayias|David Le Sage|Eduardo A. Lima|Benjamin P. Weiss|Ronald L. Walsworth	  Remanent magnetization in geological samples may record the past intensity and direction of planetary magnetic fields. Traditionally, this magnetization is analyzed through measurements of the net magnetic moment of bulk millimeter to centimeter sized samples. However, geological samples are often mineralogically and texturally heterogeneous at submillimeter scales, with only a fraction of the ferromagnetic grains carrying the remanent magnetization of interest. Therefore, characterizing this magnetization in such cases requires a technique capable of imaging magnetic fields at fine spatial scales and with high sensitivity. To address this challenge, we developed a new instrument, based on nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, which enables direct imaging of magnetic fields due to both remanent and induced magnetization, as well as optical imaging, of room-temperature geological samples with spatial resolution approaching the optical diffraction limit. We describe the operating principles of this device, which we call the quantum diamond microscope (QDM), and report its optimized image-area-normalized magnetic field sensitivity (20 uT.um/Hz^1/2), spatial resolution (5 um), and field of view (4 mm), as well as trade-offs between these parameters. We also perform an absolute magnetic field calibration for the device in different modes of operation, including three-axis (vector) and single-axis (projective) magnetic field imaging. Finally, we use the QDM to obtain magnetic images of several terrestrial and meteoritic rock samples, demonstrating its ability to resolve spatially distinct populations of ferromagnetic carriers.

The Moon and Earth are chemically and isotopically very similar. However, the Moon is highly depleted in volatile elements and the origin of this depletion is still debated. We present gallium isotopic and elemental measurements in a large set of lunar samples to constrain the origin of this volatile depletion. We show that while Ga has a geochemical behavior different from zinc, both elements show a systematic enrichment in the heavier isotopes in lunar mare basalts and Mg-suite rocks compared to the silicate Earth, pointing to a global-scale depletion event. On the other hand, the ferroan anorthosites are isotopically heterogeneous, suggesting a secondary distribution of Ga at the surface of the Moon by volatilization and condensation. The isotopic difference of Ga between Earth and the Moon and the isotopic heterogeneity of the crustal ferroan anorthosites suggest that the volatile depletion occurred following the giant impact and during the lunar magma ocean phase. These results point toward a Moon that has lost its volatile elements during a whole-scale evaporation event and that is now relatively dry compared to Earth.

It may have experienced partial melting and differentiation. We constrain Dembowska's thermophysical properties, e.g., thermal inertia, roughness fraction, geometric albedo and effective diameter within 3$\sigma$ uncertainty of $\Gamma=20^{+12}_{-7}\rm~Jm^{-2}s^{-0.5}K^{-1}$, $f_{\rm r}=0.25^{+0.60}_{-0.25}$, $p_{\rm v}=0.309^{+0.026}_{-0.038}$, and $D_{\rm eff}=155.8^{+7.5}_{-6.2}\rm~km$, by utilizing the Advanced Thermophysical Model (ATPM) to analyse four sets of thermal infrared data obtained by IRAS, AKARI, WISE and Subaru/COMICS at different epochs. In addition, by modeling the thermal lightcurve observed by WISE, we obtain the rotational phases of each dataset. These rotationally resolved data do not reveal significant variations of thermal inertia and roughness across the surface, indicating the surface of Dembowska should be covered by a dusty regolith layer with few rocks or boulders. Besides, the low thermal inertia of Dembowska show no significant difference with other asteroids larger than 100 km, indicating the dynamical lives of these large asteroids are long enough to make the surface to have sufficiently low thermal inertia. Furthermore, based on the derived surface thermophysical properties, as well as the known orbital and rotational parameters, we can simulate Dembowska's surface and subsurface temperature throughout its orbital period. The surface temperature varies from $\sim40$ K to $\sim220$ K, showing significant seasonal variation, whereas the subsurface temperature achieves equilibrium temperature about $120\sim160$ K below $30\sim50$ cm depth.

S. Aguado	  We present a detailed study of the Na I line strength index centered in the $K$-band at $22100$, {\AA} (NaI2.21 hereafter) relying on different samples of early-type galaxies. Consistent with previous studies, we find that the observed line strength indices cannot be fit by state-of-art scaled-solar stellar population models, even using our newly developed models in the NIR. The models clearly underestimate the large NaI2.21 values measured for most early-type galaxies. However, we develop a Na-enhanced version of our newly developed models in the NIR, which - together with the effect of a bottom-heavy initial mass function - yield NaI2.21 indices in the range of the observations. Therefore, we suggest a scenario in which the combined effect of [Na/Fe] enhancement and a bottom-heavy initial mass function are mainly responsible for the large NaI2.21 indices observed for most early-type galaxies. To a smaller extent, also [C/Fe] enhancement might contribute to the large observed NaI2.21 values. 	
1709.00950v9	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.00950v9	2017	The Difference between Physics and Biology: The Key Role of Biomolecules	George Ellis|Jonathan Kopel	  Physical emergence - crystals, rocks, sandpiles, turbulent eddies, planets, stars - is fundamentally different from biological emergence - amoeba, cells, mice, humans - even though the latter is based in the former. This paper points out that the essential difference is that causation in biological systems has a logical nature at each level of the hierarchy of emergence, from the biomolecular level up. The key link between physics and life enabling this to happen is provided by bio-molecules, such as voltage gated ion channels, which enable logic to emerge from the underlying physics and hence enable cell processes to take place in general, and in neurons in particular. They can only have come into being via the contextually dependent processes of natural selection, which selects them for their biological function. A further major difference is between life in general and intelligent life. We characterise intelligent organisms as being engaged in deductive causation, which enables them to transcend the physical limitations of their bodies through the power of abstract thought, prediction, and planning. Ultimately this is enabled by the biomolecules that underlie the propsgation of action potentials in neuronal axons in the brain.

Applying the polarimetric slope-albedo empirical law, we derived a geometric albedo of $p_\mathrm{V}$=0.25$\pm$0.02, which is in agreement with that of Q-type taxonomic asteroids. $\alpha_\mathrm{max}$ is unambiguously larger than that of Mercury, the Moon, and another near-Earth S-type asteroid (4179) Toutatis but consistent with laboratory samples with hundreds of microns in size. The combination of the maximum polarization degree and the geometric albedo is in accordance with terrestrial rocks with a diameter of several hundreds of micrometers. The photometric function indicates a large macroscopic roughness. We hypothesize that the unique environment (i.e., the small perihelion distance $q$=0.187 au and a short rotational period of $T_\mathrm{rot}$=2.27 hours) may be attributed to the paucity of small grains on the surface, as indicated on (3200) Phaethon.

Segura.|V. Muñoz-Sanjosé	  The appearance of segregated wurtzite Mg$_x$Zn$_{1-x}$O with low Mg content in thin films with $x>0.3$ affected by phase separation, cannot be reliably probed with crystallographic techniques owing to its embedded nanocrystalline configuration. Here we show a high-pressure approach which exploits the distinctive behaviors under pressure of wurtzite Mg$_x$Zn$_{1-x}$O thin films with different Mg contents to unveil phase segregation for $x>0.3$. By using ambient conditions photoluminescence (PL), and with optical absorption and PL under high pressure for $x=0.3$ we show that the appearance of a segregated wurtzite phase with a magnesium content of x $\sim$ 0.1 is inherent to the wurtzite and rock-salt phase separation. We also show that the presence of segregated wurtzite phase in oversaturated thin films phase is responsible for the low-energy absorption tail observed above $x=0.3$ in our Mg$_x$Zn$_{1-x}$O thin films. Our study has also allowed us to extend the concentration dependence of the pressure coefficient of the band gap from the previous limit of $x$ = 0.13 to $x \approx 0.3$ obtaining d$E_g$/d$P$ = 29 meV/GPa for wurtzite with $x \approx 0.3$ and 25 meV/GPa for the segregated $x\approx 0.09$ wurtzite phase.

First, music is an art of time, necessitating a temporal model. Second, music is usually composed of multiple instruments/tracks with their own temporal dynamics, but collectively they unfold over time interdependently. Lastly, musical notes are often grouped into chords, arpeggios or melodies in polyphonic music, and thereby introducing a chronological ordering of notes is not naturally suitable. In this paper, we propose three models for symbolic multi-track music generation under the framework of generative adversarial networks (GANs). The three models, which differ in the underlying assumptions and accordingly the network architectures, are referred to as the jamming model, the composer model and the hybrid model. We trained the proposed models on a dataset of over one hundred thousand bars of rock music and applied them to generate piano-rolls of five tracks: bass, drums, guitar, piano and strings. A few intra-track and inter-track objective metrics are also proposed to evaluate the generative results, in addition to a subjective user study. We show that our models can generate coherent music of four bars right from scratch (i.e. without human inputs). We also extend our models to human-AI cooperative music generation: given a specific track composed by human, we can generate four additional tracks to accompany it. All code, the dataset and the rendered audio samples are available at https://salu133445.github.io/musegan/ .

Pasternak|Jean-Paul Itié|Dániel G. Merkel	  Structural, magnetic and electrical-transport properties of {\alpha}-LiFeO2, crystallizing in the rock salt structure with random distribution of Li and Fe ions, have been studied by synchrotron X-ray diffraction, 57Fe M\"ossbauer spectroscopy and electrical resistance measurements at pressures up to 100 GPa using diamond anvil cells. It was found that the crystal structure is stable at least to 82 GPa, though a significant change in compressibility has been observed above 50 GPa. The changes in the structural properties are found to be on a par with a sluggish Fe3+ high- to low-spin (HS-LS) transition (S=5/2 to S=1/2) starting at 50 GPa and not completed even at ~100 GPa. The HS-LS transition is accompanied by an appreciable resistance decrease remaining a semiconductor up to 115 GPa and is not expected to be metallic even at about 200 GPa. The observed feature of the pressure-induced HS-LS transition is not an ordinary behavior of ferric oxides at high pressures. The effect of Fe3+ nearest and next nearest neighbors on the features of the spin crossover is discussed.

Kite	  Chloride-bearing deposits on Mars record high-elevation lakes during the waning stages of Mars' wet era (mid-Noachian to late Hesperian). The water source pathways, seasonality, salinity, depth, lifetime, and paleoclimatic drivers of these widespread lakes are all unknown. Here we combine reaction-transport modeling, orbital spectroscopy, and new volume estimates from high-resolution digital terrain models, in order to constrain the hydrologic boundary conditions for forming the chlorides. Considering a T = 0 degrees C system, we find: (1) individual lakes were >100 m deep and lasted decades or longer; (2) if volcanic degassing was the source of chlorine, then the water-to-rock ratio or the total water volume were probably low, consistent with brief excursions above the melting point and/or arid climate; (3) if the chlorine source was igneous chlorapatite, then Cl-leaching events would require a (cumulative) time of >10 yr at the melting point; (4) Cl masses, divided by catchment area, give column densities 0.1 - 50 kg Cl/m^2, and these column densities bracket the expected chlorapatite-Cl content for a seasonally-warm active layer. Deep groundwater was not required. Taken together, our results are consistent with Mars having a usually cold, horizontally segregated hydrosphere by the time chlorides formed.

Sanchez|Patrick McDaniel|Corey Skinner|Nima Fathi|Steven Frank|Michael Patterson	  The US Department of Energy decided in 2000 to treat its sodium-bonded spent nuclear fuel, produced for experiments on breeder reactors, with an electrochemical process. The metallic waste produced is to be cast into ingots and the salt waste further processed to form a ceramic waste form for disposal in a mined repository. However, alternative disposal pathways for metallic and salt waste streams are being investigated that may reduce the processing complexity. As summarized here, performance assessments analyzing the direct disposal the salt waste demonstrate that both mined repositories in salt and deep boreholes in basement crystalline rock can easily accommodate the salt waste. Also summarized here is an analysis of the feasibility of transporting the salt waste in a proposed vessel. The vessel is viable for transport to and disposal in a generic mined repository in salt or deep borehole but a portion of the salt waste would need to be diluted for disposal in the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant. The generally positive results continue to demonstrate the feasibility of direct disposal of salt waste after electrochemical processing of spent nuclear fuel.

Wayne Springer	  The HAWC (High Altitude Water Cherenkov) gamma ray observatory is able to observe muons with nearly horizontal trajectories. HAWC is located at an altitude of 4100 meters a.s.l. on the Sierra Negra volcano in Mexico. The HAWC detector is composed of 300 water tanks, each 7.3 m in diameter and 4.5 m tall, densely packed over a physical area of 22,000 m$^{2}$. Previous and current experiments have observed high zenith angle (near horizontal) muons at or near sea level. HAWC operates as a hodoscope able to observe multi-TeV muons at zenith angles greater than 75 degrees. This is the first experiment to measure near horizontal muons at high altitude and with large ($\geq$ 10 m) separations for multiple muons. These muons are distinguishable from extensive air showers by observing near horizontal particles propagating with the speed of light. The proximity of Sierra Negra and Pico de Orizaba volcanoes provides an additional measurement of muons with rock overburdens of several km water equivalent. We will present the angular distribution and rate at which HAWC observes these muon events

Ehrhardt|Jennifer Rasch|Rafael Reisenhofer|Carola-Bibiane Schönlieb	  Hyperspectral imaging is a cutting-edge type of remote sensing used for mapping vegetation properties, rock minerals and other materials. A major drawback of hyperspectral imaging devices is their intrinsic low spatial resolution. In this paper, we propose a method for increasing the spatial resolution of a hyperspectral image by fusing it with an image of higher spatial resolution that was obtained with a different imaging modality. This is accomplished by solving a variational problem in which the regularization functional is the directional total variation. To accommodate for possible mis-registrations between the two images, we consider a non-convex blind super-resolution problem where both a fused image and the corresponding convolution kernel are estimated. Using this approach, our model can realign the given images if needed. Our experimental results indicate that the non-convexity is negligible in practice and that reliable solutions can be computed using a variety of different optimization algorithms. Numerical results on real remote sensing data from plant sciences and urban monitoring show the potential of the proposed method and suggests that it is robust with respect to the regularization parameters, mis-registration and the shape of the kernel.

Design of efficient strategies for safe, long-term storage requires the capability to efficiently simulate processes taking place on very different temporal and spatial scales. The physical laws describing CO2 storage are the same as for hydrocarbon recovery, but the characteristic spatial and temporal scales are quite different. Petroleum reservoirs seldom extend more than tens of kilometers and have operational horizons spanning decades. Injected CO2 needs to be safely contained for hundreds or thousands of years, during which it can migrate hundreds or thousands of kilometers. Because of the vast scales involved, conventional 3D reservoir simulation quickly becomes computationally unfeasible. Large density difference between injected CO2 and resident brine means that vertical segregation will take place relatively quickly, and depth-integrated models assuming vertical equilibrium (VE) often represents a better strategy to simulate long-term migration of CO2 in large-scale aquifer systems. VE models have primarily been formulated for relatively simple rock formations and have not been coupled to 3D simulation in a uniform way. In particular, known VE simulations have not been applied to models of realistic geology in which many flow compartments may exist in-between impermeable layers. In this paper, we generalize the concept of VE models, formulated in terms of well-proven reservoir simulation technology, to complex aquifer systems with multiple layers and regions. We also introduce novel formulations for multi-layered VE models by use of both direct spill and diffuse leakage between individual layers. This new layered 3D model is then coupled to a state-of-the-art, 3D black-oil type model.

Alpak|Beatrice Riviere	  We consider an energy-based boundary condition to impose an equilibrium wetting angle for the Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes phase-field model on voxel-set-type computational domains. These domains typically stem from the micro-CT imaging of porous rock and approximate a (on {\mu}m scale) smooth domain with a certain resolution. Planar surfaces that are perpendicular to the main axes are naturally approximated by a layer of voxels. However, planar surfaces in any other directions and curved surfaces yield a jagged/rough surface approximation by voxels. For the standard Cahn-Hilliard formulation, where the contact angle between the diffuse interface and the domain boundary (fluid-solid interface/wall) is 90 degrees, jagged surfaces have no impact on the contact angle. However, a prescribed contact angle smaller or larger than 90 degrees on jagged voxel surfaces is amplified in either direction. As a remedy, we propose the introduction of surface energy correction factors for each fluid-solid voxel face that counterbalance the difference of the voxel-set surface area with the underlying smooth one. The discretization of the model equations is performed with the discontinuous Galerkin method, however, the presented semi-analytical approach of correcting the surface energy is equally applicable to other direct numerical methods such as finite elements, finite volumes, or finite differences, since the correction factors appear in the strong formulation of the model.

The Boltzmann model equation is solved by the discrete velocity method with an iterative scheme. The multi-level MPI/OpenMP parallelization is implemented with the aim to efficiently utilise the computational resources to allow direct simulation of rarefied gas flows in porous media based on digital rock images for the first time. The multi-level parallel approach is analyzed in details confirming its better performance than the commonly-used MPI processing alone for an iterative scheme. With high communication efficiency and appropriate load balancing among CPU processes, parallel efficiency of 94% is achieved for 1536 cores in the 2D simulations, and 81% for 12288 cores in the 3D simulations. While decomposition in the spatial space does not affect the simulation results, one additional benefit of this approach is that the number of subdomains can be kept minimal to avoid deterioration of the convergence rate of the iteration process. This multi-level parallel approach can be readily extended to solve other Boltzmann model equations.

Smye	  Models of thermal evolution, crustal production, and CO$_2$ cycling are used to constrain the prospects for habitability of rocky planets, with Earth-like size and composition, in the stagnant lid regime. Specifically, we determine the conditions under which such planets can maintain rates of CO$_2$ degassing large enough to prevent global surface glaciation, but small enough so as not to exceed the upper limit on weathering rates provided by the supply of fresh rock, a situation which would lead to runaway atmospheric CO$_2$ accumulation and an inhospitably hot climate. The models show that stagnant lid planets with initial radiogenic heating rates of 100-250 TW, and with total CO$_2$ budgets ranging from $\sim 10^{-2} -1$ times Earth's estimated CO$_2$ budget, can maintain volcanic outgassing rates suitable for habitability for $\approx 1-5$ Gyrs; larger CO$_2$ budgets result in uninhabitably hot climates, while smaller budgets result in global glaciation. High radiogenic heat production rates favor habitability by sustaining volcanism and CO$_2$ outgassing longer. Thus, the results suggest that plate tectonics may not be required for establishing a long-term carbon cycle and maintaining a stable, habitable climate. The model is necessarily highly simplified, as the uncertainties with exoplanet thermal evolution and outgassing are large. Nevertheless, the results provide some first order guidance for future exoplanet missions, by predicting the age at which habitability becomes unlikely for a stagnant lid planet as a function of initial radiogenic heat budget. This prediction is powerful because both planet heat budget and age can potentially be constrained from stellar observations.

Wipperfurth|Marica Baldoncini|William F. McDonough|Fabio Mantovani	  Regional characterization of the continental crust has classically been performed through either geologic mapping, geochemical sampling, or geophysical surveys. Rarely are these techniques fully integrated, due to limits of data coverage, quality, and/or incompatible datasets. We combine geologic observations, geochemical sampling, and geophysical surveys to create a coherent 3-D geologic model of a 50 x 50 km upper crustal region surrounding the SNOLAB underground physics laboratory in Canada, which includes the Southern Province, the Superior Province, the Sudbury Structure and the Grenville Front Tectonic Zone. Nine representative aggregate units of exposed lithologies are geologically characterized, geophysically constrained, and probed with 109 rock samples supported by compiled geochemical databases. A detailed study of the lognormal distributions of U and Th abundances and of their correlation permits a bivariate analysis for a robust treatment of the uncertainties. A downloadable 3D numerical model of U and Th distribution defines an average heat production of 1.5$^{+1.4}_{-0.7}$$\mu$W/m$^{3}$, and predicts a contribution of 7.7$^{+7.7}_{-3.0}$TNU (a Terrestrial Neutrino Unit is one geoneutrino event per 10$^{32}$ target protons per year) out of a crustal geoneutrino signal of 31.1$^{+8.0}_{-4.5}$TNU. The relatively high local crust geoneutrino signal together with its large variability strongly restrict the SNO+ capability of experimentally discriminating among BSE compositional models of the mantle. Future work to constrain the crustal heat production and the geoneutrino signal at SNO+ will be inefficient without more detailed geophysical characterization of the 3D structure of the heterogeneous Huronian Supergroup, which contributes the largest uncertainty to the calculation.

Raptis|Virginia Strati|Fabio Mantovani	  $^{222}$Rn is a noble radioactive gas produced along the $^{238}$U decay chain, which is present in the majority of soils and rocks. As $^{222}$Rn is the most relevant source of natural background radiation, understanding its distribution in the environment is of great concern for investigating the health impacts of low-level radioactivity and for supporting regulation of human exposure to ionizing radiation in modern society. At the same time, $^{222}$Rn is a widespread atmospheric tracer whose spatial distribution is generally used as a proxy for climate and pollution studies. Airborne gamma-ray spectroscopy (AGRS) always treated $^{222}$Rn as a source of background since it affects the indirect estimate of equivalent $^{238}$U concentration. In this work the AGRS method is used for the first time for quantifying the presence of $^{222}$Rn in the atmosphere and assessing its vertical profile. High statistics radiometric data acquired during an offshore survey are fitted as a superposition of a constant component due to the experimental setup background radioactivity plus a height dependent contribution due to cosmic radiation and atmospheric $^{222}$Rn. The refined statistical analysis provides not only a conclusive evidence of AGRS $^{222}$Rn detection but also a (0.96 $\pm$ 0.07) Bq/m$^{3}$ $^{222}$Rn concentration and a (1318 $\pm$ 22) m atmospheric layer depth fully compatible with literature data.

Mitchell|Christian Rieck|Christian Scheffer|Arne Schmidt|James R. Zuber	  We consider dynamic loading and unloading problems for heavy geometric objects. The challenge is to maintain balanced configurations at all times: minimize the maximal motion of the overall center of gravity. While this problem has been studied from an algorithmic point of view, previous work only focuses on balancing the final center of gravity; we give a variety of results for computing balanced loading and unloading schemes that minimize the maximal motion of the center of gravity during the entire process. In particular, we consider the one-dimensional case and distinguish between loading and unloading. In the unloading variant, the positions of the intervals are given, and we search for an optimal unloading order of the intervals. We prove that the unloading variant is NP-complete and give a 2.7-approximation algorithm. In the loading variant, we have to compute both the positions of the intervals and their loading order. We give optimal approaches for several variants that model different loading scenarios that may arise, e.g., in the loading of a transport ship with containers.

Michaels	  Most of Mars' ancient sedimentary rocks by volume are in wind-eroded sedimentary mounds, but the connections between mound form and wind erosion are unclear. We perform mesoscale simulations of different crater and mound morphologies to understand the formation of sedimentary mounds. As crater depth increases, slope winds produce increased erosion near the base of the crater wall, forming mounds. Peak erosion rates occur when the crater depth is ~2 km. Mound evolution depends on the size of the host crater. In smaller craters mounds preferentially erode at the top, becoming more squat, while in larger craters mounds become steeper-sided. This agrees with observations where smaller craters tend to have proportionally shorter mounds, and larger craters have mounds encircled by moats. If a large-scale sedimentary layer blankets a crater, then as the layer recedes across the crater it will erode more towards the edges of the crater, resulting in a crescent-shaped moat. When a 160 km diameter mound-hosting crater is subject to a prevailing wind, the surface wind stress is stronger on the leeward side than on the windward side. This results in the center of the mound appearing to `march upwind' over time, and forming a `bat-wing' shape, as is observed for Mt. Sharp in Gale crater. 	
1801.09148v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.09148v1	2018	Deep Water Cycling and Delayed Onset Cooling of the Earth	Johnny Seales|Adrian Lenardic	  Changes that occur on our planet can be tracked back to one of two energy sources: the sun and the Earth's internal energy. The motion of tectonic plates, volcanism, mountain building and the reshaping of our planet's surface over geologic time depend on the Earth's internal energy. Tectonic activity is driven by internal energy and affects the rate at which energy is tapped, i.e., the cooling rate of our planet. Petrologic data indicate that cooling did not occur at a constant rate over geologic history. Interior cooling was mild until ~2.5 billion years ago and then increased (Figure 1). As the Earth cools, it cycles water between its rocky interior (crust and mantle) and its surface. Water affects the viscosity of mantle rock, which affects the pace of tectonics and, by association, Earth cooling. We present suites of thermal-tectonic history models, coupled to deep water cycling, to show that the petrologically constrained change in the Earth's cooling rate can be accounted for by variations in deep water cycling over geologic time. The change in cooling rate does not require a change in the global tectonic mode of the Earth. It can be accounted for by a change in the balance of water cycling between the Earth's interior and its surface envelopes. The nature and timing of that water cycling change can be correlated to a change in the nature of continental crust and an associated rise of atmospheric oxygen. The prediction that the rise of oxygen should then be correlated, in time, to the change in the Earth's cooling rate is consistent with data constraints.

Stevenson	  Low-mass low-density planets discovered by Kepler in the super-Earth mass regime typically have large radii for their inferred masses, implying the presence of H$_2$-He atmospheres. These planets are vulnerable to atmospheric mass loss due to heating by the parent star's XUV flux. Models coupling atmospheric mass loss with thermal evolution predicted a bimodal distribution of planetary radii, which has gained observational support. However, a key component that has been ignored in previous studies is the dissolution of these gases into the molten core of rock and iron that constitute most of their mass. Such planets have high temperatures ($>$2000 K) and pressures ($\sim$kbars) at the core-envelope boundary, ensuring a molten surface and a subsurface reservoir of hydrogen that can be 5-10 times larger than the atmosphere. This study bridges this gap by coupling the thermal evolution of the planet and the mass loss of the atmosphere with the thermodynamic equilibrium between the dissolved H$_2$ and the atmospheric H$_2$ (Henry's law). Dissolution in the interior allows a planet to build a larger hydrogen repository during the planet formation stage. We show that the dissolved hydrogen outgasses to buffer atmospheric mass loss. The slow cooling of the planet also leads to outgassing because solubility decreases with decreasing temperature. Dissolution of hydrogen in the interior therefore increases the atmosphere retention ability of super-Earths. The study highlights the importance of including the temperature- and pressure-dependent solubility of gases in magma oceans and coupling outgassing to planetary evolution models.

For example, a system might tell when a train driver is incapacitated by a medical event, and assist in adopting a safe recovery strategy. These applications are demanding, because they require accurate detection of rare anomalies that may be seen only at runtime. Such a setting causes supervised methods to perform poorly. We describe a method for detecting an anomalous face image that meets these requirements. We construct a feature vector that reliably has large entries for anomalous images, then use various simple unsupervised methods to score the image based on the feature. Obvious constructions (autoencoder codes; autoencoder residuals) are defeated by a 'peeking' behavior in autoencoders. Our feature construction removes rectangular patches from the image, predicts the likely content of the patch conditioned on the rest of the image using a specially trained autoencoder, then compares the result to the image. High scores suggest that the patch was difficult for an autoencoder to predict, and so is likely anomalous. We demonstrate that our method can identify real anomalous face images in pools of typical images, taken from celeb-A, that is much larger than usual in state-of-the-art experiments. A control experiment based on our method with another set of normal celebrity images - a 'typical set', but nonceleb-A are not identified as anomalous; confirms this is not due to special properties of celeb-A.

Etna	Marisa Giuffrida|Francois Holtz|Francesco Vetere|Marco Viccaro	  Changes in magmatic assemblages and crystal stability as a response of CO2 flushing in basaltic systems have been never directly addressed experimentally, making the role of CO2 in magma dynamics still controversial and object of scientific debate. We conducted a series of experiments to understand the response of magmas from Etna volcano to CO2 flushing. We performed a first experiment at 300 MPa to synthesize a starting material composed of crystals of some hundreds of m and melt pools. This material is representative of an initial magmatic assemblage composed of plagioclase, clinopyroxene and a water undersaturated melt. In a second step, the initial assemblage was equilibrated at 300 and 100 MPa with fluids having different XCO2fl . Our experiments demonstrate that flushing basaltic systems with fluids may drastically affect crystal textures and phase equilibria depending on the amount of H2O and CO2 in the fluid phase. Since texture and crystal proportions are among the most important parameters governing the rheology of magmas, fluid flushing will also influence magma ascent to the Earths surface. The experimental results open new perspectives to decipher the textural and compositional record of minerals observed in volcanic rocks from Mt. Etna, and at the same time offer the basis for interpreting the information preserved in minerals from other basaltic volcanoes erupting magmas enriched in CO2.

These cave-like openings are theorized to be remnants of lava-tubes and their interior maybe in pristine conditions. These locations may have well preserved geological records of the Moon and Mars, including evidence of past water flow and habitability. Exploration of these caves using wheeled rovers remains a daunting challenge. These caves are likely to have entrances with caved-in ceilings much like the lava-tubes of Arizona and New Mexico. Thus, the entrances are nearly impossible to traverse even for experienced human hikers. Our approach is to utilize the SphereX robot, a 3 kg, 30 cm diameter robot with computer hardware and sensors of a smartphone attached to rocket thrusters. Each SphereX robot can hop, roll or fly short distances in low gravity, airless or low-pressure environments. Several SphereX robots maybe deployed to minimize single-point failure and exploit cooperative behaviors to traverse the cave. There are some important challenges for navigation and path planning in these cave environments. Localization systems such as GPS are not available nor are they easy to install due to the signal blockage from the rocks. These caves are too dark and too large for conventional sensor such as cameras and miniature laser sensors to perform detailed mapping and navigation. In this paper, we identify new techniques to map these caves by performing localized, cooperative mapping and navigation.

Larson	  Accurate simulation of fluid flow and transport in fractured porous media is a key challenge in subsurface reservoir engineering. Due to the high ratio between its length and width, fractures can be modeled as lower dimensional interfaces embedded in the porous rock. We apply a recently developed embedded finite element method (EFEM) for the Darcy problem. This method allows for general fracture geometry, and the fractures may cut the finite element mesh arbitrarily. We present here a velocity model for EFEM and couple the Darcy problem to a transport problem for a passive solute. The main novelties of this work is a locally conservative velocity approximation derived from the EFEM solution, and the development of a lowest order upwind finite volume method for the transport problem. This numerical model is compatible with EFEM in the sense that the same computational mesh may be applied, so that we retain the same flexibility with respect to fracture geometry and meshing. Hence, our coupled solution strategy represents a simple approach in terms of formulation, implementation and meshing. We demonstrate our model by some numerical examples on both synthetic and realistic problems, including a benchmark study for single-phase flow. Despite the simplicity of the method, the results are promising.

Traces of   UHECR neutrino tau	Daniele Fargion|Andrea Aiello|Roberto Conversano	  Ultra High Energy (UHE) Tau neutrino may lead to a very peculiar imprint in future underground $Km^3$ detectors in water and ice as well as in air: rarest secondary tau tracks and decay which may exceed the muon ones. Indeed Bremsstrahlung at high energy lead to longer tracks for heavier leptons. Radiation lenght grows nearly with the square of the lepton mass. Indeed electrons are too light and their trace in matter (liquid or rock) is negligible (tens of centimeters); muons are much better observed, while tau are too short life time and too short range to be found. However, because relativistic time expansion, UHE tau traces in matter, above $10^{17} eV$, are relativistically boosted overcoming the corresponding muon tracks, already bounded by bremsstrahlung logarithmic regime. The tau crossing for Kms in water or ice may be confused with common muon tracks; their tau decay may be misunderstood as muonic catastrophic bremsstrahlung interactions. To economize UHE tau discovery, we suggest to look the tau decay in air into the deep valleys mountains, like Canyons or deep in excavation mines where horizontal air showers induce fluorescent or Cerenkov lights. The mountain valley width screens from horizontal secondary muons. The valley height increases the solid angle view. The horizontal air Kms-size gap offer a strong discriminator to filter UHE muons against tau. Tens event a year at PeV (W resonance peak) energies in $Km^3$ excavation gap should be observable . Hunting air shower in the night toward high mountains in Canyons or in a deep excavation may be the best and cheapest way to discover UHE neutrinos, either born by electron anti neutrino scattering on electrons at PeV energies, or by direct tau neutrino possibly relic of muonic flavour oscillation even at EeV energies. 	
0005048v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0005048v1	2000	Timescales of disk evolution and planet formation	W. Brandner|H. Zinnecker|J. M. Alcala|F. Allard|E. Covino|S. Frink|R. Kohler|M. Kunkel|A. Moneti|A. Schweitzer	  We present high-spatial resolution HST and adaptive optics observations, and high-sensitivity ISO (ISOCAM & ISOPHOT) observations of a sample of X-ray selected weak-line (WTTS) and post (PTTS) T Tauri stars located in the nearby Chamaeleon T and Scorpius-Centaurus OB associations. HST/NICMOS and adaptive optics observations aimed at identifying substellar companions at separations >=30 A.U. from the primary stars. No such objects were found within 300 A.U. of any of the target stars, and a number of faint objects at larger separations can very likely be attributed to a population of background stars. ISOCAM observations of 5 to 15 Myr old WTTS and PTTS in ScoCen reveal infrared excesses which are clearly above photospheric levels, and which have a spectral index intermediate between that of younger (1 to 5 Myr) T Tauri stars in Cha and that of pure stellar photospheres. The difference in the spectral index of the older PTTS in ScoCen compared to the younger classical and WTTS in Cha can be attributed to a deficiency of smaller size (0.1 to 1mu) dust grains relative to larger size (~5mu) dust grains in the disks of the PTTS. The lack of small dust grains is either due to the environment (effect of nearby O stars and supernova explosions) or due to disk evolution. If the latter is the case, it would hint that circumstellar disks start to get dust depleted at an age between 5 to 15 Myr. Dust depletion is very likely related to the build-up of larger particles (ultimately rocks and planetesimals) and thus an indicator for the onset of the period of planet formation. 	
0102478v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0102478v2	2001	Stability and Evolution of Supernova Fallback Disks	Kristen Menou|Rosalba Perna|Lars Hernquist	  We show that thin accretion disks made of Carbon or Oxygen are subject to the same thermal ionization instability as Hydrogen and Helium disks. We argue that the instability applies to disks of any metal content. The relevance of the instability to supernova fallback disks probably means that their power-law evolution breaks down when they first become neutral. We construct simple analytical models for the viscous evolution of fallback disks to show that it is possible for these disks to become neutral when they are still young (ages of a few 10^3 to 10^4 years), compact in size (a few 10^9 cm to 10^11 cm) and generally accreting at sub-Eddington rates (Mdot ~ a few 10^14 - 10^18 g/s). Based on recent results on the nature of viscosity in the disks of close binaries, we argue that this time may also correspond to the end of the disk activity period. Indeed, in the absence of a significant source of viscosity in the neutral phase, the entire disk will likely turn to dust and become passive. We discuss various applications of the evolutionary model, including anomalous X-ray pulsars and young radio pulsars. Our analysis indicates that metal-rich fallback disks around newly-born neutron stars and black holes become neutral generally inside the tidal truncation radius (Roche limit) for planets, at \~10^11 cm. Consequently, the efficiency of the planetary formation process in this context will mostly depend on the ability of the resulting disk of rocks to spread via collisions beyond the Roche limit. It appears easier for the merger product of a doubly degenerate binary, whether it is a massive white dwarf or a neutron star, to harbor planets because it can spread beyond the Roche limit before becoming neutral.[Abridged] 	
0505603v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0505603v1	2005	The composition and size distribution of the dust in the coma of comet   Hale-Bopp	M. Min|J. W. Hovenier|A. de Koter|L. B. F. M. Waters|C. Dominik	  We discuss the composition and size distribution of the dust in the coma of comet Hale-Bopp. We do this by fitting simultaneously the infrared emission spectrum measured by the infrared space observatory (ISO) and the measured degree of linear polarization of scattered light at various phase angles and 12 different wavelengths. The effects of particle shape on the modeled optical properties of the dust grains are taken into account. We constrain our fit by forcing the abundances of the major rock forming chemical elements to be solar. The infrared spectrum at long wavelengths reveals that large grains are needed in order to fit the spectral slope. The size and shape distribution we employ allows us to estimate the sizes of the crystalline silicates. The ratios of the strength of various forsterite features show that the crystalline silicate grains in Hale-Bopp must be submicron sized. We exclude the presence of large crystalline silicate grains in the coma. Because of this lack of large crystalline grains combined with the fact that we do need large amorphous grains to fit the emission spectrum at long wavelengths, we need only approximately 4% of crystalline silicates by mass. After correcting for possible hidden crystalline material included in large amorphous grains, our best estimate of the total mass fraction of crystalline material is approximately 7.5%, significantly lower than deduced in previous studies in which the typical derived crystallinity is 20-30%. The implications of this on the possible origin and evolution of the comet are discussed. The crystallinity we observe in Hale-Bopp is consistent with the production of crystalline silicates in the inner solar system by thermal annealing and subsequent radial mixing to the comet forming region.

Elfimov|R. Liang|W. N. Hardy|D. A. Bonn|M. Raudsepp|N. J. C. Ingle|A Damascelli	  Single-particle spectroscopic probes, such as scanning tunneling and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), have provided us with crucial insights into the complex electronic structure of the high-Tc cuprates, in particular for the under and optimally doped regimes where high-quality crystals suitable for surface-sensitive experiments are available. Conversely, the elementary excitations on the heavily overdoped side of the phase diagram remain largely unexplored. Important breakthroughs could come from the study of Tl2Ba2CuO6+d (Tl2201), a structurally simple system whose doping level can be tuned from optimal to extreme overdoping by varying the oxygen content. We have grown single crystals of Tl2201, which were then carefully annealed under controlled oxygen partial pressures. Their high quality and homogeneity are demonstrated by narrow rocking curves and superconducting transition widths. These crystals have enabled the first successful ARPES study of both normal and superconducting-state electronic structure in Tl2201, allowing a direct comparison with the Fermi surface from magnetoresistance and the gap from thermal conductivity experiments. This establishes Tl2201 as the first high-Tc cuprate for which a surface-sensitive single-particle spectroscopy and a comparable bulk transport technique have arrived at quantitative agreement on a major feature such as the normal state Fermi surface. The surprising momentum dependence of the ARPES lineshape is also discussed.

Wu	  We report on the first observations of the Askaryan effect in ice: coherent impulsive radio Cherenkov radiation from the charge asymmetry in an electromagnetic (EM) shower. Such radiation has been observed in silica sand and rock salt, but this is the first direct observation from an EM shower in ice. These measurements are important since the majority of experiments to date that rely on the effect for ultra-high energy neutrino detection are being performed using ice as the target medium. As part of the complete validation process for the Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna (ANITA) experiment, we performed an experiment at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) in June 2006 using a 7.5 metric ton ice target, yielding results fully consistent with theoretical expectations. 	
0805.0253v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/0805.0253v2	2008	Probes of Lorentz Violation in Neutrino Propagation	John Ellis|Nicholas Harries|Anselmo Meregaglia|Andre Rubbia|Alexander Sakharov	  It has been suggested that the interactions of energetic particles with the foamy structure of space-time thought to be generated by quantum-gravitational (QG) effects might violate Lorentz invariance, so that they do not propagate at a universal speed of light. We consider the limits that may be set on a linear or quadratic violation of Lorentz invariance in the propagation of energetic neutrinos, v/c=[1 +- (E/M_\nuQG1)] or [1 +- (E/M_\nu QG2}^2], using data from supernova explosions and the OPERA long-baseline neutrino experiment. Using the SN1987a neutrino data from the Kamioka II, IMB and Baksan experiments, we set the limits M_\nuQG1 > 2.7(2.5)x10^10 GeV for subluminal (superluminal) propagation, respectively, and M_\nuQG2 >4.6(4.1)x10^4 GeV at the 95% confidence level. A future galactic supernova at a distance of 10 kpc would have sensitivity to M_\nuQG1 > 2(4)x10^11 GeV for subluminal (superluminal) propagation, respectively, and M_\nuQG2 > 2(4)x10^5 GeV. With the current CNGS extraction spill length of 10.5 micro seconds and with standard clock synchronization techniques, the sensitivity of the OPERA experiment would reach M_\nuQG1 ~ 7x10^5 GeV (M_\nuQG2 ~ 8x10^3 GeV) after 5 years of nominal running. If the time structure of the SPS RF bunches within the extracted CNGS spills could be exploited, these figures would be significantly improved to M_\nuQG1 ~ 5x10^7 GeV (M_\nuQG2 ~ 4x10^4 GeV). These results can be improved further if similar time resolution can be achieved with neutrino events occurring in the rock upstream of the OPERA detector: we find potential sensitivities to M_\nuQG1 ~ 4x10^8 GeV and M_\nuQG2 ~ 7x10^5 GeV.

Because it does not have imaging capability nor rocking mode for the background monitor, the sensitivity is limited by the reproducibility of the non X-ray background (NXB) model. We modeled the HXD NXB, which varies with time as well as other satellites with a low-earth orbit, by utilizing several parameters, including particle monitor counts and satellite orbital/attitude information. The model background is supplied as an event file in which the background events are generated by random numbers, and can be analyzed in the same way as the real data. The reproducibility of the NXB model depends on the event selection criteria (such as cut-off rigidity and energy band) and the integration time, and the 1sigma systematic error is estimated to be less than 3% (PIN 15--40 keV) and 1% (GSO 50--100 keV) for more than 10 ksec exposure. 	
0906.2536v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/0906.2536v2	2009	Abundant Circumstellar Silica Dust and SiO Gas Created by a Giant   Hypervelocity Collision in the ~12 Myr HD172555 System	C. M. Lisse|C. H. Chen|M. C. Wyatt|A. Morlok|I. Song|G. Bryden|P. Sheehan	  The fine dust detected by IR emission around the nearby Beta Pic analogue star HD172555 is very peculiar. The dust mineralogy is composed primarily of highly refractory, non-equilibrium materials, with approximately three-quarters of the Si atoms in silica (SiO2) species. Tektite and obsidian lab thermal emission spectra (non-equilibrium glassy silicas found in impact and magmatic systems) are required to fit the data. The best-fit model size distribution for the observed fine dust is dn/da = a-3.95 +/- 0.10. This steep a size distribution, with abundant micron-sized particles, argues for a fresh source of material within the last 0.1 Myr. The location of the dust with respect to the star is at 5.8 +/- 0.6 AU (equivalent to 1.9 +/- 0.2 AU from the Sun), within the terrestrial planet formation region but at the outer edge of any possible terrestrial habitability zone. The mass of fine dust is 4 x 10^19 - 2 x 10^20 kg, equivalent to a 150 - 200 km radius asteroid. Significant emission features centered at 4 and 8 um due to fluorescing SiO gas are also found. Roughly 10^22 kg of SiO gas, formed by vaporizing silicate rock, is also present in the system, and a separate population of very large, cool grains, massing 10^21 - 10^22 kg and equivalent to the largest sized asteroid currently found in the Solar System's main asteroid belt, dominates the solid circumstellar material by mass. The makeup of the observed dust and gas, and the noted lack of a dense circumstellar gas disk, strong primary x-ray activity, or an extended disk of Beta-meteroids argues that the source of the observed circumstellar materials is a giant hypervelocity (> 10 km sec^-1) impact between large rocky planetesimals, similar to the ones which formed the Moon and which stripped the surface crustal material off of Mercury's surface.

A large detector with a fiducial mass in the mega-ton scale will most likely be a multipurpose facility. The main physics justification for such a device is detection of accelerator generated neutrinos, nucleon decay, and natural sources of neutrinos such as solar, atmospheric and supernova neutrinos. In addition to the physics justification there are practical issues regarding the existing infrastructure at Homestake, and the stress characteristics of the Homestake rock formations.   The depth requirements associated with the various physics processes are reported for water Cherenkov and liquid argon detector technologies. While some of these physics processes can be adequately studied at shallower depths, none of them require a depth greater than 4300 mwe which corresponds to the 4850 ft level at Homestake. It is very important to note that the scale of the planned detector is such that even for accelerator neutrino detection (which allows one to use the accelerator duty factor to eliminate cosmics) a minimum depth is needed to reduce risk of contamination from cosmic rays. After consideration of the science and the practical issues regarding the Homestake site, we strongly recommend that the geotechnical studies be commenced at the 4850ft level in a timely manner. 	
0907.4514v6	http://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.4514v6	2011	The perihelion precession of Saturn, planet X/Nemesis and MOND	Lorenzo Iorio	  We show that the retrograde perihelion precession of Saturn \Delta\dot\varpi, recently estimated by different teams of astronomers by processing ranging data from the Cassini spacecraft and amounting to some milliarcseconds per century, can be explained in terms of a localized, distant body X, not yet directly discovered. From the determination of its tidal parameter K = GM_X/r_X^3 as a function of its ecliptic longitude \lambda_X and latitude \beta_X, we calculate the distance at which X may exist for different values of its mass, ranging from the size of Mars to that of the Sun. The minimum distance would occur for X located perpendicularly to the ecliptic, while the maximum distance is for X lying in the ecliptic. We find for rock-ice planets of the size of Mars and the Earth that they would be at about 80-150 au, respectively, while a Jupiter-sized gaseous giant would be at approximately 1 kau. A typical brown dwarf would be located at about 4 kau, while an object with the mass of the Sun would be at approximately 10 kau, so that it could not be Nemesis for which a solar mass and a heliocentric distance of about 88 kau are predicted. If X was directed towards a specific direction, i.e. that of the Galactic Center, it would mimick the action of a recently proposed form of the External Field Effect (EFE) in the framework of the MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND).

Ritter	  (ABRIDGED) In previous work, two platforms have been developed for testing computer-vision algorithms for robotic planetary exploration (McGuire et al. 2004b,2005; Bartolo et al. 2007). The wearable-computer platform has been tested at geological and astrobiological field sites in Spain (Rivas Vaciamadrid and Riba de Santiuste), and the phone-camera has been tested at a geological field site in Malta. In this work, we (i) apply a Hopfield neural-network algorithm for novelty detection based upon color, (ii) integrate a field-capable digital microscope on the wearable computer platform, (iii) test this novelty detection with the digital microscope at Rivas Vaciamadrid, (iv) develop a Bluetooth communication mode for the phone-camera platform, in order to allow access to a mobile processing computer at the field sites, and (v) test the novelty detection on the Bluetooth-enabled phone-camera connected to a netbook computer at the Mars Desert Research Station in Utah. This systems engineering and field testing have together allowed us to develop a real-time computer-vision system that is capable, for example, of identifying lichens as novel within a series of images acquired in semi-arid desert environments. We acquired sequences of images of geologic outcrops in Utah and Spain consisting of various rock types and colors to test this algorithm. The algorithm robustly recognized previously-observed units by their color, while requiring only a single image or a few images to learn colors as familiar, demonstrating its fast learning capability. 	
1002.4447v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1002.4447v2	2010	Interior structure models of GJ 436b	N. Nettelmann|U. Kramm|R. Redmer|R. Neuhaeuser	  GJ 436b is the first extrasolar planet discovered that resembles Neptune in mass and radius. The particularly interesting property of Neptune-sized planets is that their mass Mp and radius Rp are close to theoretical M-R relations of water planets. Given Mp, Rp, and equilibrium temperature, however, various internal compositions are possible. A broad set of interior structure models is presented here that illustrates the dependence of internal composition and possible phases of water occurring in presumably water-rich planets, such as GJ 436b on the uncertainty in atmospheric temperature profile and mean density. We show how the set of solutions can be narrowed down if theoretical constraints from formation and model atmospheres are applied or potentially observational constraints for the atmospheric metallicity Z1 and the tidal Love number k2. We model the interior by assuming either three layers (hydrogen-helium envelope, water layer, rock core) or two layers (H/He/H2O envelope, rocky core). For water, we use the equation of state H2O-REOS based on FT-DFT-MD simulations. Some admixture of H/He appears mandatory for explaining the measured radius. For the warmest considered models, the H/He mass fraction can reduce to 10^-3, still extending over ~0.7 REarth. If water occurs, it will be essentially in the plasma phase or in the superionic phase, but not in an ice phase. Metal-free envelope models have 0.02<k2<0.2, and the core mass cannot be determined from a measurement of k2. In contrast, models with 0.3<k2<0.82 require high metallicities Z1<0.89 in the outer envelope. The uncertainty in core mass decreases to 0.4 Mp, if k2>0.3, and further to 0.2 Mp, if k2>0.5, and core mass and Z1 become sensitive functions of k2. To further narrow the set of solutions, a proper treatment of the atmosphere and the evolution is necessary.

Its oscillator loop is confined to a piece of mono-crystalline rock bolted into a metal can. Its quiet amplification combined with high resonator Q provide the ingredients for exceptionally low phase noise. We here concentrate on novelties addressing the fundamental conundrums and technical challenges that impede progress. (1) Roasting: The "mase-ability" of sapphire depends significantly on the chemical conditions under which it is grown and heat-treated. We provide some fresh details and nuances here. (2) Simplification: This paper obviates the need for a Ka-band synthesizer: it describes how a 31.3 GHz loop oscillator, operating on the preferred WG pump mode, incorporating Pound locking, was built from low-cost components. (3) "Dark Matter": A Siegman-level analysis of the experimental data determines the substitutional concentration of Fe3+ in HEMEX to be less than a part per billion prior to roasting and up to a few hundred ppb afterwards. Chemical assays, using different techniques (incl. glow discharge mass spectra spectroscopy and neutron activation analysis) consistently indicate, however, that HEMEX contains iron at concentrations of a few parts per million. Drawing from several forgotten-about/under-appreciated papers, this substantial discrepancy is addressed.

White	  After Earth's origin, our host star, the Sun, was shining 20 to 25 percent less brightly than today. Without greenhouse-like conditions to warm the atmosphere, our early planet would have been an ice ball and life may never have evolved. But life did evolve, which indicates that greenhouse gases must have been present on early Earth to warm the planet. Evidence from the geologic record indicates an abundance of the greenhouse gas CO2. CH4 was probably present as well, and in this regard methanogenic bacteria, which belong to a diverse group of anaerobic procaryotes that ferment CO 2 plus H2 to CH4, may have contributed to modification of the early atmosphere. Molecular oxygen was not present, as is indicated by the study of rocks from that era, which contain iron carbonate rather than iron oxide. Multicellular organisms originated as cells within colonies that became increasingly specialized. The development of photosynthesis allowed the Sun's energy to be harvested directly by life forms. The resultant oxygen accumulated in the atmosphere and formed the ozone layer in the upper atmosphere. Aided by the absorption of harmful UV radiation in the ozone layer, life colonized Earth's surface. Our own planet is a very good example of how life forms modified the atmosphere over the planets' life time. We show that these facts have to be taken into account when we discover and characterize atmospheres of Earth-like exoplanets. If life has originated and evolved on a planet, then it should be expected that a strong co-evolution occurred between life and the atmosphere, the result of which is the planets' climate.

Rice	  It has recently been noted that many discs around T Tauri stars appear to comprise only a few Jupiter-masses of gas and dust. Using millimetre surveys of discs within six local star-formation regions, we confirm this result, and find that only a few percent of young stars have enough circumstellar material to build gas giant planets, in standard core accretion models. Since the frequency of observed exo-planets is greater than this, there is a `missing mass' problem. As alternatives to simply adjusting the conversion of dust-flux to disc mass, we investigate three other classes of solution. Migration of planets could hypothetically sweep up the disc mass reservoir more efficiently, but trends in multi-planet systems do not support such a model, and theoretical models suggest that the gas accretion timescale is too short for migration to sweep the disc. Enhanced inner-disc mass reservoirs are possible, agreeing with predictions of disc evolution through self-gravity, but not adding to millimetre dust-flux as the inner disc is optically thick. Finally, the incidence of massive discs is shown to be higher at the {\it proto}stellar stages, Classes 0 and I, where discs substantial enough to form planets via core accretion are abundant enough to match the frequency of exo-planets. Gravitational instability may also operate in the Class 0 epoch, where half the objects have potentially unstable discs of $\ga$30 % of the stellar mass. However, recent calculations indicate that forming gas giants inside 50 AU by instability is unlikely, even in such massive discs. Overall, the results presented suggest that the canonically 'proto-planetary' discs of Class II T Tauri stars {\bf have globally low masses in dust observable at millimetre wavelengths, and conversion to larger bodies (anywhere from small rocks up to planetary cores) must already have occurred.}

Melott|Richard K. Bambach	  We investigate evolutionary dynamics related to periodicity fossil biodiversity. Coherent periodic fluctuation in origination/extinction of marine genera that survive <45 million years is the source of an observed ~62 million year periodicity analyzed in Paper I. We also show that the evolutionary dynamics of "long-lived" genera (those that survive >45 million years) do not participate in the periodic fluctuation in diversity and differ from those of "short-lived" genera. The difference between the evolutionary dynamics of these 2 genera classes indicates that the periodic pattern is not an artifact of variation in quality of the geologic record. The interplay of these two previously undifferentiated systems, together with the secular increase in abundance of "long-lived" genera, is probably the source of heretofore unexplained differences in evolutionary dynamics between the Paleozoic and post-Paleozoic as reported by others. Testing for cycles similar to the 62 Myr cycle in fossil biodiversity superimposed on the long-term trends of the Phanerozoic as described in Paper I, we find a significant (but weaker) signal in sedimentary rock packages, particularly carbonates, which suggests a connection. The presence of a periodic pattern in evolutionary dynamics of the vulnerable "short-lived" component of marine fauna demonstrates that a long-term periodic fluctuation in environmental conditions capable of affecting evolution in the marine realm characterizes our planet. Coincidence in timing is more consistent with a common cause than sampling bias. A previously identified set of mass extinctions preferentially occur during the declining phase of the 62 Myr periodicity, supporting the idea that the periodicity relates to variation in biotically important stresses. Further work should focus on finding links to physical phenomena that might reveal the causal system or systems.

Hasegawa|M. Abe|K. Kawakami|T. Kasuga|D. Kinoshita|D. Kuroda|S. Urakawa|S. Okumura|Y. Sarugaku|S. Miyasaka|Y. Takagi|P. R. Weissman|Y. -J. Choi|S. Larson|K. Yanagisawa|S. Nagayama	  Near-Earth asteroid 162173 (1999 JU3) is a potential flyby and rendezvous target for interplanetary missions because of its easy to reach orbit. The physical and thermal properties of the asteroid are relevant for establishing the scientific mission goals and also important in the context of near-Earth object studies in general. Our goal was to derive key physical parameters such as shape, spin-vector, size, geometric albedo, and surface properties of 162173 (1999 JU3). With three sets of published thermal observations (ground-based N-band, Akari IRC, Spitzer IRS), we applied a thermophysical model to derive the radiometric properties of the asteroid. The calculations were performed for the full range of possible shape and spin-vector solutions derived from the available sample of visual lightcurve observations. The near-Earth asteroid 162173 (1999 JU3) has an effective diameter of 0.87 +/- 0.03 km and a geometric albedo of 0.070 +/- 0.006. The chi2-test reveals a strong preference for a retrograde sense of rotation with a spin-axis orientation of lambda_ecl = 73 deg, beta_ecl = -62 deg and P_sid = 7.63 +/- 0.01 h. The most likely thermal inertia ranges between 200 and 600 Jm-2s-0.5K-1, about a factor of 2 lower than the value for 25143 Itokawa. This indicates that the surface lies somewhere between a thick-dust regolith and a rock/boulder/cm-sized, gravel-dominated surface like that of 25143 Itokawa. Our analysis represents the first time that shape and spin-vector information has been derived from a combined data set of visual lightcurves (reflected light) and mid-infrared photometry and spectroscopy (thermal emission).

Selsis|C. Sotin	  The search for rocky exoplanets plays an important role in our quest for extra-terrestrial life. Here, we discuss the extreme physical properties possible for the first characterized rocky super-Earth, CoRoT-7b (R_pl = 1.58 \pm 0.10 R_Earth, Mpl = 6.9 \pm 1.2 M_Earth). It is extremely close to its star (a = 0.0171 AU = 4.48 R_st), with its spin and orbital rotation likely synchronized. The comparison of its location in the (Mpl, Rpl) plane with the predictions of planetary models for different compositions points to an Earth-like composition, even if the error bars of the measured quantities and the partial degeneracy of the models prevent a definitive conclusion. The proximity to its star provides an additional constraint on the model. It implies a high extreme-UV flux and particle wind, and the corresponding efficient erosion of the planetary atmosphere especially for volatile species including water. Consequently, we make the working hypothesis that the planet is rocky with no volatiles in its atmosphere, and derive the physical properties that result. As a consequence, the atmosphere is made of rocky vapours with a very low pressure (P \leq 1.5 Pa), no cloud can be sustained, and no thermalisation of the planetary is expected. The dayside is very hot (2474 \leq 71 K at the sub-stellar point) while the nightside is very cold (50 to 75 K). The sub-stellar point is as hot as the tungsten filament of an incandescent bulb, resulting in the melting and distillation of silicate rocks and the formation of a lava ocean. These possible features of CoRoT-7b could be common to many small and hot planets, including the recently discovered Kepler-10b. They define a new class of objects that we propose to name "Lava-ocean planets".

Lisse|Aurora Sicilia-Aguilar|George H. Rieke|Kate Su	  We describe Spitzer IRS spectroscopic observations of the 10 Myr-old star, EF Cha. Compositional modeling of the spectra from 5 {\mu}m to 35 {\mu}m confirms that it is surrounded by a luminous debris disk with LD/L\star ~ 10-3, containing dust with temperatures between 225 K and 430 K characteristic of the terrestrial zone. The EF Cha spectrum shows evidence for many solid-state features, unlike most cold, low-luminosity debris disks but like some other 10-20 Myr-old luminous, warm debris disks (e.g. HD 113766A). The EF Cha debris disk is unusually rich in a species or combination of species whose emissivities resemble that of finely powdered, laboratory-measured phyllosilicate species (talc, saponite, and smectite), which are likely produced by aqueous alteration of primordial anhydrous rocky materials. The dust and, by inference, the parent bodies of the debris also contain abundant amorphous silicates and metal sulfides, and possibly water ice. The dust's total olivine to pyroxene ratio of ~ 2 also provides evidence of aqueous alteration. The large mass volume of grains with sizes comparable to or below the radiation blow-out limit implies that planetesimals may be colliding at a rate high enough to yield the emitting dust but not so high as to devolatize the planetesimals via impact processing. Because phyllosilicates are produced by the interactions between anhydrous rock and warm, reactive water, EF Cha's disk is a likely signpost for water delivery to the terrestrial zone of a young planetary system. 	
1104.3863v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1104.3863v1	2011	Warm Saturns: On the Nature of Rings around Extrasolar Planets that   Reside Inside the Ice Line	Hilke E. Schlichting|Philip Chang	  We discuss the nature of rings that may exist around extrasolar planets. Taking the general properties of rings around the gas giants in the Solar System, we infer the likely properties of rings around exoplanets that reside inside the ice line. Due to their proximity to their host star, rings around such exoplanets must primarily consist of rocky materials. However, we find that despite the higher densities of rock compared to ice, most of the observed extrasolar planets with reliable radii measurements have sufficiently large Roche radii to support rings. For the currently known transiting extrasolar planets, Poynting-Robertson drag is not effective in significantly altering the dynamics of individual ring particles over a time span of $10^8$ years provided that they exceed about 1 m in size. In addition, we show that significantly smaller ring particles can exist in optically thick rings, for which we find typical ring lifetimes ranging from a few times $10^6$ to a few times $10^9$ years. Most interestingly, we find that many of the rings could have nontrivial Laplacian planes due to the increased effects of the orbital quadrupole caused by the exoplanets' proximity to their host star, allowing a constraint on the $J_2$ of extrasolar planets from ring observations. This is particular exciting, since a planet's $J_2$ reveals information about its interior structure. Furthermore, measurements of an exoplanet's oblateness and of its $J_2$, from warped rings, would together place limits on its spin period. Based on the constraints that we have derived for extrasolar rings, we anticipate that the best candidates for ring detections will come from transit observations by the Kepler spacecraft of extrasolar planets with semi-major axes $\sim 0.1$ AU and larger.

Holman|Thomas Kallinger|Rainer Kuschnig|Dimitar Sasselov|Diana Dragomir|David B. Guenther|Anthony F. J. Moffat|Jason F. Rowe|Slavek Rucinski|Werner W. Weiss	  We have detected transits of the innermost planet "e" orbiting 55 Cnc (V=6.0), based on two weeks of nearly continuous photometric monitoring with the MOST space telescope. The transits occur with the period (0.74 d) and phase that had been predicted by Dawson & Fabrycky, and with the expected duration and depth for the crossing of a Sun-like star by a hot super-Earth. Assuming the star's mass and radius to be 0.963_{-0.029}^{+0.051} M_sun and 0.943 +/- 0.010 R_sun, the planet's mass, radius, and mean density are 8.63 +/- 0.35 Mearth, 2.00 +/- 0.14 Rearth, and 5.9_{-1.1}^{+1.5} g/cm^3. The mean density is comparable to that of Earth, despite the greater mass and consequently greater compression of the interior of 55 Cnc e. This suggests a rock-iron composition supplemented by a significant mass of water, gas, or other light elements. Outside of transits, we detected a sinusoidal signal resembling the expected signal due to the changing illuminated phase of the planet, but with a full range (168 +/- 70 ppm) too large to be reflected light or thermal emission. This signal has no straightforward interpretation and should be checked with further observations. The host star of 55 Cnc e is brighter than that of any other known transiting planet, which will facilitate future investigations. 	
1107.0550v3	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1107.0550v3	2012	3D Terrestrial lidar data classification of complex natural scenes using   a multi-scale dimensionality criterion: applications in geomorphology	Nicolas Brodu|Dimitri Lague	  3D point clouds of natural environments relevant to problems in geomorphology often require classification of the data into elementary relevant classes. A typical example is the separation of riparian vegetation from ground in fluvial environments, the distinction between fresh surfaces and rockfall in cliff environments, or more generally the classification of surfaces according to their morphology. Natural surfaces are heterogeneous and their distinctive properties are seldom defined at a unique scale, prompting the use of multi-scale criteria to achieve a high degree of classification success. We have thus defined a multi-scale measure of the point cloud dimensionality around each point, which characterizes the local 3D organization. We can thus monitor how the local cloud geometry behaves across scales. We present the technique and illustrate its efficiency in separating riparian vegetation from ground and classifying a mountain stream as vegetation, rock, gravel or water surface. In these two cases, separating the vegetation from ground or other classes achieve accuracy larger than 98 %. Comparison with a single scale approach shows the superiority of the multi-scale analysis in enhancing class separability and spatial resolution. The technique is robust to missing data, shadow zones and changes in point density within the scene. The classification is fast and accurate and can account for some degree of intra-class morphological variability such as different vegetation types. A probabilistic confidence in the classification result is given at each point, allowing the user to remove the points for which the classification is uncertain. The process can be both fully automated, but also fully customized by the user including a graphical definition of the classifiers. Although developed for fully 3D data, the method can be readily applied to 2.5D airborne lidar data. 	
1109.3183v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1109.3183v1	2011	Carbon-rich Giant Planets: Atmospheric Chemistry, Thermal Inversions,   Spectra, and Formation conditions	Nikku Madhusudhan|Olivier Mousis|Torrence V. Johnson|Jonathan I. Lunine	  The recent inference of a carbon-rich atmosphere, with C/O >= 1, in the hot Jupiter WASP-12b motivates the exotic new class of carbon-rich planets (CRPs). We report a detailed study of the atmospheric chemistry and spectroscopic signatures of carbon-rich giant planets (CRGs) and the compositions of icy planetesimals required for their formation, and the apportionment of ices, rock, and volatiles in their envelopes. For C/O >= 1, most of the atmospheric oxygen is occupied by CO for T > 1400 K and pressure (P) < 1 bar, causing a substantial depletion in H2O, and an overabundance of CH4 compared to those obtained by assuming solar abundances (C/O = 0.54) in chemical equilibrium. These differences in chemistry cause distinctly observable signatures in spectra. We also find that a C/O >= 1 strongly depletes the abundances of TiO and VO available to form thermal inversions, which is adequate to rule out thermal inversions due to TiO/VO even in the most highly irradiated hot Jupiters, such as WASP-12b. Adopting stellar abundances (C/O = 0.44) for the primordial disk composition and low-temperature formation conditions (T <= 30 K) for WASP-12b leads to a C/O ratio of 0.27 in accreted planetesimals, and, consequently, in the planet's envelope. In contrast, a C/O ratio of 1 in the envelope of WASP-12b requires a substantial depletion of oxygen in the disk, by a factor of ~0.41 for the same formation conditions. This scenario also satisfies the constraints on the C/H and O/H ratios reported for WASP-12b. If, alternatively, hotter conditions prevailed in a stellar composition disk such that only H2O is condensed, the remaining gas can potentially have a C/O ~ 1. However, a high C/O in WASP-12b caused predominantly by gas accretion would preclude super-stellar C/H ratios which also fit the data.

N. P. Guimarães|V. M. Hamza|J. S. Justo	  In this work we present progress obtained in analysis airborne geophysical survey data for the north-central region of the state of Goias (Brazil). The results obtained indicate that most of the subtropical soil types are characterized by Uranium contents of greater than one parts per million (ppm). Only ultisol and oxisol soils are found to have Uranium contents lower than one ppm. Thorium and Potassium abundances also display trends similar to those of Uranium. The K/U ratios fall in the expected range of values for common soils while the Th/U ratios are higher than normal. This latter observation may indicate a characteristic feature of subtropical soils. Alternatively it may be considered as indicative of disequilibrium conditions in radioactive series and consequent underestimation of Uranium in soil layers of the study area. In this context we point out the possibility of using results of radiometric surveys as a convenient complementary tool in identifying geochemical zoning of soils in subtropical environments. Analysis of aeromagnetic data reveals the presence of a large number of magnetic lineaments. The analytic signal values point to the existence of substantial small scale variations related to lithologic changes. There are indications that deposition of soil types are controlled to a large extent by the system of NE-SW trending faults and fracture systems. According to results of radiogenic heat production calculations the cambisol soil in this region are found to have a mean heat production of 3.32 \pm 5.9 \mu Wm-3 while that of ultisol soil is only 0.36 \pm 0.3 \mu Wm-3. The mean heat production of soil layers at the surface is 0.68 \pm 0.4 \mu Wm-3. Heat production values of basement rocks are estimated to be more than 1.3 \muWm-3, after corrections for density changes and non-equilibrium conditions of Uranium series.

Maciejewski|St. Raetz|N. Nettelmann|M. Seeliger|Ch. Adam|G. Nowak|R. Neuhaeuser	  The WASP-10 planetary system is intriguing because different values of radius have been reported for its transiting exoplanet. The host star exhibits activity in terms of photometric variability, which is caused by the rotational modulation of the spots. Moreover, a periodic modulation has been discovered in transit timing of WASP-10 b, which could be a sign of an additional body perturbing the orbital motion of the transiting planet. We attempt to refine the physical parameters of the system, in particular the planetary radius, which is crucial for studying the internal structure of the transiting planet. We also determine new mid-transit times to confirm or refute observed anomalies in transit timing. We acquired high-precision light curves for four transits of WASP-10 b in 2010. Assuming various limb-darkening laws, we generated best-fit models and redetermined parameters of the system. The prayer-bead method and Monte Carlo simulations were used to derive error estimates. Three transit light curves exhibit signatures of the occultations of dark spots by the planet during its passage across the stellar disk. The influence of stellar activity on transit depth is taken into account while determining system parameters. The radius of WASP-10 b is found to be no greater than 1.03 Jupiter radii, a value significantly smaller than most previous studies indicate. We calculate interior structure models of the planet, assuming a two-layer structure with one homogeneous envelope atop a rock core. The high value of the WASP-10 b's mean density allows one to consider the planet's internal structure including 270 to 450 Earth masses of heavy elements. Our new mid-transit times confirm that transit timing cannot be explained by a constant period if all literature data points are considered. They are consistent with the ephemeris assuming a periodic variation of transit timing...

Bazant	  Effective Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equations are derived for macroscopic ion transport in charged porous media under periodic fluid flow by an asymptotic multi-scale expansion with drift. The microscopic setting is a two-component periodic composite consisting of a dilute electrolyte continuum (described by standard PNP equations) and a continuous dielectric matrix, which is impermeable to the ions and carries a given surface charge. Four new features arise in the upscaled equations: (i) the effective ionic diffusivities and mobilities become tensors, related to the microstructure; (ii) the effective permittivity is also a tensor, depending on the electrolyte/matrix permittivity ratio and the ratio of the Debye screening length to the macroscopic length of the porous medium; (iii) the microscopic fluidic convection is replaced by a diffusion-dispersion correction in the effective diffusion tensor; and (iv) the surface charge per volume appears as a continuous "background charge density", as in classical membrane models. The coefficient tensors in the upscaled PNP equations can be calculated from periodic reference cell problems. For an insulating solid matrix, all gradients are corrected by the same tensor, and the Einstein relation holds at the macroscopic scale, which is not generally the case for a polarizable matrix, unless the permittivity and electric field are suitably defined. In the limit of thin double layers, Poisson's equation is replaced by macroscopic electroneutrality (balancing ionic and surface charges). The general form of the macroscopic PNP equations may also hold for concentrated solution theories, based on the local-density and mean-field approximations. These results have broad applicability to ion transport in porous electrodes, separators, membranes, ion-exchange resins, soils, porous rocks, and biological tissues.

Sierra|Ismaeel Al-Baidhany|Heikki Salo|Daniel Kennefick|Julia Kennefick|Claud H. S. Lacy	  The discovery of a relationship between supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass and spiral arm pitch angle (P) is evidence that SMBHs are tied to the overall secular evolution of a galaxy. The discovery of SMBHs in late-type galaxies with little or no bulge suggests that an underlying correlation between the dark matter halo concentration and SMBH mass (MBH) exists, rather than between the bulge mass and MBH. In this paper we measure P using a two-dimensional fast fourier transform and estimate the bar pattern speeds of 40 barred spiral galaxies from the Carnegie-Irvine Galaxy Survey. The pattern speeds were derived by estimating the gravitational potentials of our galaxies from Ks-band images and using them to produce dynamical simulation models. The pattern speeds allow us to identify those galaxies with low central dark halo densities, or fast rotating bars, while P provides an estimate of MBH. We find that a wide range of MBH exists in galaxies with low central dark matter halo densities, which appears to support other theoretical results. We also find that galaxies with low central dark halo densities appear to follow more predictable trends in P versus de Vaucouleurs morphological type (T) and bar strength versus T than barred galaxies in general. The empirical relationship between MBH and total gravitational mass of a galaxy (Mtot) allows us to predict the minimum Mtot that will be observationally measured of our fast bar galaxies. These predictions will be investigated in a subsequent paper. 	
1207.2309v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.2309v1	2012	New indication for a dichotomy in the interior structure of Uranus and   Neptune from the application of modified shape and rotation data	N. Nettelmann|R. Helled|J. J. Fortney|R. Redmer	  Since the Voyager fly-bys of Uranus and Neptune, improved gravity field data have been derived from long-term observations of the planets' satellite motions, and modified shape and solid-body rotation periods were suggested. A faster rotation period (-40 min) for Uranus and a slower rotation period (+1h20) of Neptune compared to the Voyager data were found to minimize the dynamical heights and wind speeds. We apply the improved gravity data, the modified shape and rotation data, and the physical LM-R equation of state to compute adiabatic three-layer structure models, where rocks are confined to the core, and homogeneous thermal evolution models of Uranus and Neptune. We present the full range of structure models for both the Voyager and the modified shape and rotation data. In contrast to previous studies based solely on the Voyager data or on empirical EOS, we find that Uranus and Neptune may differ to an observationally significant level in their atmospheric heavy element mass fraction Z1 and nondimensional moment of inertia, nI. For Uranus, we find Z1 < 8% and nI=0.2224(1), while for Neptune Z1 < 65% and nI=0.2555(2) when applying the modified shape and rotation data, while for the unmodified data we compute Z1 < 17% and nI=0.230(1) for Uranus and Z1 < 54% and nI=0.2410(8) for Neptune. In each of these cases, solar metallicity models (Z1=0.015) are still possible. The cooling times obtained for each planet are similar to recent calculations with the Voyager rotation periods: Neptune's luminosity can be explained by assuming an adiabatic interior while Uranus cools far too slowly. More accurate determinations of these planets' gravity fields, shapes, rotation periods, atmospheric heavy element abundances, and intrinsic luminosities are essential for improving our understanding of the internal structure and evolution of icy planets. 	
1208.0728v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1208.0728v1	2012	The effect of frame dragging on the iron K alpha line in X-ray binaries	Adam Ingram|Chris Done	  The clear characteristic timescale picked out by the low frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) seen in many black hole and neutron star binaries has the potential to provide a very powerful diagnostic of the inner regions of the accretion flow. However, this potential cannot be realised without a quantitative model for the QPO. We have recently shown that the same truncated disc/hot inner flow geometry which is used to interpret the spectral transitions can also directly produce the QPO from Lense-Thirring (vertical) precession of the hot inner flow. This correctly predicts both the frequency and spectrum of the QPO, and the tight correlation of these properties with the total spectrum of the source via a changing truncation radius between the disc and hot flow. This model predicts a unique iron line signature as a vertically tilted flow illuminates different azimuths of the disc as it precesses. The iron line arising from this rotating illumination is blue shifted when the flow irradiates the approaching region of the spinning disc and red shifted when the flow irradiates the receding region of the disc. This gives rise to a characteristic rocking of the iron line on the QPO frequency which is a necessary (and probably sufficient) test of a Lense-Thirring origin. This is also an independent test of disc truncation models for the low/hard state, as vertical precession cannot occur if there is a disc in the midplane.   We show that it may be possible to observe this effect using archival data from the Rossi X-ray timing explorer (RXTE) or XMM Newton. However, a clean test requires a combination of moderate resolution and good statistics, such as would be available from a long XMM-Newton observation or with data from the proposed ESA mission LOFT.

As the previous sample of solar analogs, these stars slightly hotter than the Sun also provide very accurate Galactic chemical abundance trends in the metallicity range $-0.3<{\rm [Fe/H]}<0.4$. Stars with and without planets show similar mean abundance ratios. Moreover, when removing the Galactic chemical evolution effects, these mean abundance ratios, $\Delta {\rm [X/Fe]_{SUN-STARS}}$, versus condensation temperature tend to exhibit less steep trends with nearly null or slightly negative slopes. We have also analyzed a sub-sample of 26 metal-rich stars, 13 with and 13 without known planets and find the similar, although not equal, abundance pattern with negative slopes for both samples of stars with and without planets. Using stars at S/N $\ge 550$ provides equally steep abundance trends with negative slopes for both stars with and without planets. We revisit the sample of solar analogs to study the abundance patterns of these stars, in particular, 8 stars hosting super-Earth-like planets. Among these stars having very low-mass planets, only four of them reveal clear increasing abundance trends versus condensation temperature. Finally, we have compared these observed slopes with those predicted using a simple model which enables us to compute the mass of rocks which have formed terrestrial planets in each planetary system. We do not find any evidence supporting the conclusion that the volatile-to-refractory abundance ratio is related to the presence of rocky planets.

Vandenbussche|B. Swinyard|R. Moreno|C. Jarchow|F. Billebaud|T. Cavalie|S. Sidher|P. Hartogh	  Herschel-PACS measurements of the rotational R(0) and R(1) HD lines in the atmospheres of Uranus and Neptune are analyzed in order to derive a D/H ratio with improved precision for both planets. The derivation of the D/H ratio includes also previous measurements of the R(2) line by the Short Wavelength Spectrometer on board the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO). The available spectroscopic line information of the three rotational transitions is discussed and applied in the radiative transfer calculations. The best simultaneous fit of all three lines requires only a minor departure from the Spitzer temperature profile of Uranus and a departure limited to 2K from the Voyager temperature profile of Neptune (both around the tropopause). The resulting and remarkably similar D/H ratios for Uranus and Neptune are found to be (4.4$\pm$0.4)$\times10^{-5}$ and (4.1$\pm$0.4)$\times10^{-5}$ respectively. Although the deuterium enrichment in both atmospheres compared to the protosolar value is confirmed, it is found to be lower compared to previous analysis. Using the interior models of Podolak et al. (1995), Helled et al. (2011) and Nettelmann et al. (2013), and assuming that complete mixing of the atmosphere and interior occured during the planets history, we derive a D/H in protoplanetary ices between (5.75--7.0)$\times10^{-5}$ for Uranus and between (5.1--7.7)$\times10^{-5}$ for Neptune. Conversely, adopting a cometary D/H for the protoplanetary ices between (15-30)$\times10^{-5}$, we constrain the interior models of both planets to have an ice mass fraction of 14-32%, i.e. that the two planets are rock-dominated.

Lopez|Eric Agol|Geoffrey W. Marcy|Katherine M. Deck|Debra A. Fischer|Jonathan J. Fortney|Steve B. Howell|Howard Isaacson|Jon M. Jenkins|Rea Kolbl|Dimitar Sasselov|Donald R. Short|William F. Welsh	  The Kepler-11 planetary system contains six transiting planets ranging in size from 1.8 to 4.2 times the radius of Earth. Five of these planets orbit in a tightly-packed configuration with periods between 10 and 47 days. We perform a dynamical analysis of the system based upon transit timing variations observed in more than three years of \ik photometric data. Stellar parameters are derived using a combination of spectral classification and constraints on the star's density derived from transit profiles together with planetary eccentricity vectors provided by our dynamical study. Combining masses of the planets relative to the star from our dynamical study and radii of the planets relative to the star from transit depths together with deduced stellar properties yields measurements of the radii of all six planets, masses of the five inner planets, and an upper bound to the mass of the outermost planet, whose orbital period is 118 days. We find mass-radius combinations for all six planets that imply that substantial fractions of their volumes are occupied by constituents that are less dense than rock. The Kepler-11 system contains the lowest mass exoplanets for which both mass and radius have been measured.

Kennefick|Marc S. Seigar|R. Scott Barrows|Matthew Hartley|Doug Shields|Misty C. Bentz|Claud H. S. Lacy	  We present new and stronger evidence for a previously reported relationship between galactic spiral arm pitch angle P (a measure of the tightness of spiral structure) and the mass M_BH of a disk galaxy's nuclear supermassive black hole (SMBH). We use an improved method to accurately measure the spiral arm pitch angle in disk galaxies to generate quantitative data on this morphological feature for 34 galaxies with directly measured black hole masses. We find a relation of log(M/M_sun) = (8.21 +/- 0.16) - (0.062 +/- 0.009)P. This method is compared with other means of estimating black hole mass to determine its effectiveness and usefulness relative to other existing relations. We argue that such a relationship is predicted by leading theories of spiral structure in disk galaxies, including the density wave theory. We propose this relationship as a tool for estimating SMBH masses in disk galaxies. This tool is potentially superior when compared to other methods for this class of galaxy and has the advantage of being unambiguously measurable from imaging data alone. 	
1305.3858v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1305.3858v1	2013	The effect of rotation and tidal heating on the thermal lightcurves of   Super Mercuries	F. Selsis|A. -S. Maurin|F. Hersant|J. Leconte|E. Bolmont|S. N. Raymond|M. Delbo	  Short period (<50 days) low-mass (<10Mearth) exoplanets are abundant and the few of them whose radius and mass have been measured already reveal a diversity in composition. Some of these exoplanets are found on eccentric orbits and are subjected to strong tides affecting their rotation and resulting in significant tidal heating. Within this population, some planets are likely to be depleted in volatiles and have no atmosphere. We model the thermal emission of these "Super Mercuries" to study the signatures of rotation and tidal dissipation on their infrared light curve. We compute the time-dependent temperature map at the surface and in the subsurface of the planet and the resulting disk-integrated emission spectrum received by a distant observer for any observation geometry. We calculate the illumination of the planetary surface for any Keplerian orbit and rotation. We include the internal tidal heat flow, vertical heat diffusion in the subsurface and generate synthetic light curves. We show that the different rotation periods predicted by tidal models (spin-orbit resonances, pseudo-synchronization) produce different photometric signatures, which are observable provided that the thermal inertia of the surface is high, like that of solid or melted rocks (but not regolith). Tidal dissipation can also directly affect the light curves and make the inference of the rotation more difficult or easier depending on the existence of hot spots on the surface. Infrared light curve measurement with the James Webb Space Telescope and EChO can be used to infer exoplanets' rotation periods and dissipation rates and thus to test tidal models. This data will also constrain the nature of the (sub)surface by constraining the thermal inertia.

Lorente|A. Pal|L. O'Rourke|L. Metcalfe	  The near-Earth asteroid (308635) 2005 YU55 is a potentially hazardous asteroid which was discovered in 2005 and passed Earth on November 8th 2011 at 0.85 lunar distances. This was the closest known approach by an asteroid of several hundred metre diameter since 1976 when a similar size object passed at 0.5 lunar distances. We observed 2005 YU55 from ground with a recently developed mid-IR camera (miniTAO/MAX38) in N- and Q-band and with the Submillimeter Array (SMA) at 1.3 mm. In addition, we obtained space observations with Herschel/PACS at 70, 100, and 160 micron. Our thermal measurements cover a wide range of wavelengths from 8.9 micron to 1.3 mm and were taken after opposition at phase angles between -97 deg and -18 deg. We performed a radiometric analysis via a thermophysical model and combined our derived properties with results from radar, adaptive optics, lightcurve observations, speckle and auxiliary thermal data. We find that (308635) 2005 YU55 has an almost spherical shape with an effective diameter of 300 to 312 m and a geometric albedo pV of 0.055 to 0.075. Its spin-axis is oriented towards celestial directions (lam_ecl, beta_ecl) = (60 deg +/- 30deg, -60 deg +/- 15 deg), which means it has a retrograde sense of rotation. The analysis of all available data combined revealed a discrepancy with the radar-derived size. Our radiometric analysis of the thermal data together with the problem to find a unique rotation period might be connected to a non-principal axis rotation. A low to intermediate level of surface roughness (r.m.s. of surface slopes in the range 0.1 - 0.3) is required to explain the available thermal measurements. We found a thermal inertia in the range 350-800 Jm^-2s^-0.5K^-1, very similar to the rubble-pile asteroid (25143) Itokawa and indicating a mixture of low conductivity fine regolith with larger rocks and boulders of high thermal inertia on the surface.

Watson	  Kepler-78 (KIC 8435766) was identified by Sanchis-Ojeda et al. (2013) as harbouring a transiting planet of 1.16 times the size of the Earth and an orbital period of only 8.5 hours. While the exquisite Kepler photometry was able to determine its radius and period, the mass of the planet (and thus its mean density) remained unconstrained in the absence of precise radial-velocity measurements. Here we present an accurate mass measurement of Kepler-78b using the HARPS-N spectrograph, recently installed on the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (INAF) at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory, La Palma, Spain. These new data yield a mass of 1.86 Earth masses. The resulting mean density of the planet is 5.57 grams per cubic centimetre, which is similar to that of the Earth and implies a composition of iron and rock. Kepler-78b, which orbits a Sun-like star called Kepler 78 located in the Cygnus constellation at a distance of about 400 light years from us, is now the smallest exoplanet for which both the mass and radius are known accurately. 	
1402.6586v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.6586v1	2014	Approach to failure in porous granular materials under compression	F. Kun|I. Varga|S. Lennartz-Sassinek|I. G. Main	  We investigate the approach to catastrophic failure in a model porous granular material undergoing uniaxial compression. A discrete element computational model is used to simulate both the micro-structure of the material and the complex dynamics and feedbacks involved in local fracturing and the production of crackling noise. Under strain-controlled loading micro-cracks initially nucleate in an uncorrelated way all over the sample. As loading proceeds the damage localizes into a narrow damage band inclined at 30-45 degrees to the load direction. Inside the damage band the material is crushed into a poorly-sorted mixture of mainly fine powder hosting some larger fragments. The mass probability density distribution of particles in the damage zone is a power law of exponent 2.1, similar to a value of 1.87 inferred from observations of the length distribution of wear products (gouge) in natural and laboratory faults. Dynamic bursts of radiated energy, analogous to acoustic emissions observed in laboratory experiments on porous sedimentary rocks, are identified as correlated trails or cascades of local ruptures that emerge from the stress redistribution process. As the system approaches macroscopic failure consecutive bursts become progressively more correlated. Their size distribution is also a power law, with an equivalent Gutenberg-Richter b-value of 1.22 averaged over the whole test, ranging from 3 down to 0.5 at the time of failure, all similar to those observed in laboratory tests on granular sandstone samples. The formation of the damage band itself is marked by a decrease in the average distance between consecutive bursts and an emergent power law correlation integral of event locations with a correlation dimension of 2.55, also similar to those observed in the laboratory (between 2.75 and 2.25).

Bodini|D. Cambiaghi|M. Lancini|D. Vetturi|O. Barnabà|F. Fallavollita|R. Nardò|C. Riccardi|M. Rossella|P. Vitulo|G. Zumerle	  Cosmic ray radiation is mostly composed, at sea level, by high energy muons, which are highly penetrating particles capable of crossing kilometers of rock. Cosmic ray radiation constituted the first source of projectiles used to investigate the intimate structure of matter and is currently and largely used for particle detector test and calibration. The ubiquitous and steady presence at the Earth's surface and the high penetration capability has motivated the use of cosmic ray radiation also in fields beyond particle physics, from geological and archaeological studies to industrial applications and civil security. In the present paper, cosmic ray muon detection techniques are assessed for stability monitoring applications in the field of civil engineering, in particular for static monitoring of historical buildings, where conservation constraints are more severe and the time evolution of the deformation phenomena under study may be of the order of months or years. As a significant case study, the monitoring of the wooden vaulted roof of the "Palazzo della Loggia" in the town of Brescia, in Italy, has been considered. The feasibility as well as the performances and limitations of a monitoring system based on cosmic ray tracking, in the considered case, have been studied by Monte Carlo simulation and discussed in comparison with more traditional monitoring systems. Requirements for muon detectors suitable for this particular application, as well as the results of some preliminary tests on a muon detector prototype based on scintillating fibers and silicon photomultipliers SiPM are presented.

Knapen|J. Falcón-Barroso	  We present the first single-burst stellar population models in the infrared wavelength range between 2.5 and 5 {\mu}m which are exclusively based on empirical stellar spectra. Our models take as input 180 spectra from the stellar IRTF (Infrared Telescope Facility) library. Our final single-burst stellar population models are calculated based on two different sets of isochrones and various types of initial mass functions of different slopes, ages larger than 1 Gyr and metallicities between [Fe/H] = -0.70 and 0.26. They are made available online to the scientific community on the MILES web page. We analyse the behaviour of the Spitzer [3.6]-[4.5] colour calculated from our single stellar population models and find only slight dependences on both metallicity and age. When comparing to the colours of observed early-type galaxies, we find a good agreement for older, more massive galaxies that resemble a single-burst population. Younger, less massive and more metal-poor galaxies show redder colours with respect to our models. This mismatch can be explained by a more extended star formation history of these galaxies which includes a metal-poor or/and young population. Moreover, the colours derived from our models agree very well with most other models available in this wavelength range. We confirm that the mass-to-light ratio determined in the Spitzer [3.6] {\mu}m band changes much less as a function of both age and metallicity than in the optical bands.

Among 52 gamma-ray spectrometry measurements of soil, oil-sand, sludge, produced water and crude oil samples, we discover that relatively low activity concentrations of 226Ra, 228Ra, 228Th and 40K, which are 23 +/- 2 Bq/kg, 23 +/- 2 Bq/kg, 24 +/- 3 Bq/kg and 549 +/- 12 Bq/kg, respectively, come from oil-sand produced by hydrocarbon extraction from molasses formations. The mineralogical characterization together with the 228Ra/40K and 226Ra/40K ratios of these Neogene deposits confirm the geological and geodynamic model that predicts a dismantling of Mesozoic source rocks. The average activity concentrations (+/- standard deviations) of the radium isotopes (226Ra, 228Ra) and of the 228Th and 40K radionuclides in soil samples are determined to be 20 +/- 5 Bq/kg, 25 +/- 10 Bq/kg, 25 +/- 9 Bq/kg and 326 +/- 83 Bq/kg, respectively. Based on these arguments, the future radiological assessment of other fields in the region can be strategically planned focusing on the oil-sands from molasses sediments. No disequilibrium in the 228Ra decay segment has been observed in soil, sludge and oil-sand samples within the standard uncertainties. After a detailed radiological characterization of the four main oilfields, we can conclude that the outdoor absorbed dose rate never exceeds the worldwide population weighted average absorbed dose rate in outdoor air from terrestrial gamma radiation.

Linear dunes are a major geomorphological feature present on Titan, covering up to 17% of its surface, mainly in equatorial regions. However, the resolution of the RADAR instrument is not good enough to allow a detailed study of the morphology of these features. In addition, other linear wind-related landforms, such as mega-yardangs (linear wind-abraded ridges formed in cohesive rocks), are likely to present a comparable radar signature that could be confused with the one of dunes. We conducted a comparative study of the radar radiometry of both linear dunes and mega-yardangs, based on representative terrestrial analogues: the linear dunes located in the Great Sand Sea in western Egypt and in the Namib Desert in Namibia, and the mega-yardangs observed in the Lut Desert in eastern Iran and in the Borkou Desert in northern Chad. We analysed the radar scattering of both terrestrial linear dunes and mega-yardangs, using high-resolution radar images acquired by the X-band (9.6 GHz - 3.1 cm) sensor of the TerraSAR-X satellite. Variations seen in the radar response of dunes are the result of a contrast between the dune and interdune scattering, while for mega-yardangs these variations are the result of a contrast between ridges and erosion valleys. We tested a simple surface scattering model, with parameters derived from the local topography and surface roughness estimates, to accurately reproduce the radar signal variations for both landforms. It appears that we can discriminate between two types of dunes - bare interdunes as in Egypt and sand-covered interdunes as in Namibia, and between two types of mega-yardangs - young yardangs... 	
1510.06594v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.06594v1	2015	A comprehensive study of noble gases and nitrogen in Hypatia, a   diamond-rich pebble from SW Egypt	Guillaume Avice|Matthias M. M. Meier|Bernard Marty|Rainer Wieler|Jan D. Kramers|Falko Langenhorst|Pierre Cartigny|Colin Maden|Laurent Zimmermann|Marco A. G. Andreoli	  This is a follow-up study of a work by Kramers et al. (2013) on an unusual diamond-rich rock found in the SW side of the Libyan Desert Glass strewn field. This pebble, called Hypatia, is composed of almost pure carbon. Transmission Electron Microscopy and X-ray diffraction results reveal that Hypatia is made of defect-rich diamond containing lonsdaleite and deformation bands. These characteristics are compatible with an impact origin on Earth and/or in space. We analyzed concentrations and isotopic compositions of all five noble gases and nitrogen in several mg sized Hypatia samples. These data confirm that Hypatia is extra-terrestrial. The sample is rich in trapped noble gases with an isotopic composition close to the meteoritic Q component. 40Ar/36Ar ratios in individual steps are as low as 0.4. Concentrations of cosmic-ray produced 21Ne correspond to a nominal cosmic-ray exposure age of ca. 0.1 Myr if produced in a typical m-sized meteoroid. Such an atypically low nominal exposure age suggests high shielding in a considerably larger body. In addition to the Xe-Q composition, an excess of radiogenic 129Xe (from the decay of extinct 129I) is observed (129Xe/132Xe = 1.18 +/- 0.03). Two N components are present, an isotopically heavy component ({\delta}15N = +20 permil) released at low temp. and a major light component ({\delta}15N = -110 permil) at higher temp. This disequilibrium in N suggests that the diamonds in Hypatia were formed in space. Our data are broadly consistent with concentrations and isotopic compositions of noble gases in at least three different types of carbon-rich meteoritic materials. However, Hypatia does not seem to be related to any of these materials, but may have sampled a similar cosmochemical reservoir. Our study does not confirm the presence of exotic noble gases that led Kramers et al. to propose that Hypatia is a remnant of a comet that impacted the Earth.

Janotti|C. G. Van de Walle|A. Blanca-Romero|R. Pentcheva|C. M. Schneider|S. Stemmer|C. S. Fadley	  LaNiO$_3$ (LNO) is an intriguing member of the rare-earth nickelates in exhibiting a metal-insulator transition for a critical film thickness of about 4 unit cells [Son et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 96, 062114 (2010)]; however, such thin films also show a transition to a metallic state in superlattices with SrTiO$_3$ (STO) [Son et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 97, 202109 (2010)]. In order to better understand this transition, we have studied a strained LNO/STO superlattice with 10 repeats of [4 unit-cell LNO/3 unit-cell STO] grown on an (LaAlO$_3$)$_{0.3}$(Sr$_2$AlTaO$_6$)$_{0.7}$ substrate using soft x-ray standing-wave-excited angle-resolved photoemission (SWARPES), together with soft- and hard- x-ray photoemission measurements of core levels and densities-of-states valence spectra. The experimental results are compared with state-of-the-art density functional theory (DFT) calculations of band structures and densities of states. Using core-level rocking curves and x-ray optical modeling to assess the position of the standing wave, SWARPES measurements are carried out for various incidence angles and used to determine interface-specific changes in momentum-resolved electronic structure. We further show that the momentum-resolved behavior of the Ni 3d eg and t2g states near the Fermi level, as well as those at the bottom of the valence bands, is very similar to recently published SWARPES results for a related La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ superlattice that was studied using the same technique (Gray et al., Europhysics Letters 104, 17004 (2013)), which further validates this experimental approach and our conclusions. Our conclusions are also supported in several ways by comparison to DFT calculations for the parent materials and the superlattice, including layer-resolved density-of-states results.

Xhixha|A Zanon	  We present a detailed map of the uranium distribution and its uncertainties in the Variscan Basement of Northeastern Sardinia (VBNS) at a scale 1:100,000. An area of 2100 km2 was investigated by means of 535 data points obtained from laboratory and in situ gamma-ray spectrometry measurements. These data volume corresponds to the highest sampling density of the European Variscides, aimed at studying the genetic processes of the upper crust potentially triggered by an enrichment of radiogenic heat-producing elements. For the first time the Kriging with Variance of Measurement Error method was used to assign weights to the input data which are based on the degree of confidence associated to the measurements obtained with different gamma-ray spectrometry techniques. A detailed tuning of the model parameters for the adopted Experimental Semi-Variogram led to identify a maximum distance of spatial variability coherent to the observed tendency of the experimental data. We demonstrate that the obtained uranium distribution in the VBNS, characterized by several calc-alkaline plutons emplaced within migmatitic massifs and amphibolite-facies metamorphic rocks, is an excellent benchmark for the study of 'hot' collisional chains. The uranium map of VBNS, and in particular the Arzachena minor pluton, confirms the emplacement model based on the recognition of the different petrological associations characterizing the Variscan magmatic processes in the Late Paleozoic. Furthermore, the presented model of the uranium content of the geological bedrock is a potential baseline for future mapping of radon-prone areas. 	
1512.03970v3	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03970v3	2016	Coexistence in the face of uncertainty	Sebastian J. Schreiber	  Over the past century, nonlinear difference and differential equations have been used to understand conditions for species coexistence. However, these models fail to account for random fluctuations due to demographic and environmental stochasticity which are experienced by all populations. I review some recent mathematical results about persistence and coexistence for models accounting for each of these forms of stochasticity. Demographic stochasticity stems from populations and communities consisting of a finite number of interacting individuals, and often are represented by Markovian models with a countable number of states. For closed populations in a bounded world, extinction occurs in finite time but may be preceded by long-term transients. Quasi-stationary distributions (QSDs) of these Makov models characterize this meta-stable behavior. For sufficiently large "habitat sizes", QSDs are shown to concentrate on the positive attractors of deterministic models. Moreover, the probability extinction decreases exponentially with habitat size. Alternatively, environmental stochasticity stems from fluctuations in environmental conditions which influence survival, growth, and reproduction. Stochastic difference equations can be used to model the effects of environmental stochasticity on population and community dynamics. For these models, stochastic persistence corresponds to empirical measures placing arbitrarily little weight on arbitrarily low population densities. Sufficient and necessary conditions for stochastic persistence are reviewed. These conditions involve weighted combinations of Lyapunov exponents corresponding to "average" per-capita growth rates of rare species. The results are illustrated with Bay checkerspot butterflies, coupled sink populations, the storage effect, and stochastic rock-paper-scissor communities. Open problems and conjectures are presented.

With an energy resolution of 11 eV FWHM below 1 keV, the spectrum's observed line ratios help separate charge exchange contributions originating within the heliosphere from thermal emission of hot gas in the interstellar medium. The X-ray sensitivity below 1 keV was reduced by about a factor of four from contamination that occurred early in the flight, limiting the significance of the results. The observed centroid of helium-like O VII is 568+2-3 eV at 90% confidence. Since the centroid expected for thermal emission is 568.4 eV while for charge exchange is 564.2 eV, thermal emission appears to dominate for this line complex, consistent with much of the high-latitude O VII emission originating in 2-3 x 10^6 K gas in the Galactic halo. On the other hand, the observed ratio of C VI Ly gamma to Ly alpha is 0.3+-0.2. The expected ratios are 0.04 for thermal emission and 0.24 for charge exchange, indicating that charge exchange must contribute strongly to this line and therefore potentially to the rest of the ROSAT R12 band usually associated with 10^6 K emission from the Local Hot Bubble. The limited statistics of this experiment and systematic uncertainties due to the contamination require only >32% thermal emission for O VII and >20% from charge exchange for C VI at the 90% confidence level. An experimental gold coating on the silicon substrate of the array greatly reduced extraneous signals induced on nearby pixels from cosmic rays passing through the substrate, reducing the triggered event rate by a factor of 15 from a previous flight of the instrument.

We find that the TTV phases for most of these pairs lie close to zero, consistent with an eccentricity distribution that has a very low RMS value of e ~ 0.01; but about a quarter of the pairs possess much higher eccentricities, up to 0.1 - 0.4. For the low-eccentricity pairs, we are able to statistically remove the effect of eccentricity to obtain planet masses from TTV data. These masses, together with those measured by radial velocity, yield a best fit mass-radius relation M~3 M_E (R/R_E). This corresponds to a constant surface escape velocity of 20km/s.   We separate the planets into two distinct groups, "mid-sized" (those greater than 3 R_E), and "compact" (those smaller). All mid-sized planets are found to be less dense than water and therefore contain extensive H/He envelopes, likely comparable in mass to that of their cores. We argue that these planets have been significantly sculpted by photoevaporation. Surprisingly, mid-sized planets are discovered exclusively around stars more massive than 0.8 M_sun. The compact planets, on the other hand, are often denser than water. Combining our density measurements with those from radial velocity studies, we find that hotter compact planets tend to be denser, with the hottest ones reaching rock density. Moreover, hotter planets tend to be smaller in sizes. These results can be explained if the compact planets are made of rocky cores overlaid with a small amount of hydrogen, < 1% in mass, with water contributing little to their masses or sizes. Photoevaporation has exposed bare rocky cores in cases of the hottest planets. Our conclusion that these planets are likely not water-worlds contrasts with some previous studies.

R. Bruner|C. Gross|J. Ormö|R. A. Smosna|S. Walter|L. Wendt	  (abridged) We describe an image-comparison technique of Heidemann and Ritter that uses image compression, and is capable of: (i) detecting novel textures in a series of images, as well as of: (ii) alerting the user to the similarity of a new image to a previously-observed texture. This image-comparison technique has been implemented and tested using our Astrobiology Phone-cam system, which employs Bluetooth communication to send images to a local laptop server in the field for the image-compression analysis. We tested the system in a field site displaying a heterogeneous suite of sandstones, limestones, mudstones and coalbeds. Some of the rocks are partly covered with lichen. The image-matching procedure of this system performed very well with data obtained through our field test, grouping all images of yellow lichens together and grouping all images of a coal bed together, and giving a 91% accuracy for similarity detection. Such similarity detection could be employed to make maps of different geological units. The novelty-detection performance of our system was also rather good (a 64% accuracy). Such novelty detection may become valuable in searching for new geological units, which could be of astrobiological interest. The image-comparison technique is an unsupervised technique that is not capable of directly classifying an image as containing a particular geological feature; labeling of such geological features is done post facto by human geologists associated with this study, for the purpose of analyzing the system's performance. By providing more advanced capabilities for similarity detection and novelty detection, this image-compression technique could be useful in giving more scientific autonomy to robotic planetary rovers, and in assisting human astronauts in their geological exploration and assessment.

Milliken|Denis Jouglet|Jean-Pierre Bibring|Brigitte Gondet|Yves Langevin	  Here we discuss one of the current reservoirs of water on Mars, the regolith and rocks exposed at the surface. This reservoir is characterized by the presence of H_{2}O- and OH- bearing phases that produce a broad absorption at a wavelength of \sim 3 \mu m in near-infrared (NIR) reflectance spectra. This absorption is present in every ice-free spectrum of the Martian surface obtained thus far by orbital NIR spectrometers. We present a quantitative analysis of the global distribution of the 3 \mu m absorption using the Observatoire pour la Min\'eralogie, l\'\Eau, les Glaces et l\'\Activit\'e (OMEGA) imaging spectrometer that has been mapping the surface of Mars at kilometer scale for more than ten years. Based on laboratory reflectance spectra of a wide range of hydrous minerals and phases, we estimate a model-dependent water content of 4\pm 1 wt. \% in the equatorial and mid-latitudes. Surface hydration increases with latitude, with an asymmetry in water content between the northern and southern hemispheres. The surface hydration is compared to various parameters (albedo, dust, geological units, time, relative humidity, atmospheric water pressure, and in situ measurements performed by Phoenix and Curiosity) to constrain the nature of the reservoir. We conclude that the nature of the surface hydration of the Martian low latitudes is not adsorbed water but rather more tightly-bound water molecules and hydroxyl groups in the structure of the materials of the near-top surface. A frost-related process best explains the implementation of water into and onto the first microns of the high latitudes Martian regolith. 	
1411.1403v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.1403v1	2014	The Effects of Initial Abundances on Nitrogen in Protoplanetary Disks	Kamber R. Schwarz|Edwin A. Bergin	  The dominant form of nitrogen provided to most solar system bodies is currently unknown, though available measurements show that the detected nitrogen in solar system rocks and ices is depleted with respect to solar abundances and the interstellar medium. We use a detailed chemical/physical model of the chemical evolution of a protoplanetary disk to explore the evolution and abundance of nitrogen-bearing molecules. Based on this model we analyze how initial chemical abundances, provided as either gas or ice during the early stages of disk formation, influence which species become the dominant nitrogen bearers at later stages. We find that a disk with the majority of its initial nitrogen in either atomic or molecular nitrogen is later dominated by atomic and molecular nitrogen as well as NH$_{3}$ and HCN ices, where the dominant species varies with disk radius.   When nitrogen is initially in gaseous ammonia, it later becomes trapped in ammonia ice except in the outer disk where atomic nitrogen dominates. For a disk with the initial nitrogen in the form of ammonia ice the nitrogen remains trapped in the ice as NH$_{3}$ at later stages. The model in which most of the initial nitrogen is placed in atomic N best matches the ammonia abundances observed in comets. Furthermore the initial state of nitrogen influences the abundance of N$_{2}$H$^{+}$, which has been detected in protoplanetary disks. Strong N$_{2}$H$^{+}$ emission is found to be indicative of an N$_{2}$ abundance greater than $n_{\mathrm{N_{2}}}/n_{\mathrm{H_{2}}}>10^{-6}$, in addition to tracing the CO snow line. Our models also indicate that NO is potentially detectable, with lower N gas abundances leading to higher NO abundances.

Haywood	  Kepler-78b is a transiting planet that is 1.2 times the radius of Earth and orbits a young, active K dwarf every 8 hours. The mass of Kepler-78b has been independently reported by two teams based on radial velocity measurements using the HIRES and HARPS-N spectrographs. Due to the active nature of the host star, a stellar activity model is required to distinguish and isolate the planetary signal in radial velocity data. Whereas previous studies tested parametric stellar activity models, we modeled this system using nonparametric Gaussian process (GP) regression. We produced a GP regression of relevant Kepler photometry. We then use the posterior parameter distribution for our photometric fit as a prior for our simultaneous GP + Keplerian orbit models of the radial velocity datasets. We tested three simple kernel functions for our GP regressions. Based on a Bayesian likelihood analysis, we selected a quasi-periodic kernel model with GP hyperparameters coupled between the two RV datasets, giving a Doppler amplitude of 1.86 $\pm$ 0.25 m s$^{-1}$ and supporting our belief that the correlated noise we are modeling is astrophysical. The corresponding mass of 1.87 $^{+0.27}_{-0.26}$ M$_{\oplus}$ is consistent with that measured in previous studies, and more robust due to our nonparametric signal estimation. Based on our mass and the radius measurement from transit photometry, Kepler-78b has a bulk density of 6.0$^{+1.9}_{-1.4}$ g cm$^{-3}$. We estimate that Kepler-78b is 32$\pm$26% iron using a two-component rock-iron model. This is consistent with an Earth-like composition, with uncertainty spanning Moon-like to Mercury-like compositions.

Davies	  The size distribution of asteroids and Kuiper belt objects in the solar system is difficult to reconcile with a bottom-up formation scenario due to the observed scarcity of objects smaller than $\sim$100 km in size. Instead, planetesimals appear to form top-down, with large $100-1000$ km bodies forming from the rapid gravitational collapse of dense clumps of small solid particles. In this paper we investigate the conditions under which solid particles can form dense clumps in a protoplanetary disk. We use a hydrodynamic code to model the interaction between solid particles and the gas inside a shearing box inside the disk, considering particle sizes from sub-millimeter-sized chondrules to meter-sized rocks. We find that particles down to millimeter sizes can form dense particle clouds through the run-away convergence of radial drift known as the streaming instability. We make a map of the range of conditions (strength of turbulence, particle mass-loading, disk mass, and distance to the star) which are prone to producing dense particle clumps. Finally, we estimate the distribution of collision speeds between mm-sized particles. We calculate the rate of sticking collisions and obtain a robust upper limit on the particle growth timescale of $\sim$$10^5$ years. This means that mm-sized chondrule aggregates can grow on a timescale much smaller than the disk accretion timescale ($\sim$$10^6 - 10^7$ years). Our results suggest a pathway from the mm-sized grains found in primitive meteorites to fully formed asteroids. We speculate that asteroids may form from a positive feedback loop in which coagualation leads to particle clumping driven by the streaming instability. This clumping, in turn reduces collision speeds and enhances coagulation.} Future simulations should model coagulation and the streaming instability together to explore this feedback loop further.

Bouquin|Armando Gil de Paz|Samuel Boissier|Juan-Carlos Muñoz-Mateos|Kartik Sheth|Dennis Zaritsky|Jarkko Laine|Jesús Gallego|Reynier F. Peletier|Benjamin R. Röck|Johan H. Knapen	  We obtained GALEX FUV, NUV, and Spitzer/IRAC 3.6$\mu$m photometry for > 2000 galaxies, available for 90% of the S4G sample. We find a very tight "GALEX Blue Sequence (GBS)" in the (FUV-NUV) versus (NUV-[3.6]) color-color diagram which is populated by irregular and spiral galaxies, and is mainly driven by changes in the formation timescale ($\tau$) and a degeneracy between $\tau$ and dust reddening. The tightness of the GBS provides an unprecedented way of identifying star-forming galaxies and objects that are just evolving to (or from) what we call the "GALEX Green Valley (GGV)". At the red end of the GBS, at (NUV-[3.6]) > 5, we find a wider "GALEX Red Sequence (GRS)" mostly populated by E/S0 galaxies that has a perpendicular slope to that of the GBS and of the optical red sequence. We find no such dichotomy in terms of stellar mass (measured by $\rm{M}_{[3.6]}$), since both massive ($M_{\star} > 10^{11} M_{\odot}$) blue and red sequence galaxies are identified. The type that is proportionally more often found in the GGV are the S0-Sa's and most of these are located in high-density environments. We discuss evolutionary models of galaxies that show a rapid transition from the blue to the red sequence on timescale of $10^{8}$years. 	
1506.01024v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.01024v2	2015	The formation of the Galilean moons and Titan in the Grand Tack scenario	René Heller|Gabriel-Dominique Marleau|Ralph Egon Pudritz	  In the Grand Tack (GT) scenario for the young solar system, Jupiter formed beyond 3.5 AU from the Sun and migrated as close as 1.5 AU until it encountered an orbital resonance with Saturn. Both planets then supposedly migrated outward for several $10^5$ yr, with Jupiter ending up at ~5 AU. The initial conditions of the GT and the timing between Jupiter's migration and the formation of the Galilean satellites remain unexplored. We study the formation of Ganymede and Callisto, both of which consist of ~50% H$_2$O and rock, in the GT scenario. We examine why they lack dense atmospheres, while Titan is surrounded by a thick N$_2$ envelope. We model an axially symmetric circumplanetary disk (CPD) in hydrostatic equilibrium around Jupiter. The CPD is warmed by viscous heating, Jupiter's luminosity, accretional heating, and the Sun. The position of the H$_2$O ice line in the CPD, which is crucial for the formation of massive moons, is computed at various solar distances. We assess the loss of Galilean atmospheres due to high-energy radiation from the young Sun. Ganymede and Callisto cannot have accreted their H$_2$O during Jupiter's supposed GT, because its CPD (if still active) was too warm to host ices and much smaller than Ganymede's contemporary orbit. From a thermal perspective, the Galilean moons might have had significant atmospheres, but these would probably have been eroded during the GT in < $10^5$ yr by solar XUV radiation. Jupiter and the Galilean moons formed beyond 4.5 (+/- 0.5) AU and prior to the proposed GT. Thereafter, Jupiter's CPD would have been dry, and delayed accretion of planetesimals should have created water-rich Io and Europa. While Galilean atmospheres would have been lost during the GT, Titan would have formed after Saturn's own tack, because Saturn still accreted substantially for ~$10^6$ yr after its closest solar approach, ending up at about 7 AU.

To this aim, in the last decade, geophysical radiography techniques using cosmic muon particles have been proposed. By measuring the differential attenuation of the muon flux as a function of the amount of rock crossed along different directions, it is possible to determine the density distribution of the interior of a volcano. Up to now, a number of experiments have been based on the detection of the muon tracks crossing hodoscopes, made up of scintillators or nuclear emulsion planes. Using telescopes based on the atmospheric Cherenkov imaging technique, we propose a new approach to study the interior of volcanoes detecting the Cherenkov light produced by relativistic cosmic-ray muons that survive after crossing the volcano. The Cherenkov light produced along the muon path is imaged as a typical annular pattern containing all the essential information to reconstruct particle direction and energy. Our new approach offers the advantage of a negligible background and an improved spatial resolution. To test the feasibility of our new method, we have carried out simulations with a toy-model based on the geometrical parameters of ASTRI SST-2M, i.e. the imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope currently under installation onto the Etna volcano. Comparing the results of our simulations with previous experiments based on particle detectors, we gain at least a factor of 10 in sensitivity. The result of this study shows that we resolve an empty cylinder with a radius of about 100 m located inside a volcano in less than 4 days, which implies a limit on the magma velocity of 5 m/h. 	
1604.01666v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.01666v1	2016	Record breaking bursts during the compressive failure of porous   materials	Gergo Pal|Frank Raischel|Sabine Lennartz-Sassinek|Ferenc Kun|Ian G. Main	  An accurate understanding of the interplay between random and deterministic processes in generating extreme events is of critical importance in many fields, from forecasting extreme meteorological events to the catastrophic failure of materials and in the Earth. Here we investigate the statistics of record-breaking events in the time series of crackling noise generated by local rupture events during the compressive failure of porous materials. The events are generated by computer simulations of the uni-axial compression of cylindrical samples in a discrete element model of sedimentary rocks that closely resemble those of real experiments. The number of records grows initially as a decelerating power law of the number of events, followed by an acceleration immediately prior to failure. We demonstrate the existence of a characteristic record rank k^* which separates the two regimes of the time evolution. Up to this rank deceleration occurs due to the effect of random disorder. Record breaking then accelerates towards macroscopic failure, when physical interactions leading to spatial and temporal correlations dominate the location and timing of local ruptures. Sub-sequences of bursts between consecutive records are characterized by a power law size distribution with an exponent which decreases as failure is approached. High rank records are preceded by bursts of increasing size and waiting time between consecutive events and they are followed by a relaxation process. As a reference, surrogate time series are generated by reshuffling the crackling bursts. The record statistics of the uncorrelated surrogates agrees very well with the corresponding predictions of independent identically distributed random variables, which confirms that the temporal and spatial correlation of cracking bursts are responsible for the observed unique behaviour. 	
1605.00431v4	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.00431v4	2016	Complex behaviour in cyclic competition bimatrix games	Cezary Olszowiec	  We consider an example of cyclic competition bimatrix game which is a Rock-Scissors-Paper game with assumption about perfect memory of the playing agents. At first we investigate the dynamics in the neighbourhood of the Nash equilibrium as well as the dynamics on the boundary of codimension 1 - that is when one of the strategies is not played by any agent. For the analysis of the asymptotic behaviour close to the boundary of state space, we provide the description of a naturally appearing heteroclinic network. Due to the symmetry, the heteroclinic network induces a quotient network. This quotient network is investigated as well. In the literature this model was already studied, but unfortunately the results stated there are invalid, as we will show in this paper. It turns out that certain types of behaviour are never possible or appear in the system only for some parameter values, contradicting what was stated before in the literature. Moreover, the parameter space (-1,1)x(-1,1) is divided into four regions where we observe either irregular behaviour, or preference to follow an itinerary consisting of strategies for which one or the other agent does not lose, or they alternate in winning. These regions in parameter space are separated by two analytical curves and lines where the game is either symmetric (system is not $C^1$ linearisable at stationary saddle points) or is zero-sum and the system is Hamiltonian. On each of these curves we observe different bifurcation scenarios: e.g. transition from order to chaos, or from one kind of stability to another kind, or just loss of one dimension of the local stable manifold of the subcycle.

Judson Wynne|Samson Phan|Matteo Crismani|Akshata Krishnamurthy|Kristen K. John|Kevin DeBruin|Charles J. Budney|Karl L. Mitchell	  Saturn's moon Enceladus offers a unique opportunity in the search for life and habitable environments beyond Earth, a key theme of the National Research Council's 2013-2022 Decadal Survey. A plume of water vapor and ice spews from Enceladus's south polar region. Cassini data suggest that this plume, sourced by a liquid reservoir beneath the moon's icy crust, contain organics, salts, and water-rock interaction derivatives. Thus, the ingredients for life as we know it-- liquid water, chemistry, and energy sources-- are available in Enceladus's subsurface ocean. We have only to sample the plumes to investigate this hidden ocean environment. We present a New Frontiers class, solar-powered Enceladus orbiter that would take advantage of this opportunity, Testing the Habitability of Enceladus's Ocean (THEO). Developed by the 2015 Jet Propulsion Laboratory Planetary Science Summer School student participants under the guidance of TeamX, this mission concept includes remote sensing and in situ analyses with a mass spectrometer, a sub-mm radiometer-spectrometer, a camera, and two magnetometers. These instruments were selected to address four key questions for ascertaining the habitability of Enceladus's ocean within the context of the moon's geological activity: (1) How are the plumes and ocean connected? (2) Are the abiotic conditions of the ocean suitable for habitability? (3) How stable is the ocean environment? (4) Is there evidence of biological processes? By taking advantage of the opportunity Enceladus's plumes offer, THEO represents a viable, solar-powered option for exploring a potentially habitable ocean world of the outer solar system.

Hogerheijde|C. P. Folsom|A. Miotello|D. Fedele|A. Belloche|R. Güsten|F. Wyrowski	  The composition of planetary solids and gases is largely rooted in the processing of volatile elements in protoplanetary disks. To shed light on the key processes, we carry out a comparative analysis of the gas-phase carbon abundance in two systems with a similar age and disk mass, but different central stars: HD 100546 and TW Hya. We combine our recent detections of C$^{0}$ in these disks with observations of other carbon reservoirs (CO, C$^{+}$, C$_{2}$H) and gas mass and warm gas tracers (HD, O$^{0}$), as well as spatially resolved ALMA observations and the spectral energy distribution. The disks are modelled with the DALI 2D physical-chemical code. Stellar abundances for HD 100546 are derived from archival spectra. Upper limits on HD emission from HD 100546 place an upper limit on the total disk mass of $\leq0.1\,M_{\odot}$. The gas-phase carbon abundance in the atmosphere of this warm Herbig disk is at most moderately depleted compared to the interstellar medium, with [C]/[H]$_{\rm gas}=(0.1-1.5)\times 10^{-4}$. HD 100546 itself is a $\lambda\,$Bo\"{o}tis star, with solar abundances of C and O but a strong depletion of rock-forming elements. In the gas of the T Tauri disk TW Hya, both C and O are strongly underabundant, with [C]/[H]$_{\rm gas}=(0.2-5.0)\times 10^{-6}$ and C/O${>}1$. We discuss evidence that the gas-phase C and O abundances are high in the warm inner regions of both disks. Our analytical model, including vertical mixing and a grain size distribution, reproduces the observed [C]/[H]$_{\rm gas}$ in the outer disk of TW Hya and allows to make predictions for other systems. 	
1605.08479v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.08479v1	2016	Evaluating the paleomagnetic potential of single zircon crystals using   the Bishop Tuff	Roger R. Fu|Benjamin P. Weiss|Eduardo A. Lima|Pauli Kehayias|Jefferson F. D. F. Araujo|David R. Glenn|Jeff Gelb|Joshua F. Einsle|Ann M. Bauer|Richard J. Harrison|Guleed A. H. Ali|Ronald L. Walsworth	  Zircon crystals offer a unique combination of suitability for high-precision radiometric dating and high resistance to alteration. Paleomagnetic experiments on ancient zircons may potentially constrain the earliest geodynamo, which holds broad implications for the early Earth interior and atmosphere. However, the ability of zircons to record accurately the geomagnetic field has not been fully demonstrated. Here we conduct thermal and room temperature alternating field (AF) paleointensity experiments on 767.1 thousand year old (ka) zircons from the Bishop Tuff, California. The rapid emplacement of these zircons in a well-characterized magnetic field provides a high-fidelity test of the zircons intrinsic paleomagnetic recording accuracy. Successful dual heating experiments on nine zircons measured using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) microscope yield a mean paleointensity of 46.2 +/- 18.8 microtesla (1sigma), which agrees closely with high-precision results from Bishop Tuff whole rock (43.0 +/- 3.2 microtesla). High-resolution quantum diamond magnetic mapping, electron microscopy, and X-ray tomography indicate that the bulk of the remanent magnetization in Bishop Tuff zircons is carried by Fe oxides associated with apatite inclusions, which would be susceptible to destruction via metamorphism and aqueous alteration in older zircons. As such, while zircons can reliably record the geomagnetic field, robust zircon-derived paleomagnetic results require careful characterization of the ferromagnetic carrier and demonstration of their occurrence in primary inclusions. We further conclude that a combination of quantum diamond magnetometry and high-resolution imaging can provide detailed, direct characterization of the ferromagnetic mineralogy of geological samples.

Todd Hoeksema|Rick S. Bogart|Rock I. Bush|Tom L. Duvall|Yang Liu|Aimee A. Norton|Philip H. Scherrer	  NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) was launched 11 February 2010 with 3 instruments on board, including the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI). Since beginning normal operations on 1 May 2010, HMI has observed the Sun's entire visible disk almost continuously. HMI collects sequences of polarized filtergrams taken at a fixed cadence with two 4096 x 4096 cameras from which are computed arcsecond-resolution maps of photospheric observables: the line-of-sight (LoS) velocity and magnetic field, continuum intensity, line width, line depth, and the Stokes polarization parameters, I Q U V, at 6 wavelengths. Two processing pipelines implemented at the SDO Joint Science Operations Center (JSOC) at Stanford University compute observables from calibrated Level-1 filtergrams. One generates LoS quantities every 45s, and the other, primarily for the vector magnetic field, computes averages on a 720s cadence. Corrections are made for static and temporally changing CCD characteristics, bad pixels, image alignment and distortion, polarization irregularities, filter-element uncertainty and non-uniformity, as well as Sun-spacecraft velocity. This report explains issues affecting the resulting physical quantities, describes the impact of regular updates to the instrument calibration, and shows how the computations are optimized for actual HMI observations. During the 5 years of the SDO prime mission, regular calibration sequences have been used to regularly improve and update the instrument calibration and to monitor instrument changes. The instrument more than satisfies the original specifications for data quality and continuity. The procedures described here still have significant room for improvement. The most significant remaining systematic errors are associated with the spacecraft orbital velocity.

The map was generated from a combination of Cassini Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Imaging Science Subsystem imaging products, as well as altimetry, SARTopo and radargrammetry topographic datasets. In combining imagery with topographic data, our geomorphologic map reveals a stratigraphic sequence from which we infer process interactions between units. In mapping both polar regions with the same geomorphologic units, we conclude that processes that formed the terrains of the north polar region also acted to form the landscape we observe at the south. Uniform, SAR-dark plains are interpreted as sedimentary deposits, and are bounded by moderately dissected uplands. These plains contain the highest density of filled and empty lake depressions, and canyons. These units unconformably overlay a basement rock that outcrops as mountains and SAR-bright dissected terrains at various elevations across both poles. All these units are then superposed by surficial units that slope towards the seas, suggestive of subsequent overland transport of sediment. From estimates of the depths of the embedded empty depressions and canyons that drain into the seas, the SAR-dark plains must be >600 m thick in places, though the thickness may vary across the poles. At the lowest elevations of each polar region, there are large seas, which are currently liquid methane/ethane filled at the north and empty at the south. The large plains deposits and the surrounding hillslopes may represent remnant landforms that are a result of previously vast polar oceans, where larger liquid bodies may have allowed for a sustained accumulation of soluble and insoluble sediments, potentially forming layered sedimentary deposits. Coupled with vertical crustal movements, the resulting layers would be of varying solubilities and erosional resistances.

Saturn's rings are massive and made of 90-95% of water ice. In contrast, the much less massive rings of Uranus and Neptune are dark and likely to have higher rock fraction. Here we investigate, for the first time, the tidal disruption of a passing object, including the subsequent formation of planetary rings. First, we perform SPH simulations of the tidal destruction of big differentiated objects ($M_{\rm body}=10^{21-23}$) that experience close encounters with Saturn or Uranus. We find that about $0.1-10$% of the mass of the passing body is gravitationally captured around the planet. However, these fragments are initially big chunks and have highly eccentric orbits around the planet. Then, we perform N-body simulations including the planet's oblateness, starting with data obtained from the SPH simulations. Our N-body simulations show that the chunks are tidally destroyed during their next several orbits. Their individual orbits then start to precess incoherently around the planet's equator, which enhances their encounter velocities on longer-term evolution, resulting in more destructive impacts. These collisions would damp their eccentricities resulting in a progressive collapse of the debris cloud into a thin equatorial and low-eccentricity ring. These high energy impacts are expected to be catastrophic enough to produce small particles. Our numerical results also show that the mass of formed rings is large enough to explain current rings including inner regular satellites around Saturn and Uranus. In the case of Uranus, a body can go deeper inside the planet's Roche limit resulting in a more efficient capture of rocky material compared to Saturn's case in which mostly ice is captured. Thus, our results can naturally explain the compositional difference between the rings of Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.

The coordination number of the entering cations was found to play an important role in dictating the reaction pathways. The exchanges with tetrahedrally coordinated cations (i.e. with coordination number 4), such as Cd2+ or Hg2+, yielded monocrystalline CdTe or HgTe nanocrystals with Cu2-xTe/CdTe or Cu2-xTe/HgTe Janus-like heterostructures as intermediates. The formation of Janus-like architectures was attributed to the high diffusion rate of the relatively small tetrahedrally coordinated cations, which could rapidly diffuse in the Cu2-xTe NCs and nucleate the CdTe (or HgTe) phase in a preferred region of the host structure. Also, with both Cd2+ and Hg2+ ions the exchange led to wurtzite CdTe and HgTe phases rather than the more stable zinc-blende ones, indicating that the anion framework of the starting Cu2- xTe particles could be more easily deformed to match the anion framework of the metastable wurtzite structures. As hexagonal HgTe had never been reported to date, this represents another case of metastable new phases that can only be accessed by cation exchange. On the other hand, the exchanges involving octahedrally coordinated ions (i.e. with coordination number 6), such as Pb2+ or Sn2+, yielded rock-salt polycrystalline PbTe or SnTe nanocrystals with Cu2-xTe@PbTe or Cu2-xTe@SnTe core@shell architectures at the early stages of the exchange process. In this case, the octahedrally coordinated ions are probably too large to diffuse easily through the Cu2-xTe structure: their limited diffusion rate restricts their initial reaction to the surface of the nanocrystals, where cation exchange is initiated unselectively, leading to core@shell architectures.

Lobanov|Han Hsu|Jung-Fu Lin|Takashi Yoshino|Alexander F. Goncharov	  Iron spin transition directly affects properties of lower mantle minerals and can thus alter geophysical and geochemical characteristics of the deep Earth. While the spin transition in ferropericlase has been vigorously established at P ~ 60 GPa and 300 K, experimental evidence for spin transitions in other rock-forming minerals, such as bridgmanite and post-perovskite, remains controversial. Multiple valence, spin, and coordination states of iron in bridgmanite and post-perovskite are difficult to resolve with conventional spin-probing techniques. Optical spectroscopy, on the other hand, is sensitive to high/low spin ferrous/ferric iron at different sites; thus, it can be a powerful probe for spin transitions. Here we establish the optical signature of low spin Fe3+O6, a plausible low spin unit in bridgmanite and post-perovskite, by optical absorption experiments in diamond anvil cells. We show that the optical absorption of Fe3+O6 in NAL (new aluminous phase) is very sensitive to the iron spin state and represents a model behavior of bridgmanite and post-perovskite in the deep lower mantle across a spin transition. Specifically, an absorption band centered at ~ 19000 cm-1 is characteristic of the 2T2g to 2T1g (2A2g) transition in low spin Fe3+ in NAL at 40 GPa. This new spectroscopic information constrains the crystal field splitting energy of low spin Fe3+ to ~ 22200 cm-1 which we also independently confirm by our first-principles calculations. Together with available information on the electronic structure of Fe3+O6-compounds, we constrain the spin-pairing energy of Fe3+ in an octahedral field to ~ 20000-23000 cm-1. This implies that octahedrally-coordinated Fe3+ in bridgmanite is low spin at P > ~ 40 GPa.

Pasquali|C. Allende Prieto|B. Rock|D. S. Aguado|R. F. Peletier	  We present a joint analysis of the four most prominent sodium-sensitive features (NaD, NaI8190, NaI1.14, and NaI2.21), in the optical and Near-Infrared spectral range, of two nearby, massive (sigma~300km/s), early-type galaxies (named XSG1 and XSG2). Our analysis relies on deep VLT/X-Shooter long-slit spectra, along with newly developed stellar population models, allowing for [Na/Fe] variations, up to 1.2dex, over a wide range of age, total metallicity, and IMF slope. The new models show that the response of the Na-dependent spectral indices to [Na/Fe] is stronger when the IMF is bottom heavier. For the first time, we are able to match all four Na features in the central regions of massive early-type galaxies, finding an overabundance of [Na/Fe], in the range 0.5-0.7dex, and a bottom-heavy IMF. Therefore, individual abundance variations cannot be fully responsible for the trends of gravity-sensitive indices, strengthening the case towards a non-universal IMF. Given current limitations of theoretical atmosphere models, our [Na/Fe] estimates should be taken as upper limits. For XSG1, where line strengths are measured out to 0.8Re, the radial trend of [Na/Fe] is similar to [Mg/Fe] and [C/Fe], being constant out to 0.5Re, and decreasing by 0.2-0.3dex at 0.8Re, without any clear correlation with local metallicity. Such a result seems to be in contrast with the predicted increase of Na nucleosynthetic yields from AGB stars and TypeII SNe. For XSG1, the Na-inferred IMF radial profile is consistent, within the errors, with that derived from TiO features and the Wing-Ford band, presented in a recent paper.

McClusky|K. Menzies|D. Messier|G. Roberts|J. Robertson|J. Rock|R. Sabo|D. Skillman|J. Ulowetz|T. Vanmunster	  We present an analysis of photometric observations of the eclipsing novalike variable DW UMa made by the CBA consortium between 1999 and 2015. Analysis of 372 new and 260 previously published eclipse timings reveals a 13.6 year period or quasi-period in the times of minimum light. The seasonal light curves show a complex spectrum of periodic signals: both positive and negative superhumps, likely arising from a prograde apsidal precession and a retrograde nodal precession of the accretion disc. These signals appear most prominently and famously as sidebands of the orbital frequency but the precession frequencies themselves, at 0.40 and 0.22 cycles per day, are also seen directly in the power spectrum. The superhumps are sometimes seen together and sometimes separately. The depth, width and skew of eclipses are all modulated in phase with both nodal and apsidal precession of the tilted and eccentric accretion disc. The superhumps, or more correctly the precessional motions which produce them, may be essential to understanding the mysterious SW Sextantis syndrome. Disc wobble and eccentricity can both produce Doppler signatures inconsistent with the true dynamical motions in the binary, and disc wobble might boost the mass-transfer rate by enabling the hot white dwarf to directly irradiate the secondary star.

A sample of ~1000 stopping muons produced by charged current interactions of CNGS {\nu}{\mu} in the surrounding rock at the INFN Gran Sasso underground Laboratory provides an ideal benchmark in the few-GeV range since their momentum can be directly and independently obtained by the calorimetric measurement. Stopping muon momentum in the 0.5- 4.5 GeV/c range has been reconstructed via Multiple Coulomb Scattering with resolution ranging from 10 to 25 % depending on muon energy, track length and uniformity of the electric field in the drift volume. 	
1701.05822v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.05822v1	2017	Laboratory Observations and Simulations of Phase Reddening	S. E. Schröder|Y. Grynko|A. Pommerol|H. U. Keller|N. Thomas|T. L. Roush	  The visible reflectance spectrum of many solar system bodies changes with changing viewing geometry for reasons not fully understood. It is often observed to redden (increasing spectral slope) with increasing solar phase angle, an effect known as phase reddening. Only once, in an observation of the Martian surface by the Viking 1 lander, was reddening observed up to a certain phase angle with bluing beyond, making the reflectance ratio as a function of phase angle shaped like an arch. However, in laboratory experiments this arch-shape is frequently encountered. To investigate this, we measured the bidirectional reflectance of particulate samples of several common rock types in the 400-1000 nm wavelength range and performed ray-tracing simulations. We confirm the occurrence of the arch for surfaces that are forward scattering, i.e. are composed of semi-transparent particles and are smooth on the scale of the particles, and for which the reflectance increases from the lower to the higher wavelength in the reflectance ratio. The arch shape is reproduced by the simulations, which assume a smooth surface. However, surface roughness on the scale of the particles, such as the Hapke and van Horn (1963) fairy castles that can spontaneously form when sprinkling a fine powder, leads to monotonic reddening. A further consequence of this form of microscopic roughness (being indistinct without the use of a microscope) is a flattening of the disk function at visible wavelengths, i.e. Lommel-Seeliger-type scattering. The experiments further reveal monotonic reddening for reflectance ratios at near-IR wavelengths. The simulations fail to reproduce this particular reddening, and we suspect that it results from roughness on the surface of the particles. Given that the regolith of atmosphereless solar system bodies is composed of small particles, our results indicate that the prevalence of monotonic (...)

Waber|Therese Weissbach|Jake C. Zappala|Roland Purtschert	  Analyses for $^{81}$Kr and noble gases on groundwater from the deepest aquifer system of the Baltic Artesian Basin (BAB) were performed to determine groundwater ages and uncover the flow dynamics of the system on a timescale of several hundred thousand years. We find that the system is controlled by mixing of three distinct water masses: Interglacial or recent meteoric water $(\delta^{18}\text{O} \approx -10.4\unicode{x2030})$ with a poorly evolved chemical and noble gas signature, glacial meltwater $(\delta^{18}\text{O} \leq -18\unicode{x2030})$ with elevated noble gas concentrations, and an old, high-salinity brine component $(\delta^{18}\text{O} \geq -4.5\unicode{x2030}, \geq 90 \text{g Cl}^{-}/\text{L})$ with strongly depleted atmospheric noble gas concentrations. The $^{81}$Kr measurements are interpreted within this mixing framework to estimate the age of the end-members. Deconvoluted $^{81}$Kr ages range from 300 ka to 1.3 Ma for interglacial or recent meteoric water and glacial meltwater. For the brine component, ages exceed the dating range of the ATTA 3 instrument of 1.3 Ma. The radiogenic noble gas components $^{4}$He* and $^{40}$Ar* are less conclusive but also support an age of > 1 Ma for the brine. Based on the chemical and noble gas concentrations and the dating results, we conclude that the brine originates from evaporated seawater that has been modified by later water-rock interaction. As the obtained tracer ages cover several glacial cycles, we discuss the impact of the glacial cycles on flow patterns in the studied aquifer system. 	
1703.03212v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.03212v2	2017	Second order structural phase transitions, free energy curvature, and   temperature-dependent anharmonic phonons in the self-consistent harmonic   approximation: theory and stochastic implementation	Raffaello Bianco|Ion Errea|Lorenzo Paulatto|Matteo Calandra|Francesco Mauri	  The self-consistent harmonic approximation is an effective harmonic theory to calculate the free energy of systems with strongly anharmonic atomic vibrations, and its stochastic implementation has proved to be an efficient method to study, from first-principles, the anharmonic properties of solids. The free energy as a function of average atomic positions (centroids) can be used to study quantum or thermal lattice instability. In particular the centroids are order parameters in second-order structural phase transitions such as, e.g., charge-density-waves or ferroelectric instabilities. According to Landau's theory, the knowledge of the second derivative of the free energy (i.e. the curvature) with respect to the centroids in a high-symmetry configuration allows the identification of the phase-transition and of the instability modes. In this work we derive the exact analytic formula for the second derivative of the free energy in the self-consistent harmonic approximation for a generic atomic configuration. The analytic derivative is expressed in terms of the atomic displacements and forces in a form that can be evaluated by a stochastic technique using importance sampling. Our approach is particularly suitable for applications based on first-principles density-functional-theory calculations, where the forces on atoms can be obtained with a negligible computational effort compared to total energy determination. Finally we propose a dynamical extension of the theory to calculate spectral properties of strongly anharmonic phonons, as probed by inelastic scattering processes. We illustrate our method with a numerical application on a toy model that mimics the ferroelectric transition in rock-salt crystals such as SnTe or GeTe.

Abrikosov	  We present a detailed theoretical study of the electronic, magnetic, and structural properties of magnesiow\"ustite Fe$_{1-x}$Mg$_x$O with $x$ in the range between 0$-$0.875 using a fully charge self-consistent implementation of the density functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT) method. In particular, we compute the electronic structure and phase stability of the rock-salt B1-structured (Fe,Mg)O at high pressures relevant for the Earth's lower mantle. We obtain that upon compression paramagnetic (Fe,Mg)O exhibits a spin-state transition of Fe$^{2+}$ ions from a high-spin to low-spin (HS-LS) state which is accompanied by a collapse of local magnetic moments. The HS-LS transition results in a substantial drop of the lattice volume by about 4$-$8 %, implying a complex interplay between electronic and lattice degrees of freedom. Our results reveal a strong sensitivity of the calculated transition pressure $P_{\rm tr.}$ upon addition of Mg. While for Fe-rich magnesiow\"ustite, Mg $x < 0.5$, $P_{\rm tr.}$ exhibits a rather weak variation at $\sim$80 GPa, for Fe-poor (Fe,Mg)O it drops, e.g., by about 35 % to 52 GPa for Mg $x=0.75$. This behavior is accompanied by a substantial change of the spin transition range from 50$-$140 GPa in FeO to 30$-$90 GPa for $x=0.75$. In addition, the calculated bulk modulus (in the HS state) is found to increase by $\sim$12 % from 142 GPa in FeO to 159 GPa in (Fe,Mg)O with Mg $x=0.875$. We find that the pressure-induced HS-LS transition has different consequences for the electronic properties of the Fe-rich and poor (Fe,Mg)O. For the Fe-rich (Fe,Mg)O, the transition is found to be accompanied by a Mott insulator to (semi-) metal phase transition. In contrast to that, for $x>0.25$, (Fe,Mg)O remains insulating up to the highest studied pressures, implying a Mott insulator to band insulator phase transition at the HS-LS transformation.

Rendon	  From 1996 to 2015 sixteen main belt asteroids were discovered exhibiting cometary activity (less than one per year), all of them during searches at the telescope. In this work we will explore another way to discover them. We reduced 192016 magnitude observations of 165 asteroids of the Themis family, using data from the astrometric-photometric database of the Minor Planet Center, MPCOBS, and measuring the absolute magnitudes from the phase plots. 25 objects of 165 (15.2%), exhibited bumps or enhancements in brightness that might indicate low level cometary activity. Since activity repeats at the same place in different orbits and in many occasions is centered at perihelion, activity might be due to water ice sublimation. As of September 2016, there are 717768 asteroids listed in the MPC files. If we assume that we do not have any false positives and the above percentage can be extrapolated to the whole Main Belt, the number of potentially active asteroid gets to the very large number of ~111.000. This number is much larger than the ones predicted in previous surveys and indicates one of three scenarios: A) there are many false positives in our detections and the real number of active asteroid is much smaller than we found, implying that the MPC astrometric-photometric database is only astrometric and not photometric. B) The location of active asteroids is restricted to the Themis family and an extrapolation to the whole belt is not possible. Or C) there are few false positives in our candidates and the main belt actually contains many low level active asteroids undetected by current surveys. Case C) would imply that the main belt is not a field of bare rocks but a graveyard of extinct comets, changing our current paradigm of the main belt. So it is of the outmost importance to verify observationally our candidates, and determine which of these scenarios is valid.

For astrophysical tau neutrinos we take generic power-law flux, $E^{-2}$ and the cosmogenic flux initiated by the protons. We calculate tau energy loss in several approaches, such as dipole models and the phenomenological approach in which parameterization of the $F_2$ is used. We evaluate the tau neutrino charged-current cross section using the same approaches for consistency. We find that uncertainty in the neutrino cross section and in the tau energy loss partially compensate giving very small theoretical uncertainty in the emerging tau flux for distances ranging from $2$ km to $100$ km and for the energy range between $10^6$ GeV and $10^{11}$ GeV, focusing on energies above $10^8$ GeV. When we consider uncertainties in the neutrino cross section, inelasticity in neutrino interactions and the tau energy loss, which are not correlated, i.e. they are not all calculated in the same approach, theoretical uncertainty ranges from about $30\%$ and $60 \%$ at $10^8$ GeV to about factors of 3.3 and 3.8 at $10^{11}$ GeV for the $E^{-2}$ flux and the cosmogenic flux, respectively, for the distance of 10 km rock. The spread in predictions significantly increases for much larger distances, e.g., $\sim 1,000$ km. Most of the uncertainty comes from the treatment of photonuclear interactions of the tau in transit through large distances. We also consider Monte Carlo calculation of the tau propagation and we find that the result for the emerging tau flux is in agreement with the result obtained using analytic approach. Our results are relevant to several experiments that are looking for skimming astrophysical taus, such as the Pierre Auger Observatory, HAWC and Ashra. We evaluate the aperture for the Auger and discuss briefly application to the the other two experiments.

Amundsen	  H$_2$O is a key molecule in characterizing atmospheres of temperate terrestrial planets, and observations of transmission spectra are expected to play a primary role in detecting its signatures in the near future. The detectability of H$_2$O absorption features in transmission spectra depends on the abundance of water vapor in the upper part of the atmosphere. We study the three-dimensional distribution of atmospheric H$_2$O for synchronously rotating Earth-sized aquaplanets using the general circulation model (GCM) ROCKE-3D, and examine the effects of total incident flux and stellar spectral type. We observe a more gentle increase of the water vapor mixing ratio in response to increased incident flux than one-dimensional models suggest, in qualitative agreement with the climate-stabilizing effect of clouds around the substellar point previously observed in GCMs applied to synchronously rotating planets. However, the water vapor mixing ratio in the upper atmosphere starts to increase while the surface temperature is still moderate. This is explained by the circulation in the upper atmosphere being driven by the radiative heating due to absorption by water vapor and cloud particles, causing efficient vertical transport of water vapor. Consistently, the water vapor mixing ratio is found to be well-correlated with the near-infrared portion of the incident flux. We also simulate transmission spectra based on the GCM outputs, and show that for the more highly irradiated planets, the H$_2$O signatures may be strengthened by a factor of a few, loosening the observational demands for a H$_2$O detection.

Dupré|M. D. Neumann|A. Kwasniewski|D. G. Schlom|M. Bickermann	  Terbium titanate (Tb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$) is a spin-ice material with remarkable magneto-optical properties. It has a high Verdet constant and is a promising substrate crystal for the epitaxy of quantum materials with the pyrochlore structure. Large single crystals with adequate quality of Tb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ or any pyrochlore are not available so far. Here we report the growth of high-quality bulk crystals using the Czochralski method to pull crystals from the melt. Prior work using the automated Czochralski method has suffered from growth instabilities like diameter fluctuation, foot formation and subsequent spiraling shortly after the seeding stage. In this study, the volumes of the crystals were strongly increased to several cubic centimeters by means of manual growth control, leading to crystal diameters up to 40 mm and crystal lengths up to 10 mm. Rocking curve measurements revealed full width at half maximum values between 28 and 40" for 222 reflections. The specific heat capacity c$_p$ was measured between room temperature and 1573 K by dynamic differential scanning calorimetry and shows the typical slow parabolic rise. In contrast, the thermal conductivity \kappa(T) shows a minimum near 700 K and increases at higher temperature T. Optical spectroscopy was performed at room temperature from the ultraviolet to the near infrared region, and additionally in the near infrared region up to 1623 K. The optical transmission properties and the crystal color are interpreted to be influenced by partial oxidation of Tb$^{3+}$ to Tb$^{4+}$.

Percus|Jeffrey D. Hyman|Gowri Srinivasan|Hari S. Viswanathan	  Structural and topological information play a key role in modeling flow and transport through fractured rock in the subsurface. Discrete fracture network (DFN) computational suites such as dfnWorks are designed to simulate flow and transport in such porous media. Flow and transport calculations reveal that a small backbone of fractures exists, where most flow and transport occurs. Restricting the flowing fracture network to this backbone provides a significant reduction in the network's effective size. However, the particle tracking simulations needed to determine the reduction are computationally intensive. Such methods may be impractical for large systems or for robust uncertainty quantification of fracture networks, where thousands of forward simulations are needed to bound system behavior.   In this paper, we develop an alternative network reduction approach to characterizing transport in DFNs, by combining graph theoretical and machine learning methods. We consider a graph representation where nodes signify fractures and edges denote their intersections. Using random forest and support vector machines, we rapidly identify a subnetwork that captures the flow patterns of the full DFN, based primarily on node centrality features in the graph. Our supervised learning techniques train on particle-tracking backbone paths found by dfnWorks, but run in negligible time compared to those simulations. We find that our predictions can reduce the network to approximately 20% of its original size, while still generating breakthrough curves consistent with those of the original network. 	
1706.03687v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03687v2	2017	Optical response of highly reflective film used in the water Cherenkov   muon veto of the XENON1T dark matter experiment	Christopher Geis|Cyril Grignon|Uwe Oberlack|Diego Ramírez García|Quirin Weitzel	  The XENON1T experiment is the most recent stage of the XENON Dark Matter Search, aiming for the direct detection of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). To reach its projected sensitivity, the background has to be reduced by two orders of magnitude compared to its predecessor XENON100. This requires a water Cherenkov muon veto surrounding the XENON1T TPC, both to shield external backgrounds and to tag muon-induced energetic neutrons through detection of a passing muon or the secondary shower induced by a muon interacting in the surrounding rock. The muon veto is instrumented with $84$ $8"$ PMTs with high quantum efficiency (QE) in the Cherenkov regime and the walls of the watertank are clad with the highly reflective DF2000MA foil by 3M. Here, we present a study of the reflective properties of this foil, as well as the measurement of its wavelength shifting (WLS) properties. Further, we present the impact of reflectance and WLS on the detection efficiency of the muon veto, using a Monte Carlo simulation carried out with Geant4. The measurements yield a specular reflectance of $\approx100\%$ for wavelengths larger than $400\,$nm, while $\approx90\%$ of the incoming light below $370\,$nm is absorbed by the foil. Approximately $3-7.5\%$ of the light hitting the foil within the wavelength range $250\,$nm $\leq \lambda \leq 390\,$nm is used for the WLS process. The intensity of the emission spectrum of the WLS light is slightly dependent on the absorbed wavelength and shows the shape of a rotational-vibrational fluorescence spectrum, peaking at around $\lambda \approx 420\,$nm. Adjusting the reflectance values to the measured ones in the Monte Carlo simulation originally used for the muon veto design, the veto detection efficiency remains unchanged. Including the wavelength shifting in the Monte Carlo simulation leads to an increase of the efficiency of approximately $0.5\%$.

Wong|Hao-Yang Xing|Qian Yue|Jing-Jun Zhu	  We report on the measurements of the fluxes and spectra of the environmental fast neutron background at the China Jinping Underground Laboratory (CJPL) with a rock overburden of about 6700 meters water equivalent, using a liquid scintillator detector doped with 0.5% gadolinium. The signature of a prompt nuclear recoil followed by a delayed high energy $\gamma$-ray cascade is used to identify neutron events. The large energy deposition of the delayed $\gamma$-rays from the $(n, \gamma)$ reaction on gadolinium, together with the excellent n-$\gamma$ discrimination capability provides a powerful background suppression which allows the measurement of a low intensity neutron flux. The neutron flux of $(1.51\pm0.03(stat.)\pm0.10(syst.))\times10^{-7}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ in the energy range of 1 -- 10 MeV in the Hall A of CJPL was measured based on 356 days of data. In the same energy region, measurement with the same detector placed in a one meter thick polyethylene room gives a significantly lower flux of $(4.9\pm0.9(stat.)\pm0.5(syst.))\times10^{-9}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ with 174 days of data. This represents a measurement of the lowest environmental fast neutron background among the underground laboratories in the world, prior to additional experiment-specific attenuation. Additionally, the fast neutron spectra both in the Hall A and the polyethylene room were reconstructed with the help of GEANT4 simulation.

Vervack|Yanga R. Fernandez|Tushar Mittal|Christine H. Chen	  We have obtained new NASA IRTF SpeX spectra of the HR 4796A debris ring system. We find a unique red excess flux that extends out to ~9 um in Spitzer IRS spectra, where thermal emission from cold, ~100K dust from the system's ring at ~75 AU takes over. Matching imaging ring photometry, we find the excess consists of NIR reflectance from the ring which is as red as that of old, processed comet nuclei, plus a tenuous thermal emission component from close-in, T ~ 850 K circumstellar material evincing an organic plus silicate emission feature complex at 7 - 13 um. Unusual, emission-like features due to atomic Si, S, Ca, and Sr were found at 0.96 - 1.07 um, likely sourced by rocky dust evaporating in the 850 K component. An empirical cometary dust phase function can reproduce the scattered light excess and 1:5 balance of scattered vs. thermal energy for the ring with optical depth Tau > 0.10 in an 8 AU wide belt of 4 AU vertical height and Mdust > 0.1-0.7 M_Mars. Our results are consistent with HR 4796A consisting of a narrow sheparded ring of devolatilized cometary material associated with multiple rocky planetesimal subcores, and a small steady stream of dust inflowing from this belt to a rock sublimation zone at approximately 1 AU from the primary. These subcores were built from comets that have been actively emitting large, reddish dust for > 0.4 Myr at 100K, the temperature at which cometary activity onset is seen in our Solar System.

Srinivasan	  Fractures form the main pathways for flow in the subsurface within low-permeability rock. For this reason, accurately predicting flow and transport in fractured systems is vital for improving the performance of subsurface applications. Fracture sizes in these systems can range from millimeters to kilometers. Although, modeling flow and transport using the discrete fracture network (DFN) approach is known to be more accurate due to incorporation of the detailed fracture network structure over continuum-based methods, capturing the flow and transport in such a wide range of scales is still computationally intractable. Furthermore, if one has to quantify uncertainty, hundreds of realizations of these DFN models have to be run. To reduce the computational burden, we solve flow and transport on a graph representation of a DFN. We study the accuracy of the graph approach by comparing breakthrough times and tracer particle statistical data between the graph-based and the high-fidelity DFN approaches, for fracture networks with varying number of fractures and degree of heterogeneity. We show that the graph approach shows a consistent bias with up to an order of magnitude slower breakthrough when compared to the DFN approach. We show that this is due to graph algorithm's under-prediction of the pressure gradients across intersections on a given fracture, leading to slower tracer particle speeds between intersections and longer travel times. We present a bias correction methodology to the graph algorithm that reduces the discrepancy between the DFN and graph predictions. We show that with this bias correction, the graph algorithm predictions significantly improve and the results are very accurate. The good accuracy and the low computational cost, with $O(10^4)$ times lower times than the DFN, makes the graph algorithm, an ideal technique to incorporate in uncertainty quantification methods.

Asteroids, due to their low gravity are a challenging target for surface exploration. Current missions envision performing touch-and-go operations over an asteroid surface. In this work, we analyse the feasibility of sending scores of nano-landers, each 1 kg in mass and volume of 1U, or 1000 cm3. These landers would hop, roll and fly over the asteroid surface. The landers would include science instruments such as stereo cameras, hand-lens imagers and spectrometers to characterize rock composition. A network of nano-landers situated on the surface of an asteroid can provide unique and very detailed measurements of a spacecraft impacting onto an asteroid surface. A full-scale, artificial impact experiment onto an asteroid can help characterize its composition and geology and help in the development of asteroid deflection techniques intended for planetary defence. Scores of nano-landers could provide multiple complementary views of the impact, resultant seismic activity and trajectory of the ejecta. The nano-landers can analyse the pristine, unearthed regolith shielded from effects of UV and cosmic rays and that may be millions of years old. Our approach to formulating this mission concepts utilizes automated machine learning techniques in the planning and design of space systems. We use a form of Darwinian selection to select and identify suitable number of nano-landers, the on-board instruments and control system to explore and navigate the asteroid environment. Scenarios are generated in simulation and evaluated against quantifiable mission goals such as area explored on the asteroid and amount of data recorded from the impact event.

Planets, however, are made truly habitable by both chemical and physical processes which regulate climatic and geochemical cycling between atmosphere, surface, and interior reservoirs. Despite this, "Earth-like" is often defined as a planet made of a mixture of rock and Fe that is roughly 1 Earth-density. To understand the interior of a terrestrial planet, the stellar abundances of planet-building elements (e.g. Mg, Si, and Fe) can be utilized as a proxy for the planet's composition. We explore the planetary mineralogy and structure for fictive planets around the 10 closest stars to the Sun using stellar abundances from the Hypatia Catalog. Despite our sample containing stars both sub- and super-solar in their abundances, we find that the mineralogies are very similar for all 10 planets -- since the error or spread in the stellar abundances create significant degeneracy in the models. We show that abundance uncertainties need to be on the order of [Fe/H] < 0.02 dex, [Si/H] < 0.01 dex, [Al/H] < 0.002 dex, while [Mg/H] and [Ca/H] < 0.001 dex, in order to distinguish two unique planetary populations in our sample of 10 stars. While these precisions are high, we believe they are possible given certain abundance techniques, in addition to methodological transparency, recently demonstrated in the literature. However, without these precisions, the uncertainty in planetary structures will be so high that we will be unable to say confidently that a planet is like the Earth, or unlike anything we've ever seen. 	
1710.06209v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.06209v2	2018	The nature of the giant exomoon candidate Kepler-1625 b-i	René Heller	  The recent announcement of a Neptune-sized exomoon candidate around the transiting Jupiter-sized object Kepler-1625 b could indicate the presence of a hitherto unknown kind of gas giant moons, if confirmed. Three transits have been observed, allowing radius estimates of both objects. Here we investigate possible mass regimes of the transiting system that could produce the observed signatures and study them in the context of moon formation in the solar system, i.e. via impacts, capture, or in-situ accretion. The radius of Kepler-1625 b suggests it could be anything from a gas giant planet somewhat more massive than Saturn (0.4 M_Jup) to a brown dwarf (BD) (up to 75 M_Jup) or even a very-low-mass star (VLMS) (112 M_Jup ~ 0.11 M_sun). The proposed companion would certainly have a planetary mass. Possible extreme scenarios range from a highly inflated Earth-mass gas satellite to an atmosphere-free water-rock companion of about 180 M_Ear. Furthermore, the planet-moon dynamics during the transits suggest a total system mass of 17.6_{-12.6}^{+19.2} M_Jup. A Neptune-mass exomoon around a giant planet or low-mass BD would not be compatible with the common mass scaling relation of the solar system moons about gas giants. The case of a mini-Neptune around a high-mass BD or a VLMS, however, would be located in a similar region of the satellite-to-host mass ratio diagram as Proxima b, the TRAPPIST-1 system, and LHS 1140 b. The capture of a Neptune-mass object around a 10 M_Jup planet during a close binary encounter is possible in principle. The ejected object, however, would have had to be a super-Earth object, raising further questions of how such a system could have formed. In summary, this exomoon candidate is barely compatible with established moon formation theories. If it can be validated as orbiting a super-Jovian planet, then it would pose an exquisite riddle for formation theorists to solve.

Huber|Michelle Elizabeth Jamer|Joachim Nsofini|Dmitry A Pushin|Dusan Sarenac|Ivar A. J. Taminiau|Albert Young	  Construction of silicon neutron interferometers requires a perfect crystal silicon ingot (5 cm to 30 cm long) be machined such that Bragg diffracting "blades" protrude from a common base. Leaving the interferometer blades connected to the same base preserves Bragg plane alignment, but if the interferometer contains crystallographic misalignments of greater than about 10 nrad between the blades, interference fringe visibility begins to suffer. Additionally, the parallelism, thickness, and distance between the blades must be machined to micron tolerances. Traditionally, interferometers do not exhibit usable interference fringe visibility until 30 $\mu$m to 60 $\mu$m of machining surface damage is chemically etched away. However, if too much material is removed, the uneven etch rates across the interferometer cause the shape of the crystal blades to be outside of the required tolerances. As a result, the ultimate interference fringe visibility varies widely among neutron interferometers that are created under similar conditions. We find that annealing a previously etched interferometer at $800^\circ \mathrm{C}$ dramatically increased interference fringe visibility from 23 % to 90 %. The Bragg plane misalignments were also measured before and after annealing using neutron rocking curve interference peaks, showing that Bragg plane alignment was improved across the interferometer after annealing. This suggests that current interferometers with low fringe visibility may be salvageable and that annealing may become an important step in the fabrication process of future neutron interferometers, leading to less need for chemical etching and larger, more exotic neutron interferometers.

Unbiased dust surveys with Spitzer leave us with good constraints on the dust dispersal timescale of small grains in the terrestrial planet forming region. In the ALMA era, this can be confronted for the first time also with evolutionary timescales of mm grains in the outer disk. Gas surveys in the context of the existing multi-wavelength dust surveys will be a key in large statistical studies of disk gas evolution. Unbiased gas surveys are limited to ALMA CO submm surveys, where the quantitative interpretation is still debated. Herschel gas surveys have been largely biased, but [OI] 63 mic surveys and also accretion tracers agree qualitatively with the evolutionary timescale of small grains in the inner disk. Recent advances achieved by means of consistent multi-wavelength studies of gas AND dust in planet forming disks reveal the subtleties of the quantitative interpretation of gas surveys. Observational methods to determine disk masses e.g. from CO submm lines require the knowledge of the dust properties in the disk. Understanding not only the gas evolution, but also its chemical composition will provide crucial input for planet formation models. Kinetic chemical results give profoundly different answers than thermodynamic equilibrium in terms of the C/O ratios as well as the water ice/rock ratios. Again, dust has a key impact on the chemical evolution and composition of the gas. Grain growth for example affects freeze-out processes and strongly increases the cosmic ray induced UV field.

However, the 54Cr isotope composition of the Moon relies on 2 samples only, which define an average value that is slightly different from the terrestrial standard. Here, by determining the Cr isotopic composition of 17 lunar, 9 terrestrial and 5 enstatite chondrite samples, we re-assess the isotopic similarity between these different planetary bodies, and provide the first robust estimate for the Moon. In average, terrestrial and enstatite samples show similar eps_54Cr. On the other hand, lunar samples show variables excesses of 53Cr and 54Cr compared to terrestrial and enstatite chondrites samples with correlated eps_53Cr and eps_54Cr (per 10,000 deviation of the 53Cr/52Cr and 54Cr/52Cr ratios normalized to the 50Cr/52Cr ratio from Cr standard). Unlike previous suggestions, we show for the first time that cosmic irradiation can affect significantly the Cr isotopic composition of lunar materials. Moreover, we also suggest that rather than spallation reactions, neutron capture effects are the dominant process controlling the Cr isotope composition of lunar igneous rocks. This is supported by the correlation between eps_53Cr and eps_54Cr, and 150Sm/152Sm ratios. After correction of these effects, the average eps_54Cr of the Moon is indistinguishable from the terrestrial and enstatite chondrite materials reinforcing the idea of an Earth-Moon-Enstatite chondrite system homogeneity. This is compatible with the most recent scenarios of Moon formation suggesting an efficient physical homogenization after a high-energy impact on a fast spinning Earth, and/or with an impactor originating from the same reservoir in the inner proto-planetary disk as the Earth and enstatite chondrites and having similar composition.

Gehlmann|C. Conlon|A. Keqi|A. Rattanachata|O. Karslıoğlu|J. Mueller|J. Sethian|H. Bluhm|J. E. Rault|J. P. Rueff|H. Fang|A. Javey|C. S. Fadley	  Free-standing nanoribbons of InAs quantum membranes (QMs) transferred onto a (Si/Mo) multilayer mirror substrate are characterized by hard x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HXPS), and by standing-wave HXPS (SW-HXPS). Information on the chemical composition and on the chemical states of the elements within the nanoribbons was obtained by HXPS and on the quantitative depth profiles by SW-HXPS. By comparing the experimental SW-HXPS rocking curves to x-ray optical calculations, the chemical depth profile of the InAs(QM) and its interfaces were quantitatively derived with angstrom precision. We determined that: i) the exposure to air induced the formation of an InAsO$_4$ layer on top of the stoichiometric InAs(QM); ii) the top interface between the air-side InAsO$_4$ and the InAs(QM) is not sharp, indicating that interdiffusion occurs between these two layers; iii) the bottom interface between the InAs(QM) and the native oxide SiO$_2$ on top of the (Si/Mo) substrate is abrupt. In addition, the valence band offset (VBO) between the InAs(QM) and the SiO$_2$/(Si/Mo) substrate was determined by HXPS. The value of $VBO = 0.2 \pm 0.04$ eV is in good agreement with literature results obtained by electrical characterization, giving a clear indication of the formation of a well-defined and abrupt InAs/SiO$_2$ heterojunction. We have demonstrated that HXPS and SW-HXPS are non-destructive, powerful methods for characterizing interfaces and for providing chemical depth profiles of nanostructures, quantum membranes, and 2D layered materials.

Bhave	  Cavity opto-mechanics enabled radiation-pressure coupling between optical and mechanical modes of a micro-mechanical resonator gives rise to dynamical backaction, enabling amplification and cooling of mechanical motion. Due to a combination of large mechanical oscillations and necessary saturation of amplification, the noise floor of the opto-mechanical resonator increases, rendering it ineffective at transducing small signals, and thereby cooling another mechanical resonance of the system. Here we show amplification of one mechanical resonance in a micro-mechanical ring resonator while simultaneously cooling another mechanical resonance by exploiting two closely spaced optical whispering gallery mode cavity resonances.

0512083v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0512083v2	2005	New directions in mechanism design	Jiangtao Meng	  Mechanism design uses the tools of economics and game theory to design rules of interaction for economic transactions that will,in principle, yield some de- sired outcome. In the last few years this field has received much interest of researchers in computer science, especially with the Internet developing as a platform for communications and connections among enormous numbers of computers and humans. Arguably the most positive result in mechanism de- sign is truthful and there are only one general truthful mechanisms so far : the generalized Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism. But VCG mecha- nism has one shortage: The implementation of truthfulness is on the cost of decreasing the revenue of the mechanism. (e.g., Ning Chen and Hong Zhu. [1999]). We introduce three new characters of mechanism:partly truthful, criti- cal, consistent, and introduce a new mechanism: X mechanism that satisfy the above three characters. Like VCG mechanism, X mechanism also generalizes from Vickery Auction and is consistent with Vickery auction in many ways, but the extended methods used in X mechanism is different from that in VCG mechanism . This paper will demonstrate that X mechanism better than VCG mechanism in optimizing utility of mechanism, which is the original intention of mechanism design. So partly truthful,critical and consistent are at least as important as truthful in mechanism design, and they beyond truthful in many situations.As a result, we conclude that partly truthful,critical and consistent are three new directions in mechanism design.

Xu|L. Yuan|X. Zheng|H. Zhu	  Cross sections for semi-inclusive electroproduction of charged pions ($\pi^{\pm}$) from both proton and deuteron targets were measured for $0.2<x<0.5$, $2<Q^2<4$ GeV$^2$, $0.3<z<1$, and $P_t^2<0.2$ GeV$^2$. For $P_t<0.1$ GeV, we find the azimuthal dependence to be small, as expected theoretically. For both $\pi^+$ and $\pi^-$, the $P_t$ dependence from the deuteron is found to be slightly weaker than from the proton. In the context of a simple model, this implies that the initial transverse momenta width of $d$ quarks is larger than for $u$ quarks and, contrary to expectations, the transverse momentum width of the favored fragmentation function is larger than the unfavored one.

Zhang	  Air-fluorescence detectors such as the High Resolution Fly's Eye (HiRes) detector are very sensitive to upward-going, Earth-skimming ultrahigh energy electron-neutrino-induced showers. This is due to the relatively large interaction cross sections of these high-energy neutrinos and to the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM) effect. The LPM effect causes a significant decrease in the cross sections for bremsstrahlung and pair production, allowing charged-current electron-neutrino-induced showers occurring deep in the Earth's crust to be detectable as they exit the Earth into the atmosphere. A search for upward-going neutrino-induced showers in the HiRes-II monocular dataset has yielded a null result. From an LPM calculation of the energy spectrum of charged particles as a function of primary energy and depth for electron-induced showers in rock, we calculate the shape of the resulting profile of these showers in air. We describe a full detector Monte Carlo simulation to determine the detector response to upward-going electron-neutrino-induced cascades and present an upper limit on the flux of electron-neutrinos.

Wyithe	  Antenna layout is an important design consideration for radio interferometers because it determines the quality of the snapshot point spread function (PSF, or array beam). This is particularly true for experiments targeting the 21 cm Epoch of Reionization signal as the quality of the foreground subtraction depends directly on the spatial dynamic range and thus the smoothness of the baseline distribution. Nearly all sites have constraints on where antennas can be placed---even at the remote Australian location of the MWA (Murchison Widefield Array) there are rock outcrops, flood zones, heritages areas, emergency runways and trees. These exclusion areas can introduce spatial structure into the baseline distribution that enhance the PSF sidelobes and reduce the angular dynamic range. In this paper we present a new method of constrained antenna placement that reduces the spatial structure in the baseline distribution. This method not only outperforms random placement algorithms that avoid exclusion zones, but surprisingly outperforms random placement algorithms without constraints to provide what we believe are the smoothest constrained baseline distributions developed to date. We use our new algorithm to determine antenna placements for the originally planned MWA, and present the antenna locations, baseline distribution, and snapshot PSF for this array choice.

And a Bellwether for   Cataclysmic-Variable Evolution	Joseph Patterson|Helena Uthas|Jonathan Kemp|Enrique de Miguel|Thomas Krajci|Jerry Foote|Franz-Josef Hambsch|Tut Campbell|George Roberts|David Cejudo|Shawn Dvorak|Tonny Vanmunster|Robert Koff|David Skillman|David Harvey|Brian Martin|John Rock|David Boyd|Arto Oksanen|Etienne Morelle|Joseph Ulowetz|Anthony Kroes|Richard Sabo|Lasse Jensen	  We summarize the results of a 20-year campaign to study the light curves of BK Lyncis, a nova-like star strangely located below the 2-3 hour orbital period gap in the family of cataclysmic variables. Two apparent "superhumps" dominate the nightly light curves - with periods 4.6% longer, and 3.0% shorter, than P_orb. The first appears to be associated with the star's brighter states (V~14), while the second appears to be present throughout and becomes very dominant in the low state (V~15.7).   Starting in the year 2005, the star's light curve became indistinguishable from that of a dwarf nova - in particular, that of the ER UMa subclass. Reviewing all the star's oddities, we speculate: (a) BK Lyn is the remnant of the probable nova on 30 December 101, and (b) it has been fading ever since, but has taken ~2000 years for the accretion rate to drop sufficiently to permit dwarf-nova eruptions. If such behavior is common, it can explain other puzzles of CV evolution. One: why the ER UMa class even exists (because all members can be remnants of recent novae). Two: why ER UMa stars and short-period novalikes are rare (because their lifetimes, which are essentially cooling times, are short). Three: why short-period novae all decline to luminosity states far above their true quiescence (because they're just getting started in their postnova cooling). Four: why the orbital periods, accretion rates, and white-dwarf temperatures of short-period CVs are somewhat too large to arise purely from the effects of gravitational radiation (because the unexpectedly long interval of enhanced postnova brightness boosts the mean mass-transfer rate). These are substantial rewards in return for one investment of hypothesis: that the second parameter in CV evolution, besides P_orb, is time since the last classical-nova eruption.

Thompson	  NASA's Kepler Mission has revealed two transiting planets orbiting Kepler-68. Follow-up Doppler measurements have established the mass of the innermost planet and revealed a third jovian-mass planet orbiting beyond the two transiting planets. Kepler-68b, in a 5.4 day orbit has mass 8.3 +/- 2.3 Earth, radius 2.31 +/- 0.07 Earth radii, and a density of 3.32 +/- 0.92 (cgs), giving Kepler-68b a density intermediate between that of the ice giants and Earth. Kepler-68c is Earth-sized with a radius of 0.953 Earth and transits on a 9.6 day orbit; validation of Kepler-68c posed unique challenges. Kepler-68d has an orbital period of 580 +/- 15 days and minimum mass of Msin(i) = 0.947 Jupiter. Power spectra of the Kepler photometry at 1-minute cadence exhibit a rich and strong set of asteroseismic pulsation modes enabling detailed analysis of the stellar interior. Spectroscopy of the star coupled with asteroseismic modeling of the multiple pulsation modes yield precise measurements of stellar properties, notably Teff = 5793 +/- 74 K, M = 1.079 +/- 0.051 Msun, R = 1.243 +/- 0.019 Rsun, and density 0.7903 +/- 0.0054 (cgs), all measured with fractional uncertainties of only a few percent. Models of Kepler-68b suggest it is likely composed of rock and water, or has a H and He envelope to yield its density of about 3 (cgs).

XENON is a dark matter direct detection project, consisting of a time projection chamber (TPC) filled with liquid xenon as detection medium. The construction of the next generation detector, XENON1T, is presently taking place at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS) in Italy. It aims at a sensitivity to spin-independent cross sections of $2 \cdot 10^{-47} ~ \mathrm{cm}^{\mathrm{2}}$ for WIMP masses around 50 GeV/c$^{2}$, which requires a background reduction by two orders of magnitude compared to XENON100, the current generation detector. An active system that is able to tag muons and muon-induced backgrounds is critical for this goal. A water Cherenkov detector of $\sim$10 m height and diameter has been therefore developed, equipped with 8 inch photomultipliers and cladded by a reflective foil. We present the design and optimization study for this detector, which has been carried out with a series of Monte Carlo simulations. The muon veto will reach very high detection efficiencies for muons ($>99.5%$) and showers of secondary particles from muon interactions in the rock ($>70%$). Similar efficiencies will be obtained for XENONnT, the upgrade of XENON1T, which will later improve the WIMP sensitivity by another order of magnitude. With the Cherenkov water shield studied here, the background from muon-induced neutrons in XENON1T is negligible.

Sári	  IW ../submit_V2/abstract.txt ( Row 1 Col 1 6:48 Ctrl-K H for help We report the discovery by the HATSouth network of HATS-7b, a transiting Super-Neptune with a mass of 0.120+/-0.012MJ, a radius of 0.563+/-(0.046,0.034)RJ, and an orbital period of 3.1853days. The host star is a moderately bright (V=13.340+/-0.010mag, K_S=10.976+/-0.026mag) K dwarf star with a mass of 0.849+/-0.027Msun , a radius of 0.815+/-(0.049,-0.035)Rsun, and a metallicity of [Fe/H]=+0.250+/-0.080. The star is photometrically quiet to within the precision of the HATSouth measurements and has low RV jitter. HATS-7b is the second smallest radius planet discovered by a wide-field ground-based transit survey, and one of only a handful of Neptune-size planets with mass and radius determined to 10% precision. Theoretical modeling of HATS-7b yields a hydrogen-helium fraction of 18+/-4% (rock-iron core and H2-He envelope), or 9+/-4% (ice core and H2-He envelope), i.e.it has a composition broadly similar to that of Uranus and Neptune, and very different from that of Saturn, which has 75% of its mass in H2-He. Based on a sample of transiting exoplanets with accurately (<20%) determined parameters, we establish approximate power-law relations for the envelopes of the mass-density distribution of exoplanets. HATS-7b, which, together with the recently discovered HATS-8b, is one of the first two transiting super-Neptunes discovered in the Southern sky, is a prime target for additional follow-up observations with Southern hemisphere facilities to characterize the atmospheres of Super-Neptunes (which we define as objects with mass greater than that of Neptune, and smaller than halfway between that of Neptune and Saturn, i.e. 0.054 MJ<Mp<0.18 MJ).

Zhu	  Structure functions, as measured in lepton-nucleon scattering, have proven to be very useful in studying the quark dynamics within the nucleon. However, it is experimentally difficult to separately determine the longitudinal and transverse structure functions, and consequently there are substantially less data available for the longitudinal structure function in particular. Here we present separated structure functions for hydrogen and deuterium at low four--momentum transfer squared, Q^2< 1 GeV^2, and compare these with parton distribution parameterizations and a k_T factorization approach. While differences are found, the parameterizations generally agree with the data even at the very low Q^2 scale of the data. The deuterium data show a smaller longitudinal structure function, and smaller ratio of longitudinal to transverse cross section R, than the proton. This suggests either an unexpected difference in R for the proton and neutron or a suppression of the gluonic distribution in nuclei.

The discrepancy can be explained by the fact that Bohmian mechanics has no natural way to accomodate the Heisenberg picture, since the local expectation values that define the beables of the theory depend on the Heisenberg time being used to define the operators.   Relations to measurement are discussed, too, and shown to leave no loophole for claiming that Bohmian mechanics reproduces all predictions of quantum mechanics exactly.

Zundel	  The Telescope Array observatory utilizes fluorescence detectors and surface detectors to observe air showers produced by ultra high energy cosmic rays in the Earth's atmosphere. Cosmic ray events observed in this way are termed hybrid data. The depth of air shower maximum is related to the mass of the primary particle that generates the shower. This paper reports on shower maxima data collected over 8.5 years using the Black Rock Mesa and Long Ridge fluorescence detectors in conjunction with the array of surface detectors. We compare the means and standard deviations of the observed $X_{\mathrm{max}}$ distributions with Monte Carlo $X_{\mathrm{max}}$ distributions of unmixed protons, helium, nitrogen, and iron, all generated using the QGSJet~II-04 hadronic model. We also perform an unbinned maximum likelihood test of the observed data, which is subjected to variable systematic shifting of the data $X_{\mathrm{max}}$ distributions to allow us to test the full distributions, and compare them to the Monte Carlo to see which elements are not compatible with the observed data. For all energy bins, QGSJet~II-04 protons are found to be compatible with Telescope Array hybrid data at the 95% confidence level after some systematic $X_{\mathrm{max}}$ shifting of the data. Three other QGSJet~II-04 elements are found to be compatible using the same test procedure in an energy range limited to the highest energies where data statistics are sparse. 	
1203.1809v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.1809v2	2013	Undominated Groves Mechanisms	Mingyu Guo|Evangelos Markakis|Krzysztof R. Apt|Vincent Conitzer	  The family of Groves mechanisms, which includes the well-known VCG mechanism (also known as the Clarke mechanism), is a family of efficient and strategy-proof mechanisms. Unfortunately, the Groves mechanisms are generally not budget balanced. That is, under such mechanisms, payments may flow into or out of the system of the agents, resulting in deficits or reduced utilities for the agents. We consider the following problem: within the family of Groves mechanisms, we want to identify mechanisms that give the agents the highest utilities, under the constraint that these mechanisms must never incur deficits.   We adopt a prior-free approach. We introduce two general measures for comparing mechanisms in prior-free settings. We say that a non-deficit Groves mechanism $M$ {\em individually dominates} another non-deficit Groves mechanism $M'$ if for every type profile, every agent's utility under $M$ is no less than that under $M'$, and this holds with strict inequality for at least one type profile and one agent. We say that a non-deficit Groves mechanism $M$ {\em collectively dominates} another non-deficit Groves mechanism $M'$ if for every type profile, the agents' total utility under $M$ is no less than that under $M'$, and this holds with strict inequality for at least one type profile. The above definitions induce two partial orders on non-deficit Groves mechanisms. We study the maximal elements corresponding to these two partial orders, which we call the {\em individually undominated} mechanisms and the {\em collectively undominated} mechanisms, respectively.

1211.1325v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1211.1325v1	2012	Composable and Efficient Mechanisms	Vasilis Syrgkanis|Eva Tardos	  We initiate the study of efficient mechanism design with guaranteed good properties even when players participate in multiple different mechanisms simultaneously or sequentially. We define the class of smooth mechanisms, related to smooth games defined by Roughgarden, that can be thought of as mechanisms that generate approximately market clearing prices. We show that smooth mechanisms result in high quality outcome in equilibrium both in the full information setting and in the Bayesian setting with uncertainty about participants, as well as in learning outcomes. Our main result is to show that such mechanisms compose well: smoothness locally at each mechanism implies efficiency globally.   For mechanisms where good performance requires that bidders do not bid above their value, we identify the notion of a weakly smooth mechanism. Weakly smooth mechanisms, such as the Vickrey auction, are approximately efficient under the no-overbidding assumption. Similar to smooth mechanisms, weakly smooth mechanisms behave well in composition, and have high quality outcome in equilibrium (assuming no overbidding) both in the full information setting and in the Bayesian setting, as well as in learning outcomes.   In most of the paper we assume participants have quasi-linear valuations. We also extend some of our results to settings where participants have budget constraints.

Our instantiation of the exponential mechanism can be interpreted as a generalization of the VCG mechanism in the sense that the VCG mechanism is the extreme case when the privacy parameter goes to infinity. To our knowledge, this is the first general tool for designing mechanisms that are both truthful and differentially private.

A typical model of such pricing mechanism is the so-called g--expectation defined by solutions of a backward stochastic differential equation with g as its generating function. Black-Scholes pricing model is a special linear case of this pricing mechanism. We are mainly concerned with two types of pricing mechanisms in an option market: the market pricing mechanism through which the market prices of options are produced, and the ask-bid pricing mechanism operated through the system of market makers. The later one is a typical nonlinear pricing mechanism. Data of prices produced by these two pricing mechanisms are usually quoted in an option market.   We introduce a criteria, i.e., the domination condition (A5) in (2.5) to test if a dynamic pricing mechanism under investigation is a g--pricing mechanism. This domination condition was statistically tested using CME data documents. The result of test is significantly positive. We also provide some useful characterizations of a pricing mechanism by its generating function.

Force-bearing networks can transduce locally developed mechanical signals very extensively over different parts of the cell or tissues. In this article we conduct an overview of this kind of mechanical transduction, focusing in particular on the multiple layers of complexity displayed by the mechanisms that control and trigger the conversion of a mechanical signal into a biochemical function. Single molecule methodologies, through their capability to introduce the force in studies of biological processes in which mechanical stresses are developed, are unveiling subtle intertwining mechanisms between chemistry and mechanics and in particular are revealing how chemistry can control mechanics. The possibility that chemistry interplays with mechanics should be always considered in biochemical studies. 	
0911.1813v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/0911.1813v2	2011	Interactive Privacy via the Median Mechanism	Aaron Roth|Tim Roughgarden	  We define a new interactive differentially private mechanism -- the median mechanism -- for answering arbitrary predicate queries that arrive online. Relative to fixed accuracy and privacy constraints, this mechanism can answer exponentially more queries than the previously best known interactive privacy mechanism (the Laplace mechanism, which independently perturbs each query result). Our guarantee is almost the best possible, even for non-interactive privacy mechanisms. Conceptually, the median mechanism is the first privacy mechanism capable of identifying and exploiting correlations among queries in an interactive setting.   We also give an efficient implementation of the median mechanism, with running time polynomial in the number of queries, the database size, and the domain size. This efficient implementation guarantees privacy for all input databases, and accurate query results for almost all input databases. The dependence of the privacy on the number of queries in this mechanism improves over that of the best previously known efficient mechanism by a super-polynomial factor, even in the non-interactive setting.

1212.3741v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1212.3741v1	2012	Envy Freedom and Prior-free Mechanism Design	Nikhil R. Devanur|Jason D. Hartline|Qiqi Yan	  We consider the provision of an abstract service to single-dimensional agents. Our model includes position auctions, single-minded combinatorial auctions, and constrained matching markets. When the agents' values are drawn from a distribution, the Bayesian optimal mechanism is given by Myerson (1981) as a virtual-surplus optimizer. We develop a framework for prior-free mechanism design and analysis. A good mechanism in our framework approximates the optimal mechanism for the distribution if there is a distribution; moreover, when there is no distribution this mechanism still performs well.   We define and characterize optimal envy-free outcomes in symmetric single-dimensional environments. Our characterization mirrors Myerson's theory. Furthermore, unlike in mechanism design where there is no point-wise optimal mechanism, there is always a point-wise optimal envy-free outcome.   Envy-free outcomes and incentive-compatible mechanisms are similar in structure and performance. We therefore use the optimal envy-free revenue as a benchmark for measuring the performance of a prior-free mechanism. A good mechanism is one that approximates the envy free benchmark on any profile of agent values. We show that good mechanisms exist, and in particular, a natural generalization of the random sampling auction of Goldberg et al. (2001) is a constant approximation.

1411.6148v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.6148v1	2014	Bayesian Mechanism Design with Efficiency, Privacy, and Approximate   Truthfulness	Samantha Leung|Edward Lui	  Recently, there has been a number of papers relating mechanism design and privacy (e.g., see \cite{MT07,Xia11,CCKMV11,NST12,NOS12,HK12}). All of these papers consider a worst-case setting where there is no probabilistic information about the players' types. In this paper, we investigate mechanism design and privacy in the \emph{Bayesian} setting, where the players' types are drawn from some common distribution. We adapt the notion of \emph{differential privacy} to the Bayesian mechanism design setting, obtaining \emph{Bayesian differential privacy}. We also define a robust notion of approximate truthfulness for Bayesian mechanisms, which we call \emph{persistent approximate truthfulness}. We give several classes of mechanisms (e.g., social welfare mechanisms and histogram mechanisms) that achieve both Bayesian differential privacy and persistent approximate truthfulness. These classes of mechanisms can achieve optimal (economic) efficiency, and do not use any payments. We also demonstrate that by considering the above mechanisms in a modified mechanism design model, the above mechanisms can achieve actual truthfulness.

1608.01875v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.01875v2	2017	Non-Revelation Mechanism Design	Jason Hartline|Samuel Taggart	  We consider mechanism design and redesign for markets like Internet advertising where many frequent, small transactions are organized by a principal. Mechanisms for these markets rarely have truthtelling equilibria. We identify a family of winner-pays-bid mechanisms for such markets that exhibit three properties. First, equilibria in these mechanisms are simple. Second, the mechanisms' parameters are easily reoptimized from the bid data that the mechanism generates. Third, the performance of mechanisms in the family is near the optimal performance possible by any mechanism (not necessarily within the family). Our mechanisms are based on batching across multiple iterations of an auction environment, and our approximation bound is asymptotically optimal, with loss inversely proportional to the cube root of the number of iterations batched. Our analysis methods are of broader interest in mechanism design and, for example, we also use them to give new sample complexity bounds for mechanism design in general single-dimensional agent environments. 	
1108.1762v4	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1108.1762v4	2013	Randomized Strategyproof Mechanisms for Facility Location and the   Mini-Sum-of-Squares Objective	Michal Feldman|Yoav Wilf	  We consider the problem of locating a public facility on a line, where a set of $n$ strategic agents report their \emph{locations} and a mechanism determines, either deterministically or randomly, the location of the facility. Game theoretic perspectives of the facility location problem advanced in two main directions. The first direction is concerned with the characterization of \emph{strategyproof} (SP) mechanisms; i.e., mechanisms that induce truthful reporting as a dominant strategy; and the second direction quantifies how well various objective functions can be approximated when restricted to SP mechanisms. The current paper provides contributions in both directions. First, we construct a parameterized randomized SP mechanism, and show that all of the previously proposed deterministic and randomized SP mechanisms for the current settings can be formalized as special cases of this mechanism. Second, we give tight results for the approximation ratio of SP mechanisms with respect to the objective of minimizing the sum of squares of distances to the agents (\emph{miniSOS}). Holzman \cite{Holzman1990} provided an axiomatic foundation for this function, showing that it is the unique function that satisfies unanimity, continuity and invariance. We devise a randomized mechanism that gives a 1.5-approximation for the miniSOS function, and show that no other randomized SP mechanism can provide a better approximation. This mechanism chooses the average location with probability 1/2 and a \emph{random dictator} with probability 1/2. For deterministic mechanisms, we show that the median mechanism provides a 2-approximation, and this is tight. Together, our study provides fundamental understanding of the miniSOS objective function and makes a step toward the characterization of randomized SP facility location mechanisms.

In contrast with known mechanisms for pure noise-induced pattern formation, this mechanism is not driven by a short-time instability amplified by collective effects.

The results are interpreted as recurrence in quantum mechanics, similar to Poincare recurrence in classical mechanics.

This principle allows a physical system to have imperfect information, i.e., there is incomplete knowledge of the physical state, and many paths are allowed.

This game naturally appears in situations that some service providers benefit from pairwise allocations on a network, such as the kidney exchanges between hospitals.   Ashlagi et al. present a $2$-approximation randomized truthful mechanism for this problem. This is the best known result in this setting with multiple players. However, we note that the variance of the utility of an agent in this mechanism may be as large as $\Omega(n^2)$, which is not desirable in a real application. In this paper we resolve this issue by providing a $2$-approximation randomized truthful mechanism in which the variance of the utility of each agent is at most $2+\epsilon$.   Interestingly, we could apply our technique to design a deterministic mechanism such that, if an agent deviates from the mechanism, she does not gain more than $2\lceil \log_2 m\rceil$. We call such a mechanism an almost truthful mechanism. Indeed, in a practical scenario, an almost truthful mechanism is likely to imply a truthful mechanism. We believe that our approach can be used to design low risk or almost truthful mechanisms for other problems.

We review two different types of mechanical oscillators. The first one is a clamped mechanical oscillator, such as a cantilever, with a fixed frequency. The second one is an optically trapped nano-diamond with a build-in nitrogen-vacancy center. By coupling mechanical resonators with electron spins, we can use the spins to control the motion of mechanical oscillators. For the first setup, we discuss two different coupling mechanisms which are magnetic coupling and strain induced coupling. We summarize their applications such as cooling the mechanical oscillator, generating entanglements between NV centers, squeezing spin ensembles and et al. For the second setup, we discuss how to generate quantum superposition states with magnetic coupling, and realize matter wave interferometer. We will also review its applications as ultra-sensitive mass spectrometer. Finally, we discuss new coupling mechanisms and applications of the field.

We consider a dynamic two-step model with one strategic seller with wind generation and one buyer, who trade energy through a mechanism determined by a designer. The seller has private information about his technology and wind condition, which he learns dynamically over time. We consider (static) forward and real-time mechanisms that take place at time T=1 and T=2, respectively. We also propose a dynamic mechanism that provides a coupling between the outcomes of the forward and real-time markets. We show that the dynamic mechanism outperforms the forward and real-time mechanisms for a general objective of the designer. Therefore, we demonstrate the advantage of adopting dynamic market mechanisms over static market mechanisms for wind energy. The dynamic mechanism reveals information about wind generation in advance, and also provides flexibility for incorporation of new information arriving over time. We discuss how our results generalize to environments with many strategic sellers. We also study two variants of the dynamic mechanism that guarantee no penalty risk for the seller, and/or monitor the wind condition. We illustrate our results with a numerical example.

However, it is incompatible with the fundamental laws of mechanics because its deduction requires the introduction of probability. In this paper we attempt a justification of statistical mechanics without deviating from the existing framework of quantum mechanics. We point out that the principle of equal a priori probabilities is easily proven in the dual space. The dual of the space of the quantum states is the space of the observations. We then prove that time evolution of the operators of observations obeys Boltzmann equation. This result implies that the difference of the states from equal probability becomes unobservable as time elapses.

A mechanism which is quite different from the Orowan mechanism is observed, where a dislocation leaves two prismatic loops near a precipitate: i.e. the Hirsch mechanism. It is found that the critical stress for the Hirsch mechanism is almost the same with the Orowan stress, while the spatial inhomogeneity of the shear stress is essential to the Hirsch mechanism. We also find that the repetition of the Hirsch mechanism does not increase the critical stress.

Maedan	  We show how parametric resonance mechanism follows quench mechanism in the classical linear sigma model. The parametric resonance amplifies long wavelength modes of the pion for more than $10 fm/c$. The shifting from the quench mechanism to the parametric resonance mechanism is described by a time dependent quantity. After the quench mechanism is over, that quantity has an oscillating part, which causes the parametric resonance. Since its frequency is $2 m_\pi ~(m_\pi$ : pion mass), very long wavelength modes such as k = 40 MeV of the pion are amplified by the parametric resonance.

This regime is characterized by regenerative mechanical oscillation of the mechanical mirror eigenmodes. We have recently observed the excitation of mechanical modes in an ultra-high-Q optical microcavity. Here, we present a detailed experimental analysis of this effect and demonstrate that radiation pressure is the excitation mechanism of the observed mechanical oscillations.

In both cases, it is shown that correlations at different times of compatible position observables on stationary states agree with Quantum Mechanics only in the case of product wave functions.

Lagrange, Hamilton and Hamilton-Jacobi frameworks have been implemented for the fractional classical mechanics. The Lagrangian of fractional classical mechanics has been introduced, and equation of motion has been obtained. Fractional oscillator model has been launched and solved in 1D case. A new equation for the period of oscillations of fractional classical oscillator has been found. The interplay between the energy dependency of the period of classical oscillations and the non-equidistant distribution of the energy levels for fractional quantum oscillator has been discussed. We discuss as well, the relationships between new equations of fractional classical mechanics and the well-known fundamental equations of classical mechanics.

Procaccia	  It is typically expected that if a mechanism is truthful, then the agents would, indeed, truthfully report their private information. But why would an agent believe that the mechanism is truthful? We wish to design truthful mechanisms, whose truthfulness can be verified efficiently (in the computational sense). Our approach involves three steps: (i) specifying the structure of mechanisms, (ii) constructing a verification algorithm, and (iii) measuring the quality of verifiably truthful mechanisms. We demonstrate this approach using a case study: approximate mechanism design without money for facility location.

Bhave	  Finite photon lifetimes for light fields in an opto-mechanical cavity impose a bandwidth limit on displacement sensing at mechanical resonance frequencies beyond the loaded cavity photon decay rate. Opto-mechanical modulation efficiency can be enhanced via multi-GHz transduction techniques such as piezo-opto-mechanics at the cost of on-chip integration. In this paper, we present a novel high bandwidth displacement sense scheme employing Rayleigh scattering in photonic resonators. Using this technique in conjunction with on-chip electrostatic drive in silicon enables efficient modulation at frequencies up to 9.1GHz. Being independent of the drive mechanism, this scheme could readily be extended to piezo-opto-mechanical and all optical transduced systems.

Our mechanism allocates the object to the highest valued agent with more than 99% probability provided there are at least 14 agents. It is also ex-post individually rational. We show that our mechanism is optimal in a restricted class of satisfactory ranking mechanisms. Since achieving efficiency through a dominant strategy incentive compatible and budget-balanced mechanism is impossible in this model, our results illustrate the limits of this impossibility. 	
1605.04674v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.04674v1	2016	An almost ideal coordination mechanism for unrelated machine scheduling	Ioannis Caragiannis|Angelo Fanelli	  Coordination mechanisms aim to mitigate the impact of selfishness when scheduling jobs to different machines. Such a mechanism defines a scheduling policy within each machine and naturally induces a game among the selfish job owners. The desirable properties of a coordination mechanism includes simplicity in its definition and efficiency of the outcomes of the induced game. We present a broad class of coordination mechanisms for unrelated machine scheduling that are simple to define and we identify one of its members (mechanism \Dcoord) that is superior to all known mechanisms. \Dcoord\ induces potential games with logarithmic price of anarchy and only constant price of stability. Both bounds are almost optimal.

Apt|Vincent Conitzer|Mingyu Guo|Evangelos Markakis	  A common objective in mechanism design is to choose the outcome (for example, allocation of resources) that maximizes the sum of the agents' valuations, without introducing incentives for agents to misreport their preferences. The class of Groves mechanisms achieves this; however, these mechanisms require the agents to make payments, thereby reducing the agents' total welfare.   In this paper we introduce a measure for comparing two mechanisms with respect to the final welfare they generate. This measure induces a partial order on mechanisms and we study the question of finding minimal elements with respect to this partial order. In particular, we say a non-deficit Groves mechanism is welfare undominated if there exists no other non-deficit Groves mechanism that always has a smaller or equal sum of payments. We focus on two domains: (i) auctions with multiple identical units and unit-demand bidders, and (ii) mechanisms for public project problems. In the first domain we analytically characterize all welfare undominated Groves mechanisms that are anonymous and have linear payment functions, by showing that the family of optimal-in-expectation linear redistribution mechanisms, which were introduced in [6] and include the Bailey-Cavallo mechanism [1,2], coincides with the family of welfare undominated Groves mechanisms that are anonymous and linear in the setting we study. In the second domain we show that the classic VCG (Clarke) mechanism is welfare undominated for the class of public project problems with equal participation costs, but is not undominated for a more general class. 	
1206.2957v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.2957v1	2012	Mechanisms for Risk Averse Agents, Without Loss	Shaddin Dughmi|Yuval Peres	  Auctions in which agents' payoffs are random variables have received increased attention in recent years. In particular, recent work in algorithmic mechanism design has produced mechanisms employing internal randomization, partly in response to limitations on deterministic mechanisms imposed by computational complexity. For many of these mechanisms, which are often referred to as truthful-in-expectation, incentive compatibility is contingent on the assumption that agents are risk-neutral. These mechanisms have been criticized on the grounds that this assumption is too strong, because "real" agents are typically risk averse, and moreover their precise attitude towards risk is typically unknown a-priori. In response, researchers in algorithmic mechanism design have sought the design of universally-truthful mechanisms --- mechanisms for which incentive-compatibility makes no assumptions regarding agents' attitudes towards risk.   We show that any truthful-in-expectation mechanism can be generically transformed into a mechanism that is incentive compatible even when agents are risk averse, without modifying the mechanism's allocation rule. The transformed mechanism does not require reporting of agents' risk profiles. Equivalently, our result can be stated as follows: Every (randomized) allocation rule that is implementable in dominant strategies when players are risk neutral is also implementable when players are endowed with an arbitrary and unknown concave utility function for money.

The mechanism designer's goal is to field a mechanism with high expected profit on the distribution over buyers' values. Unfortunately, if the set of mechanisms he optimizes over is complex, a mechanism may have high empirical profit over a small set of samples but low expected profit. This raises the question, how many samples are sufficient to ensure that the empirically optimal mechanism is nearly optimal in expectation? We uncover structure shared by a myriad of pricing, auction, and lottery mechanisms that allows us to prove strong sample complexity bounds: for any set of buyers' values, profit is a piecewise linear function of the mechanism's parameters. We prove new bounds for mechanism classes not yet studied in the sample-based mechanism design literature and match or improve over the best known guarantees for many classes. The profit functions we study are significantly different from well-understood functions in machine learning, so our analysis requires a sharp understanding of the interplay between mechanism parameters and buyer values. We strengthen our main results with data-dependent bounds when the distribution over buyers' values is "well-behaved." Finally, we investigate a fundamental tradeoff in sample-based mechanism design: complex mechanisms often have higher profit than simple mechanisms, but more samples are required to ensure that empirical and expected profit are close. We provide techniques for optimizing this tradeoff.

We consider the problem of designing truthful budget feasible mechanisms for general submodular functions: we give a randomized mechanism with approximation ratio $7.91$ (improving the previous best-known result 112), and a deterministic mechanism with approximation ratio $8.34$. Further we study the knapsack problem, which is special submodular function, give a $2+\sqrt{2}$ approximation deterministic mechanism (improving the previous best-known result 6), and a 3 approximation randomized mechanism. We provide a similar result for an extended knapsack problem with heterogeneous items, where items are divided into groups and one can pick at most one item from each group.   Finally we show a lower bound of approximation ratio of $1+\sqrt{2}$ for deterministic mechanisms and 2 for randomized mechanisms for knapsack, as well as the general submodular functions. Our lower bounds are unconditional, which do not rely on any computational or complexity assumptions. 	
1103.6017v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1103.6017v2	2011	Generalized Froggatt-Nielsen Mechanism	Fei Wang	  In this paper, we propose a Generalized Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism in which non-renormalizable operators involving a GUT group and $U(1)_H$ non-singlet Higgs field are introduced. Thus the GUT gauge symmetry breaking and the generation of hierarchical flavor hierarchy have a common origin in this mechanism. In this Generalized Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism, we propose universality conditions for coefficients corresponding to different contractions in the group productions. We find that the predictions in Generalized Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism for SU(5) GUT is different to that of ordinary Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism. Such Generalized Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism can be used in GUT models when ordinary Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism is no longer available. We study the application of Generalized Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism in SO(10) model. We find that realistic standard model mass hierarchy and mixings can be obtained both in SU(5) and SO(10) GUT models with such Generalized Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism.

They may jeopardize statistical inference of the model of interest, if the missing mechanism is nonignorable, that is, the missing mechanism depends on the missing values themselves even conditional on the observed data. With a nonignorable missing mechanism, the model of interest is often not identifiable without imposing further assumptions. We find that even if the missing mechanism has a known parametric form, the model is not identifiable without specifying a parametric outcome distribution. Although it is fundamental for valid statistical inference, identifiability under nonignorable missing mechanisms is not established for many commonly-used models. In this paper, we first demonstrate identifiability of the normal distribution under monotone missing mechanisms. We then extend it to the normal mixture and $t$ mixture models with non-monotone missing mechanisms. We discover that models under the Logistic missing mechanism are less identifiable than those under the Probit missing mechanism. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for identifiability of models under the Logistic missing mechanism, which sometimes can be checked in real data analysis. We illustrate our methods using a series of simulations, and apply them to a real-life dataset.

We compare and contrast na\"ive physics with quantum mechanics and argue that quantum mechanics is not just hard to understand but that it is difficult to believe, often appearing magical in nature. Quantum mechanics is often discussed in the context of "quantum weirdness" and quantum entanglement is known as "spooky action at a distance." This spookiness is more than just because quantum mechanics doesn't match everyday experience; it ruffles the feathers of our na\"ive physics cognitive module. In Everett's many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, we preserve a form of deterministic thinking that can alleviate some of the perceived weirdness inherent in other interpretations of quantum mechanics, at the cost of having the universe split into parallel worlds at every quantum measurement. By examining the role cognitive modules play in interpreting quantum mechanics, we conclude that the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics involves a cognitive bias not seen in the Copenhagen interpretation.

The objective is to design strategyproof mechanisms which are competitive against the most efficient (but not strategyproof) mechanism.   For the case with two items:   (1) We provide a set of sufficient conditions for strategyproofness.   (2) We use an analytic approach to derive strategyproof mechanisms which are more competitive than all prior strategyproof mechanisms.   (3) We improve the linear-program-based proof of Guo and Conitzer to show new upper bounds on competitive ratios.   (4) We provide the first "mathematical" upper bound proof.   For the cases with any number of items:   (1) We build on the Partial Allocation mechanisms introduced by Cole et al. to design a strategyproof mechanism which is 0.67776-competitive, breaking the 2/3 barrier.   (2) We propose a new subclass of strategyproof mechanisms called Dynamical-Increasing-Price mechanisms, where each agent purchases the items using virtual money, and the prices of the items depend on other agents' preferences.

Vincent Poor|Prateek Mittal	  Differential privacy mechanism design has traditionally been tailored for a scalar-valued query function. Although many mechanisms such as the Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms can be extended to a matrix-valued query function by adding i.i.d. noise to each element of the matrix, this method is often suboptimal as it forfeits an opportunity to exploit the structural characteristics typically associated with matrix analysis. To address this challenge, we propose a novel differential privacy mechanism called the Matrix-Variate Gaussian (MVG) mechanism, which adds a matrix-valued noise drawn from a matrix-variate Gaussian distribution, and we rigorously prove that the MVG mechanism preserves $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of directional noise made possible by the design of the MVG mechanism. Directional noise allows the impact of the noise on the utility of the matrix-valued query function to be moderated. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate the performance of our mechanism using three matrix-valued queries on three privacy-sensitive datasets. We find that the MVG mechanism notably outperforms four previous state-of-the-art approaches, and provides comparable utility to the non-private baseline.

To transfer information between mechanical modes, either direct coupling or an interface between these modes is needed. In previous works, strong coupling between different modes in a single mechanical resonator and direct interaction between neighboring mechanical resonators have been demonstrated. However, coupling between distant mechanical resonators, which is a crucial request for long-distance classical and quantum information processing using mechanical devices, remains an experimental challenge. Here, we report the experimental observation of strong indirect coupling between separated mechanical resonators in a graphene-based electromechanical system. The coupling is mediated by a far-off-resonant phonon cavity through virtual excitations via a Raman-like process. By controlling the resonant frequency of the phonon cavity, the indirect coupling can be tuned in a wide range. Our results may lead to the development of gate-controlled all-mechanical devices and open up the possibility of long-distance quantum mechanical experiments.

Most of these mechanisms are effective, and security experts can handle them to achieve a sufficient level of security for any given system. However, most of these systems have not been designed with focus on good usability for the average end user. Today, the average end user often struggles with understanding and using security mechanisms. Other security mechanisms are simply annoying for end users. As the overall security of any system is only as strong as the weakest link in this system, bad usability of IT security mechanisms may result in operating errors, resulting in insecure systems. Buying decisions of end users may be affected by the usability of security mechanisms. Hence software providers may decide to better have no security mechanism then one with a bad usability. Usability of IT security mechanisms is one of the most underestimated properties of applications and systems. Even IT security itself is often only an afterthought. Hence, usability of security mechanisms is often the afterthought of an afterthought. Software developers are missing guidelines on how to build security mechanisms with good usability for end users. This paper presents some guidelines that should help software developers to improve end user usability of security-related mechanisms, and analyzes common applications based on these guidelines.

Zuckerman	  ATP-driven proton pumps, which are critical to the operation of a cell, maintain cytosolic and organellar pH levels within a narrow functional range. These pumps employ two very different mechanisms: an elaborate rotary mechanism used by V-ATPase H+ pumps, and a simpler alternating access mechanism used by P-ATPase H+ pumps. Why are two different mechanisms used to perform the same function? Systematic analysis, without parameter fitting, of kinetic models of the rotary, alternating access and other possible mechanisms suggest that, when the ratio of protons transported per ATP hydrolyzed exceeds one, the one-at-a-time proton transport by the rotary mechanism is faster than other possible mechanisms across a wide range of driving conditions. When the ratio is one, there is no intrinsic difference in the free energy landscape between mechanisms, and therefore all mechanisms can exhibit the same kinetic performance. To our knowledge all known rotary pumps have an H+:ATP ratio greater than one, and all known alternating access ATP-driven proton pumps have a ratio of one. Our analysis suggests a possible explanation for this apparent relationship between coupling ratio and mechanism. When the conditions under which the pump must operate permit a coupling ratio greater than one, the rotary mechanism may have been selected for its kinetic advantage. On the other hand, when conditions require a coupling ratio of one or less, the alternating access mechanism may have been selected for other possible advantages resulting from its structural and functional simplicity.

Lichtenberg	  Different mechanisms have been proposed to account for the spin-dependent interaction between quarks in ground-state hadrons. The first mechanism is the chromomagnetic interaction arising from one-gluon exchange, a second mechanism is an interaction arising from meson exchange, and a third from instanton effects. Some lattice calculations favor the first mechanism for heavy quarks and the third for light quarks. An argument is presented in favor of the one-gluon exchange mechanism. However, thus far, nobody has performed a crucial experiment that can definitively distinguish between these mechanisms.

After a brief summary of sources of unease with quantum mechanics, a survey is given of attempts either to give a new interpretive framework assuming quantum mechanics is exact, or to modify quantum mechanics assuming it is a very accurate approximation to a more fundamental theory. This survey focuses particularly on the issues of whether probabilities in quantum mechanics are postulated or emergent.

The interesting feature of the phenomenon is that systems become entangled without causal interaction; hence it is a useful situation for investigating the unique nature of interaction in Bohmian mechanics. The first two sections introduce, respectively, entanglement exchange in the standard interpretation of quantum mechanics, and the basic principles of Bohmian mechanics.

As a result, light neutrinos are naturally obtained with new physics at TeV scale. As interesting consequence, the mechanism may be directly probed at the LHC by directly producing the TeV states intrinsic of the mechanism. We show that the 3-3-1 model with right-handed neutrinos realizes naturally such seesaw mechanism.

The non-discerned particles correspond to an action and a density which satisfy the statistical Hamilton-Jacobi equations and allow to explain the Gibbs paradox in a simple manner. On the other hand, a discerned particle corresponds to a particular action that satisfies the local Hamilton-Jacobi equations. We then study the convergence of quantum mechanics to classical mechanics when hbar -> 0 by considering the convergence for the two cases. These results provide an argument for a renewed interpretation of quantum mechanics.

We propose an evolutionary spectrum access mechanism with complete network information, and show that the mechanism achieves an equilibrium that is globally evolutionarily stable. With incomplete network information, we propose a distributed learning mechanism, where each user utilizes local observations to estimate the expected throughput and learns to adjust its spectrum access strategy adaptively over time. We show that the learning mechanism converges to the same evolutionary equilibrium on the time average. Numerical results show that the proposed mechanisms are robust to the perturbations of users' channel selections.

Researchers have proposed methods to reduce packet overhead regarding to maintain compatible with standard mechanisms.

Following discussion, a new mechanism called Improved Tunneling-based Route Optimization is proposed and due to performance analysis, it is shown that proposed mechanism has less overhead comparing to common mechanisms. Analytical results indicate that Improved Tunneling-based Route Optimization transmits more payloads due to send packets with less overhead.

The non-extensive statistical mechanics is usually introduced in a formal way, using the maximization of entropy. In this article we investigate the canonical ensemble in the non-extensive statistical mechanics using a more traditional way, by considering a small system interacting with a large reservoir via short-range forces. The reservoir is characterized by generalized entropy instead of the Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy. Assuming equal probabilities for all available microstates we derive the equations of the non-extensive statistical mechanics. Such a procedure can provide deeper insight into applicability of the non-extensive statistics.

Our mechanism maximizes the revenue guarantee when there is one buyer. As the number of buyers tends to infinity, the revenue guarantee of our mechanism converges to the full surplus.

The writing pulse maps a signal pulse at the cavity resonance to a mechanical excitation. The readout pulse later converts the mechanical excitation back to an optical pulse. The light storage lifetime is determined by the relatively long damping time of the mechanical excitation. 	
1306.4907v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1306.4907v1	2013	Inferential vs. Dynamical Conceptions of Physics	David Wallace	  I contrast two possible attitudes towards a given branch of physics: as inferential (i.e., as concerned with an agent's ability to make predictions given finite information), and as dynamical (i.e., as concerned with the dynamical equations governing particular degrees of freedom). I contrast these attitudes in classical statistical mechanics, in quantum mechanics, and in quantum statistical mechanics; in this last case, I argue that the quantum-mechanical and statistical-mechanical aspects of the question become inseparable. Along the way various foundational issues in statistical and quantum physics are (hopefully!) illuminated. 	
1309.1153v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.1153v1	2013	On reconciling quantum mechanics and local realism	Donald A. Graft	  A necessary and natural change in our application of quantum mechanics to separated systems is shown to reconcile quantum mechanics and local realism. An analysis of separation and localization justifies the proposed change in application of quantum mechanics. An important EPRB experiment is reconsidered and it is seen that when it is correctly interpreted it supports local realism. This reconciliation of quantum mechanics with local realism allows the axiom sets of quantum mechanics, probability, and special relativity to be joined in a consistent global axiom set for physics. 	
1410.4501v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.4501v2	2014	Four Ways from Universal to Particular: How Chomsky's   Language-Acquisition Faculty is Not Selectionist	David Ellerman	  Following the development of the selectionist theory of the immune system, there was an attempt to characterize many biological mechanisms as being "selectionist" as juxtaposed to "instructionist." But this broad definition would group Darwinian evolution, the immune system, embryonic development, and Chomsky's language-acquisition mechanism as all being "selectionist." Yet Chomsky's mechanism (and embryonic development) are significantly different from the selectionist mechanisms of biological evolution or the immune system. Surprisingly, there is an abstract way using two dual mathematical logics to make the distinction between genuinely selectionist mechanisms and what are better called "generative" mechanisms. This note outlines that distinction. 	
1604.04876v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.04876v2	2016	(Almost) Efficient Mechanisms for Bilateral Trading	Liad Blumrosen|Shahar Dobzinski	  We study the simplest form of two-sided markets: one seller, one buyer and a single item for sale. It is well known that there is no fully-efficient mechanism for this problem that maintains a balanced budget. We characterize the quality of the most efficient mechanisms that are budget balanced, and design simple and robust mechanisms with these properties. We also show that even minimal use of statistical data can yield good results. Finally, we demonstrate how a mechanism for this simple bilateral-trade problem can be used as a "black-box" for constructing mechanisms in more general environments.

0204453v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0204453v1	2002	Generalized Competing Glauber-type Dynamics and Kawasaki-type Dynamics	Han Zhu|Jian-yang Zhu|Yang Zhou	  In this article, we have given a systematic formulation of the new generalized competing mechanism: the Glauber-type single-spin transition mechanism, with probability p, simulates the contact of the system with the heat bath, and the Kawasaki-type spin-pair redistribution mechanism, with probability 1-p, simulates an external energy flux. These two mechanisms are natural generalizations of Glauber's single-spin flipping mechanism and Kawasaki's spin-pair exchange mechanism respectively. On the one hand, the new mechanism is in principle applicable to arbitrary systems, while on the other hand, our formulation is able to contain a mechanism that just directly combines single-spin flipping and spin-pair exchange in their original form. Compared with the conventional mechanism, the new mechanism does not assume the simplified version and leads to greater influence of temperature. The fact, order for lower temperature and disorder for higher temperature, will be universally true. In order to exemplify this difference, we applied the mechanism to 1D Ising model and obtained analytical results. We also applied this mechanism to kinetic Gaussian model and found that, above the critical point there will be only paramagnetic phase, while below the critical point, the self-organization as a result of the energy flux will lead the system to an interesting heterophase, instead of the initially guessed antiferromagnetic phase. We studied this process in details.

Here we consider the effect of a second mechanical mode with a close, but different resonance frequency. We show that the nearby mechanical resonance is simultaneously cooled by the cavity field, provided that the difference between the two mechanical frequencies is not too small. When this frequency difference becomes smaller than the effective mechanical damping of the secondary mode, the two cooling processes interfere destructively and cavity cooling is suppressed in the limit of identical mechanical frequencies. We show that also the entanglement properties of the steady state of the tripartite system crucially depend upon on the difference between the two mechanical frequencies. If the latter is larger than the effective damping of the second mechanical mode, the state shows fully tripartite entanglement and each mechanical mode is entangled with the cavity mode. If instead the frequency difference is smaller, the steady state is a two-mode biseparable state, inseparable only when one splits the cavity mode from the two mechanical modes. In this latter case, the entanglement of each mechanical mode with the cavity mode is extremely fragile with respect to temperature.

We show that the class of truthful mechanisms is very limited: A decisive truthful mechanism partitions the tasks into groups so that the tasks in each group are allocated independently of the other groups. Tasks in a group of size at least two are allocated by an affine minimizer and tasks in singleton groups by a task-independent mechanism. This characterization is about all truthful mechanisms, including those with unbounded approximation ratio.   A direct consequence of this approach is that the approximation ratio of mechanisms for two players is 2, even for two tasks. In fact, it follows that for two players, VCG is the unique algorithm with optimal approximation 2.   This characterization provides some support that any decisive truthful mechanism (for 3 or more players) partitions the tasks into groups some of which are allocated by affine minimizers, while the rest are allocated by a threshold mechanism (in which a task is allocated to a player when it is below a threshold value which depends only on the values of the other players). We also show here that the class of threshold mechanisms is identical to the class of additive mechanisms. 	
0810.1019v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/0810.1019v2	2011	Classical and Quantum Mechanics via Lie algebras	Arnold Neumaier|Dennis Westra	  The goal of this book is to present classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, and statistical mechanics in an almost completely algebraic setting, thereby introducing mathematicians, physicists, and engineers to the ideas relating classical and quantum mechanics with Lie algebras and Lie groups. The book emphasizes the closeness of classical and quantum mechanics, and the material is selected in a way to make this closeness as apparent as possible.   Much of the material covered here is not part of standard textbook treatments of classical or quantum mechanics (or is only superficially treated there). For physics students who want to get a broader view of the subject, this book may therefore serve as a useful complement to standard treatments of quantum mechanics.   Almost without exception, this book is about precise concepts and exact results in classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, and statistical mechanics. The structural properties of mechanics are discussed independent of computational techniques for obtaining quantitatively correct numbers from the assumptions made. The standard approximation machinery for calculating from first principles explicit thermodynamic properties of materials, or explicit cross sections for high energy experiments can be found in many textbooks and is not repeated here.

1107.2994v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1107.2994v2	2012	Budget Feasible Mechanism Design via Random Sampling	Xiaohui Bei|Ning Chen|Nick Gravin|Pinyan Lu	  Budget feasible mechanism considers algorithmic mechanism design questions where there is a budget constraint on the total payment of the mechanism. An important question in the field is that under which valuation domains there exist budget feasible mechanisms that admit `small' approximations (compared to a socially optimal solution). Singer \cite{PS10} showed that additive and submodular functions admit a constant approximation mechanism. Recently, Dobzinski, Papadimitriou, and Singer \cite{DPS11} gave an $O(\log^2n)$ approximation mechanism for subadditive functions and remarked that: "A fundamental question is whether, regardless of computational constraints, a constant-factor budget feasible mechanism exists for subadditive function."   In this paper, we give the first attempt to this question. We give a polynomial time $O(\frac{\log n}{\log\log n})$ sub-logarithmic approximation ratio mechanism for subadditive functions, improving the best known ratio $O(\log^2 n)$. Further, we connect budget feasible mechanism design to the concept of approximate core in cooperative game theory, and show that there is a mechanism for subadditive functions whose approximation is, via a characterization of the integrality gap of a linear program, linear to the largest value to which an approximate core exists. Our result implies in particular that the class of XOS functions, which is a superclass of submodular functions, admits a constant approximation mechanism. We believe that our work could be a solid step towards solving the above fundamental problem eventually, and possibly, with an affirmative answer.

Here, we describe a framework for understanding the patterns of student reasoning difficulties and how students develop expertise in quantum mechanics. The framework posits that the challenges many students face in developing expertise in quantum mechanics are analogous to the challenges introductory students face in developing expertise in introductory classical mechanics. This framework incorporates both the diversity in upper-level students' prior preparation, goals, and motivation in general (i.e., the facts that even in upper-level courses, students may be inadequately prepared, have unclear goals, and have insufficient motivation to excel) as well as the "paradigm shift" from classical mechanics to quantum mechanics. The framework is based on empirical investigations demonstrating that the patterns of reasoning, problem-solving, and self-monitoring difficulties in quantum mechanics bear a striking resemblance to those found in introductory classical mechanics. Examples from research in quantum mechanics and introductory classical mechanics are discussed to illustrate how the patterns of difficulties are analogous as students learn to unpack the respective principles and grasp the formalism in each knowledge domain during the development of expertise. Embracing such a framework and contemplating the parallels between the difficulties in these two knowledge domains can enable researchers to leverage the extensive literature for introductory physics education research to guide the design of teaching and learning tools for helping students develop expertise in quantum mechanics. 	
1506.06987v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.06987v1	2015	Towards Enhanced Usability of IT Security Mechanisms - How to Design   Usable IT Security Mechanisms Using the Example of Email Encryption	Hans-Joachim Hof	  Nowadays, advanced security mechanisms exist to protect data, systems, and networks. Most of these mechanisms are effective, and security experts can handle them to achieve a sufficient level of security for any given system. However, most of these systems have not been designed with focus on good usability for the average end user. Today, the average end user often struggles with understanding and using security mecha-nisms. Other security mechanisms are simply annoying for end users. As the overall security of any system is only as strong as the weakest link in this system, bad usability of IT security mechanisms may result in operating errors, resulting in inse-cure systems. Buying decisions of end users may be affected by the usability of security mechanisms. Hence, software provid-ers may decide to better have no security mechanism then one with a bad usability. Usability of IT security mechanisms is one of the most underestimated properties of applications and sys-tems. Even IT security itself is often only an afterthought. Hence, usability of security mechanisms is often the after-thought of an afterthought. This paper presents some guide-lines that should help software developers to improve end user usability of security-related mechanisms, and analyzes com-mon applications based on these guidelines. Based on these guidelines, the usability of email encryption is analyzed and an email encryption solution with increased usability is presented. The approach is based on an automated key and trust man-agement. The compliance of the proposed email encryption solution with the presented guidelines for usable security mechanisms is evaluated.

Yakobson|Teng Zhang|Yong-Wei Zhang|Yao Zhou|Yong Zhu	  Since the first successful synthesis of graphene just over a decade ago, a variety of two-dimensional (2D) materials (e.g., transition metal-dichalcogenides, hexagonal boron-nitride, etc.) have been discovered. Among the many unique and attractive properties of 2D materials, mechanical properties play important roles in manufacturing, integration and performance for their potential applications. Mechanics is indispensable in the study of mechanical properties, both experimentally and theoretically. The coupling between the mechanical and other physical properties (thermal, electronic, optical) is also of great interest in exploring novel applications, where mechanics has to be combined with condensed matter physics to establish a scalable theoretical framework. Moreover, mechanical interactions between 2D materials and various substrate materials are essential for integrated device applications of 2D materials, for which the mechanics of interfaces (adhesion and friction) has to be developed for the 2D materials. Here we review recent theoretical and experimental works related to mechanics and mechanical properties of 2D materials. While graphene is the most studied 2D material to date, we expect continual growth of interest in the mechanics of other 2D materials beyond graphene.

Viren|J. J. Walding|A. Weber|R. C. Webb|C. White|L. Whitehead|S. G. Wojcicki|K. Zhang|R. Zwaska	  This paper reports measurements of atmospheric neutrino and antineutrino interactions in the MINOS Far Detector, based on 2553 live-days (37.9 kton-years) of data. A total of 2072 candidate events are observed. These are separated into 905 contained-vertex muons and 466 neutrino-induced rock-muons, both produced by charged-current $\nu_{\mu}$ and $\bar{\nu}_{\mu}$ interactions, and 701 contained-vertex showers, composed mainly of charged-current $\nu_{e}$ and $\bar{\nu}_{e}$ interactions and neutral-current interactions. The curvature of muon tracks in the magnetic field of the MINOS Far Detector is used to select separate samples of $\nu_{\mu}$ and $\bar{\nu}_{\mu}$ events. The observed ratio of $\bar{\nu}_{\mu}$ to $\nu_{\mu}$ events is compared with the Monte Carlo simulation, giving a double ratio of $R^{data}_{\bar{\nu}/\nu}/R^{MC}_{\bar{\nu}/\nu} = 1.03 \pm 0.08 (stat.) \pm 0.08 (syst.)$. The $\nu_{\mu}$ and $\bar{\nu}_{\mu}$ data are separated into bins of $L/E$ resolution, based on the reconstructed energy and direction of each event, and a maximum likelihood fit to the observed $L/E$ distributions is used to determine the atmospheric neutrino oscillation parameters. This fit returns 90% confidence limits of $|\Delta m^{2}| = (1.9 \pm 0.4) \times 10^{-3} eV^{2}$ and $sin^{2} 2\theta > 0.86$. The fit is extended to incorporate separate $\nu_{\mu}$ and $\bar{\nu}_{\mu}$ oscillation parameters, returning 90% confidence limits of $|\Delta m^{2}|-|\Delta \bar{m}^{2}| = 0.6^{+2.4}_{-0.8} \times 10^{-3} eV^{2}$ on the difference between the squared-mass splittings for neutrinos and antineutrinos.

Vallage|V. Van Elewyck|F. Versari|D. Vivolo|A. Vizzoca|J. Wilms|J. D. Zornoza|J. Zúñiga	  The ANTARES detector is at present the most sensitive neutrino telescope in the Northern Hemisphere. The highly significant cosmic neutrino excess observed by the Antarctic IceCube detector can be studied with ANTARES, exploiting its complementing field of view, exposure, and lower energy threshold. Searches for an all-flavor diffuse neutrino signal, covering 9 years of ANTARES data taking, are presented in this letter. Upward-going events are used to reduce the atmospheric muon background. This work includes for the first time in ANTARES both track-like (mainly $\nu_\mu)$ and shower-like (mainly $\nu_e$) events in this kind of analysis. Track-like events allow for an increase of the effective volume of the detector thanks to the long path traveled by muons in rock and/or sea water. Shower-like events are well reconstructed only when the neutrino interaction vertex is close to, or inside, the instrumented volume. A mild excess of high-energy events over the expected background is observed in 9 years of ANTARES data in both samples. The best fit for a single power-law cosmic neutrino spectrum, in terms of per-flavor flux at 100 TeV, is $\Phi_0^{1f}(100\ \textrm{TeV}) = \left(1.7\pm 1.0\right) \times$10$^{-18}$\,GeV$^{-1}$\,cm$^{-2}$\,s$^{-1}$\,sr$^{-1}$ with spectral index $\Gamma = 2.4^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$. The null cosmic flux assumption is rejected with a significance of 1.6$\sigma$.

Lomholt|Ling Miao	  Mechanics of fluid membranes may be described in terms of the concepts of mechanical deformations and stresses, or in terms of mechanical free-energy functions. In this paper, each of the two descriptions is developed by viewing a membrane from two perspectives: a microscopic perspective, in which the membrane appears as a thin layer of finite thickness and with highly inhomogeneous material and force distributions in its transverse direction, and an effective, two-dimensional perspective, in which the membrane is treated as an infinitely thin surface, with effective material and mechanical properties. A connection between these two perspectives is then established. Moreover, the functional dependence of the variation in the mechanical free energy of the membrane on its mechanical deformations is first studied in the microscopic perspective. The result is then used to examine to what extent different, effective mechanical stresses and forces can be derived from a given, effective functional of the mechanical free energy.

0608271v3	http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0608271v3	2006	Mechanical vs. informational components of price impact	J. Doyne Farmer|Neda Zamani	  We study the problem of what causes prices to change. We define the mechanical impact of a trading order as the change in future prices in the absence of any future changes in decision making, and its it informational impact as the remainder of the total impact once mechanical impact is removed. We introduce a method of measuring mechanical impact and apply it to order book data from the London Stock Exchange. The average mechanical impact of a market order decays to zero as a function of time, at an asymptotic rate that is consistent with a power law with an exponent of roughly 1.7. In contrast the average informational impact builds to approach a constant value. Initially the impact is entirely mechanical, and is about half as big as the asymptotic informational impact. The size of the informational impact is positively correlated to mechanical impact. For cases where the mechanical impact is zero for all times, we find that the informational impact is negative, i.e. buy market orders that have no mechanical impact at all generate strong negative price responses.

In addition, proto-mechanics proves valid also for the description of a half-spin.

Specifically, it allows a maximum-entropy interpretation of quantum probabilities, which creates a stronger link between it and statistical mechanics. The proposed approach also allows a range of extensions of the guidance condition in Bohmian mechanics.

In the resulting formalism, problems relating to measurements and objective reality are solved as in Bohmian mechanics (without sharing its weak points). The pitfalls of Nelson's stochastic mechanics are also avoided. 	
0701223v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0701223v2	2007	Is PT-symmetric quantum mechanics just quantum mechanics in a   non-orthogonal basis?	Damien Martin	  One of the postulates of quantum mechanics is that the Hamiltonian is Hermitian, as this guarantees that the eigenvalues are real. Recently there has been an interest in asking if $H^\dagger = H$ is a necessary condition, and has lead to the development of PT-symmetric quantum mechanics. This note shows that any finite physically acceptable non-Hermitian Hamiltonian is equivalent to doing ordinary quantum mechanics in a non-orthogonal basis. In particular, this means that there is no experimental distinction between PT-symmetric quantum mechanics and ordinary quantum mechanics for finite systems. In particular, the claim that PT-symmetric quantum mechanics allows for faster evolution than Hermitian quantum mechanics is shown to be a problem of physical interpretation.

Here we report on a cavity opto-mechanical system in which a collective density excitation of a Bose-Einstein condensate is shown to serve as the mechanical oscillator coupled to the cavity field. We observe that a few photons inside the ultrahigh-finesse cavity trigger a strongly driven back-action dynamics, in quantitative agreement with a cavity opto-mechanical model. With this experiment we approach the strong coupling regime of cavity opto-mechanics, where a single excitation of the mechanical oscillator significantly influences the cavity field. The work opens up new directions to investigate mechanical oscillators in the quantum regime and quantum gases with non-local coupling. 	
0810.3182v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/0810.3182v1	2008	Optimal Strategies in Sequential Bidding	Krzysztof R. Apt|Vangelis Markakis	  We are interested in mechanisms that maximize social welfare. In [1] this problem was studied for multi-unit auctions with unit demand bidders and for the public project problem, and in each case social welfare undominated mechanisms in the class of feasible and incentive compatible mechanisms were identified. One way to improve upon these optimality results is by allowing the players to move sequentially. With this in mind, we study here sequential versions of two feasible Groves mechanisms used for single item auctions: the Vickrey auction and the Bailey-Cavallo mechanism. Because of the absence of dominant strategies in this sequential setting, we focus on a weaker concept of an optimal strategy. For each mechanism we introduce natural optimal strategies and observe that in each mechanism these strategies exhibit different behaviour. However, we then show that among all optimal strategies, the one we introduce for each mechanism maximizes the social welfare when each player follows it. The resulting social welfare can be larger than the one obtained in the simultaneous setting. Finally, we show that, when interpreting both mechanisms as simultaneous ones, the vectors of the proposed strategies form a Pareto optimal Nash equilibrium in the class of optimal strategies. 	
0811.1769v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/0811.1769v1	2008	Fractional Quantum Mechanics	Nick Laskin	  A path integral approach to quantum physics has been developed. Fractional path integrals over the paths of the L\'evy flights are defined. It is shown that if the fractality of the Brownian trajectories leads to standard quantum and statistical mechanics, then the fractality of the L\'evy paths leads to fractional quantum mechanics and fractional statistical mechanics. The fractional quantum and statistical mechanics have been developed via our fractional path integral approach. A fractional generalization of the Schr\"odinger equation has been found. A relationship between the energy and the momentum of the nonrelativistic quantum-mechanical particle has been established. The equation for the fractional plane wave function has been obtained. We have derived a free particle quantum-mechanical kernel using Fox's H function. A fractional generalization of the Heisenberg uncertainty relation has been established. Fractional statistical mechanics has been developed via the path integral approach. A fractional generalization of the motion equation for the density matrix has been found. The density matrix of a free particle has been expressed in terms of the Fox's H function. We also discuss the relationships between fractional and the well-known Feynman path integral approaches to quantum and statistical mechanics. 	
0903.3878v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/0903.3878v1	2009	Bohmian particle trajectories contradict quantum mechanics	Michael Zirpel	  The Bohmian interpretation of quantum mechanics adds particle trajectories to the wave function and ensures that the probability distribution of the particle positions agrees with quantum mechanics at any time. This is not sufficient to avoid contradictions with quantum mechanics. There are correlations between particle positions at different times which cannot be reproduced with real particle trajectories. A simple rearrangement of an experimental test of the Bell-CHSH inequality demonstrates this.

Tang	  We report enhanced optomechanical coupling by embedding a nano-mechanical beam resonator within an optical race-track resonator. Precise control of the mechanical resonator is achieved by clamping the beam between two low-loss photonic crystal waveguide couplers. The low insertion loss and the rigid mechanical support provided by the couplers yield both high mechanical and optical Q-factors for improved signal quality. 	
1004.2888v4	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1004.2888v4	2011	Approximately Optimal Mechanism Design via Differential Privacy	Kobbi Nissim|Rann Smorodinsky|Moshe Tennenholtz	  In this paper we study the implementation challenge in an abstract interdependent values model and an arbitrary objective function. We design a mechanism that allows for approximate optimal implementation of insensitive objective functions in ex-post Nash equilibrium. If, furthermore, values are private then the same mechanism is strategy proof. We cast our results onto two specific models: pricing and facility location. The mechanism we design is optimal up to an additive factor of the order of magnitude of one over the square root of the number of agents and involves no utility transfers.   Underlying our mechanism is a lottery between two auxiliary mechanisms: with high probability we actuate a mechanism that reduces players' influence on the choice of the social alternative, while choosing the optimal outcome with high probability. This is where the recent notion of differential privacy is employed. With the complementary probability we actuate a mechanism that is typically far from optimal but is incentive compatible. The joint mechanism inherits the desired properties from both.

We develop a generalized statistical mechanics formalism for superstatistical systems, by mapping the superstatistical complex system onto a system of ordinary statistical mechanics with modified energy levels. We also briefly review recent examples of applications of the superstatistics concept for three very different subject areas, namely train delay statistics, turbulent tracer dynamics, and cancer survival statistics. 	
1011.2413v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1011.2413v1	2010	Optimal Auctions with Correlated Bidders are Easy	Shahar Dobzinski|Hu Fu|Robert Kleinberg	  We consider the problem of designing a revenue-maximizing auction for a single item, when the values of the bidders are drawn from a correlated distribution. We observe that there exists an algorithm that finds the optimal randomized mechanism that runs in time polynomial in the size of the support. We leverage this result to show that in the oracle model introduced by Ronen and Saberi [FOCS'02], there exists a polynomial time truthful in expectation mechanism that provides a $(\frac 3 2+\epsilon)$-approximation to the revenue achievable by an optimal truthful-in-expectation mechanism, and a polynomial time deterministic truthful mechanism that guarantees $\frac 5 3$ approximation to the revenue achievable by an optimal deterministic truthful mechanism.   We show that the $\frac 5 3$-approximation mechanism provides the same approximation ratio also with respect to the optimal truthful-in-expectation mechanism. This shows that the performance gap between truthful-in-expectation and deterministic mechanisms is relatively small. En route, we solve an open question of Mehta and Vazirani [EC'04].   Finally, we extend some of our results to the multi-item case, and show how to compute the optimal truthful-in-expectation mechanisms for bidders with more complex valuations.

The Wigner function formalism resembles the mathematical language of classical mechanics of non-interacting particles. Thus, it allows a more direct comparison between classical and quantum dynamical features.

Haugen	  This paper provides detailed comparisons of chemical reaction mechanisms of H2 applicable at high preheat temperatures and pressures relevant to gas turbine and particularly Alstom's reheat gas turbine conditions. It is shown that the available reaction mechanisms exhibit large differences in several important elementary reaction coefficients. The reaction mechanisms are assessed by comparing ignition delay and laminar flame speed results obtained from CHEMKIN with available data, however, the amount of data at these conditions is scarce and a recommended candidate among the mechanisms can presently not be selected. Generally, the results with the GRI-Mech and Leeds mechanisms deviate from the Davis, Li, O'Conaire, Konnov and San Diego mechanisms, but there are also significant deviations between the latter five mechanisms that altogether are better adapted to hydrogen. The differences in ignition delay times between the dedicated hydrogen mechanisms (O'Conaire, Li and Konnov) range from approximately a maximum factor of 2 for the H2-air cases, to more than a factor 5 for the H2/O2/AR cases. The application of the computed ignition delay time to reheat burner development is briefly discussed.

Sardanashvily	  We address classical and quantum mechanics in a general setting of arbitrary time-dependent transformations. Classical non-relativistic mechanics is formulated as a particular field theory on smooth fibre bundles over a time axis. Connections on these bundles describe reference frames. Quantum time-dependent mechanics is phrased in geometric terms of Banach and Hilbert bundles and connections on these bundles.

Quantum Mechanics inherent randomness in the measurement process is sometimes presented as a door to explain free will. We argue against this interpretation. The possibility that Quantum Mechanics provides just an effective description of Nature which is only valid at our low-energy scales is also discussed.

We begin with a comprehensive review on the superconformal quantum mechanics and emphasize that conformal symmetry and supersymmetry in quantum mechanics contain a number of exotic and enlightening properties which do not occur in higher dimensional field theories. We see that superfield and superspace formalism is available for $\mathcal{N}\le 8$ superconformal mechanical models. We then discuss the M2-branes with a focus on the world-volume descriptions of the multiple M2-branes which are superconformal three-dimensional Chern-Simons matter theories. Finally we argue that the two topics are connected in M-theoretical construction by considering the multiple M2-branes wrapped around a compact Riemann surface and study the emerging IR quantum mechanics. We establish that the resulting quantum mechanics realizes a set of novel $\mathcal{N}\ge 8$ superconformal quantum mechanical models which have not been reached so far. Also we discuss possible applications of the superconformal quantum mechanics to mathematical physics.

Steele	  In physical systems, decoherence can arise from both dissipative and dephasing processes. In mechanical resonators, the driven frequency response measures a combination of both, while time domain techniques such as ringdown measurements can separate the two. Here, we report the first observation of the mechanical ringdown of a carbon nanotube mechanical resonator. Comparing the mechanical quality factor obtained from frequency- and time-domain measurements, we find a spectral quality factor four times smaller than that measured in ringdown, demonstrating dephasing-induced decoherence of the nanomechanical motion. This decoherence is seen to arise at high driving amplitudes, pointing to a non-linear dephasing mechanism. Our results highlight the importance of time-domain techniques for understanding dissipation in nano-mechanical resonators, and the relevance of decoherence mechanisms in nanotube mechanics.

The provision of security in such system is therefore modeled as a public good provision problem, and is referred to as a security game. In this paper, we compare two well-known incentive mechanisms in this context for incentivizing optimal security investments among users, namely the Pivotal and the Externality mechanisms. The taxes in a Pivotal mechanism are designed to ensure users' voluntary participation, while those in an Externality mechanism are devised to maintain a balanced budget. We first show the more general result that, due to the non-excludable nature of security, no mechanism can incentivize the socially optimal investment profile, while at the same time ensuring voluntary participation and maintaining a balanced budget for all instances of security games. To further illustrate, we apply the Pivotal and Externality mechanisms to the special case of weighted total effort interdependence models, and identify some of the effects of varying interdependency between users on the budget deficit in the Pivotal mechanism, as well as on the participation incentives in the Externality mechanism. 	
1408.1387v3	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1408.1387v3	2015	Double or Nothing: Multiplicative Incentive Mechanisms for Crowdsourcing	Nihar B. Shah|Dengyong Zhou	  Crowdsourcing has gained immense popularity in machine learning applications for obtaining large amounts of labeled data. Crowdsourcing is cheap and fast, but suffers from the problem of low-quality data. To address this fundamental challenge in crowdsourcing, we propose a simple payment mechanism to incentivize workers to answer only the questions that they are sure of and skip the rest. We show that surprisingly, under a mild and natural "no-free-lunch" requirement, this mechanism is the one and only incentive-compatible payment mechanism possible. We also show that among all possible incentive-compatible mechanisms (that may or may not satisfy no-free-lunch), our mechanism makes the smallest possible payment to spammers. We further extend our results to a more general setting in which workers are required to provide a quantized confidence for each question. Interestingly, this unique mechanism takes a "multiplicative" form. The simplicity of the mechanism is an added benefit. In preliminary experiments involving over 900 worker-task pairs, we observe a significant drop in the error rates under this unique mechanism for the same or lower monetary expenditure. 	
1511.04741v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.04741v1	2015	On the Computational Complexity of Optimal Simple Mechanisms	Aviad Rubinstein	  We consider a monopolist seller facing a single buyer with additive valuations over n heterogeneous, independent items. It is known that in this important setting optimal mechanisms may require randomization [HR12], use menus of infinite size [DDT15], and may be computationally intractable [DDT14]. This has sparked recent interest in finding simple mechanisms that obtain reasonable approximations to the optimal revenue [HN12, LY13, BILW14]. In this work we attempt to find the optimal simple mechanism.   There are many ways to define simple mechanisms. Here we restrict our search to partition mechanisms, where the seller partitions the items into disjoint bundles and posts a price for each bundle; the buyer is allowed to buy any number of bundles.   We give a PTAS for the problem of finding a revenue-maximizing partition mechanism, and prove that the problem is strongly NP-hard. En route, we prove structural properties of near-optimal partition mechanisms which may be of independent interest: for example, there always exists a near-optimal partition mechanism that uses only a constant number of non-trivial bundles (i.e. bundles with more than one item).

Luiz|Rodrigo S. Benevides|Gustavo S. Wiederhecker|Thiago P. Mayer Alegre	  Optomechanical cavities have proven to be an exceptional tool to explore fundamental and technological aspects of the interaction between mechanical and optical waves. Such interactions strongly benefit from cavities with large optomechanical coupling, high mechanical and optical quality factors, and mechanical frequencies larger than the optical mode linewidth, the so called resolved sideband limit. Here we demonstrate a novel optomechanical cavity based on a disk with a radial mechanical bandgap. This design confines light and mechanical waves through distinct physical mechanisms which allows for independent control of the mechanical and optical properties. Our device design is not limited by unique material properties and could be easily adapted to allow large optomechanical coupling and high mechanical quality factors with other promising materials. Finally, our demonstration is based on devices fabricated on a commercial silicon photonics facility, demonstrating that our approach can be easily scalable.

In this paper, we consider the problem of designing revenue optimal dynamic mechanism for a setting where an auctioneer sells a set of items to a buyer in multiple stages. At each stage, there could be multiple items for sale but each item can only appear in one stage. The type of the buyer at each stage is thus a multi-dimensional vector characterizing the buyer's valuations of the items at that stage and is assumed to be stage-wise independent.   In particular, we propose a novel class of mechanisms called bank account mechanisms. Roughly, a bank account mechanism is no different from any stage-wise individual mechanism except for an augmented structure called bank account, a real number for each node that summarizes the history so far. We first establish that the optimal revenue from any dynamic mechanism in this setting can be achieved by a bank account mechanism, and we provide a simple characterization of the set of incentive compatible and ex-post individually rational bank account mechanisms. Based on these characterizations, we then investigate the problem of finding the (approximately) optimal bank account mechanisms. We prove that there exists a simple, randomized bank account mechanism that approximates optimal revenue up to a constant factor. Our result is general and can accommodate previous approximation results in single-shot multi-dimensional mechanism design. Based on the previous mechanism, we further show that there exists a deterministic bank account mechanism that achieves constant-factor approximation as well. Finally, we consider the problem of computing optimal mechanisms when the type space is discrete and provide an FPTAS via linear and dynamic programming.

In this paper, we review some established mechanisms for achieving such transparency, without any claim to completeness, and briefly discuss potential future directions. Our investigation is structured by four "challenges" under which we subsume the various requirements on, and approaches to, socio-economic transparency mechanisms. One main focus is on the inference, i.e., statistical, aspect of such mechanisms. 	
1608.01871v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.01871v1	2016	Mechanical dissipation in MoRe superconducting metal drums	S. Yanai|V. Singh|M. Yuan|M. Gely|S. J. Bosman|G. A. Steele	  We experimentally investigate dissipation in mechanical resonators made of a disordered superconducting thin film of Molybdenum-Rhenium(MoRe) alloy. By electrostatically driving the drum with a resonant AC voltage, we detect its motion using a superconducting microwave cavity. From the temperature dependence of mechanical resonance frequencies and quality factors, we find evidence for non-resonant, mechanically active two-level systems (TLSs) limiting its quality factor at low temperature. In addition, we observe a strong suppression of mechanical dissipation at large mechanical driving amplitudes, suggesting an unconventional saturation of the non-resonant TLSs. These new observations shed light on the mechanism of mechanical damping in superconducting drums and routes towards understanding dissipation in such mechanical systems.

Kuhlmann|Davide Cadeddu|Jean-Michel Gérard|Julien Claudon|Martino Poggio|Richard J. Warburton	  Coupling a microscopic mechanical resonator to a nano-scale quantum system enables control of the mechanical resonator via the quantum system, and vice versa. The coupling is usually achieved through functionalization of the mechanical resonator but this results in additional mass and dissipation channels. An alternative is an intrinsic coupling based on strain. We employ here a monolithic semiconductor system. The nano-scale quantum system is a quantum dot; the mechanical resonator a microscopic trumpet which simultaneously optimizes the mechanical and photonic properties. The quantum dot transition is driven resonantly. Via the resonance fluorescence, we observe mechanical Brownian motion even at 4K, and demonstrate a coupling to mechanical modes of different types. We identify a mechanical mode with a cooperativity larger than one. We show analytically that the Heisenberg limit on displacement measurement can be reached with an embedded two-level system in the case of a transform-limited optical emitter with perfect photon detection. We argue that operation close to the Heisenberg limit is achievable with state-of-the-art quantum dot devices.

Taylor	  Optomechanical systems show tremendous promise for high sensitivity sensing of forces and modification of mechanical properties via light. For example, similar to neutral atoms and trapped ions, laser cooling of mechanical motion by radiation pressure can take single mechanical modes to their ground state. Conventional optomechanical cooling is able to introduce additional damping channel to mechanical motion, while keeping its thermal noise at the same level, and as a consequence, the effective temperature of the mechanical mode is lowered. However, the ratio of temperature to quality factor remains roughly constant, preventing dramatic advances in quantum sensing using this approach. Here we propose an approach for simultaneously reducing the thermal load on a mechanical resonator while improving its quality factor. In essence, we use the optical interaction to dynamically modify the dominant damping mechanism, providing an optomechanically-induced effect analogous to a phononic band gap. The mechanical mode of interest is assumed to be weakly coupled to its heat bath but strongly coupled to a second mechanical mode, which is cooled by radiation pressure coupling to a red detuned cavity field. We also identify a realistic optomechanical design that has the potential to realize this novel cooling scheme. 	
1704.08480v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.08480v1	2017	Combinatorial Cost Sharing	Shahar Dobzinski|Shahar Ovadia	  We introduce a combinatorial variant of the cost sharing problem: several services can be provided to each player and each player values every combination of services differently. A publicly known cost function specifies the cost of providing every possible combination of services. A combinatorial cost sharing mechanism is a protocol that decides which services each player gets and at what price. We look for dominant strategy mechanisms that are (economically) efficient and cover the cost, ideally without overcharging (i.e., budget balanced). Note that unlike the standard cost sharing setting, combinatorial cost sharing is a multi-parameter domain. This makes designing dominant strategy mechanisms with good guarantees a challenging task.   We present the Potential Mechanism -- a combination of the VCG mechanism and a well-known tool from the theory of cooperative games: Hart and Mas-Colell's potential function. The potential mechanism is a dominant strategy mechanism that always covers the incurred cost. When the cost function is subadditive the same mechanism is also approximately efficient. Our main technical contribution shows that when the cost function is submodular the potential mechanism is approximately budget balanced in three settings: supermodular valuations, symmetric cost function and general symmetric valuations, and two players with general valuations.

All these observations are made through a mechanism that links the external world to the experimenter's awareness, a mechanism which is not under the experimenter's control. We discuss how this mechanism can affect the physical laws as implied by the experimenter, and define fundamental physical laws as the ones which remain invariant under the change of such mechanism.

The mechanical oscillator with a tiny magnet attached on one of its free ends produces an oscillating magnetic field. When its oscillating frequency matches certain hyperfine Zeeman energy of Rb87 atoms, the trapped BEC atoms are coupled out of the magnetic trap by the mechanical oscillator, flying away from the trap with stolen energy from the mechanical oscillator. Thus the mode temperature of the mechanical oscillator is reduced. The mode temperature of the steady state of a mechanical oscillator, measured by the mean steady-state phonon number in the flexural mode of the mechanical oscillator, is analyzed. It is found that ground state (phonon number less than 1) may be accessible with optimal parameters of the hybrid system of a mechanical oscillator and trapped BEC atoms.

Momeni|M. H. Naderi	  In this paper, we study theoretically a hybrid optomechanical system consisting of a degenerate optical parametric amplifier inside a driven optical cavity with a moving end mirror which is modeled as a stiffening Duffing-like anharmonic quantum mechanical oscillator. By providing analytical expressions for the critical values of the system parameters corresponding to the emergence of the multistability behavior in the steady-state response of the system, we show that the stiffening mechanical Duffing anharmonicity reduces the width of the multistability region while the optical parametric nonlinearity can be exploited to drive the system toward the multistability region. We also show that for appropriate values of the mechanical anharmonicity strength the steady-state mechanical squeezing and the ground-state cooling of the mechanical resonator can be achieved. Moreover, we find that the presence of the nonlinear gain medium can lead to the improvement of the mechanical anharmonicity-induced cooling of the mechanical motion, as well as to the mechanical squeezing beyond the standard quantum limit of 3 dB.

Zhang	  Classical statistical average values are generally generalized to average values of quantum mechanics, it is discovered that quantum mechanics is direct generalization of classical statistical mechanics, and we generally deduce both a new general continuous eigenvalue equation and a general discrete eigenvalue equation in quantum mechanics, and discover that a eigenvalue of quantum mechanics is just an extreme value of an operator in possibility distribution, the eigenvalue f is just classical observable quantity. A general classical statistical uncertain relation is further given, the general classical statistical uncertain relation is generally generalized to quantum uncertainty principle, the two lost conditions in classical uncertain relation and quantum uncertainty principle, respectively, are found. We generally expound the relations among uncertainty principle, singularity and condensed matter stability, discover that quantum uncertainty principle prevents from the appearance of singularity of the electromagnetic potential between nucleus and electrons, and give the failure conditions of quantum uncertainty principle. Finally, we discover that the classical limit of quantum mechanics is classical statistical mechanics, the classical statistical mechanics may further be degenerated to classical mechanics, and we discover that only saying that the classical limit of quantum mechanics is classical mechanics is mistake. As application examples, we deduce both Shrodinger equation and state superposition principle, deduce that there exist decoherent factor from a general mathematical representation of state superposition principle, and the consistent difficulty between statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics and determinant property of classical mechanics is overcome. 	
9903030v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/9903030v1	1999	Transformation Relation of Two Descriptive Systems between Quantum   Mechanics and Classical Statistical Mechanics and Dynamic Foundation of   Classical Statistical Physics	Xiaochun Mei	  Based on the concept of ensemble, it is proved in the manuscript that the probability amplitude function can also been used to describe the classical statistical system. The motion equations of probability amplitude functions of classical statistical system are obtained, which are similar to that in quantum mechanics. It is also proved in the meantime that microsystems that obey quantum mechanics can also be described in the forms of classical statistical mechanics and deterministic classical mechanics. The quantum revised formula of classical interaction force and the revised Liouville's equations are also obtained. In this way, the transformation of two descriptive forms between classical mechanics and quantum mechanics is achieved. A new and rational interpretation about quantum mechanics, including the meaning of wave function, the potential barrier penetration of microparticles, the Uncertainty relation, the wave-particle duality, the essence of spin and the Bell's inequality and so on, is provided in the paper. Based on the transformation, two fundamental hypotheses are put forward as the basic postulates of classical statistical physics. The equal probability hypothesis in the equilibrium states is given up. The united description of nonequilibrium state mechanics and equilibrium state statistical mechanics is reached, and the so-called reversibility paradox can also be eliminated. 	
0906.1019v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/0906.1019v1	2009	Efficiency of (Revenue-)Optimal Mechanisms	Gagan Aggarwal|Gagan Goel|Aranyak Mehta	  We compare the expected efficiency of revenue maximizing (or {\em optimal}) mechanisms with that of efficiency maximizing ones. We show that the efficiency of the revenue maximizing mechanism for selling a single item with k + log_{e/(e-1)} k + 1 bidders is at least as much as the efficiency of the efficiency maximizing mechanism with k bidders, when bidder valuations are drawn i.i.d. from a Monotone Hazard Rate distribution. Surprisingly, we also show that this bound is tight within a small additive constant of 5.7. In other words, Theta(log k) extra bidders suffice for the revenue maximizing mechanism to match the efficiency of the efficiency maximizing mechanism, while o(log k) do not. This is in contrast to the result of Bulow and Klemperer comparing the revenue of the two mechanisms, where only one extra bidder suffices. More precisely, they show that the revenue of the efficiency maximizing mechanism with k+1 bidders is no less than the revenue of the revenue maximizing mechanism with k bidders.   We extend our result for the case of selling t identical items and show that 2.2 log k + t Theta(log log k) extra bidders suffice for the revenue maximizing mechanism to match the efficiency of the efficiency maximizing mechanism.   In order to prove our results, we do a classification of Monotone Hazard Rate (MHR) distributions and identify a family of MHR distributions, such that for each class in our classification, there is a member of this family that is pointwise lower than every distribution in that class. This lets us prove interesting structural theorems about distributions with Monotone Hazard Rate.

Matthew Weinberg	  We study the communication complexity of combinatorial auctions via interpolation mechanisms that interpolate between non-truthful and truthful protocols. Specifically, an interpolation mechanism has two phases. In the first phase, the bidders participate in some non-truthful protocol whose output is itself a truthful protocol. In the second phase, the bidders participate in the truthful protocol selected during phase one. Note that virtually all existing auctions have either a non-existent first phase (and are therefore truthful mechanisms), or a non-existent second phase (and are therefore just traditional protocols, analyzed via the Price of Anarchy/Stability).   The goal of this paper is to understand the benefits of interpolation mechanisms versus truthful mechanisms or traditional protocols, and develop the necessary tools to formally study them. Interestingly, we exhibit settings where interpolation mechanisms greatly outperform the optimal traditional and truthful protocols. Yet, we also exhibit settings where interpolation mechanisms are provably no better than truthful ones. Finally, we apply our new machinery to prove that the recent single-bid mechanism of Devanur et. al.~\cite{DevanurMSW15} (the only pre-existing interpolation mechanism in the literature) achieves the optimal price of anarchy among a wide class of protocols, a claim that simply can't be addressed by appealing just to machinery from communication complexity or the study of truthful mechanisms. 	
1602.06028v6	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.06028v6	2017	Generalized Gaussian Mechanism for Differential Privacy	Fang Liu	  Assessment of disclosure risk is of paramount importance in the research and applications of data privacy techniques. The concept of differential privacy (DP) formalizes privacy in probabilistic terms and provides a robust concept for privacy protection without making assumptions about the background knowledge of adversaries. Practical applications of DP involve development of DP mechanisms to release results at a pre-specified privacy budget. In this paper, we generalize the widely used Laplace mechanism to the family of generalized Gaussian (GG) mechanism based on the $l_p$ global sensitivity of statistical queries. We explore the theoretical requirement for the GG mechanism to reach DP at prespecified privacy parameters, and investigate the connections and differences between the GG mechanism and the Exponential mechanism based on the GG distribution We also present a lower bound on the scale parameter of the Gaussian mechanism of $(\epsilon,\delta)$-probabilistic DP as a special case of the GG mechanism, and compare the statistical utility of the sanitized results in the tail probability and dispersion in the Gaussian and Laplace mechanisms. Lastly, we apply the GG mechanism in 3 experiments (the mildew, Czech, adult data), and compare the accuracy of sanitized results via the $l_1$ distance and Kullback-Leibler divergence and examine how sanitization affects the prediction power of a classifier constructed with the sanitized data in the adult experiment. 	
1802.10077v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.10077v1	2018	A Differential Privacy Mechanism Design Under Matrix-Valued Query	Thee Chanyaswad|Alex Dytso|H. Vincent Poor|Prateek Mittal	  Traditionally, differential privacy mechanism design has been tailored for a scalar-valued query function. Although many mechanisms such as the Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms can be extended to a matrix-valued query function by adding i.i.d. noise to each element of the matrix, this method is often sub-optimal as it forfeits an opportunity to exploit the structural characteristics typically associated with matrix analysis. In this work, we consider the design of differential privacy mechanism specifically for a matrix-valued query function. The proposed solution is to utilize a matrix-variate noise, as opposed to the traditional scalar-valued noise. Particularly, we propose a novel differential privacy mechanism called the Matrix-Variate Gaussian (MVG) mechanism, which adds a matrix-valued noise drawn from a matrix-variate Gaussian distribution. We prove that the MVG mechanism preserves $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy, and show that it allows the structural characteristics of the matrix-valued query function to naturally be exploited. Furthermore, due to the multi-dimensional nature of the MVG mechanism and the matrix-valued query, we introduce the concept of directional noise, which can be utilized to mitigate the impact the noise has on the utility of the query. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the MVG mechanism and the advantages of directional noise using three matrix-valued queries on three privacy-sensitive datasets. We find that the MVG mechanism notably outperforms four previous state-of-the-art approaches, and provides comparable utility to the non-private baseline. Our work thus presents a promising prospect for both future research and implementation of differential privacy for matrix-valued query functions.

Marsiglio	  The BCS electron-phonon mechanism and the unconventional 'hole mechanism' have been proposed as explanations for the high temperature superconductivity observed in $MgB_2$. It is proposed that a critical test of which theory is correct is the dependence of $T_c$ on hole doping: the hole mechanism predicts that $T_c$ will drop rapidly to zero as holes are added, while the electron-phonon mechanism appears to predict increasing $T_c$ for a substantial range of hole doping. Furthermore, the hole mechanism and electron-phonon mechanism differ qualitatively in their predictions of the effect on $T_c$ of change in the $B-B$ distances. We discuss predictions of the hole mechanism for a variety of observables as a function of doping, emphasizing the expected differences and similarities with the electron-phonon explanation. The hole mechanism predicts coherence length and penetration depth to increase and decrease monotonically with hole doping respectively.

Truskett	  We use molecular simulations to explore how sample dimensions and interfacial properties impact some generic aspects of the mechanical and structural behavior of nanoconfined materials. Specifically, we calculate the strain-dependent properties of minimum-energy thin-film particle configurations (i.e., inherent structures) confined between attractive, parallel substrates. We examine how the relationship between the transverse strain and the stress tensor (the equation of state of the energy landscape) depends on the properties of the film and substrate. We find that both film thickness and film-substrate attractions influence not only the mechanical properties of thin films, but also the shape and location of the "weak spots" where voids preferentially form in a film as it is strained beyond its point of maximum tensile stress. The sensitivity of weak spots to film properties suggests that nanoscale materials may be intrinsically vulnerabile to specific mechanisms of mechanical failure.

Mechanism of a   Stalk-Hole Complex	Kirill Katsov|Marcus Mueller|Michael Schick	  We use self-consistent field theory to determine structural and energetic properties of intermediates and transition states involved in bilayer membrane fusion. In particular, we extend our original calculations from those of the standard hemifusion mechanism, which was studied in detail in the first paper of this series, to consider a possible alternative to it. This mechanism involves non-axial stalk expansion, in contrast to the axially symmetric evolution postulated in the classical mechanism. Elongation of the initial stalk facilitates the nucleation of holes and leads to destabilization of the fusing membranes via the formation of a stalk-hole complex. We study properties of this complex in detail, and show how transient leakage during fusion, previously predicted and recently observed in experiment, should vary with system architecture and tension. We also show that the barrier to fusion in the alternative mechanism is lower than that of the standard mechanism by a few $k_BT$ over most of the relevant region of system parameters, so that this alternative mechanism is a viable alternative to the standard pathway. 	
0205075v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0205075v1	2002	Complexity of Mechanism Design	Vincent Conitzer|Tuomas Sandholm	  The aggregation of conflicting preferences is a central problem in multiagent systems. The key difficulty is that the agents may report their preferences insincerely. Mechanism design is the art of designing the rules of the game so that the agents are motivated to report their preferences truthfully and a (socially) desirable outcome is chosen. We propose an approach where a mechanism is automatically created for the preference aggregation setting at hand. This has several advantages, but the downside is that the mechanism design optimization problem needs to be solved anew each time. Focusing on settings where side payments are not possible, we show that the mechanism design problem is NP-complete for deterministic mechanisms. This holds both for dominant-strategy implementation and for Bayes-Nash implementation. We then show that if we allow randomized mechanisms, the mechanism design problem becomes tractable. In other words, the coordinator can tackle the computational complexity introduced by its uncertainty about the agents' preferences by making the agents face additional uncertainty. This comes at no loss, and in some cases at a gain, in the (social) objective. 	
0606003v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0606003v1	2006	Modeling Aspect Mechanisms: A Top-Down Approach	Sergei Kojarski|David H. Lorenz	  A plethora of diverse aspect mechanisms exist today, all of which integrate concerns into artifacts that exhibit crosscutting structure. What we lack and need is a characterization of the design space that these aspect mechanisms inhabit and a model description of their weaving processes. A good design space representation provides a common framework for understanding and evaluating existing mechanisms. A well-understood model of the weaving process can guide the implementor of new aspect mechanisms. It can guide the designer when mechanisms implementing new kinds of weaving are needed. It can also help teach aspect-oriented programming (AOP). In this paper we present and evaluate such a model of the design space for aspect mechanisms and their weaving processes. We model weaving, at an abstract level, as a concern integration process. We derive a weaving process model (WPM) top-down, differentiating a reactive from a nonreactive process. The model provides an in-depth explanation of the key subpro existing aspect mechanisms.

9910405v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ph/9910405v2	2000	A Tale of Two Hard Pomerons	Arjun Berera	  Two mechanisms are examined for hard double pomeron exchange dijet production, the factorized model of Ingelman-Schlein and the nonfactorized model of lossless jet production which exhibits the Collins-Frankfurt-Strikman mechanism. Comparison between these two mechanisms are made of the total cross section, $E_T$-spectra, and mean rapidity spectra. For both mechanisms, several specific models are examined with the cuts of CDF, D\O and representative cuts of LHC. Distinct qualitative differences are predicted by the two mechanisms for the CDF $y_+$-spectra and for the $E_T$-spectra for all three experimental cuts. The preliminary CDF and D\O experimental data for this process are interpreted in terms of these two mechanisms. The $y_+$-spectra of the CDF data is suggestive of domination by the factorized Ingelman-Schlein mechanism, whereas the D\O data shows no greater preference for either mechanism. An inconsistency is found amongst all the theoretical models in attempting to explain the ratio of the cross sections given by the data from these two experiments.

Kamerdzhiev	  A system of equations is obtained for the Cooper gap in nuclei. The system takes two mechanisms of superfluidity into account in an approximation quadratic in the phonon- production amplitude : a Bardeen- Cooper- Schrieffer (BCS) type mechanism and a quasiparticle- phonon mechanism. These equations are solved for 120 Sn in a realistic approximation. If the simple procedures proposed are used to determine the new particle- particle interaction and to estimate the average effect, then the contribution of the quasiparticle- phonon mechanism to the observed width of the pairing gap is 26% and the BCS-type contribution is 74%. This means that at least in semimagic nuclei pairing is of a mixed nature - it is due to the two indicated mechanisms, the first being mainly a surface mechanism and the second mainly a volume mechanism.

Sear|Martin Howard	  Using computational modelling, we investigate mechanisms of signal transduction focusing on the spindle assembly checkpoint where a single unattached kinetochore is able to signal to prevent cell cycle progression. This inhibitory signal switches off rapidly once spindle microtubules have attached to all kinetochores. This requirement tightly constrains the possible mechanisms. Here we investigate two possible mechanisms for spindle checkpoint operation in metazoan cells, both supported by recent experiments. The first involves the free diffusion and sequestration of cell-cycle regulators. This mechanism is severely constrained both by experimental fluorescence recovery data and also by the large volumes involved in open mitosis in metazoan cells. Using a simple mathematical analysis and computer simulation, we find that this mechanism can generate the inhibition found in experiment but likely requires a two stage signal amplification cascade. The second mechanism involves spatial gradients of a short-lived inhibitory signal that propagates first by diffusion but then primarily via active transport along spindle microtubules. We propose that both mechanisms may be operative in the metazoan spindle assembly checkpoint, with either able to trigger anaphase onset even without support from the other pathway.

Singh	  The rules of quantum mechanics require a time coordinate for their formulation. However, a notion of time is in general possible only when a classical spacetime geometry exists. Such a geometry is itself produced by classical matter sources. Thus it could be said that the currently known formulation of quantum mechanics pre-assumes the presence of classical matter fields. A more fundamental formulation of quantum mechanics should exist, which avoids having to use a notion of time. In this paper we discuss as to how such a fundamental formulation could be constructed for single particle, non-relativistic quantum mechanics. We argue that there is an underlying non-linear theory of quantum gravity, to which both standard quantum mechanics and classical general relativity are approximations. The timeless formulation of quantum mechanics follows from the underlying theory when the mass of the particle is much smaller than Planck mass. On the other hand, when the particle's mass is much larger than Planck mass, spacetime emerges and the underlying theory should reduce to classical mechanics and general relativity. We also suggest that noncommutative differential geometry is a possible candidate for describing this underlying theory.

Possibilities include acceleration of the head, direct passage of the blast wave via the cranium, and propagation of the blast wave to the brain via a thoracic mechanism. The hypothesis that the blast pressure wave reaches the brain via a thoracic mechanism is considered in light of ballistic and blast pressure wave research. Ballistic pressure waves, caused by penetrating ballistic projectiles or ballistic impacts to body armor, can only reach the brain via an internal mechanism and have been shown to cause cerebral effects. Similar effects have been documented when a blast pressure wave has been applied to the whole body or focused on the thorax in animal models. While vagotomy reduces apnea and bradycardia due to ballistic or blast pressure waves, it does not eliminate neural damage in the brain, suggesting that the pressure wave directly affects the brain cells via a thoracic mechanism. An experiment is proposed which isolates the thoracic mechanism from cranial mechanisms of mTBI due to blast wave exposure. Results have implications for evaluating risk of mTBI due to blast exposure and for developing effective protection.

Vahala|Oskar Painter	  The combination of large per-photon optical force and small motional mass attainable in nanocavity optomechanical systems results in strong dynamical back-action between mechanical motion and the cavity light field. In this work we study the optical control of mechanical motion within two different nanocavity structures, a zipper nanobeam photonic crystal cavity and a double-microdisk whispering-gallery resonator. The strong optical gradient force within these cavities is shown to introduce signifcant optical rigidity into the structure, with the dressed mechanical states renormalized into optically-bright and optically-dark modes of motion. With the addition of internal mechanical coupling between mechanical modes, a form of optically-controlled mechanical transparency is demonstrated in analogy to electromagnetically induced transparency of three-level atomic media. Based upon these measurements, a proposal for coherently transferring RF/microwave signals between the optical field and a long-lived dark mechanical state is described.

Kakade|Ilan Lobel|Hamid Nazerzadeh	  We consider the problem of revenue-optimal dynamic mechanism design in settings where agents' types evolve over time as a function of their (both public and private) experience with items that are auctioned repeatedly over an infinite horizon. A central question here is understanding what natural restrictions on the environment permit the design of optimal mechanisms (note that even in the simpler static setting, optimal mechanisms are characterized only under certain restrictions). We provide a {\em structural characterization} of a natural "separable: multi-armed bandit environment (where the evolution and incentive structure of the a-priori type is decoupled from the subsequent experience in a precise sense) where dynamic optimal mechanism design is possible. Here, we present the Virtual Index Mechanism, an optimal dynamic mechanism, which maximizes the (long term) {\em virtual surplus} using the classical Gittins algorithm. The mechanism optimally balances exploration and exploitation, taking incentives into account. 	
1002.2334v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1002.2334v2	2013	Budget Feasible Mechanisms	Yaron Singer	  We study a novel class of mechanism design problems in which the outcomes are constrained by the payments. This basic class of mechanism design problems captures many common economic situations, and yet it has not been studied, to our knowledge, in the past. We focus on the case of procurement auctions in which sellers have private costs, and the auctioneer aims to maximize a utility function on subsets of items, under the constraint that the sum of the payments provided by the mechanism does not exceed a given budget. Standard mechanism design ideas such as the VCG mechanism and its variants are not applicable here. We show that, for general functions, the budget constraint can render mechanisms arbitrarily bad in terms of the utility of the buyer. However, our main result shows that for the important class of submodular functions, a bounded approximation ratio is achievable. Better approximation results are obtained for subclasses of the submodular functions. We explore the space of budget feasible mechanisms in other domains and give a characterization under more restricted conditions.

In this paper, we identify good mechanisms for risk-averse sellers. As is standard in the economics literature, we model the risk-aversion of a seller by endowing the seller with a monotone concave utility function. We then seek robust mechanisms that are approximately optimal for all sellers, no matter what their levels of risk-aversion are. We have two main results for multi-unit auctions with unit-demand bidders whose valuations are drawn i.i.d. from a regular distribution. First, we identify a posted-price mechanism called the Hedge mechanism, which gives a universal constant factor approximation; we also show for the unlimited supply case that this mechanism is in a sense the best possible. Second, we show that the VCG mechanism gives a universal constant factor approximation when the number of bidders is even only a small multiple of the number of items. Along the way we point out that Myerson's characterization of the optimal mechanisms fails to extend to utility-maximization for risk-averse sellers, and establish interesting properties of regular distributions and monotone hazard rate distributions.

Mechanisms satisfying each requirement separately have been studied extensively, but there are few results on mechanisms achieving both. We are interested in those allocations for which there exist payments such that the resulting mechanism is simultaneously incentive compatible and envy-free. Cyclic monotonicity is a characterization of incentive compatible allocations, local efficiency is a characterization for envy-free allocations. We combine the above to give a characterization for allocations which are both incentive compatible and envy free. We show that even for allocations that allow payments leading to incentive compatible mechanisms, and other payments leading to envy free mechanisms, there may not exist any payments for which the mechanism is simultaneously incentive compatible and envy-free. The characterization that we give lets us compute the set of Pareto-optimal mechanisms that trade off envy freeness for incentive compatibility.

Vanner|Markus Aspelmeyer	  Micro- and nanoscale mechanical resonators have recently emerged as ubiquitous devices for use in advanced technological applications, for example in mobile communications and inertial sensors, and as novel tools for fundamental scientific endeavors. Their performance is in many cases limited by the deleterious effects of mechanical damping. Here, we report a significant advancement towards understanding and controlling support-induced losses in generic mechanical resonators. We begin by introducing an efficient numerical solver, based on the "phonon-tunneling" approach, capable of predicting the design-limited damping of high-quality mechanical resonators. Further, through careful device engineering, we isolate support-induced losses and perform the first rigorous experimental test of the strong geometric dependence of this loss mechanism. Our results are in excellent agreement with theory, demonstrating the predictive power of our approach. In combination with recent progress on complementary dissipation mechanisms, our phonon-tunneling solver represents a major step towards accurate prediction of the mechanical quality factor.

H. Pernice|Hong X. Tang	  Cavity optomechanics enables active manipulation of mechanical resonators through backaction cooling and amplification. This ability to control mechanical motion with retarded optical forces has recently spurred a race towards realizing a mechanical resonator in its quantum ground state. Here, instead of quenching optomechanical motion, we demonstrate high amplitude operation of nanomechanical resonators by utilizing a highly efficient phonon generation process. In this regime, the nanomechanical resonators gain sufficient energy from the optical field to overcome the large energy barrier of a double well potential, leading to nanomechanical slow-down and zero frequency singularity, as predicted by early theories . Besides fundamental studies and interests in parametric amplification of small forces, optomechanical backaction is also projected to open new windows for studying discrete mechanical states, and to foster applications. Here we realize a non-volatile mechanical memory element, in which bits are written and reset via optomechanical backaction by controlling the mechanical damping across the barrier. Our study casts a new perspective on the energy dynamics in coupled mechanical resonator - cavity systems and enables novel functional devices that utilize the principles of cavity optomechanics. 	
1110.0025v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1110.0025v1	2011	Computationally Feasible VCG Mechanisms	N. Nisan|A. Ronen	  A major achievement of mechanism design theory is a general method for the construction of truthful mechanisms called VCG (Vickrey, Clarke, Groves). When applying this method to complex problems such as combinatorial auctions, a difficulty arises: VCG mechanisms are required to compute optimal outcomes and are, therefore, computationally infeasible. However, if the optimal outcome is replaced by the results of a sub-optimal algorithm, the resulting mechanism (termed VCG-based) is no longer necessarily truthful. The first part of this paper studies this phenomenon in depth and shows that it is near universal. Specifically, we prove that essentially all reasonable approximations or heuristics for combinatorial auctions as well as a wide class of cost minimization problems yield non-truthful VCG-based mechanisms. We generalize these results for affine maximizers.   The second part of this paper proposes a general method for circumventing the above problem. We introduce a modification of VCG-based mechanisms in which the agents are given a chance to improve the output of the underlying algorithm. When the agents behave truthfully, the welfare obtained by the mechanism is at least as good as the one obtained by the algorithms output. We provide a strong rationale for truth-telling behavior. Our method satisfies individual rationality as well.

1202.2789v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1202.2789v1	2012	The Computational Complexity of Truthfulness in Combinatorial Auctions	Shahar Dobzinski|Jan Vondrak	  One of the fundamental questions of Algorithmic Mechanism Design is whether there exists an inherent clash between truthfulness and computational tractability: in particular, whether polynomial-time truthful mechanisms for combinatorial auctions are provably weaker in terms of approximation ratio than non-truthful ones. This question was very recently answered for universally truthful mechanisms for combinatorial auctions \cite{D11}, and even for truthful-in-expectation mechanisms \cite{DughmiV11}. However, both of these results are based on information-theoretic arguments for valuations given by a value oracle, and leave open the possibility of polynomial-time truthful mechanisms for succinctly described classes of valuations.   This paper is the first to prove {\em computational hardness} results for truthful mechanisms for combinatorial auctions with succinctly described valuations. We prove that there is a class of succinctly represented submodular valuations for which no deterministic truthful mechanism provides an $m^{1/2-\epsilon}$-approximation for a constant $\epsilon>0$, unless $NP=RP$ ($m$ denotes the number of items). Furthermore, we prove that even truthful-in-expectation mechanisms cannot approximate combinatorial auctions with certain succinctly described submodular valuations better than within $n^\gamma$, where $n$ is the number of bidders and $\gamma>0$ some absolute constant, unless $NP \subseteq P/poly$. In addition, we prove computational hardness results for two related problems. 	
1205.2654v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1205.2654v1	2012	Prediction Markets, Mechanism Design, and Cooperative Game Theory	Vincent Conitzer	  Prediction markets are designed to elicit information from multiple agents in order to predict (obtain probabilities for) future events. A good prediction market incentivizes agents to reveal their information truthfully; such incentive compatibility considerations are commonly studied in mechanism design. While this relation between prediction markets and mechanism design is well understood at a high level, the models used in prediction markets tend to be somewhat different from those used in mechanism design. This paper considers a model for prediction markets that fits more straightforwardly into the mechanism design framework. We consider a number of mechanisms within this model, all based on proper scoring rules. We discuss basic properties of these mechanisms, such as incentive compatibility. We also draw connections between some of these mechanisms and cooperative game theory. Finally, we speculate how one might build a practical prediction market based on some of these ideas.

Wellman	  We present a functional framework for automated mechanism design based on a two-stage game model of strategic interaction between the designer and the mechanism participants, and apply it to several classes of two-player infinite games of incomplete information. At the core of our framework is a black-box optimization algorithm which guides the selection process of candidate mechanisms. Our approach yields optimal or nearly optimal mechanisms in several application domains using various objective functions. By comparing our results with known optimal mechanisms, and in some cases improving on the best known mechanisms, we provide evidence that ours is a promising approach to parametric design of indirect mechanisms.

Simmonds|K. W. Lehnert	  Recently, macroscopic mechanical oscillators have been coaxed into a regime of quantum behavior, by direct refrigeration [1] or a combination of refrigeration and laser-like cooling [2, 3]. This exciting result has encouraged notions that mechanical oscillators may perform useful functions in the processing of quantum information with superconducting circuits [1, 4-7], either by serving as a quantum memory for the ephemeral state of a microwave field or by providing a quantum interface between otherwise incompatible systems [8, 9]. As yet, the transfer of an itinerant state or propagating mode of a microwave field to and from a mechanical oscillator has not been demonstrated owing to the inability to agilely turn on and off the interaction between microwave electricity and mechanical motion. Here we demonstrate that the state of an itinerant microwave field can be coherently transferred into, stored in, and retrieved from a mechanical oscillator with amplitudes at the single quanta level. Crucially, the time to capture and to retrieve the microwave state is shorter than the quantum state lifetime of the mechanical oscillator. In this quantum regime, the mechanical oscillator can both store and transduce quantum information.

1212.1522v3	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1212.1522v3	2014	Mechanism Design for Fair Division	Richard Cole|Vasilis Gkatzelis|Gagan Goel	  We revisit the classic problem of fair division from a mechanism design perspective, using {\em Proportional Fairness} as a benchmark. In particular, we aim to allocate a collection of divisible items to a set of agents while incentivizing the agents to be truthful in reporting their valuations. For the very large class of homogeneous valuations, we design a truthful mechanism that provides {\em every agent} with at least a $1/e\approx 0.368$ fraction of her Proportionally Fair valuation. To complement this result, we show that no truthful mechanism can guarantee more than a $0.5$ fraction, even for the restricted class of additive linear valuations. We also propose another mechanism for additive linear valuations that works really well when every item is highly demanded. To guarantee truthfulness, our mechanisms discard a carefully chosen fraction of the allocated resources; we conclude by uncovering interesting connections between our mechanisms and known mechanisms that use money instead.

Hossein Partovi	  Using quantum-classical analogies, we find that dynamical pictures of quantum mechanics have precise counterparts in classical mechanics. In particular, the Eulerian and Lagrangian descriptions of fluid dynamics in classical mechanics are the analogs of the Schroedinger and Heisenberg pictures in quantum mechanics, respectively. Similarities between classical and quantum dynamical pictures are explored within the framework of the Koopman-von Neumann formalism. These allow for a natural definition of various dynamical pictures in classical mechanics as well as the application of classical concepts to quantum dynamics. As an illustration, we use the interaction picture to find the classical evolution of an ensemble of particles of equal initial momenta and arbitrary configuration density under the action of a constant force in one dimension. As a second example, we discuss the extension of the ideas of sensitivity to initial conditions and chaos in classical mechanics to quantum mechanics.

To attract more participants to provide good quality, bidding mechanisms that solicit the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism and its variants are natural fits for crowd sensing applications in mobile social networks. However, in practical continuous crowd sensing applications, where bids cannot be solicited and only posted pricing mechanisms can be implemented. Obviously, these mechanisms for continuous crowd sensing are not applicable. To tackle the issue, we propose a collection-behavior based multi-parameter posted pricing mechanism, not only to consider extensive user participating and sensing data submission quality under given budget constraints by applying all-pay auctions and posted pricing mechanisms, but also to maximize the coverage utilities by applying crowd aversion. Simulation results indicate that incentive mechanisms in our proposed framework outperform the best existing solution. 	
1402.3426v3	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.3426v3	2015	Privacy Games: Optimal User-Centric Data Obfuscation	Reza Shokri	  In this paper, we design user-centric obfuscation mechanisms that impose the minimum utility loss for guaranteeing user's privacy. We optimize utility subject to a joint guarantee of differential privacy (indistinguishability) and distortion privacy (inference error). This double shield of protection limits the information leakage through obfuscation mechanism as well as the posterior inference. We show that the privacy achieved through joint differential-distortion mechanisms against optimal attacks is as large as the maximum privacy that can be achieved by either of these mechanisms separately. Their utility cost is also not larger than what either of the differential or distortion mechanisms imposes. We model the optimization problem as a leader-follower game between the designer of obfuscation mechanism and the potential adversary, and design adaptive mechanisms that anticipate and protect against optimal inference algorithms. Thus, the obfuscation mechanism is optimal against any inference algorithm.

Capuj|Jordi Gomis-Bresco|Francesc Alzina|Alessandro Pitanti|Amadeu Griol|Alejandro Martinez|Clivia M. Sotomayor Torres	  Optical forces can set tiny objects into states of coherent mechanical oscillation, also known as mechanical or phonon lasing. We present a novel pumping mechanism in an opto-mechanical photonic crystal that realizes mechanical lasing with relaxed requirements for the optical-mechanical modes and their inter-coupling. It derives from a spontaneously triggered thermal/free carrier self-pulsing and the anharmonic modulation of the radiation pressure force that comes as a consequence. Moreover, the feedback of the mechanics on the self-pulsing frequency-entrains both oscillators, creating a self-stabilized indecomposable system. A manifold of frequency-entrained regions with two different mechanical modes (at 54 and 122 MHz) are observed as a result of the wide tuneability of the natural frequency of the self-pulsing. The system operates at ambient conditions of pressure and temperature in a silicon compatible platform, which enables its exploitation in sensing, intra-chip metrology or time-keeping applications.

Vidiella-Barranco	  In this work we study an optomechanical system in which there is a purely quadratic optomechanical coupling between the optical and mechanical modes. The optical mode is pumped by three coherent fields and the mechanical mode is parametrically driven. We show that if the frequencies and amplitudes of both optical and mechanical drivings are properly chosen, the optomechanical interaction gives rise to an effective interaction, which, in the presence of optical damping and in the absence of mechanical damping, has the squeezed vacuum state and the squeezed one phonon state as dark states of the dynamics. These states are well known for presenting quadrature squeezing and sub-Poissonian statistics. However, even in the presence of mechanical damping it is possible to find steady states with large degrees of quadrature squeezing or strong sub-Poissonian statistics. Furthermore, we find a counter-intuitive behavior in which a nonzero temperature of the mechanical environment allows the observation of mechanical states with more pronounced sub-Poissonian statistics.

Assuming truthful reporting, we compare student welfare under these mechanisms both from a conceptual and from a quantitative perspective: We first show that, BM rank dominates DA whenever they are comparable; and via limit arguments and simulations we show that ABM yields intermediate student welfare between BM and DA. Second, we perform computational experiments with preference data from the high school match in Mexico City. We find that student welfare (in terms of rank transitions) is highest under BM, intermediate under ABM, and lowest under DA. BM, ABM, and DA can thus be understood to form a hierarchy in terms of student welfare. In contrast, in (Mennle and Seuken, 2017), we have found that the same mechanisms also form a hierarchy in terms of incentives for truthtelling that points in the opposite direction. A decision between them therefore involves an implicit trade-off between incentives and student welfare.

Goldberg|Jie Zhang|Jinshan Zhang	  We study the Price of Anarchy of mechanisms for the well-known problem of one-sided matching, or house allocation, with respect to the social welfare objective. We consider both ordinal mechanisms, where agents submit preference lists over the items, and cardinal mechanisms, where agents may submit numerical values for the items being allocated. We present a general lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ on the Price of Anarchy, which applies to all mechanisms. We show that two well-known mechanisms, Probabilistic Serial, and Random Priority, achieve a matching upper bound. We extend our lower bound to the Price of Stability of a large class of mechanisms that satisfy a common proportionality property, and show stronger bounds on the Price of Anarchy of all deterministic mechanisms. 	
1503.00238v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.00238v2	2016	Geometric formulation of quantum mechanics	Hoshang Heydari	  Quantum mechanics is among the most important and successful mathematical model for describing our physical reality. The traditional formulation of quantum mechanics is linear and algebraic. In contrast classical mechanics is a geometrical and non-linear theory that is defined on a symplectic manifold. However, after invention of general relativity, we are convinced that geometry is physical and effect us in all scale. Hence the geometric formulation of quantum mechanics sought to give a unified picture of physical systems based on its underling geometrical structures, e.g., now, the states are represented by points of a symplectic manifold with a compatible Riemannian metric, the observables are real-valued functions on the manifold, and the quantum evolution is governed by a symplectic flow that is generated by a Hamiltonian function. In this work we will give a compact introduction to main ideas of geometric formulation of quantum mechanics. We will provide the reader with the details of geometrical structures of both pure and mixed quantum states. We will also discuss and review some important applications of geometric quantum mechanics.

These further generalize two quite well known examples: --1) Kendall's (metric) shape space with his shape statistics and Barbour's mechanics thereupon. 0) Leibnizian relational space alias metric scale-and-shape space to which corresponds Barbour-Bertotti mechanics. This paper's new theories include, using the invariant and group namings, 1) $Angle$ alias $conformal$ $shape$ $mechanics$. 2) $Area ratio$ alias $affine$ $shape$ $mechanics$. 3) $ Area$ alias $affine$ $scale$-$and$-$shape$ $mechanics$. 1) to 3) rest respectively on angle space, area-ratio space, and area space configuration spaces. Probability and statistics applications are also pointed to in outline.   4) Various supersymmetric counterparts of -1) to 3) are considered. Since supergravity differs considerably from GR-based conceptions of Background Independence, some of the new supersymmetric shape mechanics are compared with both. These reveal compatibility between supersymmetry and GR-based conceptions of Background Independence, at least within these simpler model arenas.

Under lexicographic preferences, we characterize the set of strategyproof, non-bossy, and neutral quota mechanisms and show that under a mild Pareto efficiency condition, serial dictatorship quota mechanisms are the only mechanisms satisfying these properties. Dropping the neutrality requirement, this class of quota mechanisms further expands to sequential dictatorship quota mechanisms. We then extend quota mechanisms to randomized settings, and show that the random serial dictatorship quota mechanisms (RSDQ) are envyfree, strategyproof, and ex post efficient for any number of agents and objects and any quota system, proving that the well-studied Random Serial Dictatorship (RSD) satisfies envyfreeness when preferences are lexicographic. 	
1512.04637v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.04637v1	2015	Graphical Exchange Mechanisms	Pradeep Dubey|Siddhartha Sahi|Martin Shubik	  Consider an exchange mechanism which accepts diversified offers of various commodities and redistributes everything it receives. We impose certain conditions of fairness and convenience on such a mechanism and show that it admits unique prices, which equalize the value of offers and returns for each individual.   We next define the complexity of a mechanism in terms of certain integers $\tau_{ij},\pi_{ij}$ and $k_{i}$ that represent the time required to exchange $i$ for $j$, the difficulty in determining the exchange ratio, and the dimension of the message space. We show that there are a finite number of minimally complex mechanisms, in each of which all trade is conducted through markets for commodity pairs.   Finally we consider minimal mechanisms with smallest worst-case complexities $\tau=\max\tau_{ij}$ and $\pi=\max\pi_{ij}$. For $m>3$ commodities, there are precisely three such mechanisms, one of which has a distinguished commodity -- the money -- that serves as the sole medium of exchange. As $m\rightarrow \infty$ the money mechanism is the only one with bounded $\left( \pi ,\tau\right) $.

We require that the mechanism satisfies a strong individual rationality constraint, requiring that the stage utility of each agent be positive during each period. We show that the optimum mechanism can be computed by solving a nested sequence of static (single-period) mechanisms that optimize a tradeoff between the surplus of the allocation and the buyer's utility. We also provide a simple dynamic mechanism that obtains at least half of the optimal revenue. The mechanism either ignores history and posts the optimal monopoly price in each period, or allocates with a probability that is independent of the current report of the agent and is based only on previous reports. Our characterization extends to multi-agent auctions. We also formulate a discounted infinite horizon version of the problem, where we study the performance of "Markov mechanisms."

Kippenberg	  Cavity-enhanced radiation-pressure coupling of optical and mechanical degrees of freedom gives rise to a range of optomechanical phenomena, in particular providing a route to the quantum regime of mesoscopic mechanical oscillators. A prime challenge in cavity optomechanics has however been to realize systems which simultaneously maximize optical finesse and mechanical quality. Here we demonstrate for the first time independent control over both mechanical and optical degree of freedom within one and the same on-chip resonator. The first direct observation of mechanical normal mode coupling in a micromechanical system allows for a quantitative understanding of mechanical dissipation. Subsequent optimization of the resonator geometry enables intrinsic material loss limited mechanical Q-factors, rivalling the best values reported in the high MHz frequency range, while simultaneously preserving the resonators' ultra-high optical finesse. Besides manifesting a complete understanding of mechanical dissipation in microresonator based optomechanical systems, our results provide an ideal setting for cavity optomechanics.

1407.2890v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.2890v2	2014	Topological mechanisms as classical spinor fields	Vincenzo Vitelli|Nitin Upadhyaya|Bryan Gin-ge Chen	  A mechanism is a zero-energy motion of a mechanical structure that does not stretch or compress any of its components. Here, we focus on a special class of mechanisms that we dub topological because they are insensitive to smooth changes in material parameters. Topological mechanisms do not arise from local under-coordination, but they can be localized to solitons in the underlying structure. In this letter, we exploit supersymmetry to develop a real-space formalism whereby a topological mechanism can be described as a classical spinor whose real components are the soliton-induced displacement and stress fields. Our analytical approach goes beyond topological band theory by addressing the non-linearity and inhomogeneity of the underlying structure key to the very definition of a mechanism. We apply this general method to an activated mechanism, inspired by the organic molecule polyacetylene, that can propagate down an assembly line without deploying the whole structure. 	
1408.1486v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1408.1486v1	2014	Complexity of Mechanism Design	Vincent Conitzer|Tuomas Sandholm	  The aggregation of conflicting preferences is a central problem in multiagent systems. The key difficulty is that the agents may report their preferences insincerely. Mechanism design is the art of designing the rules of the game so that the agents are motivated to report their preferences truthfully and a (socially) desirable outcome is chosen. We propose an approach where a mechanism is automatically created for the preference aggregation setting at hand. This has several advantages, but the downside is that the mechanism design optimization problem needs to be solved anew each time. Focusing on settings where side payments are not possible, we show that the mechanism design problem is NP-complete for deterministic mechanisms. This holds both for dominant-strategy implementation and for Bayes-Nash implementation. We then show that if we allow randomized mechanisms, the mechanism design problem becomes tractable. In other words, the coordinator can tackle the computational complexity introduced by its uncertainty about the agents preferences BY making the agents face additional uncertainty.This comes at no loss, AND IN SOME cases at a gain, IN the(social) objective.

Yokoyama	  We investigate the triggering mechanisms of plasma eruptions in the solar atmosphere due to interactions between emerging flux and coronal arcade fields by using two-dimensional MHD simulations. We perform parameter surveys with respect to arcade field height, magnetic field strength, and emerging flux location. Our results show that two possible mechanisms exist, and which mechanism is dominant depends mostly on emerging flux location. One mechanism appears when the location of emerging flux is close to the polarity inversion line (PIL) of an arcade field. This mechanism requires reconnection between the emerging flux and the arcade field, as pointed out by previous studies. The other mechanism appears when the location of emerging flux is around the edge of an arcade field. This mechanism does not require reconnection between the emerging flux and the arcade field but does demand reconnection in the arcade field above the PIL. Furthermore, we found that the eruptive condition for this mechanism can be represented by a simple formula.

Our mechanism uses a Wishart distribution to generate matrix noise. In particular, We apply this mechanism to principal component analysis. Our mechanism is able to keep the positive semi-definiteness of the published covariance matrix. Thus, our approach gives rise to a general publishing framework for input perturbation of a symmetric positive semidefinite matrix. Moreover, compared with the classic Laplace mechanism, our method has better utility guarantee. To the best of our knowledge, Wishart mechanism is the best input perturbation approach for $(\epsilon,0)$-differentially private PCA. We also compare our work with previous exponential mechanism algorithms in the literature and provide near optimal bound while having more flexibility and less computational intractability.

Dobzinski, Nisan, and Schapira provided the first mechanism that guarantees a non-trivial approximation ratio of $O(\log^2 m)$ [STOC'06], where $m$ is the number of items. This was subsequently improved to $O(\log m\log \log m)$ [Dobzinski, APPROX'07] and then to $O(\log m)$ [Krysta and Vocking, ICALP'12].   In this paper we develop the first mechanism that breaks the logarithmic barrier. Specifically, the mechanism provides an approximation ratio of $O(\sqrt {\log m})$. Similarly to previous constructions, our mechanism uses polynomially many value and demand queries, and in fact provides the same approximation ratio for the larger class of XOS (a.k.a. fractionally subadditive) valuations.   We also develop a computationally efficient implementation of the mechanism for combinatorial auctions with budget additive bidders. Although in general computing a demand query is NP-hard for budget additive valuations, we observe that the specific form of demand queries that our mechanism uses can be efficiently computed when bidders are budget additive.

Bhattacharya	  Nonclassical states of macroscopic objects are promising for ultrasensitive metrology as well as testing quantum mechanics. In this work, we investigate dissipative mechanical quantum state engineering in an optically levitated nanodiamond. First, we study single-mode mechanical squeezed states by magnetically coupling the mechanical motion to a dressed three-level system provided by a Nitrogen-vacancy center in the nanoparticle. Quantum coherence between the dressed levels is created via microwave fields to induce a two-phonon transition, which results in mechanical squeezing. Remarkably, we find that in ultrahigh vacuum quantum squeezing is achievable at room temperature with feedback cooling. For moderate vacuum, quantum squeezing is possible with cryogenic temperature. Second, we present a setup for two mechanical modes coupled to the dressed three levels, which results in two-mode squeezing analogous to the mechanism of the single-mode case. In contrast to previous works, our study provides a deterministic method for engineering macroscopic squeezed states without the requirement for a cavity.

Aware of the paramount importance of effectively incentivizing participation in such systems, the research community has proposed a wide variety of incentive mechanisms. However, different from most of these existing mechanisms which assume the existence of only one data requester, we consider MCS systems with multiple data requesters, which are actually more common in practice. Specifically, our incentive mechanism is based on double auction, and is able to stimulate the participation of both data requesters and workers. In real practice, the incentive mechanism is typically not an isolated module, but interacts with the data aggregation mechanism that aggregates workers' data. For this reason, we propose CENTURION, a novel integrated framework for multi-requester MCS systems, consisting of the aforementioned incentive and data aggregation mechanism. CENTURION's incentive mechanism satisfies truthfulness, individual rationality, computational efficiency, as well as guaranteeing non-negative social welfare, and its data aggregation mechanism generates highly accurate aggregated results. The desirable properties of CENTURION are validated through both theoretical analysis and extensive simulations.

Here, using molecular dynamic simulations, we demonstrate that there exists an intrinsic energy conversion mechanism between thermal energy and mechanical work in the telescopic motions of double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs). A DWCNT can inherently convert heat into mechanical work in its telescopic extension process, while convert mechanical energy into heat in its telescopic retraction process. These two processes are thermodynamically reversible. The underlying mechanism for this reversibility is that the entropy changes with the telescopic overlapping length of concentric individual tubes. We find also that the entropy effect enlarges with the decreasing intertube space of DWCNTs. As a result, the spontaneously telescopic motion of a condensed DWCNT can be switched to extrusion by rising the system temperature above a critical value. These findings are important for fundamentally understanding the mechanical behavior of concentric nanotubes, and may have general implications in the application of DWCNTs as linear motors in nanodevices.

In this platform application security is built primarily upon a system of permissions which specify restrictions on the operations a particular process can perform. The critical role of these security mechanisms makes them a prime target for (formal) verification. We present an idealized model of a reference monitor of the novel mechanisms of Android 6 (and further), where it is possible to grant permissions at run time. Using the programming language of the proof-assistant Coq we have developed a functional implementation of the reference validation mechanism and certified its correctness with respect to the specified reference monitor. Several properties concerning the permission model of Android 6 and its security mechanisms have been formally formulated and proved. Applying the program extraction mechanism provided by Coq we have also derived a certified Haskell prototype of the reference validation mechanism.

How does quantum randomness differ fundamentally from classical randomness? We cannot fully explain how the theories differ until we can derive them within a single axiomatic framework, allowing an unambiguous account of how one theory is the limit of the other. Here we derive nonrelativistic quantum mechanics and classical statistical mechanics within a common framework. The common axioms include conservation of average energy and conservation of probability current. But two axioms distinguish quantum mechanics from classical statistical mechanics: an "ontic extension" defines a nonseparable (global) random variable that generates physical correlations, and an "epistemic restriction" constrains allowed phase space distributions. The ontic extension and epistemic restriction, with strength on the order of Planck's constant, imply quantum entanglement and uncertainty relations. This framework suggests that the wave function is epistemic, yet it does not provide an ontic dynamics for individual systems.

Each mechanism defines a game where the consumers optimize their flexible consumption to reduce their electricity bills. Mohsenian-Rad et al propose a daily mechanism for which they prove the social optimality. Baharlouei et al propose a hourly billing mechanism for which we give theoretical results: we prove the uniqueness of an equilibrium in the associated game and give an upper bound on its price of anarchy. We evaluate numerically the two mechanisms, using real consumption data from Pecan Street Inc. The simulations show that the equilibrium reached with the hourly mechanism is socially optimal up to 0.1%, and that it achieves an important fairness property according to a quantitative indicator we define. We observe that the two DSM mechanisms avoid the synchronization effect induced by non- game theoretic mechanisms, e.g. Peak/OffPeak hours contracts.

Taking Einstein's historical construction of Special Relativity as a model, the construction is carried out in close contact with a simple quantum mechanical Gedanken experiment. This leads to the standard axioms of Quantum Mechanics. The quantum mechanical description is identified as a tool that allows describing objects with discrete degrees of freedom in space-time covariant with respect to coordinate transformations. An inherent property of this description is a quantum mechanical interaction mechanism. The construction gives detailed answers to controversial questions, such as the measurement problem, the informational content of the wave function, and the completeness of Quantum Mechanics. 	
1405.2452v3	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.2452v3	2014	Mechanism Design for Crowdsourcing: An Optimal 1-1/e Competitive   Budget-Feasible Mechanism for Large Markets	Nima Anari|Gagan Goel|Afshin Nikzad	  In this paper we consider a mechanism design problem in the context of large-scale crowdsourcing markets such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk, ClickWorker, CrowdFlower. In these markets, there is a requester who wants to hire workers to accomplish some tasks. Each worker is assumed to give some utility to the requester. Moreover each worker has a minimum cost that he wants to get paid for getting hired. This minimum cost is assumed to be private information of the workers. The question then is - if the requester has a limited budget, how to design a direct revelation mechanism that picks the right set of workers to hire in order to maximize the requester's utility.   We note that although the previous work has studied this problem, a crucial difference in which we deviate from earlier work is the notion of large-scale markets that we introduce in our model. Without the large market assumption, it is known that no mechanism can achieve an approximation factor better than 0.414 and 0.5 for deterministic and randomized mechanisms respectively (while the best known deterministic and randomized mechanisms achieve an approximation ratio of 0.292 and 0.33 respectively). In this paper, we design a budget-feasible mechanism for large markets that achieves an approximation factor of 1-1/e (i.e. almost 0.63). Our mechanism can be seen as a generalization of an alternate way to look at the proportional share mechanism which is used in all the previous works so far on this problem. Interestingly, we also show that our mechanism is optimal by showing that no truthful mechanism can achieve a factor better than 1-1/e; thus, fully resolving this setting. Finally we consider the more general case of submodular utility functions and give new and improved mechanisms for the case when the markets are large.

Here we show an approach toward the statistical mechanics of such self-gravitating systems (SGS). This is a generalization of the standard statistical mechanics based on the new definition of entropy; Tsallis statistical mechanics. Developing the composition of entropy and the generalized Euler relation, we investigate the galaxy distributions in count-in-cell method. This is applied to the data of CfA II South redshift survey.

In contrast to the conventional understanding that there are no interactions between droplets in the late stage of spinodal decomposition, we demonstrate the existence of interactions between droplets that is caused by the coupling between diffuse concentration change around droplets. We show the possibility that this mechanism plays an important role in droplet phase separation together with Brownian-coagulation mechanism. We also discuss the coupling between hydrodynamic and diffusion modes, namely, "collision-induced collision" phenomena.

Payne	  Mechanically induced degradation of diamond, as occurs during polishing, is studied using total--energy pseudopotential calculations. The strong asymmetry in the rate of polishing between different directions on the diamond (110) surface is explained in terms of an atomistic mechanism for nano--groove formation. The post--polishing surface morphology and the nature of the polishing residue predicted by this mechanism are consistent with experimental evidence.

In a slow velocity region where the system almost behaves adiabatically, the magnetic plateau appears which has been observed in the recent experiment of V$_{15}$ [ Phys. Rev. Lett. (2000)]. We investigate its mechanism and propose that this phenomenon is quite universal in the quasi-adiabatic transition with small inflow of the heat, and we call it 'Magnetic Foehn Effect'. We observe the crossover between this mechanism and the Landau-Zener-St\"{u}ckelberg mechanism changing the velocity. Some experiment is proposed to clarify the inherent mechanism of this effect.

Fulde	  We propose a spin-mechanical device to control and detect spin currents by mechanical torque. Our hybrid nano-electro-mechanical device, which contains a nanowire with a ferromagnetic-nonmagnetic interface, is designed to measure or induce spin polarized currents. Since spin carries angular momentum, a spin flip or spin transfer process involves a change in angular momentum--and hence, a torque--which enables mechanical measurement of spin flips. Conversely, an applied torque can result in spin polarization and spin current. 	
0610142v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/0610142v2	2007	Is quantum mechanics based on an invariance principle?	Leon Brenig	  Non-relativistic quantum mechanics for a free particle is shown to emerge from classical mechanics through an invariance principle under transformations that preserve the Heisenberg position-momentum inequality. These transformations are induced by isotropic space dilations. This invariance imposes a change in the laws of classical mechanics that exactly corresponds to the transition to quantum mechanics. The Schroedinger equation appears jointly with a second nonlinear equation describing non-unitary processes. Unitary and non-unitary evolutions are exclusive and appear sequentially in time. The non-unitary equation admits solutions that seem to correspond to the collapse of the wave function.

This is a potential background to more interesting mechanisms. We find that this mechanism is negligible in the CERES experiments. Generally, the contribution due to this mechanism is small in the central region, while it can be large for small invariant masses and forward or backward rapidities. A simple formula based on the equivalent photon approximation and applications to a possible scenario at RHIC are also given.

The mechanism is natural and we use it to drive the electroweak symmetry breaking. The mechanism can be implemented in different ways while here we review two simple models in which the Bose-Einstein sector is felt directly or indirectly by all of the standard model fields. The structure of the corrections due to the new mechanism is general and independent on the model used leading to experimental signatures which can be disentangled from other known extensions of the standard model.

Blum	  By assuming the existence of a novel multipronged string state for D-particles interacting with D-brane intersections in type IIA string theory, we are able to derive a quantum mechanical description of supersymmetric Reissner-Nordstrom black holes. A supersymmetric index calculation provides evidence for this conjecture. The quantum mechanical system becomes two decoupled conformal quantum mechanical systems in the low energy limit. The conformal quantum mechanics has expected properties of a dual description of string theory on $AdS_2\times S^2$.

It is proved that in the abelian case the topological mass generation mechanism introduced in hep-th/9301060, hep-th/9512216 is equivalent to the mass generation mechanism defined in hep-th/0510240, hep-th/0605050 with the help of ``localization'' of a nonlocal gauge invariant action. In the nonabelian case the former mechanism is known to generate a unitary renormalizable quantum field theory describing a massive vector field.

The chapter introduces standard quantum mechanics by means of a symmetry principle, without reference to classical mechanics. The mathematical foundation of this approach comes from a recent paper of Naudts and Kuna on covariance systems. The standard representation of quantum mechanics is derived. Next, spin and mass of a quantum particle are explained as labels of projective representations of the Galilei group.

In Chapter 1 we present a minimal mathematical introduction to operator algebras, with physical applications in mind. In Chapter 2 we study some questions related to the quantum statistical mechanics of spin systems, with particular attention to the time evolution of infinite systems. The basic reference for these two chapters is Bratteli-Robinson: Operator algebras and quantum statistical mechanics I, II. In Chapter 3 we discuss the nonequilibrium statistical mechanics of quantum spin systems, as it is currently being developped.

It is a polynomially graded Lie algebra, a class we introduce. We describe these Lie algebras, give an algorithm to calculate the dimensions $c_n$ of the homogeneous subspaces of the Lie algebra of classical mechanics, and determine the value of its entropy $\lim_{n\to\infty} c_n^{1/n}$. It is $1.82542377420108...$, a fundamental constant associated to classical mechanics. 	
0409073v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/math-ph/0409073v1	2004	Star Products and Geometric Algebra	Peter Henselder|Allen C. Hirshfeld|Thomas Spernat	  The formalism of geometric algebra can be described as deformed super analysis. The deformation is done with a fermionic star product, that arises from deformation quantization of pseudoclassical mechanics. If one then extends the deformation to the bosonic coefficient part of superanalysis one obtains quantum mechanics for systems with spin. This approach clarifies on the one hand the relation between Grassmann and Clifford structures in geometric algebra and on the other hand the relation between classical mechanics and quantum mechanics. Moreover it gives a formalism that allows to handle classical and quantum mechanics in a consistent manner.

Cai	  A new mechanism, the forget-remember mechanism, is proposed for studying the spreading process in 2-state model. Such mechanism exhibits behaviors of message spreading influenced by some kinds of functions about time and history caring about the individuals of the spreading system, holding message or being out of message. To demonstrate the mechanism, both linear and exponential forms for forget-function and remember-function are simulated and show that a great impact on the saturation of message-spreading and the relative phase transformation.

The new mechanism is present in the interaction between oscillatory modes of odd and even parity in systems of large but finite aspect ratio, and provides an explanation for the bursting behavior observed in binary fluid convection. Additional applications of the new mechanism are proposed.

Maia	  We present an axiomatic framework for what we call Mach's mechanics, inspired on the ideas by A. K. T. Assis and P. Graneau about relational mechanics. We show that contrarily to what is suggested by these authors, Mach's principle does not need to be committed with any Weber's like gravitational force. Actually it is possible to settle an axiomatic framework for non-relativistic classical particle mechanics which incorporates Mach's principle and is consistent with any force that obeys the newtonian action-reaction principle. We make further criticisms concerning relational mechanics. 	
0404104v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0404104v1	2004	Playing Games with the Quantum Three-Body Problem	Tarun Biswas	  Quantum mechanics courses focus mostly on its computational aspects. This alone does not provide the same depth of understanding as most physicists have of classical mechanics. The understanding of classical mechanics is significantly bolstered by the intuitive understanding that one acquires through the playing of games like baseball at an early age. It would be good to have similar games for quantum mechanics. However, real games that involve quantum phenomena directly are impossible. So, computer simulated games are good alternatives. Here a computer game involving three interacting quantum particles is discussed. It is hoped that such games played at an early age will provide the intuitive background for a better understanding of quantum mechanics at a later age.

Vahala|T. J. Kippenberg	  Cooling of a 58 MHz micro-mechanical resonator from room temperature to 11 K is demonstrated using cavity enhanced radiation pressure. Detuned pumping of an optical resonance allows enhancement of the blue shifted motional sideband (caused by the oscillator's Brownian motion) with respect to the red-shifted sideband leading to cooling of the mechanical oscillator mode. The reported cooling mechanism is a manifestation of the effect of radiation pressure induced dynamical backaction. These results constitute an important step towards achieving ground state cooling of a mechanical oscillator.

Numerous network mechanisms have recently been proposed to reproduce specific properties such as degree distributions or clustering coefficients. We present a method for inferring the mechanism most accurately capturing a given network topology, exploiting discriminative tools from machine learning. The Drosophila melanogaster protein network is confidently and robustly (to noise and training data subsampling) classified as a duplication-mutation-complementation network over preferential attachment, small-world, and other duplication-mutation mechanisms. Systematic classification, rather than statistical study of specific properties, provides a discriminative approach to understand the design of complex networks.

Stefanini	  We describe a mechanism for pronounced biochemical oscillations, relevant to microscopic systems, such as the intracellular environment. This mechanism operates for reaction schemes which, when modeled using deterministic rate equations, fail to exhibit oscillations for any values of rate constants. The mechanism relies on amplification of the underlying stochasticity of reaction kinetics within a narrow window of frequencies. This amplification allows fluctuations to beat the central limit theorem, having a dominant effect even though the number of molecules in the system is relatively large. The mechanism is quantitatively studied within simple models of self-regulatory gene expression, and glycolytic oscillations.

Stapp	  Classical mechanics is based upon a mechanical picture of nature that is fundamentally incorrect. It has been replaced at the basic level by a radically different theory: quantum mechanics. This change entails an enormous shift in our basic conception of nature, one that can profoundly alter the scientific image of man himself. Self-image is the foundation of values, and the replacement of the mechanistic self-image derived from classical mechanics by one concordant with quantum mechanics may provide the foundation of a moral order better suited to our times, a self-image that endows human life with meaning, responsibility, and a deeper linkage to nature as a whole.

Isidro	  A recent concept in theoretical physics, motivated in string duality and M-theory, is the notion that not all quantum theories arise from quantising a classical system. Also, a given quantum model may possess more than just one classical limit. In view of these developments, we analyse some general properties that quantum mechanics must satisfy, if it is not to be formulated as a quantisation of a given classical mechanics. Instead, our approach to quantum mechanics is modelled on a statement that is close in spirit to the equivalence principle of general relativity, thus bearing a strong resemblance with the equivalence principle of quantum mechanics formulated by Faraggi-Matone.

Rylov	  It is shown that the statistical conception of quantum mechanics is dynamical but not probabilistic, i.e. the statistical description in quantum mechanics is founded on dynamics. A use of the probability theory, when it takes place, is auxiliary. Attention is drawn to the fact that in the quantum mechanics there are two different objects: an individual object to be statistically described and a statistical average object, which is a result of the statistical description. Identification of the two different objects (a use of the same term for both) is an origin of many known quantum mechanics paradoxes.

Under certain pressure of mathematical formalism there has raised a hypothesis of complexity of space and time by Minkovsky, being significant mainly for quantum objects. In this eight-dimensional space and time with six space and two time dimensions all the problems and peculiarities of quantum mechanical formalism disappear, the reasons of their appearance become clear, and there comes a clear and physically transparent picture of the foundations of quantum mechanics.

Kaniadakis	  Recently, the one particle quantum mechanics has been obtained in the framework of an entirely classical subquantum kinetics. In the present paper we argue that, within the same scheme and without any additional assumption, it is possible to obtain also the $n$-particle non relativistic quantum mechanics. The main goal of the present effort is to show that the classical BBGKY hierarchical equation, for the $n$-particle reduced distribution function, is the ancestor of the $n$-particle Schr\"odinger equation. On the other hand we show that within the scenario of the subquantum structure of quantum particle, the Fisher information measure emerges naturally in quantum mechanics.

Kapsa	  Probabilistic description of results of measurements and its consequences for understanding quantum mechanics are discussed. It is shown that the basic mathematical structure of quantum mechanics like the probability amplitude, Born rule, probability density current, commutation relations, momentum operator, uncertainty relations, rules for including the scalar and vector potentials and existence of antiparticles can be derived from the definition of the mean values of the space coordinates and time. Equations of motion of quantum mechanics, the Klein-Gordon equation, Schroedinger equation and Dirac equation are obtained from requirement of the relativistic invariance of the theory. Limit case of localized probability densities leads to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation of classical mechanics. Many particle systems are also discussed.

Anders Månsson	  In this paper we discuss and analyse the idea of trying to see (non-relativistic) quantum mechanics as a ``space-time statistical mechanics'', by using the classical statistical mechanical method on objective microscopic space-time configurations. It is argued that this could perhaps be accomplished by giving up the assumption that the objective ``state'' of a system is independent of a future measurement performed on the system. This idea is then applied in an example of quantum state estimation on a qubit system.

This formulation, which includes explicitly the macroscopic systems, assumes the probabilistic interpretation and is nevertheless objective. The classical paradoxes of quantum mechanics are analyzed and their origin is found to be the fictitious properties that are usually attributed to quantum-mechanical states. The hypothesis that any mixed state can always be considered as an incoherent superposition of pure states is found to contradict quantum mechanics. A solution of EPR paradox is proposed. It is shown that entanglement of quantum states is compatible with realism and locality of events, but implies non-local encoding of information.

Here we show that the Born rule is not solely quantum mechanical; rather, it arises naturally in the Hilbert space formulation of {\it classical} mechanics as well. These results provide new insights into the nature of the Born rule, and impact on its understanding in the framework of quantum mechanics.

By tuning the magnetic field properly, either linear or quadratic couplings can be realized, with a discretely adjustable coupling strength. This provides a way to realize coherent nonlinear effects in a nano mechanical resonator by coupling it to a Josephson quantum circuit. As an example, we show how squeezing of the nano mechanical resonator state can be realized with this technique. We also propose a simple method to measure the uncertainty in the position of the nano mechanical resonator without quantum state tomography.

We outline the main characteristics of its non-relativistic formulation. Most notably it does provide a simple solution to the infamous measurement problem of quantum mechanics. Presumably the most common objection against Bohmian mechanics is based on its non-locality and its apparent conflict with relativity and quantum field theory. However, several models for a quantum field theoretical generalization do exist. We give a non-technical account of some of these models.

Dias|Tapio Ala-Nissila|Mikko Karttunen|Ilpo Vattulainen|Martin Grant	  We elucidate the mechanism of cold denaturation through constant-pressure simulations for a model of hydrophobic molecules in an explicit solvent. We find that the temperature dependence of the hydrophobic effect is the driving force/induces/facilitates cold denaturation. The physical mechanism underlying this phenomenon is identified as the destabilization of hydrophobic contact in favor of solvent separated configurations, the same mechanism seen in pressure induced denaturation. A phenomenological explanation proposed for the mechanism is suggested as being responsible for cold denaturation in real proteins. 	
0705.1399v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/0705.1399v1	2007	A New Concept of Modular Parallel Mechanism for Machining Applications	Damien Chablat|Philippe Wenger	  The subject of this paper is the design of a new concept of modular parallel mechanisms for three, four or five-axis machining applications. Most parallel mechanisms are designed for three- or six-axis machining applications. In the last case, the position and the orientation of the tool are coupled and the shape of the workspace is complex. The aim of this paper is to use a simple parallel mechanism with two-degree-of-freedom (dof) for translation motions and to add one or two legs to add one or two-dofs for rotation motions. The kinematics and singular configurations are studied for each mechanism.

Nikolic	  All measurable predictions of classical mechanics can be reproduced from a quantum-like interpretation of a nonlinear Schrodinger equation. The key observation leading to classical physics is the fact that a wave function that satisfies a linear equation is real and positive, rather than complex. This has profound implications on the role of the Bohmian classical-like interpretation of linear quantum mechanics, as well as on the possibilities to find a consistent interpretation of arbitrary nonlinear generalizations of quantum mechanics.

Three 2-DOF parallel mechanism architectures dedicated to machining applications are studied in this paper. The three mechanisms have two constant length struts gliding along fixed linear actuated joints with different relative orientation. The comparative study is conducted on the basis of a same prescribed Cartesian workspace for the three mechanisms. The common desired workspace properties are a rectangular shape and given kinetostatic performances. The machine size of each resulting design is used as a comparative criterion. The 2-DOF machine mechanisms analyzed in this paper can be extended to 3-axis machines by adding a third joint.

Delphenich	  It is shown that physical mechanics for pointlike bodies can be effectively modeled in terms of the action of transformation groups that act as symmetries of the solutions of systems of differential equations that describe the integrability of dynamical states. The equations of motion are then obtained from these integrability equations for the dynamical states. It is also observed that the functions that define the components of a dynamical state represent a set of mechanical constitutive laws. The variational formulation of mechanics is shown to be a specialization of these principles.

Sen	  Wigner had expressed the opinion that the impossibility of exact measurements of single operators like position operators rendered the notion of geometrical points somewhat dubious in physics. Using Sewell's recent resolution of the measurement problem (collapse of the wave packet) in quantum mechanics and extending it to the measurement of operators with continuous spectra, we are able to compare the situation in quantum mechanics with that in quantum mechanics. Our conclusion is that the notion of a geometrical point is as meaningful in quantum mechanics as it is in classical mechanics. 	
0801.3189v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/0801.3189v1	2008	A classical interpretation of quantum mechanics and the measurement   problem	Christian Jansson	  In this paper a didactic approach is described which immediately leads to an understanding of those postulates of quantum mechanics used most frequently in quantum computation. Moreover, an interpretation of quantum mechanics is presented which is motivated by retaining the point of view of classical mechanics as much as possible, and which is consistent with relativity theory. Everything can be written down in terms of well-known mathematical formulations that can be found in every textbook about quantum mechanics. Therefore, in this version, almost no formulas are used. 	
0809.1351v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/0809.1351v1	2008	Background Independent Quantum Mechanics, Classical Geometric Forms and   Geometric Quantum Mechanics-I	Aalok Pandya	  The geometry of the symplectic structures and Fubini-Study metric is discussed. Discussion in the paper addresses geometry of Quantum Mechanics in the classical phase space. Also, geometry of Quantum Mechanics in the projective Hilbert space has been discussed for the chosen Quantum states. Since the theory of classical gravity is basically geometric in nature and Quantum Mechanics is in no way devoid of geometry, the explorations pertaining to more and more geometry in Quantum Mechanics could prove to be valuable for larger objectives such as understanding of gravity.

A drawback of parallel mechanisms is the non homogeneity of kinetostatic performance within their workspace. The common approach to solve this problem is the introduction of actuation redundancy, that involves force control algorithms. Another approach, highlighted in this paper, is to select the actuated joint in each limb with regard to the pose of the end-effector. First, the architecture of the mechanism and two kinetostatic performance indices are described. Then, the actuating modes of the mechanism are compared.

Cornish	  The Conditional Probability Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics replaces the abstract notion of time used in standard Quantum Mechanics by the time that can be read off from a physical clock. The use of physical clocks leads to apparent non-unitary and decoherence. Here we show that a close approximation to standard Quantum Mechanics can be recovered from conditional Quantum Mechanics for semi-classical clocks, and we use these clocks to compute the minimum decoherence predicted by the Conditional Probability Interpretation.

We extend the discussion of geometry of uncertainty relations in wider perspective. Also, we discuss the geometry of probability in Quantum Mechanics and its interpretations. We give yet another interpretation to the notion of Faraday lines and loops as the locus of probability flow. Also, the possibilities of visualization of spectra of area operators by means of classical geometric forms and conventional Quantum Mechanics are explored.

We have built an exactly solvable model in which electric current and mechanical oscillation are treated fully quantum mechanically on an equal footing. Quantum mechanically fluctuating Aharonov-Bohm phases obtained by the electrons cause nontrivial contribution to mechanical vibration and electrical conduction of the wire. We demonstrate our theory by calculating the admittance of the wire which are influenced by the multiple interplay between the mechanical and the electrical energy scales, magnetic field strength, and the electron-electron interaction.

Plotnikov|A. K. Bakarov|A. I. Toropov	  Influence of forced mechanical vibrations of a suspended single-electron transistor on electron tunneling through the quantum dot limited by the Coulomb blockade is investigated. It is shown that mechanical oscillations of the quantum dot lead to the Coulomb blockade breakdown, shown in sharp resonant peaks in the transistor conductance dependence on the excitation frequency at values corresponding to the mechanical oscillations eigen modes. Physical mechanism of the observed effect is considered. It is presumably connected with oscillations of the mutual electrical capacitances between the quantum dot and surrounding electrodes.

Maleki	  We propose a method for frequency stabilization of a resonant opto-mechanical oscillator utilizing the different temperature and strain dependence of the optical and mechanical modes. In particular, we show that the temperature of the mechanical resonator can be stabilized to microKelvin level without the need for an external temperature or frequency reference. The method is promising for reaching the thermodynamically limited performance of opto-mechanical oscillators, and even for lifting the thermodynamic limit.

Tian	  Cavity cooling via quantum backaction force can extract thermal fluctuations from a mechanical resonator to reach the quantum ground state. Surface or bulk two-level-system (TLS) defects in a mechanical resonator can couple with the mechanical mode via deformation potential and affect the cooling process significantly. Here, we develop a theory to study the cavity cooling of a mechanical mode in the presence of a TLS defect using the adiabatic elimination technique. Our result shows that the cooling process depends strongly on the resonance and the damping rate of the TLS.

In the current work we examine the behaviour of the BZ mechanism with respect to different boundary conditions, revealing the mechanism robustness upon variation of these conditions. Consequently, this work closes a gap in our understanding of this important scenario.

This formula results from a formal first order perturbation calculation without rigorous justification. A rigorous derivation of Fourier's law for heat conduction from the laws of mechanics remains thus a major unsolved problem. In this note we present a deterministic mechanical model of a heat-conducting chain with nontrivial interactions, where kinetic energy fluctuations at the nodes of the chain are removed. In this model the derivation of Fourier's law can proceed rigorously.

Hentschel|Valery Ilyin|Itamar Procaccia	  We extend our statistical mechanical theory of the glass transition from examples consisting of point particles to molecular liquids with internal degrees of freedom. As before, the fundamental assertion is that super-cooled liquids are ergodic, although becoming very viscous at lower temperatures, and are therefore describable in principle by statistical mechanics. The theory is based on analyzing the local neighborhoods of each molecule, and a statistical mechanical weight is assigned to every possible local organization. This results in an approximate theory that is in very good agreement with simulations regarding both thermodynamical and dynamical properties. 	
1105.2177v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1105.2177v1	2011	Energy loss mechanism for suspended micro- and nanoresonators due to the   Casimir force	André Gusso	  A so far not considered energy loss mechanism in suspended micro- and nanoresonators due to noncontact acoustical energy loss is investigated theoretically. The mechanism consists on the conversion of the mechanical energy from the vibratory motion of the resonator into acoustic waves on large nearby structures, such as the substrate, due to the coupling between the resonator and those structures resulting from the Casimir force acting over the separation gaps. Analytical expressions for the resulting quality factor Q for cantilever and bridge micro- and nanoresonators in close proximity to an underlying substrate are derived and the relevance of the mechanism is investigated, demonstrating its importance when nanometric gaps are involved. 	
1202.3807v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1202.3807v1	2012	An Adaptive Mechanism for Accurate Query Answering under Differential   Privacy	Chao Li|Gerome Miklau	  We propose a novel mechanism for answering sets of count- ing queries under differential privacy. Given a workload of counting queries, the mechanism automatically selects a different set of "strategy" queries to answer privately, using those answers to derive answers to the workload. The main algorithm proposed in this paper approximates the optimal strategy for any workload of linear counting queries. With no cost to the privacy guarantee, the mechanism improves significantly on prior approaches and achieves near-optimal error for many workloads, when applied under (\epsilon, \delta)-differential privacy. The result is an adaptive mechanism which can help users achieve good utility without requiring that they reason carefully about the best formulation of their task.

A general formula for the efficiency of such an engine with an arbitrary confining potential is presented. Its expression is purely given in terms of the structure of the energy spectrum. Dependency of the efficiency on the form of a potential as an analog of the working material in thermodynamics implies nonuniversality of the engine. This may be due to the absence of the second-law-like principle in pure-state quantum mechanics.

First, the theory is developed in the formalism of phase space quantum mechanics. It is shown that by transforming a star-product, when passing to a new coordinate system, observables and states transform as in classical mechanics, i.e., by composing them with a transformation of coordinates. Then the developed formalism of coordinate transformations is transferred to a standard formulation of quantum mechanics. In addition, the developed theory is illustrated on examples of particular classes of quantum canonical transformations.

Joshi|Manoj Misra	  The significance of the DDoS problem and the increased occurrence, sophistication and strength of attacks has led to the dawn of numerous prevention mechanisms. Each proposed prevention mechanism has some unique advantages and disadvantages over the others. In this paper, we present a classification of available mechanisms that are proposed in literature on preventing Internet services from possible DDoS attacks and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each mechanism. This provides better understanding of the problem and enables a security administrator to effectively equip his arsenal with proper prevention mechanisms for fighting against DDoS threat.

Sulis	  The measurement problem and the role of observers have plagued quantum mechanics since its conception. Attempts to resolve these have introduced anthropomorphic or non-realist notions into physics. A shift of perspective based upon process theory and utilizing methods from combinatorial games, interpolation theory and complex systems theory results in a novel realist version of quantum mechanics incorporating quasi-local, nondeterministic hidden variables that are compatible with the no-hidden variable theorems and relativistic invariance, and reproduce the standard results of quantum mechanics to a high degree of accuracy without invoking observers.

Sometimes these mechanisms need to obey the properties of probabilistic reasoning. A purely numeric mechanism, like those proposed so far, cannot provide a probabilistic logic with truth functional connectives. We propose an alternative mechanism, Incidence Calculus, which is based on a representation of uncertainty using sets of points, which might represent situations, models or possible worlds. Incidence Calculus does provide a probabilistic logic with truth functional connectives.

Liu	  Models that invoke nonlinear wavefront propagation in a chemically excitable medium are rife in the biological literature. Indeed, the idea that wavefront propagation can serve as a signaling mechanism has often been invoked to explain synchronization of developmental processes. In this paper we suggest a new kind of signaling based not on diffusion of a chemical species but on the propagation of mechanical stress. We construct a theoretical approach to describe mechanical signaling as a nonlinear wavefront propagation problem and study its dependence on key variables such as the effective elasticity and damping of the medium.

Bhattacharya	  Typical optomechanical systems involving optical cavities and mechanical oscillators rely on a coupling that varies linearly with the oscillator displacement. However, recently a coupling varying instead as the square of the mechanical displacement has been realized, presenting new possibilities for non-demolition measurements and mechanical squeezing. In this article we present a quantum mechanical study of a generic quadratic-coupling optomechanical Hamiltonian. First, neglecting dissipation, we provide analytical results for the dressed states, spectrum, phonon statistics and entanglement. Subsequently, accounting for dissipation, we supply a numerical treatment using a master equation approach. We expect our results to be of use to optomechanical spectroscopy, state transfer, wavefunction engineering, and entanglement generation.

A MEMS resonator shows two coexisting stable states when nonlinear responses appear. Previous studies addressed that a micro- or nano-electrical-mechanical resonator can be utilized as a mechanical 1-bit memory or mechanical logic gates. The next phase is the development of logic system with coupled multi-resonators. From the viewpoint of application of nonlinear dynamics in coupled MEMS resonators, we show the first experimental success of the controlling nonlinear behavior as a 2-bit binary counter.

Meystre	  We investigate a hybrid electro-mechanical system consisting of a pair of charged macroscopic mechanical oscillators coupled to a small ensemble of Rydberg atoms. The resonant dipole-dipole coupling between an internal atomic Rydberg transition and the mechanics allows cooling to its motional ground state with a single atom despite the considerable mass imbalance between the two subsystems. We show that the rich electronic spectrum of Rydberg atoms, combined with their high degree of optical control, paves the way towards implementing various quantum-control protocol for the mechanical oscillators.

A third realization of this formalism is the so-called hyperbolic quantum mechanics where split-complex numbers replace the usual complex numbers. We introduce and explore the corresponding generalization of C*-algebras and prove that hyperbolic quantum mechanics is not a viable candidate for describing Nature. Quantum and classical mechanics are the only acceptable theories of Nature which are invariant under tensorial composition.

Here we show that strong mechanical squeezing in the steady state can be generated in an optomechanical system with mechanical nonlinearity and red-detuned monochromatic driving on the cavity mode. The squeezing is achieved as the joint effect of nonlinearity-induced parametric amplification and cavity cooling, and is robust against thermal fluctuations of the mechanical mode.

In this model, the Vickrey mechanism is no longer dominant-strategy, and we prove that all dominant-strategy mechanisms are inadequate. However, we also prove that, in undominated strategies, the social welfare produced by the Vickrey mechanism in the worst case is not only very good, but also essentially optimal.

The scheme is applied to published ab initio defect formation energies, and the variety of resulting phenomena is demonstrated. Further, by introducing model assumptions the consequences for the active diffusion mechanisms are deduced. It is shown that particularly for the off-stoichiometric case, the assumed prevalence of either the six-jump cycle or the triple-defect mechanism has to be reconsidered, as a number of qualitatively different mechanisms emerge as likely candidates for the dominant effect. Two of those, the 4+2-jump cycles and the waltzing-step mechanism, are introduced here.

Contrary to most of the techniques presented before, the embedding matrix of our mechanism is highly structured. That enables us to perform hashing more efficiently and use less memory. What is crucial and nonintuitive is the fact that imposing structured mechanism does not affect the quality of the produced hash. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to give strong theoretical guarantees of the proposed binary hashing method by proving the efficiency of the mechanism for several classes of structured projection matrices. As a corollary, we obtain binary hashing mechanisms with strong concentration results for circulant and Topelitz matrices. Our approach is however much more general.

We give bounds on how well different random assignment mechanisms approximate the optimal egalitarian value and investigate the effect that different well-known properties like ordinality, envy-freeness, and truthfulness have on the achievable egalitarian value. Finally, we conduct detailed experiments analyzing the tradeoffs between efficiency with envy-freeness or truthfulness using two prominent random assignment mechanisms --- random serial dictatorship and the probabilistic serial mechanism --- for different classes of utility functions and distributions.

Here we give a theoretical study of a hybrid atom-optomechanical system in which the steady-state squeezing of the mechanical resonator can be generated via the mechanical nonlinearity and cavity cooling process. The validity of the scheme is assessed by simulating the steady-state variance of the mechanical displacement quadrature numerically. The scheme is robust against dissipation of the optical cavity, and the steady-state squeezing can be effectively generated in a highly dissipative cavity.

This derivation appears to be possible by selecting a suitable physical process in which the transformation of the equation of motion into a quantum mechanical wave equation can be obtained by Einstein's geodesic approach. The selected process is the pi-meson, modeled as the one-body equivalent of a two-body quantum mechanical oscillator in which the vibrating mass is modeled as the result of the two energy fluxes from the quark and the antiquark. The quantum mechanical formula for the Gravitational Constant appears to show a quantitatively verifiable relationship with the Higgs boson as conceived in the Standard Model.

This problem was proposed and studied in the seminal paper (Nisan and Ronen 1999), where they gave a 1.75-approximation randomized truthful mechanism for the case of two machines. We improve this result by a 1.6737-approximation randomized truthful mechanism. We also generalize our result to a $0.8368m$-approximation mechanism for task scheduling with $m$ machines, which improve the previous best upper bound of $0.875m(Mu'alem and Schapira 2007).

Blanter	  We investigate strong mechanical feedback for the single-electron tunneling device coupled to an underdamped harmonic oscillator in the high-frequency case, when the mechanical energy of the oscillator exceeds the tunnel rate, and for weak coupling. In the strong feedback regime, the mechanical oscillations oscillated by the telegraph signal from the SET in their turn modify the electric current.

They come with distinct mechanical clamps: shear-based, involving a cystine slipknot, and due to dragging of a cystine plug through a cystine ring. The latter two mechanisms are topological in nature and the cystine plug mechanism has not yet been discussed but it turns out to provide the largest resistance to stretching. Its possible applications in elastomers are discussed.

An emergent space-time M and continuous wave function arise through a non-uniform interpolation process. Standard non-relativistic quantum mechanics emerges under the limit of infinite information (the causal space grows to infinity) and infinitesimal scale (the separation between points goes to zero). The model has the potential to address several paradoxes in quantum mechanics while remaining computationally powerful.

These functionalities arise from a broken rotational symmetry which causes highly nonlinear coupling of deformations along the two primary axes of these metamaterials. We introduce a soft mechanism model which captures the programmable mechanics, and outline a general design strategy for confined mechanical metamaterials. Finally, we show how inhomogeneous confinement can be explored to create multi stability and giant hysteresis.

Glinsky	  A classification technique for identifying focal mechanism type and fault plane orientation based on the polarity of P-wave "first motion" data is derived. A support vector machine is used to classify the polarity data in the space of spherical harmonic functions. The classification is non-parametric in the sense that there is no requirement to make a priori assumptions source mechanism. A metric of similarity potentially able to distinguish shear versus tensile dislocation without requiring estimation of the fault plane orientation is a natural consequence of this procedure. Going further, correlation functions between template source mechanism is derived, gives an estimate of fault plane orientation assuming a particular source mechanism.

A learning machine is a system that realizes mechanical learning. Importantly, we emphasis that it is based on a set of simple and fixed rules, contrasting to often called machine learning that is sophisticated software based on very complicated mathematical theory, and often needs human intervene for software fine tune and manual adjustments. Here, we discuss some basic facts and principles of such system, and try to lay down a framework for further study. We propose 2 directions to approach mechanical learning, just like Church-Turing pair: one is trying to realize a learning machine, another is trying to well describe the mechanical learning.

Our basic quantity is Aharonov's weak value, from which the QP can be defined up to a certain ambiguity parameterized by a complex number. Unlike the conventional probability, the QP allows us to treat two noncommuting observables consistently, and this is utilized to embed the QP in Bohmian mechanics such that its equivalence to quantum mechanics becomes more transparent. We also show that, with the help of the QP, Bohmian mechanics can be recognized as an ontological model with a certain type of contextuality.

The effect of the light field on the mechanical system is modeled as a modulation of the spring constants of the individual oscillators. Using this fully classical model, we derive the Bloch equations for a two-level system and discuss the mechanical analogues of Rabi oscillations and coherent control experiments

Rakhubovsky|Radim Filip	  Feasible setup for pulsed quantum non-demolition interaction between two distant mechanical oscillators through optical or microwave mediator is proposed. The proposal uses homodyne measurement of the mediator and feedforward control of the mechanical oscillators to reach the interaction. To verify quantum nature of the interaction, we investigate the Gaussian entanglement generated in the mechanical modes. We evaluate it under influence of mechanical bath and propagation loss for the mediator and propose ways to optimize the interaction. Finally, both currently available optomechanical and electromechanical platforms are numerically analyzed. The analysis shows that implementation is already feasible with current technology.

Milman	  Mechanical resonators represent one of the most promising candidates to mediate the interaction between different quantum technologies, bridging the gap between efficient quantum computation and long-distance quantum communication. In this letter, we introduce a novel interferometric scheme where the interaction of a mechanical resonator with input/output quantum pulses is controlled by an independent classical drive. We design protocols for state teleportation and direct quantum state transfer, between distant mechanical resonators. The proposed device, feasible with state-of-the-art technology, can serve as building block for the implementation of long-distance quantum networks of mechanical resonators.

In addition to allowing us to restrict to deterministic mechanisms, we can also indirectly model non-additive valuations. We prove a strong duality result, extending a result due to Daskalakis et al. [2015], that guarantees the existence of a certificate of optimality for optimal restricted mechanisms. As a corollary of our result, we provide a new characterization of the set of allocations that the optimal mechanism may actually use. To illustrate our result we find and certify optimal mechanisms for four settings where previous frameworks do not apply, and provide new economic intuition about some of the tools that have previously been used to find optimal mechanisms. 	
1608.00998v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.00998v1	2016	Cooling mechanical oscillators by coherent control	Martin Frimmer|Jan Gieseler|Lukas Novotny	  In optomechanics, electromagnetic fields are harnessed to control a single mode of a mechanically compliant system, while other mechanical degrees of freedom remain unaffected due to the modes' mutual orthogonality and high quality factor. Extension of the optical control beyond the directly addressed mode would require a controlled coupling between mechanical modes. Here, we introduce an optically controlled coupling between two oscillation modes of an optically levitated nanoparticle. We sympathetically cool one oscillation mode by coupling it coherently to the second mode, which is feedback cooled. Furthermore, we demonstrate coherent energy transfer between mechanical modes and discuss its application for ground-state cooling.

We try to introduce a general framework which covers the most significant algorithms in mechanism design that use the relaxation and rounding technique. We believe that this framework is not only a generalization of the existing algorithms but also can be leveraged for further results in algorithmic mechanism design. Before presenting the framework, we briefly define algorithmic mechanism design, its connections to game theory and computer science, and the challenges in the field.

However, in an antiferromagnet with vanishing magnetization, new fundamental rules are required to properly describe spin-mechanical phenomena. Here we show that the N\'eel order dynamics affects the mechanical motion of a rigid body by modifying its inertia tensor in the presence of strong magnetocrystalline anisotropy. This effect depends on temperature when magnon excitations are considered. Such a spin-mechanical inertia can produce measurable consequences at small scales.

Amongst quantum mechanical systems, only systems with at most quadratic potentials allow for a trajectory-based description of their phase space dynamics. We show that anharmonic quantum mechanical systems' generation of quantum-mechanical coherences is responsible for the occurrence of singularities in their phase space velocity fields. This implies that anharmonic quantum systems cannot feature trajectories. For their quantum phase space dynamics the Lagrangian approach of moving-with-the-flow along trajectories yields misleading results. This invalidates some trajectory-based approaches to quantum phase space studies.

Numerical simulation	Vladislav Polnikov	  The issue of the equilibrium-range formation in the wind-wave spectrum is studied by a direct numerical simulation. The evolution equation of wind-wave spectrum is numerically solved with using an exact calculation of the Hasselmann kinetic integral and involving various modifications of known parametrizations for the wave-pumping mechanism due to wind and the wave-dissipation mechanism due viscosity of the upper layer. It is shown that the balance of the last two mechanisms is responsible for a formation of stationary part of the wind-wave spectrum. This balance allows establishing any prescribed form of the equilibrium part of the spectrum, if the proper representations of input and dissipation mechanisms are chosen.

Vahid|Uyguroğlu Mustafa	  In this paper, the kinematic structure of the geared robotic mechanism (GRM) is investigated with the aid of two different methods which are based on directed graphs and the methods are compared. One of the methods is Matroid Method developed by Talpasanu and the other method is Tsai-Tokad (T-T) Graph method developed by Uyguroglu and Demirel. It is shown that the kinematic structure of the geared robotic mechanism can be represented by directed graphs and angular velocity equations of the mechanisms can be systematically obtained from the graphs. The advantages and disadvantages of both methods are demonstrated relative to each other.

Massel	  We propose here a setup to generate and evaluate the entanglement between two mechanical resonators in a cavity optomechanical setting. As in previous proposals, our scheme includes two driving pumps allowing for the generation of two-mode mechanical squeezing. In addition, we include here four additional probing tones, which allow for the separate evaluation of the collective mechanical quadratures required to estimate the Duan quantity, thus allowing us to infer whether the mechanical resonators are entangled.

Butler	  Understanding the bending mechanics of uncured carbon fibre prepreg is vital for modelling forming processes and the formation of out-of-plane wrinkling defects. This paper presents a modification of standard Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) to characterise the viscoelastic bending mechanics of uncured carbon fibre prepreg using Timoshenko beam theory. By post-processing DMA results, the analysis provides temperature and rate-dependent values of inter and intra-ply shear stiffness for a carbon fibre laminate and each individual ply with experimental results for AS4/8552 presented. The new methodology provides a means to parametrise process models, and also gives an indication of optimal manufacturing conditions to enable defect-free forming and consolidation processes.

McAfee's mechanism handles single-parametric agents, allowing each seller to sell a single unit and each buyer to buy a single unit. This paper presents a double-auction mechanism that handles multi-parametric agents and allows multiple units per trader, as long as the valuation functions of all traders have decreasing marginal returns. The mechanism is prior-free, ex-post individually-rational, dominant-strategy truthful and strongly-budget-balanced. Its gain-from-trade approaches the optimum when the market size is sufficiently large.

In the scheme, possible double counting from these mechanisms and the `light mechanisms' (the gluon-gluon fusion and quark-antiquark annihilation mechanisms) is subtracted properly. The numerical results show that the transverse momentum, $p_t$, distribution of the produced $B_c(B_c^*)$ from the `intrinsic heavy quark mechanisms' (i.e. the heavy quark mechanisms in which the double counting components have been subtracted accordingly) declines faster with the increment of the $p_t$ than that from the `light mechanisms', and only in small $p_t$ region ($p_t\lesssim 7.0$ GeV) the `intrinsic heavy quark mechanisms' themselves may make remarkable contributions. The combined contributions from the `intrinsic heavy quark mechanisms' and the `light mechanisms' to the production are compared with that obtained by the most calculations in literature, which in some sense are within the fixed flavor number (FFN) scheme at leading order, and we find that the production by virtue of the GM-VFN scheme is more or less the same as the one in literature, except in the small $p_t$ region. 	
0311153v3	http://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0311153v3	2007	Uncertainty and information in classical mechanics formulation. Common   ground for thermodynamics and quantum mechanics	Adrian Faigon	  Mechanics can be founded on a principle relating the uncertainty delta-q in the trajectory of an observable particle to its motion relative to the observer. From this principle, p.delta-q=const., p being the q-conjugated momentum, mechanical laws are derived and the meaning of the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian functions are discussed. The connection between the presented principle and Hamilton's Least Action Principle is examined.   Wave mechanics and Schrodinger equation appear without additional assumptions by choosing the representation for delta-q in the case the motion is not trajectory describable. The Cramer-Rao inequality serves that purpose. For a particle hidden from direct observation, the position uncertainty determined by the enclosing boundaries leads to thermodynamics in a straightforward extension of the presented formalism.   The introduction of uncertainty in classical mechanics formulation enables the translation of mechanical laws into the wide ranging conceptual framework of information theory. The boundaries between classical mechanics, thermodynamics and quantum mechanics are defined in terms of informational changes associated with the system evolution. As a direct application of the proposed formulation upper bounds for the rate of information transfer are derived.

Kippenberg	  The observation of quantum phenomena in macroscopic mechanical oscillators has been a subject of interest since the inception of quantum mechanics. Prerequisite to this regime are both preparation of the mechanical oscillator at low phonon occupancy and a measurement sensitivity at the scale of the spread of the oscillator's ground state wavefunction. It has been widely perceived that the most promising approach to address these two challenges are electro nanomechanical systems. Here we approach for the first time the quantum regime with a mechanical oscillator of mesoscopic dimensions--discernible to the bare eye--and 1000-times more massive than the heaviest nano-mechanical oscillators used to date. Imperative to these advances are two key principles of cavity optomechanics: Optical interferometric measurement of mechanical displacement at the attometer level, and the ability to use measurement induced dynamic back-action to achieve resolved sideband laser cooling of the mechanical degree of freedom. Using only modest cryogenic pre-cooling to 1.65 K, preparation of a mechanical oscillator close to its quantum ground state (63+-20 phonons) is demonstrated. Simultaneously, a readout sensitivity that is within a factor of 5.5+-1.5 of the standard quantum limit is achieved. The reported experiments mark a paradigm shift in the approach to the quantum limit of mechanical oscillators using optical techniques and represent a first step into a new era of experimental investigation which probes the quantum nature of the most tangible harmonic oscillator: a mechanical vibration. 	
0905.3429v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/0905.3429v1	2009	Auctions with Online Supply	Moshe Babaioff|Liad Blumrosen|Aaron L. Roth	  We study the problem of selling identical goods to n unit-demand bidders in a setting in which the total supply of goods is unknown to the mechanism. Items arrive dynamically, and the seller must make the allocation and payment decisions online with the goal of maximizing social welfare. We consider two models of unknown supply: the adversarial supply model, in which the mechanism must produce a welfare guarantee for any arbitrary supply, and the stochastic supply model, in which supply is drawn from a distribution known to the mechanism, and the mechanism need only provide a welfare guarantee in expectation.   Our main result is a separation between these two models. We show that all truthful mechanisms, even randomized, achieve a diminishing fraction of the optimal social welfare (namely, no better than a Omega(loglog n) approximation) in the adversarial setting. In sharp contrast, in the stochastic model, under a standard monotone hazard-rate condition, we present a truthful mechanism that achieves a constant approximation. We show that the monotone hazard rate condition is necessary, and also characterize a natural subclass of truthful mechanisms in our setting, the set of online-envy-free mechanisms. All of the mechanisms we present fall into this class, and we prove almost optimal lower bounds for such mechanisms. Since auctions with unknown supply are regularly run in many online-advertising settings, our main results emphasize the importance of considering distributional information in the design of auctions in such environments. 	
1104.2872v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1104.2872v1	2011	Mechanism Design without Money via Stable Matching	Ning Chen|Nick Gravin|Pinyan Lu	  Mechanism design without money has a rich history in social choice literature. Due to the strong impossibility theorem by Gibbard and Satterthwaite, exploring domains in which there exist dominant strategy mechanisms is one of the central questions in the field. We propose a general framework, called the generalized packing problem (\gpp), to study the mechanism design questions without payment. The \gpp\ possesses a rich structure and comprises a number of well-studied models as special cases, including, e.g., matroid, matching, knapsack, independent set, and the generalized assignment problem.   We adopt the agenda of approximate mechanism design where the objective is to design a truthful (or strategyproof) mechanism without money that can be implemented in polynomial time and yields a good approximation to the socially optimal solution. We study several special cases of \gpp, and give constant approximation mechanisms for matroid, matching, knapsack, and the generalized assignment problem. Our result for generalized assignment problem solves an open problem proposed in \cite{DG10}.   Our main technical contribution is in exploitation of the approaches from stable matching, which is a fundamental solution concept in the context of matching marketplaces, in application to mechanism design. Stable matching, while conceptually simple, provides a set of powerful tools to manage and analyze self-interested behaviors of participating agents. Our mechanism uses a stable matching algorithm as a critical component and adopts other approaches like random sampling and online mechanisms. Our work also enriches the stable matching theory with a new knapsack constrained matching model.

Nazarov	  We study theoretically dynamics in a Josephson junction coupled to a mechanical resonator looking at the signatures of the resonance in d.c. electrical response of the junction. Such a system can be realized experimentally as a suspended ultra-clean carbon nanotube brought in contact with two superconducting leads. A nearby gate electrode can be used to tune the junction parameters and to excite mechanical motion. We augment theoretical estimations with the values of setup parameters measured in the samples fabricated.   We show that charging effects in the junction give rise to a mechanical force that depends on the superconducting phase difference. The force can excite the resonant mode provided the superconducting current in the junction has oscillating components with a frequency matching the resonant frequency of the mechanical resonator. We develop a model that encompasses the coupling of electrical and mechanical dynamics. We compute the mechanical response (the effect of mechanical motion) in the regime of phase bias and d.c. voltage bias. We thoroughly investigate the regime of combined a.c. and d.c. bias where Shapiro steps are developed and reveal several distinct regimes characteristic for this effect. Our results can be immediately applied in the context of experimental detection of the mechanical motion in realistic superconducting nano-mechanical devices. 	
1112.5905v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1112.5905v1	2011	Mechanical Stress Inference for Two Dimensional Cell Arrays	Kevin K. Chiou|Lars Hufnagel|Boris I. Shraiman	  Many morphogenetic processes involve mechanical rearrangement of epithelial tissues that is driven by precisely regulated cytoskeletal forces and cell adhesion. The mechanical state of the cell and intercellular adhesion are not only the targets of regulation, but are themselves likely signals that coordinate developmental process. Yet, because it is difficult to directly measure mechanical stress {\it in vivo} on sub-cellular scale, little is understood about the role of mechanics of development. Here we present an alternative approach which takes advantage of the recent progress in live imaging of morphogenetic processes and uses computational analysis of high resolution images of epithelial tissues to infer relative magnitude of forces acting within and between cells. We model intracellular stress in terms of bulk pressure and interfacial tension, allowing these parameters to vary from cell to cell and from interface to interface. Assuming that epithelial cell layers are close to mechanical equilibrium, we use the observed geometry of the two dimensional cell array to infer interfacial tensions and intracellular pressures. Here we present the mathematical formulation of the proposed Mechanical Inverse method and apply it to the analysis of epithelial cell layers observed at the onset of ventral furrow formation in the {\it Drosophila} embryo and in the process of hair-cell determination in the avian cochlea. The analysis reveals mechanical anisotropy in the former process and mechanical heterogeneity, correlated with cell differentiation, in the latter process. The method opens a way for quantitative and detailed experimental tests of models of cell and tissue mechanics. 	
1203.4455v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.4455v1	2012	Budget Feasible Mechanism Design: From Prior-Free to Bayesian	Xiaohui Bei|Ning Chen|Nick Gravin|Pinyan Lu	  Budget feasible mechanism design studies procurement combinatorial auctions where the sellers have private costs to produce items, and the buyer(auctioneer) aims to maximize a social valuation function on subsets of items, under the budget constraint on the total payment. One of the most important questions in the field is "which valuation domains admit truthful budget feasible mechanisms with `small' approximations (compared to the social optimum)?" Singer showed that additive and submodular functions have such constant approximations. Recently, Dobzinski, Papadimitriou, and Singer gave an O(log^2 n)-approximation mechanism for subadditive functions; they also remarked that: "A fundamental question is whether, regardless of computational constraints, a constant-factor budget feasible mechanism exists for subadditive functions."   We address this question from two viewpoints: prior-free worst case analysis and Bayesian analysis. For the prior-free framework, we use an LP that describes the fractional cover of the valuation function; it is also connected to the concept of approximate core in cooperative game theory. We provide an O(I)-approximation mechanism for subadditive functions, via the worst case integrality gap I of LP. This implies an O(log n)-approximation for subadditive valuations, O(1)-approximation for XOS valuations, and for valuations with a constant I. XOS valuations are an important class of functions that lie between submodular and subadditive classes. We give another polynomial time O(log n/loglog n) sub-logarithmic approximation mechanism for subadditive valuations.   For the Bayesian framework, we provide a constant approximation mechanism for all subadditive functions, using the above prior-free mechanism for XOS valuations as a subroutine. Our mechanism allows correlations in the distribution of private information and is universally truthful. 	
1207.0935v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.0935v1	2012	On the Power of Deterministic Mechanisms for Facility Location Games	Dimitris Fotakis|Christos Tzamos	  We consider K-Facility Location games, where n strategic agents report their locations in a metric space, and a mechanism maps them to K facilities. Our main result is an elegant characterization of deterministic strategyproof mechanisms with a bounded approximation ratio for 2-Facility Location on the line. In particular, we show that for instances with n \geq 5 agents, any such mechanism either admits a unique dictator, or always places the facilities at the leftmost and the rightmost location of the instance. As a corollary, we obtain that the best approximation ratio achievable by deterministic strategyproof mechanisms for the problem of locating 2 facilities on the line to minimize the total connection cost is precisely n-2. Another rather surprising consequence is that the Two-Extremes mechanism of (Procaccia and Tennenholtz, EC 2009) is the only deterministic anonymous strategyproof mechanism with a bounded approximation ratio for 2-Facility Location on the line.   The proof of the characterization employs several new ideas and technical tools, which provide new insights into the behavior of deterministic strategyproof mechanisms for K-Facility Location games, and may be of independent interest. Employing one of these tools, we show that for every K \geq 3, there do not exist any deterministic anonymous strategyproof mechanisms with a bounded approximation ratio for K-Facility Location on the line, even for simple instances with K+1 agents. Moreover, building on the characterization for the line, we show that there do not exist any deterministic strategyproof mechanisms with a bounded approximation ratio for 2-Facility Location on more general metric spaces, which is true even for simple instances with 3 agents located in a star. 	
1304.7432v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.7432v2	2013	Sybil-proof Mechanisms in Query Incentive Networks	Wei Chen|Yajun Wang|Dongxiao Yu|Li Zhang	  In this paper, we study incentive mechanisms for retrieving information from networked agents. Following the model in [Kleinberg and Raghavan 2005], the agents are represented as nodes in an infinite tree, which is generated by a random branching process. A query is issued by the root, and each node possesses an answer with an independent probability $p=1/n$. Further, each node in the tree acts strategically to maximize its own payoff. In order to encourage the agents to participate in the information acquisition process, an incentive mechanism is needed to reward agents who provide the information as well as agents who help to facilitate such acquisition.   We focus on designing efficient sybil-proof incentive mechanisms, i.e., which are robust to fake identity attacks. %We consider incentive mechanisms which are sybil-proof, i.e., robust to fake identity attacks. We propose a family of mechanisms, called the direct referral (DR) mechanisms, which allocate most reward to the information holder as well as its direct parent (or direct referral). We show that, when designed properly, the direct referral mechanism is sybil-proof and efficient. In particular, we show that we may achieve an expected cost of $O(h^2)$ for propagating the query down $h$ levels for any branching factor $b>1$. This result exponentially improves on previous work when requiring to find an answer with high probability. When the underlying network is a deterministic chain, our mechanism is optimal under some mild assumptions. In addition, due to its simple reward structure, the DR mechanism might have good chance to be adopted in practice. 	
1307.1766v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1307.1766v2	2014	Truthful approximations to range voting	Aris Filos-Ratsikas|Peter Bro Miltersen	  We consider the fundamental mechanism design problem of approximate social welfare maximization under general cardinal preferences on a finite number of alternatives and without money. The well-known range voting scheme can be thought of as a non-truthful mechanism for exact social welfare maximization in this setting. With m being the number of alternatives, we exhibit a randomized truthful-in-expectation ordinal mechanism implementing an outcome whose expected social welfare is at least an Omega(m^{-3/4}) fraction of the social welfare of the socially optimal alternative. On the other hand, we show that for sufficiently many agents and any truthful-in-expectation ordinal mechanism, there is a valuation profile where the mechanism achieves at most an O(m^{-{2/3}) fraction of the optimal social welfare in expectation. We get tighter bounds for the natural special case of m = 3, and in that case furthermore obtain separation results concerning the approximation ratios achievable by natural restricted classes of truthful-in-expectation mechanisms. In particular, we show that for m = 3 and a sufficiently large number of agents, the best mechanism that is ordinal as well as mixed-unilateral has an approximation ratio between 0.610 and 0.611, the best ordinal mechanism has an approximation ratio between 0.616 and 0.641, while the best mixed-unilateral mechanism has an approximation ratio bigger than 0.660. In particular, the best mixed-unilateral non-ordinal (i.e., cardinal) mechanism strictly outperforms all ordinal ones, even the non-mixed-unilateral ordinal ones. 	
1405.3745v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.3745v1	2014	Mechanism reduction for multicomponent surrogates: a case study using   toluene reference fuels	Kyle E Niemeyer|Chih-Jen Sung	  Strategies and recommendations for performing skeletal reductions of multicomponent surrogate fuels are presented, through the generation and validation of skeletal mechanisms for a three-component toluene reference fuel. Using the directed relation graph with error propagation and sensitivity analysis method followed by a further unimportant reaction elimination stage, skeletal mechanisms valid over comprehensive and high-temperature ranges of conditions were developed at varying levels of detail. These skeletal mechanisms were generated based on autoignition simulations, and validation using ignition delay predictions showed good agreement with the detailed mechanism in the target range of conditions. When validated using phenomena other than autoignition, such as perfectly stirred reactor and laminar flame propagation, tight error control or more restrictions on the reduction during the sensitivity analysis stage were needed to ensure good agreement. In addition, tight error limits were needed for close prediction of ignition delay when varying the mixture composition away from that used for the reduction. In homogeneous compression-ignition engine simulations, the skeletal mechanisms closely matched the point of ignition and accurately predicted species profiles for lean to stoichiometric conditions. Furthermore, the efficacy of generating a multicomponent skeletal mechanism was compared to combining skeletal mechanisms produced separately for neat fuel components; using the same error limits, the latter resulted in a larger skeletal mechanism size that also lacked important cross reactions between fuel components. Based on the present results, general guidelines for reducing detailed mechanisms for multicomponent fuels are discussed. 	
1502.04052v5	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.04052v5	2016	Computer-aided verification in mechanism design	Gilles Barthe|Marco Gaboardi|Emilio Jesús Gallego Arias|Justin Hsu|Aaron Roth|Pierre-Yves Strub	  In mechanism design, the gold standard solution concepts are dominant strategy incentive compatibility and Bayesian incentive compatibility. These solution concepts relieve the (possibly unsophisticated) bidders from the need to engage in complicated strategizing. While incentive properties are simple to state, their proofs are specific to the mechanism and can be quite complex. This raises two concerns. From a practical perspective, checking a complex proof can be a tedious process, often requiring experts knowledgeable in mechanism design. Furthermore, from a modeling perspective, if unsophisticated agents are unconvinced of incentive properties, they may strategize in unpredictable ways.   To address both concerns, we explore techniques from computer-aided verification to construct formal proofs of incentive properties. Because formal proofs can be automatically checked, agents do not need to manually check the properties, or even understand the proof. To demonstrate, we present the verification of a sophisticated mechanism: the generic reduction from Bayesian incentive compatible mechanism design to algorithm design given by Hartline, Kleinberg, and Malekian. This mechanism presents new challenges for formal verification, including essential use of randomness from both the execution of the mechanism and from the prior type distributions. As an immediate consequence, our work also formalizes Bayesian incentive compatibility for the entire family of mechanisms derived via this reduction. Finally, as an intermediate step in our formalization, we provide the first formal verification of incentive compatibility for the celebrated Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism.

A central component of online advertising is the underlying mechanism that selects and prices the winning ads for a given ad slot. In this paper we study designing a mechanism for the Combinatorial Auction with Identical Items (CAII) in which we are interested in selling $k$ identical items to a group of bidders each demanding a certain number of items between $1$ and $k$. CAII generalizes important online advertising scenarios such as image-text and video-pod auctions [GK14]. In image-text auction we want to fill an advertising slot on a publisher's web page with either $k$ text-ads or a single image-ad and in video-pod auction we want to fill an advertising break of $k$ seconds with video-ads of possibly different durations.   Our goal is to design truthful mechanisms that satisfy Revenue Monotonicity (RM). RM is a natural constraint which states that the revenue of a mechanism should not decrease if the number of participants increases or if a participant increases her bid.   [GK14] showed that no deterministic RM mechanism can attain PoRM of less than $\ln(k)$ for CAII, i.e., no deterministic mechanism can attain more than $\frac{1}{\ln(k)}$ fraction of the maximum social welfare. [GK14] also design a mechanism with PoRM of $O(\ln^2(k))$ for CAII.   In this paper, we seek to overcome the impossibility result of [GK14] for deterministic mechanisms by using the power of randomization. We show that by using randomization, one can attain a constant PoRM. In particular, we design a randomized RM mechanism with PoRM of $3$ for CAII.

However, the role of mechanical approaches in tumor therapy is largely neglected, while the currently available cancer prevention and treatment methods are generally either expensive or just cause too much side effect. In this article, we present a systematic interpretation on a promising strategy which was termed here as Mechanical Therapy for the first time based on the fact that mechanical force closely accompanies the whole life (growth and death) of a cell, and plays a crucial role in biological functions. In order to mold the mechanical force as a practical tool for cancer therapy, we expound the effects of the mechanical force related to the tumors from molecule to tissue level and evaluate its feasibility for treatment purpose. It can be conceived that given enough investigations, the mechanical therapy may generate big potential to open new windows for cancer prevention, relieving or even destroying if well administrated. As an easy going and convenient method, a systematic and thorough study of mechanical therapy may clarify more options for future clinical practices. Besides, when patients encounter various forces in daily life, they can at least identify the good or bad forces for a better and healthy life style based on the mechanisms thus disclosed.

Narahari	  Civic Crowdfunding is emerging as a popular means to mobilize funding from citizens for public projects. A popular mechanism deployed on civic crowdfunding platforms is a provision point mechanism, wherein, the total contributions must reach a predetermined threshold in order for the project to be provisioned (undertaken). Such a mechanism may have multiple equilibria; unfortunately, in many of these equilibria, the project is not funded even if it is highly valued among the agents. Recent work has proposed mechanisms with refund bonuses where the project gets funded in equilibrium if its net value is higher than a threshold among the agents who are aware of the crowdfunding effort. In this paper, we formalize the notion of social desirability of a public project and propose mechanisms which use the idea of referrals to expand the pool of participants and achieve an equilibrium in which the project gets funded if its net value exceeds a threshold among the entire agent population. We call this new class of mechanisms Referral-Embedded Provision Point Mechanisms (REPPM). We specifically propose two variants of REPPM and both these mechanisms have the remarkable property that, at equilibrium, referral bonuses are offered but there is no need for actual payment of these bonuses. We establish that any given agent's equilibrium strategy is to refer other agents and to contribute in proportion to the agent's true value for the project. By referring others to contribute, an agent can, in fact, reduce his equilibrium contribution. In our view, the proposed mechanisms will lead to an increase in the number of projects that are funded on civic crowdfunding platforms.

The budget feasible mechanism design problem aims to design a mechanism which incentivizes the sellers to truthfully report their cost, and maximizes the buyer's value while guaranteeing that the total payment does not exceed her budget. Such budget feasible mechanisms can model a buyer in a crowdsourcing market interested in recruiting a set of workers (sellers) to accomplish a task for her.   This budget feasible mechanism design problem was introduced by Singer in 2010. There have been a number of improvements on the approximation guarantee of such mechanisms since then. We consider the general case where the buyer's valuation is a monotone submodular function. We offer two general frameworks for simple mechanisms, and by combining these frameworks, we significantly improve on the best known results for this problem, while also simplifying the analysis. For example, we improve the approximation guarantee for the general monotone submodular case from 7.91 to 5; and for the case of large markets (where each individual item has negligible value) from 3 to 2.58. More generally, given an $r$ approximation algorithm for the optimization problem (ignoring incentives), our mechanism is a $r+1$ approximation mechanism for large markets, an improvement from $2r^2$. We also provide a similar parameterized mechanism without the large market assumption, where we achieve a $4r+1$ approximation guarantee.

Sequential posted price mechanisms are conceptually simple mechanisms that work by proposing a take-it-or-leave-it offer to each buyer. We apply sequential posted price mechanisms to single-parameter multi-unit settings in which each buyer demands only one item and the mechanism can assign the service to at most k of the buyers. For standard sequential posted price mechanisms, we prove that with the valuation distribution having finite support, no sequential posted price mechanism can extract a constant fraction of the optimal expected revenue, even with unlimited supply. We extend this result to the the case of a continuous valuation distribution when various standard assumptions hold simultaneously. In fact, it turns out that the best fraction of the optimal revenue that is extractable by a sequential posted price mechanism is proportional to ratio of the highest and lowest possible valuation. We prove that for two simple generalizations of these mechanisms, a better revenue performance can be achieved: if the sequential posted price mechanism has for each buyer the option of either proposing an offer or asking the buyer for its valuation, then a Omega(1/max{1,d}) fraction of the optimal revenue can be extracted, where d denotes the degree of dependence of the valuations, ranging from complete independence (d=0) to arbitrary dependence (d=n-1). Moreover, when we generalize the sequential posted price mechanisms further, such that the mechanism has the ability to make a take-it-or-leave-it offer to the i-th buyer that depends on the valuations of all buyers except i's, we prove that a constant fraction (2-sqrt{e})/4~0.088 of the optimal revenue can be always be extracted. 	
1411.7422v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.7422v1	2014	Mechanisms for the clustering of inertial particles in the inertial   range of isotropic turbulence	Andrew D. Bragg|Peter J. Ireland|Lance R. Collins	  In this paper, we consider the physical mechanism for the clustering of inertial particles in the inertial range of isotropic turbulence. We analyze the exact, but unclosed, equation governing the radial distribution function (RDF) and compare the mechanisms it describes for clustering in the dissipation and inertial ranges. We demonstrate that in the limit ${St_r\ll1}$, where $St_r$ is the Stokes number based on the eddy turnover timescale at separation $r$, the clustering in the inertial range can be understood to be due to the preferential sampling of the coarse-grained fluid velocity gradient tensor at that scale. When ${St_r\gtrsim\mathcal{O}(1)}$ this mechanism gives way to a non-local clustering mechanism. These findings reveal that the clustering mechanisms in the inertial range are analogous to the mechanisms that we identified for the dissipation regime (see \emph{New J. Phys.} \textbf{16}:055013, 2014). Further, we discuss the similarities and differences between the clustering mechanisms we identify in the inertial range and the "sweep-stick" mechanism developed by Coleman \& Vassilicos (Phys. Fluids 21:113301, 2009). We argue that when ${St_r\ll1}$ the sweep-stick mechanism is equivalent to our mechanism in the inertial range if the particles are suspended in Navier-Stokes turbulence, but that the sweep-stick mechanism breaks down for ${St_r\gtrsim\mathcal{O}(1)}$. The argument also explains why the sweep-stick mechanism is unable to predict particle clustering in kinematic simulations. We then consider the closed, model equation for the RDF given in Zaichik \& Alipchenkov (Phys. Fluids. 19:113308, 2007) and use this, together with the results from our analysis, to predict the analytic form of the RDF in the inertial range for ${St_r\ll1}$, which, unlike that in the dissipation range, is not scale-invariant. The results are in good agreement with direct...

Wilkes	  Super-Kamiokande (SK) can search for weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) by detecting neutrinos produced from WIMP annihilations occurring inside the Sun. In this analysis, we include neutrino events with interaction vertices in the detector in addition to upward-going muons produced in the surrounding rock. Compared to the previous result, which used the upward-going muons only, the signal acceptances for light (few-GeV/$c^2$ $\sim$ 200-GeV/$c^2$) WIMPs are significantly increased. We fit 3903 days of SK data to search for the contribution of neutrinos from WIMP annihilation in the Sun. We found no significant excess over expected atmospheric-neutrino background and the result is interpreted in terms of upper limits on WIMP-nucleon elastic scattering cross sections under different assumptions about the annihilation channel. We set the current best limits on the spin-dependent (SD) WIMP-proton cross section for WIMP masses below 200 GeV/$c^2$ (at 10 GeV/$c^2$, 1.49$\times 10^{-39}$ cm$^2$ for $\chi\chi\rightarrow b \bar{b}$ and 1.31$\times 10^{-40}$ cm$^2$ for $\chi\chi\rightarrow\tau^+\tau^-$ annihilation channels), also ruling out some fraction of WIMP candidates with spin-independent (SI) coupling in the few-GeV/$c^2$ mass range.

P. Levanyuk|S. A. Minyukov|A. Cano	  We show that there exists a universal mechanism of long-range soliton attraction in three-dimensional solids and, therefore, of discontinuity of any commensurate-incommensurate (C-IC) phase transition. This mechanism is due to the strain dependence of the soliton self-energy and specific features of the solid-state elasticity. The role of this mechanism is studied in detail for a class of C-IC transitions where the IC modulation is one-dimensional, the anisotropy in the order parameter space is small, and the symmetry of the systems allows the existence of the Lifshitz invariant. Two other mechanisms of soliton attraction are operative here but the universal mechanism considered in this paper is found to be the most important one in some cases. Comparison with the most extensively studied C-IC transition in $\rm K_2SeO_4$ shows that the experimentally observed thermal anomalies can be understood as a result of the smearing of the theoretically predicted discontinuous transition.

Kolomeisky|Hubert Phillips III	  The dynamics of motor protein molecules that have two subunits is investigated using simple discrete stochastic models. Exact steady-state analytical expressions are obtained for velocities and dispersions for any number of intermediate states and conformations between the corresponding binding states of proteins. These models enabled a detailed description and comparison of two possible mechanisms of the motion of motor proteins along the linear tracks: the hand-over-hand mechanism when the motion of subunits alternate, and the inchworm mechanism when one subunit is always trailing another one. It is shown that particles in the hand-over-hand mechanism move faster and fluctuate more than the molecules in the inchworm mechanism. The effect of external forces on dynamic properties of motor proteins is discussed. Finally, a method is proposed for distinguishing between these two mechanisms based on experimental observations.

The approximation under consideration is based on the ordinary Taylor expansion of physical variables. The quantum contribution is given by the term of the second order. To escape technical difficulties, we start with the finite dimensional quantum mechanics. In our approach quantum mechanics is an approximative theory. It predicts statistical averages only with some precision. In principle, there might be found deviations of averages calculated within the quantum formalism from experimental averages (which are supposed to be equal to classical averages given by our model).

Schranz	  Dynamic dielectric and mechanical responses of the microcomposites of the ferroelastic-dielectric type were studied in this paper. The mechanical inclusions-matrix interactions have influence on the mechanical moduli of the composite. We have studied a mechanical response of the composite which consists of the material M and of the other material I in which dispersion of mechanic moduli of particles is present. The inclusions of the dielectric material in the ferroelastic matrix has the effect on the dielectric response of the microcomposite. We have found conditions for which the inclusions have the effect of enhancement of the dielectric response. Results of low frequency dielectric constant and dielectric loss in orthorhombic $ Al_{2}(WO_{4})_{3}$ show for polycrystalline material, where voids play the role of the dielectric material, their linear increasing dependence on increasing hydrostatic pressure p. These facts are qualitatively explained within our theory.

Shalyt-Margolin	  In this paper Quantum Mechanics with Fundamental Length is chosen as Quantum Mechanics at Planck's scale. This is possible due to the presence in the theory of General Uncertainty Relations (GUR). Here Quantum Mechanics with Fundamental Length is obtained as a deformation of Quantum Mechanics. The distinguishing feature of the proposed approach in comparison with previous ones, lies on the fact that here density matrix subjects to deformation whereas so far commutators have been deformed. The density matrix obtained by deformation of quantum-mechanical density one is named throughout this paper density pro-matrix, which at low energy limit turns to the density matrix. This transition corresponds to non-unitary one from Quantum Mechanics with GUR to Quantum mechanics. Below the implications of obtained results are enumerated.New view on the Black Holes Information Paradox are discussed

A two-Higgs doublet model with Vacuum CP Violation and Approximate Global $U(1)$ Family Symmetries (AGUFS) is built and may provide one of the simplest and attractive models in understanding origin and mechanisms of CP violation at the weak scale. It is seen that CP violation occurs everywhere it can from a single CP phase of the vacuum and is generally classified into four types of CP-violating mechanism. A new type of CP-violating mechanism is emphasized and can provide a consistent application to both the established and the reported CP-, T- and P-violating phenomena.

It is shown that the mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking provides not only a mechanism for generating masses of the bosons and fermions, but also a mechanism for creating CP-phases of the bosons and fermions, so that CP violation occurs, after spontaneous symmetry breaking, in all possible ways from a single CP phase of the vacuum and is generally classified into four types of CP-violating mechanism. A new type of CP-violating mechanism in the charged Higgs boson interactions of the fermions is emphasized and can provide a consistent description for both established and reported CP-, P- and T-violating phenomena. Of particular importance is the new source of CP violation for charged Higgs boson interactions that lead to the value of $\epsilon'/\epsilon$ as large as $10^{-3}$ independend of the CKM phase.

Present Experimental Status of This Resonance Mechanism	Kh. M. Beshtoev	  The mechanism of resonance enhancement of neutrino oscillations in matter and some critical remarks to this mechanism are considered. Using of this resonance mechanism is very important to examine the model of electroweak interactions since the processes induced by this mechanism grow multiply. In contrast to the electromagnetic and strong interactions in weak interactions, $P$-parity is violated therefore a problem of mass generations in the weak interactions is considered (the interaction must be left-right symmetric for mass generations). It is concluded that a possibility of mass generation in the framework of the weak interactions is not proved. The present experimental status of this resonance mechanism is considered and it is done conclusion that this effect has no clear experimental confirmation. For this purpose it is necessary to fulfil precision experiments with solar neutrinos and the neutrinos passed through the Earth matter.

Tze	  We propose a generalization of the standard geometric formulation of quantum mechanics, based on the classical Nambu dynamics of free Euler tops. This extended quantum mechanics has in lieu of the standard exponential time evolution, a nonlinear temporal evolution given by Jacobi elliptic functions. In the limit where latter's moduli parameters are set to zero, the usual geometric formulation of quantum mechanics, based on the Kahler structure of a complex projective Hilbert space, is recovered. We point out various novel features of this extended quantum mechanics, including its geometric aspects. Our approach sheds a new light on the problem of quantization of Nambu dynamics. Finally, we argue that the structure of this nonlinear quantum mechanics is natural from the point of view of string theory.

Solla	  A mathematical model describing the coupling between two independent amplification mechanisms in auditory hair cells is proposed and analyzed. Hair cells are cells in the inner ear responsible for translating sound-induced mechanical stimuli into an electrical signal that can then be recorded by the auditory nerve. In nonmammals, two separate mechanisms have been postulated to contribute to the amplification and tuning properties of the hair cells. Models of each of these mechanisms have been shown to be poised near a Hopf bifurcation. Through a weakly nonlinear analysis that assumes weak periodic forcing, weak damping, and weak coupling, the physiologically-based models of the two mechanisms are reduced to a system of two coupled amplitude equations describing the resonant response. The predictions that follow from an analysis of the reduced equations, as well as performance benefits due to the coupling of the two mechanisms, are discussed and compared with published experimental auditory nerve data.

Vahala	  The resonant buildup of light within optical microcavities elevates the radiation pressure which mediates coupling of optical modes to the mechanical modes of a microcavity. Above a certain threshold pump power, regenerative mechanical oscillation occurs causing oscillation of certain mechanical eigenmodes. Here, we present a methodology to spatially image the micro-mechanical resonances of a toroid microcavity using a scanning probe technique. The method relies on recording the induced frequency shift of the mechanical eigenmode when in contact with a scanning probe tip. The method is passive in nature and achieves a sensitivity sufficient to spatially resolve the vibrational mode pattern associated with the thermally agitated displacement at room temperature. The recorded mechanical mode patterns are in good qualitative agreement with the theoretical strain fields as obtained by finite element simulations.

Olavo	  The two previous papers developed quantum mechanical formalism from classical mechanics and two additional postulates. In the first paper it was also shown that the uncertainty relations possess no ontological validity and only reflect the formalism's limitations. In this paper, a Realist Interpretation of quantum mechanics based on these results is elaborated and compared to the Copenhagen Interpretation. We demonstrate that von Neumann's proof of the impossibility of a hidden variable theory is not correct, independently of Bell's argumentation. A local hidden variable theory is found for non-relativistic quantum mechanics, which is nothing else than newtonian mechanics itself. We prove that Bell's theorem does not imply in a non-locality of quantum mechanics, and also demonstrate that Bohm's theory cannot be considered a true hidden variable theory.

We then turn to some objections to Bohmian mechanics, for example the fact that in Bohmian mechanics there is no back action of particle configurations upon wave functions. These lead us to our main concern: a more careful consideration of the meaning of the wave function in quantum mechanics, as suggested by a Bohmian perspective. We propose that the reason, on the universal level, that there is no action of configurations upon wave functions, as there seems to be between all other elements of physical reality, is that the wave function of the universe is not an element of physical reality. We propose that the wave function belongs to an altogether different category of existence than that of substantive physical entities, and that its existence is nomological rather than material. We propose, in other words, that the wave function is a component of physical law rather than of the reality described by the law.

Vatsya	  The basic premise of Quantum Mechanics, embodied in the doctrine of wave-particle duality, assigns both, a particle and a wave structure to the physical entities. The classical laws describing the motion of a particle and the evolution of a wave are assumed to be correct. Gauge Mechanics treats the discrete entities as particles, and their motion is described by an extension of the corresponding classical laws. Quantum mechanical interpretations of various observations and their implications, including some issues that are usually ignored, are presented and compared here with the gauge mechanical descriptions. The considerations are confined mainly to the conceptual foundations and the internal consistency of these theories. Although no major differences between their predictions have yet been noticed, some deviations are expected, which are indicated. These cases may provide the testing grounds for further investigations.

Shemi-zadeh	  The article is dedicated to discussion of irreversibility and foundation of statistical mechanics "from the first principles". Taking into account infinitesimal and, as it seems, neglectful for classical mechanics fluctuations of the physical vacuum, makes a deterministic motion of unstable dynamic systems is broken ("spontaneous determinism breaking", "spontaneous stochastization"). Vacuum fluctuations play part of the trigger, starting the powerful mechanism of exponent instability. The motion of the dynamic systems becomes irreversible and stochastic. Classical mechanics turns out to be applicable only for a small class of stable dynamic systems with zero Kolmogorov-Sinay entropy $h=0$. For alternative "Stochastic mechanics" there are corresponding equations of motion and Master Equation, describing irreversible evolution of the initial distribution function to equilibrium state. 	
0407096v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0407096v1	2004	The Emergence of Classical Dynamics in a Quantum World	Tanmoy Bhattacharya|Salman Habib|Kurt Jacobs	  Ever since the advent of quantum mechanics, it has been clear that the atoms composing matter do not obey Newton's laws. Instead, their behavior is described by the Schroedinger equation. Surprisingly though, until recently, no clear explanation was given for why everyday objects, which are merely collections of atoms, are observed to obey Newton's laws. It would seem that, if quantum mechanics explains all the properties of atoms accurately, they, too, should obey quantum mechanics. This reasoning led some scientists to believe in a distinct macroscopic, or ``big and complicated,'' world in which quantum mechanics fails and classical mechanics takes over, although there has never been experimental evidence for such a failure. Even those who insisted that Newtonian mechanics would somehow emerge from the underlying quantum mechanics as the system became increasingly macroscopic were hindered by the lack of adequate experimental and theoretical tools. In the last decade, however, this quantum-to-classical transition has become accessible to experimental study and quantitative description, and the resulting insights are the subject of this article.

Tannor	  In recent years there has been a resurgence of interest in Bohmian mechanics as a numerical tool because of its local dynamics, which suggest the possibility of significant computational advantages for the simulation of large quantum systems. However, closer inspection of the Bohmian formulation reveals that the nonlocality of quantum mechanics has not disappeared -- it has simply been swept under the rug into the quantum force. In this paper we present a new formulation of Bohmian mechanics in which the quantum action, S, is taken to be complex. This leads to a single equation for complex S, and ultimately complex x and p but there is a reward for this complexification -- a significantly higher degree of localization. The quantum force in the new approach vanishes for Gaussian wavepacket dynamics, and its effect on barrier tunneling processes is orders of magnitude lower than that of the classical force. We demonstrate tunneling probabilities that are in virtually perfect agreement with the exact quantum mechanics down to 10^{-7} calculated from strictly localized quantum trajectories that do not communicate with their neighbors. The new formulation may have significant implications for fundamental quantum mechanics, ranging from the interpretation of non-locality to measures of quantum complexity.

Szabo	  In 1935 Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (EPR) published an important paper in which they claimed that the whole formalism of quantum mechanics together with what they called "Reality Criterion" imply that quantum mechanics cannot be complete. That is, there must exist some elements of reality that are not described by quantum mechanics. There must be, they concluded, a more complete description of physical reality behind quantum mechanics. There must be a state, a hidden variable, characterizing the state of affairs in the world in more details than the quantum mechanical state, something that also reflects the missing elements of reality.   Under some further but quite plausible assumptions, this conclusion implies that in some spin-correlation experiments the measured quantum mechanical probabilities should satisfy particular inequalities (Bell-type inequalities). The paradox consists in the fact that quantum probabilities do not satisfy these inequalities. And this paradoxical fact has been confirmed by several laboratory experiments in the last three decades. The problem is still open and hotly debated among both physicists and philosophers. It has motivated a wide range of research from the most fundamental quantum mechanical experiments through foundations of probability theory to the theory of stochastic causality as well as the metaphysics of free will.

Hence, this approach entails substituting an infinite number of conservative systems for a dissipative mechanical system corresponding to varied initial conditions. One key way we use to demonstrate these viewpoints is that by the Newton-Laplace principle the nonconservative force can be reasonably assumed to be equal to a function of a component of generalized coordinates $q_i$ along a phase curve, such that a nonconservative mechanical system can be reformulated as countless conservative systems. Utilizing the proposition, one can apply the method of Hamiltonian mechanics or Lagrangian mechanics to dissipative mechanical system. The advantage of this approach is that there is no need to change the definition of canonical momentum and the motion is identical to that of the original system.

Here, we present the mesoscopic model of biological protein materials composed of protein crystals prescribed by Go potential for characterization of elastic behavior of protein materials. Specifically, we consider the representative volume element (RVE) containing the protein crystals represented by alpha-carbon atoms, prescribed by Go potential, with application of constant normal strain to RVE. The stress-strain relationship computed from virial stress theory provides the nonlinear elastic behavior of protein materials and their mechanical properties such as Young's modulus, quantitatively and/or qualitatively comparable to mechanical properties of biological protein materials obtained from experiments and/or atomistic simulations. Further, we discuss the role of native topology on the mechanical properties of protein crystals. It is shown that parallel strands (hydrogen bonds in parallel) enhances the mechanical resilience of protein materials.

Pires Da Cruz|C. Pera|Jörg Anderlohr|Roda Bounaceur|Frédérique Battin-Leclerc	  The development and validation against experimental results of a new gasoline surrogate complex kinetic mechanism is presented in this paper. The surrogate fuel is a ternary mixture of n heptane, iso octane and toluene. The full three components mechanism is based on existing n heptane/iso octane (gasoline PRF) and toluene mechanisms which were modified and coupled for the purpose of this work. Mechanism results are compared against available experimental data from the literature. Simulations with the PRF plus toluene mechanism show that its behavior is in agreement with experimental results for most of the tested settings. These include a wide variety of thermodynamic conditions and fuel proportions in experimental configurations such as HCCI engine experiments, rapid compression machines, a shock tube and a jet stirred reactor. 	
0904.4193v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/0904.4193v2	2009	On the Power of Randomization in Algorithmic Mechanism Design	Shahar Dobzinski|Shaddin Dughmi	  In many settings the power of truthful mechanisms is severely bounded. In this paper we use randomization to overcome this problem. In particular, we construct an FPTAS for multi-unit auctions that is truthful in expectation, whereas there is evidence that no polynomial-time truthful deterministic mechanism provides an approximation ratio better than 2.   We also show for the first time that truthful in expectation polynomial-time mechanisms are \emph{provably} stronger than polynomial-time universally truthful mechanisms. Specifically, we show that there is a setting in which: (1) there is a non-polynomial time truthful mechanism that always outputs the optimal solution, and that (2) no universally truthful randomized mechanism can provide an approximation ratio better than 2 in polynomial time, but (3) an FPTAS that is truthful in expectation exists. 	
0906.2466v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/0906.2466v1	2009	Truthful Mechanisms via Greedy Iterative Packing	Chandra Chekuri|Iftah Gamzu	  An important research thread in algorithmic game theory studies the design of efficient truthful mechanisms that approximate the optimal social welfare. A fundamental question is whether an \alpha-approximation algorithm translates into an \alpha-approximate truthful mechanism. It is well-known that plugging an \alpha-approximation algorithm into the VCG technique may not yield a truthful mechanism. Thus, it is natural to investigate properties of approximation algorithms that enable their use in truthful mechanisms.   The main contribution of this paper is to identify a useful and natural property of approximation algorithms, which we call loser-independence; this property is applicable in the single-minded and single-parameter settings. Intuitively, a loser-independent algorithm does not change its outcome when the bid of a losing agent increases, unless that agent becomes a winner. We demonstrate that loser-independent algorithms can be employed as sub-procedures in a greedy iterative packing approach while preserving monotonicity. A greedy iterative approach provides a good approximation in the context of maximizing a non-decreasing submodular function subject to independence constraints. Our framework gives rise to truthful approximation mechanisms for various problems. Notably, some problems arise in online mechanism design. 	
0907.1948v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.1948v2	2009	Amplified Hardness of Approximation for VCG-Based Mechanisms	Shaddin Dughmi|Hu Fu|Robert Kleinberg	  If a two-player social welfare maximization problem does not admit a PTAS, we prove that any maximal-in-range truthful mechanism that runs in polynomial time cannot achieve an approximation factor better than 1/2. Moreover, for the k-player version of the same problem, the hardness of approximation improves to 1/k under the same two-player hardness assumption. (We note that 1/k is achievable by a trivial deterministic maximal-in-range mechanism.) This hardness result encompasses not only deterministic maximal-in-range mechanisms, but also all universally-truthful randomized maximal in range algorithms, as well as a class of strictly more powerful truthful-in-expectation randomized mechanisms recently introduced by Dobzinski and Dughmi. Our result applies to any class of valuation functions that satisfies some minimal closure properties. These properties are satisfied by the valuation functions in all well-studied APX-hard social welfare maximization problems, such as coverage, submodular, and subadditive valuations.   We also prove a stronger result for universally-truthful maximal-in-range mechanisms. Namely, even for the class of budgeted additive valuations, which admits an FPTAS, no such mechanism can achieve an approximation factor better than 1/k in polynomial time. 	
0910.5391v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/0910.5391v1	2009	Randomness in Classical Mechanics and Quantum Mechanics	Igor V. Volovich	  The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics assumes the existence of the classical deterministic Newtonian world. We argue that in fact the Newton determinism in classical world does not hold and in classical mechanics there is fundamental and irreducible randomness. The classical Newtonian trajectory does not have a direct physical meaning since arbitrary real numbers are not observable. There are classical uncertainty relations, i.e. the uncertainty (errors of observation) in the determination of coordinate and momentum is always positive (non zero).   A "functional" formulation of classical mechanics was suggested. The fundamental equation of the microscopic dynamics in the functional approach is not the Newton equation but the Liouville equation for the distribution function of the single particle. Solutions of the Liouville equation have the property of delocalization which accounts for irreversibility. The Newton equation in this approach appears as an approximate equation describing the dynamics of the average values of the position and momenta for not too long time intervals. Corrections to the Newton trajectories are computed. An interpretation of quantum mechanics is attempted in which both classical and quantum mechanics contain fundamental randomness. Instead of an ensemble of events one introduces an ensemble of observers.

Meisinger|Qing-hai Wang	  The correspondence principle asserts that quantum mechanics resembles classical mechanics in the high-quantum-number limit. In the past few years many papers have been published on the extension of both quantum mechanics and classical mechanics into the complex domain. However, the question of whether complex quantum mechanics resembles complex classical mechanics at high energy has not yet been studied. This paper introduces the concept of a local quantum probability density $\rho(z)$ in the complex plane. It is shown that there exist infinitely many complex contours $C$ of infinite length on which $\rho(z) dz$ is real and positive. Furthermore, the probability integral $\int_C\rho(z) dz$ is finite. Demonstrating the existence of such contours is the essential element in establishing the correspondence between complex quantum and classical mechanics. The mathematics needed to analyze these contours is subtle and involves the use of asymptotics beyond all orders.

Kouwenhoven|H. S. J. van der Zant	  Nanoscale resonators that oscillate at high frequencies are useful in many measurement applications. We studied a high-quality mechanical resonator made from a suspended carbon nanotube driven into motion by applying a periodic radio frequency potential using a nearby antenna. Single-electron charge fluctuations created periodic modulations of the mechanical resonance frequency. A quality factor exceeding 10^5 allows the detection of a shift in resonance frequency caused by the addition of a single-electron charge on the nanotube. Additional evidence for the strong coupling of mechanical motion and electron tunneling is provided by an energy transfer to the electrons causing mechanical damping and unusual nonlinear behavior. We also discovered that a direct current through the nanotube spontaneously drives the mechanical resonator, exerting a force that is coherent with the high-frequency resonant mechanical motion.

J. van Raan	  The crown indicator is a well-known bibliometric indicator of research performance developed by our institute. The indicator aims to normalize citation counts for differences among fields. We critically examine the theoretical basis of the normalization mechanism applied in the crown indicator. We also make a comparison with an alternative normalization mechanism. The alternative mechanism turns out to have more satisfactory properties than the mechanism applied in the crown indicator. In particular, the alternative mechanism has a so-called consistency property. The mechanism applied in the crown indicator lacks this important property. As a consequence of our findings, we are currently moving towards a new crown indicator, which relies on the alternative normalization mechanism. 	
1009.0377v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1009.0377v1	2010	A Unified Mechanism Design Framework for Networked Systems	Tansu Alpcan|Holger Boche|Siddharth Naik	  Mechanisms such as auctions and pricing schemes are utilized to design strategic (noncooperative) games for networked systems. Although the participating players are selfish, these mechanisms ensure that the game outcome is optimal with respect to a global criterion (e.g. maximizing a social welfare function), preference-compatible, and strategy-proof, i.e. players have no reason to deceive the designer. The mechanism designer achieves these objectives by introducing specific rules and incentives to the players; in this case by adding resource prices to their utilities. In auction-based mechanisms, the mechanism designer explicitly allocates the resources based on bids of the participants in addition to setting prices. Alternatively, pricing mechanisms enforce global objectives only by charging the players for the resources they have utilized. In either setting, the player preferences represented by utility functions may be coupled or decoupled, i.e. they depend on other player's actions or only on player's own actions, respectively. The unified framework and its information structures are illustrated through multiple example resource allocation problems from wireless and wired networks.

Mayer Alegre|Alex Krause|Oskar Painter	  We present optical sideband spectroscopy measurements of a mesoscopic mechanical oscillator cooled near its quantum ground state. The mechanical oscillator, corresponding to a 3.99GHz acoustic mode of a patterned silicon nanobeam, is coupled via radiation pressure to a pair of co-localized 200THz optical modes. The mechanical mode is cooled close to its quantum ground state from a bath temperature of 18K using radiation pressure back-action stemming from the optical pumping of one of the optical cavity resonances. An optical probe beam, resonant with the second optical cavity resonance, is used to transduce the mechanical motion and determine the phonon occupancy of the mechanical mode. Measurement of the asymmetry between up-converted and down-converted photons of the probe beam yields directly the displacement noise power associated with the quantum zero-point motion of the mechanical oscillator, and provides an absolute calibration of the average phonon occupancy of the mechanical mode. 	
1111.0175v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1111.0175v1	2011	Mechanical surface tension governs membrane thermal fluctuations	Oded Farago	  Motivated by the still ongoing debate about the various possible meanings of the term surface tension of bilayer membranes, we present here a detailed discussion that explains the differences between the "intrinsic", "renormalized", and "mechanical" tensions. We use analytical considerations and computer simulations to show that the membrane spectrum of thermal fluctuations is governed by the mechanical and not the intrinsic tension. Our study highlights the fact that the commonly used quadratic approximation of Helfrich effective Hamiltonian is not rotationally invariant. We demonstrate that this non-physical feature leads to a calculated mechanical tension that differs dramatically from the correct mechanical tension. Specifically, our results suggest that the mechanical and intrinsic tensions vanish simultaneously, which contradicts recent theoretical predictions derived for the approximated Hamiltonian.

Applications to Analytical   Mechanics	Radu Miron	  The aim of the present text is twofold: to provide a compendium of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian geometries and to introduce and investigate new analytical Mechanics: Finslerian, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian. The fundamental equations (or evolution equations) of these Mechanics are derived from the variational calculus applied to the integral of action and these can be studied by using the methods of Lagrangian or Hamiltonian geometries. More general, the notions of higher order Lagrange or Hamilton spaces have been introduced and developed by the present author. The applications led to the notions of Lagrangian or Hamiltonian Analytical Mechanics of higher order. For short, in this text we aim to solve some difficult problems: The problem of geometrization of classical non conservative mechanical systems; The foundations of geometrical theory of new mechanics: Finslerian, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian;To determine the evolution equations of the classical mechanical systems for whose external forces depend on the higher order accelerations.

The CO molecule is used as a computational example. While the hyperpolarizability mechanism generates small amounts of orientation at intensities below the ionization threshold, ionization depletion quickly becomes the dominant mechanism as soon as ionizing intensities are reached. Only the ionization mechanism leads to substantial orientation (e.g. on the order of |<cos\theta>| > 0.1). For intensities typical of laser-induced molecular alignment and orientation experiments, the two mechanism lead to robust, characteristic timings of the field-free orientation wave-packet revivals relative to the the alignment revivals and the revival time. The revival timings can be used to detect the active orientation mechanism experimentally. 	
1206.6097v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.6097v1	2012	A Contemporary View of Coronal Heating	Clare E. Parnell|Ineke De Moortel	  Determining the heating mechanism (or mechanisms) that causes the outer atmosphere of the Sun, and many other stars, to reach temperatures orders of magnitude higher than their surface temperatures has long been a key problem. For decades the problem has been known as the coronal heating problem, but it is now clear that `coronal heating' cannot be treated or explained in isolation and that the heating of the whole solar atmosphere must be studied as a highly coupled system. The magnetic field of the star is known to play a key role, but, despite significant advancements in solar telescopes, computing power and much greater understanding of theoretical mechanisms, the question of which mechanism or mechanisms are the dominant supplier of energy to the chromosphere and corona is still open. Following substantial recent progress, we consider the most likely contenders and discuss the key factors that have made, and still make, determining the actual (coronal) heating mechanism (or mechanisms) so difficult. 	
1302.1924v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.1924v1	2013	Macroscopic Quantum Mechanics: Theory and Experimental Concepts of   Optomechanics	Yanbei Chen	  Rapid experimental progress has recently allowed the use of light to prepare macroscopic mechanical objects into nearly pure quantum states. This research field of quantum optomechanics opens new doors toward testing quantum mechanics, and possibly other laws of physics, in new regimes. In the first part of this paper, I will review a set of techniques of quantum measurement theory that are often used to analyze quantum optomechanical systems. Some of these techniques were originally designed to analyze how a classical driving force passes through a quantum system, and can eventually be detected with optimal signal-to-noise ratio --- while others focus more on the quantum state evolution of a mechanical object under continuous monitoring. In the second part of this paper, I will review a set of experimental concepts that will demonstrate quantum mechanical behavior of macroscopic objects --- quantum entanglement, quantum teleportation, and the quantum Zeno effect. Taking the interplay between gravity and quantum mechanics as an example, I will review a set of speculations on how quantum mechanics can be modified for macroscopic objects, and how these speculations --- and their generalizations --- might be tested by optomechanics.

We introduce hybrid mechanisms, which are convex combinations of two component mechanisms. We give a set of conditions under which such hybrids facilitate a non-degenerate trade-off between strategyproofness (in terms of partial strategyproofness) and efficiency (in terms of dominance). This set of conditions is tight in the sense that trade-offs may become degenerate if any of the conditions are dropped. Moreover, we give an algorithm for the mechanism designer's problem of determining a maximal mixing factor. Finally, we prove that our construction can be applied to mix Random Serial Dictatorship with Probabilistic Serial, as well as with the adaptive Boston mechanism, and we illustrate the efficiency gains numerically.

If agents are strategic to minimize their own individual cost rather than the global social cost, they are endowed with an incentive not to follow the intended algorithm, unless the tax/subsidy mechanism is carefully designed. Inspired by the classical Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism and more recent algorithmic mechanism design theory, we propose a tax mechanism that incentivises agents to faithfully implement the intended algorithm. In particular, a new notion of asymptotic incentive compatibility is introduced to characterize a desirable property of such class of mechanisms. The proposed class of tax mechanisms provides a sequence of mechanisms that gives agents a diminishing incentive to deviate from suggested algorithm. 	
1304.7964v3	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.7964v3	2013	Structural Analysis of Combustion Mechanisms	J. Tóth|A. L. Nagy|I. Zsély	  39 detailed mechanisms for combustion of hydrogen, carbon monoxide and methanol are investigated using ReactionKinetics, a Mathematica based package. The obtained results in most cases do not depend on the choice of reaction rate coefficients, the methods only use the underlying sets of reaction steps, thus the results are robust and general in a certain sense. These investigations can be used before or in parallel with usual numerical investigations, such as pathway analysis, sensitivity analysis, parameter estimation or simulation.   The considered hydrogen mechanisms shared 90% of common reaction steps. The CO combustion mechanisms show a larger variety both in species and in reaction steps. There exist only a few methanol combustion mechanisms; the big differences between them shows that the modelling community is only at the very beginning of exploring this process.   The package and the methods may be useful for automatic mechanism generations, testing, comparing and reduction of mechanisms as well, especially in the case of large systems.

The particle trajectories of a general dynamical system defined on an (1+n)-dimensional smooth manifold are treated geometrically as dynamical variables. Statistical mechanics of particle trajectories are constructed in a classical manner. Thermodynamic variables are introduced through a partition function based on a canonical ensemble of trajectories. Within this theoretical framework, classical mechanics can be interpreted as an equilibrium state of statistical mechanics. The relationships between classical and quantum mechanics are discussed from this statistical mechanical viewpoint. The maximum entropy principle is shown to provide a unified view of both classical and quantum mechanics.

Holland	  We study an optomechanical system in which a microwave field and an optical field are coupled to a common mechanical resonator. We explore methods that use these mechanical resonators to store quantum mechanical states and to transduce states between the electromagnetic resonators from the perspective of the effect of mechanical decoherence. Besides being of fundamental interest, this coherent quantum state transfer could have important practical implications in the field of quantum information science, as it potentially allows one to overcome intrinsic limitations of both microwave and optical platforms. We discuss several state transfer protocols and study their transfer fidelity using a fully quantum mechanical model that utilizes quantum state-diffusion techniques. This work demonstrates that mechanical decoherence should not be an insurmountable obstacle in realizing high fidelity storage and transduction. 	
1307.7164v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1307.7164v1	2013	On the Scalability of Reliable Data Transfer in High Speed Networks	Majid Ghaderi|Don Towsley	  This paper considers reliable data transfer in a high-speed network (HSN) in which the per-connection capacity is very large. We focus on sliding window protocols employing selective repeat for reliable data transfer and study two reliability mechanisms based on ARQ and FEC. The question we ask is which mechanism is more suitable for an HSN in which the scalability of reliable data transfer in terms of receiver's buffer requirement and achievable delay and throughput is a concern. To efficiently utilize the large bandwidth available to a connection in an HSN, sliding window protocols require a large transmission window. In this regime of large transmission windows, we show that while both mechanisms achieve the same asymptotic throughput in the presence of packet losses, their delay and buffer requirements are different. Specifically, an FEC-based mechanism has delay and receiver's buffer requirement that are asymptotically smaller than that of an ARQ-based selective repeat mechanism by a factor of log W, where W is the window size of the selective repeat mechanism. This result is then used to investigate the implications of each reliability mechanism on protocol design in an HSN in terms of throughput, delay, buffer requirement, and control overhead. 	
1310.5485v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.5485v2	2014	Behavior-Based online Incentive Mechanism for Crowd Sensing with Budget   Constraints	Jiajun Sun	  Crowd sensing is a new paradigm which leverages the ubiquity of sensor-equipped mobile devices to collect data. To achieve good quality for crowd sensing, incentive mechanisms are indispensable to attract more participants. Most of existing mechanisms focus on the expected utility prior to sensing, ignoring the risk of low quality solution and privacy leakage. Traditional incentive mechanisms such as the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism and its variants are not applicable here. In this paper, to address these challenges, we propose a behavior based incentive mechanism for crowd sensing applications with budget constraints by applying sequential all-pay auctions in mobile social networks (MSNs), not only to consider the effects of extensive user participation, but also to maximize high quality of the context based sensing content submission for crowd sensing platform under the budget constraints, where users arrive in a sequential order. Through an extensive simulation, results indicate that incentive mechanisms in our proposed framework outperform the best existing solution.

Unlike standard sideband cooling, this scheme applies to the so-called unresolved sideband regime, where the resonance frequency of the mechanical mode is much smaller than the cavity linewidth. Ground state cooling becomes possible when assuming the presence of an additional, auxiliary mechanical mode and exploiting the effect of optomechanically induced transparency. We first consider a system where one optical cavity interacts with two mechanical modes, and show that ground state cooling of the unresolved mechanical mode is possible when the auxiliary mode is in the resolved sideband regime. We then present a modified setup involving two cavity modes, where both mechanical modes are allowed to be in the unresolved sideband regime.

To provide gain to one mechanical resonator and the same amount of damping to the other, the two optical cavities should be driven by blue- and red-detuned laser fields, respectively. After adiabatically eliminating the degrees of freedom of the cavity modes, we derive a formula to describe the PT symmetry of two coupled mechanical resonators. Mechanical PT-symmetric phase transition is demonstrated by the dynamical behavior of the mechanical resonators. Moreover, we study the effect of the quantum noises on the dynamical behavior of the mechanical resonators when the system is in the quantum regime. 	
1412.8518v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.8518v1	2014	Optimal Platform Design	Jason D. Hartline|Tim Roughgarden	  An auction house cannot generally provide the optimal auction technology to every client. Instead it provides one or several auction technologies, and clients select the most appropriate one. For example, eBay provides ascending auctions and "buy-it-now" pricing. For each client the offered technology may not be optimal, but it would be too costly for clients to create their own. We call these mechanisms, which emphasize generality rather than optimality, platform mechanisms. A platform mechanism will be adopted by a client if its performance exceeds that of the client's outside option, e.g., hiring (at a cost) a consultant to design the optimal mechanism. We ask two related questions. First, for what costs of the outside option will the platform be universally adopted? Second, what is the structure of good platform mechanisms? We answer these questions using a novel prior-free analysis framework in which we seek mechanisms that are approximately optimal for every prior.

In the implicit setting, e.g. when the bidders have additive valuations with independent and/or continuous values for the items, these results do not apply, and it was recently shown that exact revenue optimization is intractable, even when there is only one bidder. Even for item distributions with special structure, optimal mechanisms have been surprisingly rare and the problem is challenging even in the two-item case. In this paper, we provide a framework for designing optimal mechanisms using optimal transport theory and duality theory. We instantiate our framework to obtain conditions under which only pricing the grand bundle is optimal in multi-item settings (complementing the work of [Manelli and Vincent 2006], as well as to characterize optimal two-item mechanisms. We use our results to derive closed-form descriptions of the optimal mechanism in several two-item settings, exhibiting also a setting where a continuum of lotteries is necessary for revenue optimization but a closed-form representation of the mechanism can still be found efficiently using our framework.

It takes   three to tango	Goffredo Chirco|Thibaut Josset|Carlo Rovelli	  It is notoriously difficult to apply statistical mechanics to generally covariant systems, because the notions of time, energy and equilibrium are seriously modified in this context. We discuss the conditions under which weaker versions of these notions can be defined, sufficient for statistical mechanics. We focus on reparametrization-invariant systems without additional gauges. The key is to reconstruct statistical mechanics from the ergodic theorem. We find that a suitable split of the system into two non interacting components is sufficient for generalizing statistical mechanics. While equilibrium acquires sense only when the system admits a suitable split into three weakly interacting components ---roughly: a clock and two systems among which a generalization of energy is equi-partitioned. This allows the application of statistical mechanics and thermodynamics as an additivity condition of such generalized energy.

Dimitris Fotakis|Christos Tzamos|Emmanouil Zampetakis	  We introduce a general approach based on \emph{selective verification} and obtain approximate mechanisms without money for maximizing the social welfare in the general domain of utilitarian voting. Having a good allocation in mind, a mechanism with verification selects few critical agents and detects, using a verification oracle, whether they have reported truthfully. If yes, the mechanism produces the desired allocation. Otherwise, the mechanism ignores any misreports and proceeds with the remaining agents. We obtain randomized truthful (or almost truthful) mechanisms without money that verify only $O(\ln m / \epsilon)$ agents, where $m$ is the number of outcomes, independently of the total number of agents, and are $(1-\epsilon)$-approximate for the social welfare. We also show that any truthful mechanism with a constant approximation ratio needs to verify $\Omega(\log m)$ agents. A remarkable property of our mechanisms is \emph{robustness}, namely that their outcome depends only on the reports of the truthful agents.

Steele	  We experimentally investigate the nonlinear response of a multilayer graphene resonator using a superconducting microwave cavity to detect its motion. The radiation pressure force is used to drive the mechanical resonator in an optomechanically induced transparency configuration. By varying the amplitudes of drive and probe tones, the mechanical resonator can be brought into a nonlinear limit. Using the calibration of the optomechanical coupling, we quantify the mechanical Duffing nonlinearity. By increasing the drive force, we observe a decrease in the mechanical dissipation rate at large amplitudes, suggesting a negative nonlinear damping mechanism in the graphene resonator. Increasing the optomechanical backaction, we observe a nonlinear regime not described by a Duffing response that includes new instabilities of the mechanical response.

Lee|Qiang Lin	  Silicon carbide (SiC) exhibits excellent material properties attractive for broad applications. We demonstrate the first SiC optomechanical microresonators that integrate high mechanical frequency, high mechanical quality, and high optical quality into a single device. The radial-breathing mechanical mode has a mechanical frequency up to 1.69 GHz with a mechanical Q around 5500 in atmosphere, which corresponds to a mechanical f-Q product as high as 9.47x10^12 Hz. The strong optomechanical coupling allows us to efficiently excite and probe the coherent mechanical oscillation by optical waves. The demonstrated devices, in combination with the superior thermal property, chemical inertness, and defect characteristics of SiC, show great potential for applications in metrology, sensing, and quantum photonics, particularly in harsh environments that are challenging for other device platforms.

Wittel|Jan Carmeliet	  The hygro-mechanical behavior of a hierarchical cellular material, i.e. growth rings of softwood is investigated using a two-scale micro-mechanics model based on a computational homogenization technique. The lower scale considers the individual wood cells of varying geometry and dimensions. Honeycomb unit cells with periodic boundary conditions are utilized to calculate the mechanical properties and swelling coefficients of wood cells. Using the cellular scale results, the anisotropy in mechanical and swelling behavior of a growth ring in transverse directions is investigated. Predicted results are found to be comparable to experimental data. It is found that the orthotropic swelling properties of the cell wall in thin-walled earlywood cells produce anisotropic swelling behavior while, in thick latewood cells, this anisotropy vanishes. The proposed approach provides the ability to consider the complex microstructure when predicting the effective mechanical and swelling properties of softwood. 	
1510.03760v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.03760v1	2015	Noether's first theorem in Hamiltonian mechanics	G. Sardanashvily	  Non-autonomous non-relativistic mechanics is formulated as Lagrangian and Hamiltonian theory on fibre bundles over the time axis R. Hamiltonian mechanics herewith can be reformulated as particular Lagrangian theory on a momentum phase space. This facts enable one to apply Noether's first theorem both to Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics. By virtue of Noether's first theorem, any symmetry defines a symmetry current which is an integral of motion in Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics. The converse is not true in Lagrangian mechanics where integrals of motion need not come from symmetries. We show that, in Hamiltonian mechanics, any integral of motion is a symmetry current. In particular, an energy function relative to a reference frame is a symmetry current along a connection on a configuration bundle which is this reference frame. An example of the global Kepler problem is analyzed in detail.

In this paper we show that the electron-transfer processes occurring in these two states are a difficult test for chemical bonding descriptors and can be used to assess new bonding descriptors on its ability to recognize the harpoon mechanism. To this aim, we study the bond formation mechanism in a series of diatomic molecules. In all studied electron-reorganization mechanisms, the maximal electron-transfer variation point along the bond formation path occurs when about half electron has been transferred from one atom to another. If the process takes places through a harpoon mechanism, this point of the reaction path coincides with the avoided crossing. The electron sharing indices and one-dimensional plots of the electron localization function and the Laplacian of the electron density along the molecular axis can be used to monitor the bond formation in diatomics and provide a distinction between the harpoon mechanism and a regular electron-reorganization process.

Computer scientists have applied mechanized reasoning to economic problems but -- to date -- this work has not yet been properly presented in economics journals. We introduce mechanized reasoning to economists in three ways. First, we introduce mechanized reasoning in general, describing both the techniques and their successful applications. Second, we explain how mechanized reasoning has been applied to economic problems, concentrating on the two domains that have attracted the most attention: social choice theory and auction theory. Finally, we present a detailed example of mechanized reasoning in practice by means of a proof of Vickrey's familiar theorem on second-price auctions.

However, differential privacy, the current gold standard in data privacy, does not adequately address privacy issues in this kind of data.   This work looks at a recent generalization of differential privacy, called Pufferfish, that can be used to address privacy in correlated data. The main challenge in applying Pufferfish is a lack of suitable mechanisms. We provide the first mechanism -- the Wasserstein Mechanism -- which applies to any general Pufferfish framework. Since this mechanism may be computationally inefficient, we provide an additional mechanism that applies to some practical cases such as physical activity measurements across time, and is computationally efficient. Our experimental evaluations indicate that this mechanism provides privacy and utility for synthetic as well as real data in two separate domains.

Milburn	  Optomechanical systems typically use light to control the quantum state of a mechanical resonator. In this paper, we propose a scheme for controlling the quantum state of light using the mechanical degree of freedom as a controlled beam splitter. Preparing the mechanical resonator in non-classical states enables an optomechanical Stern-Gerlach interferometer. When the mechanical resonator has a small coherent amplitude it acts as a quantum control, entangling the optical and mechanical degrees of freedom. As the coherent amplitude of the resonator increases, we recover single photon and two-photon interference via a classically controlled beam splitter. The visibility of the two-photon interference is particularly sensitive to coherent excitations in the mechanical resonator and this could form the basis of an optically transduced weak-force sensor.

Quantum cryptography is one of the solutions that use property of polarization to ensure that transmitted data is not tampered. The research paper provides the mechanism that enhances the data security in quantum cryptography during exchange of information. In first phase detailed explanation of Quantum key distribution's BB84 protocol is given. BB84 protocol is used as the basis for the mechanism. In next phase the proposed mechanism is explained. The proposed mechanism combines BB84 protocol at two levels, from sender to receiver and then from receiver to sender. Moreover, a logic circuit is used to combine the bits hence to reduce the probability of eavesdropping. The key obtained can be used to exchange the information securely further it can help in encryption and decryption of crucial data. Double level BB84 mechanism will help in information reconciliation as well as privacy amplification. In future the proposed mechanism will be very beneficial where unconditional security is required during key and other secret information exchange 	
1209.1236v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1209.1236v1	2012	Coordination of autonomic functionalities in communications networks	Richard Combes|Zwi Altman|Eitan Altman	  Future communication networks are expected to feature autonomic (or self-organizing) mechanisms to ease deployment (self-configuration), tune parameters automatically (self-optimization) and repair the network (self-healing). Self-organizing mechanisms have been designed as stand-alone entities, even though multiple mechanisms will run in parallel in operational networks. An efficient coordination mechanism will be the major enabler for large scale deployment of self-organizing networks. We model self-organizing mechanisms as control loops, and study the conditions for stability when running control loops in parallel. Based on control theory and Lyapunov stability, we propose a coordination mechanism to stabilize the system, which can be implemented in a distributed fashion. The mechanism remains valid in the presence of measurement noise via stochastic approximation. Instability and coordination in the context of wireless networks are illustrated with two examples and the influence of network geometry is investigated. We are essentially concerned with linear systems, and the applicability of our results for non-linear systems is discussed. 	
1309.0400v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.0400v2	2013	Time and probability: From classical mechanics to relativistic Bohmian   mechanics	H. Nikolic	  Bohmian mechanics can be generalized to a relativistic theory without preferred foliation, with a price of introducing a puzzling concept of spacetime probability conserved in a scalar time. We explain how analogous concept appears naturally in classical statistical mechanics of relativistic particles, with scalar time being identified with the proper time along particle trajectories. The conceptual understanding of relativistic Bohmian mechanics is significantly enriched by this classical insight. In particular, the analogy between classical and Bohmian mechanics suggests the interpretation of Bohmian scalar time as a quantum proper time different from the classical one, the two being related by a nonlocal scale factor calculated from the wave function. In many cases of practical interest, including the macroscopic measuring apparatus, the fundamental spacetime probability explains the more familiar space probability as an emergent approximate description. Requiring that the quantum proper time in the classical limit should reduce to the classical proper time, we propose that only massive particles have Bohmian trajectories. An analysis of the macroscopic measuring apparatus made up of massive particles restores agreement with the predictions of standard quantum theory.

One of the widely used "refer-a-friend" mechanisms offers an equal reward to both the referrer and the invitee. This mechanism provides incentives for direct referrals and is fair to the invitee. On the other hand, multi-level marketing and recent social mobilisation experiments focus on mechanisms that incentivise both direct and indirect referrals. Such mechanisms share the reward for inviting a new member among the ancestors, usually in geometrically decreasing shares. A new member receives nothing at the time of joining. We study fairness in multi-level marketing mechanisms. We show how characteristic function games can be used to model referral marketing, show how the canonical fairness concept of the Shapley value can be applied to this setting, and establish the complexity of finding the Shapley value in each class, and provide a comparison of the Shapley value-based mechanism to existing referral mechanisms. 	
1404.0686v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.0686v2	2014	Many body localization and thermalization in quantum statistical   mechanics	Rahul Nandkishore|David A. Huse	  We review some recent developments in the statistical mechanics of isolated quantum systems. We provide a brief introduction to quantum thermalization, paying particular attention to the `Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis' (ETH), and the resulting `single-eigenstate statistical mechanics'. We then focus on a class of systems which fail to quantum thermalize and whose eigenstates violate the ETH: These are the many-body Anderson localized systems; their long-time properties are not captured by the conventional ensembles of quantum statistical mechanics. These systems can locally remember forever information about their local initial conditions, and are thus of interest for possibilities of storing quantum information. We discuss key features of many-body localization (MBL), and review a phenomenology of the MBL phase. Single-eigenstate statistical mechanics within the MBL phase reveals dynamically-stable ordered phases, and phase transitions among them, that are invisible to equilibrium statistical mechanics and can occur at high energy and low spatial dimensionality where equilibrium ordering is forbidden.

The resulting calculus is sound and universal for quantum mechanics. We define the notion of a mutually unbiased qudit theory and study two particular instances of these theories in detail: qudit stabilizer quantum mechanics and Spekkens-Schreiber toy theory for dits. The calculus allows us to analyze the structure of qudit stabilizer quantum mechanics and provides a geometrical picture of qudit stabilizer theory using D-toruses, which generalizes the Bloch sphere picture for qubit stabilizer quantum mechanics. We also use our framework to describe generalizations of Spekkens toy theory to higher dimensional systems. This gives a novel proof that qudit stabilizer quantum mechanics and Spekkens-Schreiber toy theory for dits are operationally equivalent in three dimensions. The qudit pictorial calculus is a useful tool to study quantum foundations, understand the relationship between qubit and qudit quantum mechanics, and provide a novel, high level description of quantum information protocols.

We show that a mechanism is optimal if and only if a measure $\mu$ derived from the buyer's type distribution satisfies certain stochastic dominance conditions. This measure expresses the marginal change in the seller's revenue under marginal changes in the rent paid to subsets of buyer types. As a corollary, we characterize the optimality of grand-bundling mechanisms, strengthening several results in the literature, where only sufficient optimality conditions have been derived. As an application, we show that the optimal mechanism for $n$ independent uniform items each supported on $[c,c+1]$ is a grand-bundling mechanism, as long as $c$ is sufficiently large, extending Pavlov's result for $2$ items [Pavlov'11]. At the same time, our characterization also implies that, for all $c$ and for all sufficiently large $n$, the optimal mechanism for $n$ independent uniform items supported on $[c,c+1]$ is not a grand bundling mechanism. 	
1410.1703v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.1703v2	2016	A Truthful Mechanism for the Generalized Assignment Problem	Salman Fadaei|Martin Bichler	  We propose a truthful-in-expectation, $(1-1/e)$-approximation mechanism for a strategic variant of the generalized assignment problem (GAP). In GAP, a set of items has to be optimally assigned to a set of bins without exceeding the capacity of any singular bin. In the strategic variant of the problem we study, values for assigning items to bins are the private information of bidders and the mechanism should provide bidders with incentives to truthfully report their values. The approximation ratio of the mechanism is a significant improvement over the approximation ratio of the existing truthful mechanism for GAP.   The proposed mechanism comprises a novel convex optimization program as the allocation rule as well as an appropriate payment rule. To implement the convex program in polynomial time, we propose a fractional local search algorithm which approximates the optimal solution within an arbitrarily small error leading to an approximately truthful-in-expectation mechanism. The presented algorithm improves upon the existing optimization algorithms for GAP in terms of simplicity and runtime while the approximation ratio closely matches the best approximation ratio given for GAP when all inputs are publicly known.

Remarkably, little prior work has addressed the problem of mechanism design for team formation, accounting for the need to elicit agents' preferences over potential teammates. Coalition formation in the related hedonic games has received much attention, but only from the perspective of coalition stability, with little emphasis on the mechanism design objectives of true preference elicitation, social welfare, and equity. We present the first formal mechanism design framework for team formation, building on recent combinatorial matching market design literature. We exhibit four mechanisms for this problem, two novel, two simple extensions of known mechanisms from other domains. Two of these (one new, one known) have desirable theoretical properties. However, we use extensive experiments to show our second novel mechanism, despite having no theoretical guarantees, empirically achieves good incentive compatibility, welfare, and fairness.

Neutrino Annihilation Process	Tong Liu|Shu-Jin Hou|Li Xue|Wei-Min Gu	  A neutrino-dominated accretion flow (NDAF) around a rotating stellar-mass black hole (BH) is one of the plausible candidates for the central engine of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Two mechanisms, i.e., Blandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism and neutrino annihilation process, are generally considered to power GRBs. Using the analytic solutions from Xue et al. (2013) and ignoring the effects of the magnetic field configuration, we estimate the BZ and neutrino annihilation luminosities as the functions of the disk masses and BH spin parameters to contrast the observational jet luminosities of GRBs. The results show that, although the neutrino annihilation processes could account for most of GRBs, the BZ mechanism is more effective, especially for long-duration GRBs. Actually, if the energy of afterglows and flares of GRBs is included, the distinction between these two mechanisms is more significant. Furthermore, massive disk mass and high BH spin are beneficial to power high luminosities of GRBs. Finally, we discuss possible physical mechanisms to enhance the disk mass or the neutrino emission rate of NDAFs and relevant difference between these two mechanisms.

Dance	  We consider an infinite horizon dynamic mechanism design problem with interdependent valuations. In this setting the type of each agent is assumed to be evolving according to a first order Markov process and is independent of the types of other agents. However, the valuation of an agent can depend on the types of other agents, which makes the problem fall into an interdependent valuation setting. Designing truthful mechanisms in this setting is non-trivial in view of an impossibility result which says that for interdependent valuations, any efficient and ex-post incentive compatible mechanism must be a constant mechanism, even in a static setting. Mezzetti (2004) circumvents this problem by splitting the decisions of allocation and payment into two stages. However, Mezzetti's result is limited to a static setting and moreover in the second stage of that mechanism, agents are weakly indifferent about reporting their valuations truthfully. This paper provides a first attempt at designing a dynamic mechanism which is efficient, `strict' ex-post incentive compatible and ex-post individually rational in a setting with interdependent values and Markovian type evolution.

Using the mechanical bound state in the continuum, we have found that the mechanical clamping loss can be avoided. The mechanical quality factor of microsphere could be achieved up to 10^8 for a specific radius of the stem, where the different coupling channels between the resonator and supporting stem are orthogonal to each other. Such mechanism is proved to be universal for different geometries and materials, thus can also be generalized to design the high quality mechanical resonators.

In this first paper, we present the definition of a complex scale-covariant time-differential operator and show that mechanics of non-differentiable paths is implemented in the same way as classical mechanics but with the replacement of the time derivative and velocity with the time-differential operator and associated complex velocity. With this, the generalized form of Newton's fundamental relation of dynamics is shown to take the form of a Langevin equation in the case of stationary motion characterized by a null average classical velocity. The numerical integration of the Langevin equation in the case of a harmonic oscillator reveals the same statistics as the stationary solutions of the Schroedinger equation for the same problem. This motivates the second paper which makes the relation to quantum mechanics explicit by discussing the axioms of quantum mechanics in the Scale Relativity framework.

Vanner	  The exploration of wave phenomena and quantum properties of massive systems offers an intriguing pathway to study the foundations of physics and to develop a suite of quantum-enhanced technologies. Here we present an optomechanical scheme to prepare non-Gaussian quantum states of motion of a mechanical resonator using photonic quantum measurements. Our method is capable of generating non-classical mechanical states without the need for strong single-photon coupling, and is resilient against optical loss and initial mechanical thermal occupation. Additionally, our approach provides a route to generate larger mechanical superposition states using effective interactions with multi-photon quantum states. We experimentally demonstrate this technique on a mechanical thermal state in the classical limit and observe interference fringes in the mechanical position distribution that show phase super-resolution. This opens a feasible route to explore and exploit quantum phenomena at a macroscopic scale. 	
1605.00935v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.00935v2	2016	Proposal for a quantum delayed-choice experiment with a spin-mechanical   setup	Peng-Bo Li|Fu-Li Li	  We describe an experimentally feasible protocol for performing a variant of the quantum delayed-choice experiment with massive objects. In this scheme, a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond driven by microwave fields is dispersively coupled to a massive mechanical resonator. A double-pulse Ramsey interferometer can be implemented with the spin-mechanical setup, where the second Ramsey microwave pulse drives the spin conditioned on the number states of the resonator. The probability for finding the NV center in definite spin states exhibits interference fringes when the mechanical resonator is prepared in a specific number state. On the other hand, the interference is destroyed if the mechanical resonator stays in some other number states. The wavelike and particlelike behavior of the NV spin can be superposed by preparing the mechanical resonator in a superposition of two distinct number states. Thus a quantum version of Wheeler's delayed-choice experiment could be implemented, allowing of fundamental tests of quantum mechanics on a macroscopic scale.

Aerodynamic and hydrodynamic drafting, vortice uplift, Bernoulli suction, thermoregulatory coupling, path following, physical hooks, synchronization, and cooperation are only some of the better-known examples. While drafting mechanisms also appear in non-biological systems such as sedimentation and particle vortices, the broad spectrum of these mechanisms appears more diversely in biological systems including bacteria, spermatozoa, various aquatic species, birds, land animals, semi-fluid dwellers like turtle hatchlings, as well as human systems. We present the thermodynamic framework for energy saving mechanisms, and we review evidence in favor of the variation range hypothesis. This hypothesis posits that, as an evolutionary process, the variation range between strongest and weakest group members converges on the equivalent energy saving quantity that is generated by the energy saving mechanism. We also review self-organized structures that emerge due to energy saving mechanisms, including convective processes that can be observed in many systems over both short and long time scales, as well as high collective output processes in which a form of collective position locking occurs.

Many scattered investigations have got involved in these cellular effects, analyzed their relative mechanisms and extended their biomedical uses in magnetic hyperthermia and cell regulation. This review reports these cellular effects and their important applications in biomedical area. More importantly, we highlight the underlying mechanisms behind these direct cellular effects in the review from the thermal energy and mechanical force. Recently, some physical analyses showed that the mechanisms of heat and mechanical force in cellular effects are controversial. Although the physical principle plays an important role in these cellular effects, some chemical reactions such as free radical reaction also existed in the interaction of MNPs with magnetic fields, which provides the possible explanation for the current controversy. It's anticipated that the review here could provide readers a deeper understanding of mechanisms of how MNPs contribute to the direct cellular effects and thus their biomedical applications under various magnetic fields.

Two widely-studied randomized mechanisms in multiagent settings are the Random Serial Dictatorship (RSD) and the Probabilistic Serial Rule (PS). Both mechanisms require only that agents specify ordinal preferences and have a number of desirable economic and computational properties. However, the induced outcomes of the mechanisms are often incomparable and thus there are challenges when it comes to deciding which mechanism to adopt in practice. In this paper, we first consider the space of general ordinal preferences and provide empirical results on the (in)comparability of RSD and PS. We analyze their respective economic properties under general and lexicographic preferences. We then instantiate utility functions with the goal of gaining insights on the manipulability, efficiency, and envyfreeness of the mechanisms under different risk-attitude models. Our results hold under various preference distribution models, which further confirm the broad use of RSD in most practical applications. 	
1704.08017v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.08017v1	2017	Bohmian Mechanics	Roderich Tumulka	  Bohmian mechanics, also known as pilot-wave theory or de Broglie-Bohm theory, is a formulation of quantum mechanics whose fundamental axioms are not about what observers will see if they perform an experiment but about what happens in reality. It is therefore called a "quantum theory without observers." It follows from these axioms that in a universe governed by Bohmian mechanics, observers will see outcomes with exactly the probabilities specified by the usual rules of quantum mechanics for empirical predictions. Specifically, Bohmian mechanics asserts that electrons and other elementary particles have a definite position at every time and move according to an equation of motion that is one of the fundamental laws of the theory and involves a wave function that evolves according to the usual Schr\"odinger equation. Bohmian mechanics is named after David Bohm (1917-1992), who was, although not the first to consider this theory, the first to realize (in 1952) that it actually makes correct predictions. 	
1705.06306v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.06306v1	2017	Deterministic, Strategyproof, and Fair Cake Cutting	Vijay Menon|Kate Larson	  We study the classic cake cutting problem from a mechanism design perspective, in particular focusing on deterministic mechanisms that are strategyproof and fair. We begin by looking at mechanisms that are non-wasteful and primarily show that for even the restricted class of piecewise constant valuations there exists no direct-revelation mechanism that is strategyproof and even approximately proportional. Subsequently, we remove the non-wasteful constraint and show another impossibility result stating that there is no strategyproof and approximately proportional direct-revelation mechanism that outputs contiguous allocations, again, for even the restricted class of piecewise constant valuations. In addition to the above results, we also present some negative results when considering an approximate notion of strategyproofness, show a connection between direct-revelation mechanisms and mechanisms in the Robertson-Webb model when agents have piecewise constant valuations, and finally also present a (minor) modification to the well-known Even-Paz algorithm that has better incentive-compatible properties for the cases when there are two or three agents. 	
1705.07704v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.07704v2	2017	A Regularized Framework for Sparse and Structured Neural Attention	Vlad Niculae|Mathieu Blondel	  Modern neural networks are often augmented with an attention mechanism, which tells the network where to focus within the input. We propose in this paper a new framework for sparse and structured attention, building upon a smoothed max operator. We show that the gradient of this operator defines a mapping from real values to probabilities, suitable as an attention mechanism. Our framework includes softmax and a slight generalization of the recently-proposed sparsemax as special cases. However, we also show how our framework can incorporate modern structured penalties, resulting in more interpretable attention mechanisms, that focus on entire segments or groups of an input. We derive efficient algorithms to compute the forward and backward passes of our attention mechanisms, enabling their use in a neural network trained with backpropagation. To showcase their potential as a drop-in replacement for existing ones, we evaluate our attention mechanisms on three large-scale tasks: textual entailment, machine translation, and sentence summarization. Our attention mechanisms improve interpretability without sacrificing performance; notably, on textual entailment and summarization, we outperform the standard attention mechanisms based on softmax and sparsemax.

It is shown that these mechanisms, at the molecular level, cannot work steadily in terms of classical mechanics. Quantum mechanisms of changes in the genome, based on the long-range interaction potential between biologically important molecules, are proposed as one of possible explanation. Different variants of interactions of the organism and environment based on molecular recognition and leading to new species origins are considered. Experiments to verify the model are proposed. This bio-physical study is completed by the general operational model of based on quantum information theory. The latter is applied to model epigenetic evolution.

Despite the vast literature on this very standard model, it still remains unclear how do truthful mechanisms look like. We focus on the case of two players with additive valuation functions and our purpose is twofold. First, our main result provides a complete characterization of truthful mechanisms that allocate all the items to the players. Our characterization reveals an interesting structure underlying all truthful mechanisms, showing that they can be decomposed into two components: a selection part where players pick their best subset among prespecified choices determined by the mechanism, and an exchange part where players are offered the chance to exchange certain subsets if it is favorable to do so. In the remaining paper, we apply our main result and derive several consequences on the design of mechanisms with fairness guarantees. We consider various notions of fairness, (indicatively, maximin share guarantees and envy-freeness up to one item) and provide tight bounds for their approximability. Our work settles some of the open problems in this agenda, and we conclude by discussing possible extensions to more players.

A classical impossibility result by Myerson and Satterthwaite showed that even with only one seller and one buyer, no Individually Rational (IR), Bayesian Incentive Compatible (BIC) and Budget-Balanced (BB) mechanism can achieve full GFT (trade whenever buyer's value is higher than the seller's cost). On the other hand, they proposed the "second-best" mechanism that maximizes the GFT subject to IR, BIC and BB constraints, which is unfortunately rather complex for even the single-seller single-buyer case. Our mechanism is simple, IR, BIC and BB, and achieves $\frac{1}{2}$ of the optimal GFT among all IR, BIC and BB mechanisms. Our result holds for arbitrary distributions of the buyers' and sellers' values and can accommodate any downward-closed feasibility constraints over the allocations. The analysis of our mechanism is facilitated by extending the Cai-Weinberg-Devanur duality framework to two-sided markets.

Several mechanisms have been proposed to regulate oscillations. One prominent but understudied mechanism is gap-junctional coupling. Gap junctions are ubiquitous in cortex between GABAergic interneurons. Moreover, recent experiments indicate their strength can be modified in an activity-dependent manner, similar to chemical synapses. We hypothesized that activity-dependent gap junction plasticity acts as a mechanism to regulate oscillations in the cortex. We developed a computational model of gap junction plasticity in a recurrent cortical network. We showed that gap junction plasticity can serve as a homeostatic mechanism for oscillations by maintaining a tight balance between two network states: asynchronous irregular activity and synchronized oscillations. This homeostatic mechanism allows for robust communication between neuronal assemblies through two different mechanisms: transient oscillations and frequency modulation. This implies a direct functional role for gap junction plasticity in information transmission in cortex.

Nguyên|Siu Cheung Hui	  Survival analysis studies the statistical properties of the time until an event of interest occurs. It has been commonly used to study the effectiveness of medical treatments or the lifespan of a population. However, survival analysis can potentially leak confidential information of individuals in the dataset. The state-of-the-art techniques apply ad-hoc privacy-preserving mechanisms on publishing results to protect the privacy. These techniques usually publish sanitized and randomized answers which promise to protect the privacy of individuals in the dataset but without providing any formal mechanism on privacy protection. In this paper, we propose private mechanisms for parametric survival analysis with Weibull distribution. We prove that our proposed mechanisms achieve differential privacy, a robust and rigorous definition of privacy-preservation. Our mechanisms exploit the property of local sensitivity to carefully design a utility function which enables us to publish parameters of Weibull distribution with high precision. Our experimental studies show that our mechanisms can publish useful answers and outperform other differentially private techniques on real datasets.

This provides an intriguing platform for the study of fundamental physics and the development of novel quantum devices. Yet, the challenge of reconstructing and verifying the quantum state of mechanical systems has remained a major roadblock in the field. Here, we present a novel approach that allows for tomographic reconstruction of the quantum state of a mechanical system without the need for extremely high quality optical cavities. We show that, without relying on the usual state transfer presumption between light an mechanics, the full optomechanical Hamiltonian can be exploited to imprint mechanical tomograms on a strong optical coherent pulse, which can then be read out using well-established techniques. Furthermore, with only a small number of measurements, our method can be used to witness nonclassical features of mechanical systems without requiring full tomography. By relaxing the experimental requirements, our technique thus opens a feasible route towards verifying the quantum state of mechanical resonators and their nonclassical behaviour in a wide range of optomechanical systems.

Arregui	  We present a method to assess the plausibility of alternative mechanisms to explain the damping of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) transverse waves in solar coronal loops. The considered mechanisms are resonant absorption of kink waves in the Alfv\'en continuum, phase-mixing of Alfv\'en waves, and wave leakage. Our methods make use of Bayesian inference and model comparison techniques. We first infer the values for the physical parameters that control the wave damping, under the assumption of a particular mechanism, for typically observed damping time-scales. Then, the computation of marginal likelihoods and Bayes factors enable us to quantify the relative plausibility between the alternative mechanisms. We find that, in general, the evidence is not large enough to support a single particular damping mechanism as the most plausible one. Resonant absorption and wave leakage offer the most probable explanations in strong damping regimes, while phase mixing is the best candidate for weak/moderate damping. When applied to a selection of 89 observed transverse loop oscillations, with their corresponding measurements of damping times scales and taking into account data uncertainties, we find that only in a few cases positive evidence for a given damping mechanism is available.

Bertacco	  In-vivo, cells are frequently exposed to multiple mechanical stimuli arising from the extracellular microenvironment, with deep impact on many biological functions. On the other hand, current methods for mechanobiology do not allow to easily replicate in-vitro the complex spatio-temporal behavior of such mechanical signals. Here, we introduce a new platform for studying the mechanical coupling between the extracellular environment and the nucleus in living cells, based on active substrates for cell culture made of Fe-coated polymeric micropillars. Under the action of quasi-static external magnetic fields, each group of pillars produces synchronous nano-mechanical stimuli at different points of the cell membrane, thanks to the highly controllable pillars' deflection. This method enables to perform a new set of experiments for the investigation of cellular dynamics and mechanotransduction mechanisms in response to a periodic nano-pinching, with tunable strength and arbitrary temporal shape. We applied this methodology to NIH3T3 cells, demonstrating how the nano-mechanical stimulation affects the actin cytoskeleton, nuclear morphology, H2B core-histone dynamics and MKL transcription-cofactor nuclear to cytoplasmic translocation.

We obtain the close form expression of tunneling time from a rectangular barrier by stationary phase method. We show that tunneling time depends upon the width $b$ of the barrier for $b \to \infty$ and therefore Hartman effect doesn't exist in space fractional quantum mechanics. Interestingly we found that the tunneling time monotonically reduces with increasing $b$. The tunneling time is smaller in space fractional quantum mechanics as compared to the case of standard quantum mechanics. We recover the Hartman effect of standard quantum mechanics as a special case of space fractional quantum mechanics. 	
1801.00676v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.00676v1	2017	The frame of fixed stars in Relational Mechanics	Rafael Ferraro	  Relational mechanics is a gauge theory of classical mechanics whose laws do not govern the motion of individual particles but the evolution of the distances between particles. Its formulation gives a satisfactory answer to Leibniz's and Mach's criticisms of Newton's mechanics: relational mechanics does not rely on the idea of an absolute space. When describing the behavior of small subsystems with respect to the so called "fixed stars", relational mechanics basically agrees with Newtonian mechanics. However, those subsystems having huge angular momenta will deviate from the Newtonian behavior if they are described in the frame of fixed stars. Such subsystems naturally belong to the field of astronomy; they can be used to test the relational theory.

Priority attachment is a mechanism which generalizes previously proposed mechanisms, such as small world creation or preferential attachment, but we also observe its presence in a range of real-world networks. In this paper we show that by using priority attachment we can generate networks of very diverse topologies, as well as recreate empirical networks. An additional advantage of the priority attachment mechanism is an easy interpretation of the latent processes of network formation. We substantiate our claims by performing numerical experiments on synthetic and empirical networks. The two main contributions of the paper are: the introduction of the priority attachment mechanism, and the design of the Priority Rank: a simple network generative model based on the priority attachment mechanism.

Over sixty selected mechanisms are listed for the purpose of quantitative comparisons. Some of these mechanisms may not completely account for all astrophysical observations but are relevant to particular situations such as the solar limb red-shift, the red-shift of quasars or the cosmological red-shift. However, this paper focuses mainly on the 59 mechanisms giving a quantitative description of the cosmological redshift-distance relationship. A description is given for each mechanism including its properties, limits of applicability, functional relationships and comments.

An axiomatisation has recently been proven to be complete for an approximatively universal fragment of quantum mechanics, the so-called Clifford+T fragment. We focus here on the expressive power of this axiomatisation beyond Clifford+T Quantum mechanics. We consider the full pure qubit quantum mechanics, and mainly prove two results: (i) First, the axiomatisation for Clifford+T quantum mechanics is also complete for all equations involving some kind of linear diagrams. The linearity of the diagrams reflects the phase group structure, an essential feature of the ZX-calculus. In particular all the axioms of the ZX-calculus are involving linear diagrams. (ii) We also show that the axiomatisation for Clifford+T is not complete in general but can be completed by adding a single (non linear) axiom, providing a simpler axiomatisation of the ZX-calculus for pure quantum mechanics than the one recently introduced by Ng&Wang.

Voudouris	  When a company undergoes a merger or transfer of its ownership, the existing governing body has an opinion on which buyer should take over as the new owner. Similar situations occur while assigning the host of big sports tournaments, e.g., the World Cup or the Olympics. In all these settings, the values of the external bidders are as important as the internal experts' opinions. Motivated by such questions, we consider a social welfare maximizing approach to design and analyze truthful mechanisms in these settings. We consider the problem with one expert and two bidders and provide tight approximation guarantees of the optimal social welfare. Since this problem is a combination of mechanism design with and without monetary transfers (payments can be imposed to the bidders but not to the expert), classical solutions like VCG cannot be applied, making this a unique mechanism design problem. We distinguish between mechanisms that use ordinal and cardinal information, as well as between mechanisms that base their decisions on one of the two sides (either the bidders or the expert) or both. Our analysis shows that the cardinal setting is quite rich and admits several non-trivial randomized truthful mechanisms, and also allows for closer-to-optimal-welfare guarantees.

Shaat	  Poisson ratio is an important mechanical property that reveals the deformation patterns of materials. A positive Poisson ratio is a feature of the majority of materials. Some materials, however, display auxetic behaviors (i.e. possess negative Poisson ratios). Indeed, auxetic and non-auxetic materials display different deformation mechanisms. Revealing these differences and their effects on the mechanics of these materials is of a significant importance. In this study, effects of Poisson ratio on the mechanics of auxetic and non-auxetic nanobeams are revealed. A parametric study is provided on effects of Poisson ratio on the static bending and free vibration behaviors of auxetic nanobeams. The general nonlocal theory is employed to model the nonlocal effects. Unlike Eringen nonlocal theory, the general nonlocal theory uses different attenuation functions for the longitudinal and lateral strains. This theory can reveal the Poisson ratio-nonlocal coupling effects on the mechanics of nanomaterials. The obtained results showed that Poisson ratio is an essential parameter for determining mechanical behaviors of nanobeams. It is revealed that auxetic and non-auxetic nanobeams may reflect softening or hardening behaviors depending on the ratio of the nonlocal fields of the longitudinal and lateral strains of the beam.

This is done with the introduction of Micro Partitions ; a union of disjoint components in phase space. Partition functions including the invariants, Kolmogorov Entropy and Euler number are introduced. The ergodic hypothesis for partial ergodicity is discussed.   In the context of Quantum Mechanics the presence of symmetry groups with irreducible representations gives rise to degenerate and non degenerate spectrum for the Hamiltonian. Quantum Statistical Mechanics is formulated including these two cases ; by including the multiplicity dimension of the group representation and the Casimir invariants into the Partition function. The possibility of new kinds of phase transitions is discussed.   The occurence of systems with non simply connected configuration spaces and Quantum Mechanics for them, also requires a possible generalisation of Statistical Mechanics. The developments of Quantum pure, mixed, and entangled states has made it neccessary to understand the Statistical Mechanics of the multipartite N particle system. And to obtain in terms of the density matrices, written in energy basis, the Trace of the Gibbs operator as the Partition function and use it to get statistical averages of operators. There are some issues of definition, interpretation and application that are discussed.

Srivastava	  We carry out numerical simulation of a first order phase transition in 2+1 dimensions by randomly nucleating bubbles, and study the formation of global U(1) vortices. Bubbles grow and coalesce and vortices are formed at junctions of bubbles via standard Kibble mechanism as well as due to a new mechanism, recently proposed by us, where defect-antidefect pairs are produced due to field oscillations. We make a comparative study of the contribution of both of these mechanisms for vortex production. We find that, for high nucleation rate of bubbles, vortex-antivortex pairs produced via the new mechanism have overlapping configurations, and annihilate quickly; so only those vortices survive till late which are produced via the Kibble mechanism. However, for low nucleation rates, bubble collisions are energetic enough to lead to many well separated vortex-antivortex pairs being produced via the new mechanism. For example, in a simulation involving nucleation of 20 bubbles, a total of 14 non-overlapping vortices and antivortices formed via this new mechanism of pair creation (6 of them being very well separated), as compared to 6 vortices and antivortices produced via the Kibble mechanism. Our results show the possibility that in extremely energetic bubble collisions, such as those in the inflationary models of the early Universe, this new mechanism may drastically affect the defect production scenario. 	
0004090v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0004090v1	2000	Path Integral Methods and Applications	Richard MacKenzie	  These lectures are intended as an introduction to the technique of path integrals and their applications in physics. The audience is mainly first-year graduate students, and it is assumed that the reader has a good foundation in quantum mechanics. No prior exposure to path integrals is assumed, however.   The path integral is a formulation of quantum mechanics equivalent to the standard formulations, offering a new way of looking at the subject which is, arguably, more intuitive than the usual approaches. Applications of path integrals are as vast as those of quantum mechanics itself, including the quantum mechanics of a single particle, statistical mechanics, condensed matter physics and quantum field theory.   After an introduction including a very brief historical overview of the subject, we derive a path integral expression for the propagator in quantum mechanics, including the free particle and harmonic oscillator as examples. We then discuss a variety of applications, including path integrals in multiply-connected spaces, Euclidean path integrals and statistical mechanics, perturbation theory in quantum mechanics and in quantum field theory, and instantons via path integrals.   For the most part, the emphasis is on explicit calculations in the familiar setting of quantum mechanics, with some discussion (often brief and schematic) of how these ideas can be applied to more complicated situations such as field theory. 	
0312051v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0312051v1	2003	The general structure and ergodic properties of quantum and classical   mechanics: A unified C*-algebraic approach	Rocco Duvenhage	  Quantum mechanics is essentially a statistical theory. Classical mechanics, however, is usually not viewed as being inherently statistical. Nevertheless, the latter can also be formulated statistically. Furthermore, a statistical formulation of both can be expressed in terms of unital C*-algebras, in which case it becomes clear that they have the same general structure, with quantum mechanics a noncommutative generalization of the classical case. In purely mathematical terms it is seen that quantum mechanics is a noncommutative generalization of probability theory. The most important insight in this respect is that the projection postulate of quantum mechanics is a noncommutative conditional probability. This is the subject of Chapter 1 of the thesis.   As ergodic theory (the long term behaviour of a dynamical system) is done in classical probability theory, it is then also done for noncommutative probability theory in Chapter 2. In particular, generalizations of Khintchine's recurrence theorem and a variation thereof for ergodic systems are proved, as well as various characterizations of noncommutative ergodicity.   Lastly, in Chapter 3, recurrence and ergodicity is then investigated from a physical perspective in quantum and classical mechanics, by means of a quantum mechanical analogue of Liouville's Theorem in classical mechanics which was suggested in Chapter 1. 	
0907.2049v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.2049v1	2009	Strategyproof Approximation Mechanisms for Location on Networks	Noga Alon|Michal Feldman|Ariel D. Procaccia|Moshe Tennenholtz	  We consider the problem of locating a facility on a network, represented by a graph. A set of strategic agents have different ideal locations for the facility; the cost of an agent is the distance between its ideal location and the facility. A mechanism maps the locations reported by the agents to the location of the facility. Specifically, we are interested in social choice mechanisms that do not utilize payments. We wish to design mechanisms that are strategyproof, in the sense that agents can never benefit by lying, or, even better, group strategyproof, in the sense that a coalition of agents cannot all benefit by lying. At the same time, our mechanisms must provide a small approximation ratio with respect to one of two optimization targets: the social cost or the maximum cost.   We give an almost complete characterization of the feasible truthful approximation ratio under both target functions, deterministic and randomized mechanisms, and with respect to different network topologies. Our main results are: We show that a simple randomized mechanism is group strategyproof and gives a (2-2/n)-approximation for the social cost, where n is the number of agents, when the network is a circle (known as a ring in the case of computer networks); we design a novel "hybrid" strategyproof randomized mechanism that provides a tight approximation ratio of 3/2 for the maximum cost when the network is a circle; and we show that no randomized SP mechanism can provide an approximation ratio better than 2-o(1) to the maximum cost even when the network is a tree, thereby matching a trivial upper bound of two. 	
0907.2435v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.2435v2	2010	Sequential Posted Pricing and Multi-parameter Mechanism Design	Shuchi Chawla|Jason Hartline|David Malec|Balasubramanian Sivan	  We consider the classical mathematical economics problem of {\em Bayesian optimal mechanism design} where a principal aims to optimize expected revenue when allocating resources to self-interested agents with preferences drawn from a known distribution. In single-parameter settings (i.e., where each agent's preference is given by a single private value for being served and zero for not being served) this problem is solved [Myerson '81]. Unfortunately, these single parameter optimal mechanisms are impractical and rarely employed [Ausubel and Milgrom '06], and furthermore the underlying economic theory fails to generalize to the important, relevant, and unsolved multi-dimensional setting (i.e., where each agent's preference is given by multiple values for each of the multiple services available) [Manelli and Vincent '07]. In contrast to the theory of optimal mechanisms we develop a theory of sequential posted price mechanisms, where agents in sequence are offered take-it-or-leave-it prices. These mechanisms are approximately optimal in single-dimensional settings, and avoid many of the properties that make optimal mechanisms impractical. Furthermore, these mechanisms generalize naturally to give the first known approximations to the elusive optimal multi-dimensional mechanism design problem. In particular, we solve multi-dimensional multi-unit auction problems and generalizations to matroid feasibility constraints. The constant approximations we obtain range from 1.5 to 8. For all but one case, our posted price sequences can be computed in polynomial time. 	
0912.3310v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/0912.3310v2	2011	Frugal and Truthful Auctions for Vertex Covers, Flows, and Cuts	David Kempe|Mahyar Salek|Cristopher Moore	  We study truthful mechanisms for hiring a team of agents in three classes of set systems: Vertex Cover auctions, k-flow auctions, and cut auctions. For Vertex Cover auctions, the vertices are owned by selfish and rational agents, and the auctioneer wants to purchase a vertex cover from them. For k-flow auctions, the edges are owned by the agents, and the auctioneer wants to purchase k edge-disjoint s-t paths, for given s and t. In the same setting, for cut auctions, the auctioneer wants to purchase an s-t cut. Only the agents know their costs, and the auctioneer needs to select a feasible set and payments based on bids made by the agents.   We present constant-competitive truthful mechanisms for all three set systems. That is, the maximum overpayment of the mechanism is within a constant factor of the maximum overpayment of any truthful mechanism, for every set system in the class. The mechanism for Vertex Cover is based on scaling each bid by a multiplier derived from the dominant eigenvector of a certain matrix. The mechanism for k-flows prunes the graph to be minimally (k+1)-connected, and then applies the Vertex Cover mechanism. Similarly, the mechanism for cuts contracts the graph until all s-t paths have length exactly 2, and then applies the Vertex Cover mechanism. 	
1003.2817v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1003.2817v1	2010	Gaussian Approximation Potential: an interatomic potential derived from   first principles Quantum Mechanics	Albert P. Bartók	  Simulation of materials at the atomistic level is an important tool in studying microscopic structure and processes. The atomic interactions necessary for the simulation are correctly described by Quantum Mechanics. However, the computational resources required to solve the quantum mechanical equations limits the use of Quantum Mechanics at most to a few hundreds of atoms and only to a small fraction of the available configurational space. This thesis presents the results of my research on the development of a new interatomic potential generation scheme, which we refer to as Gaussian Approximation Potentials. In our framework, the quantum mechanical potential energy surface is interpolated between a set of predetermined values at different points in atomic configurational space by a non-linear, non-parametric regression method, the Gaussian Process. To perform the fitting, we represent the atomic environments by the bispectrum, which is invariant to permutations of the atoms in the neighbourhood and to global rotations. The result is a general scheme, that allows one to generate interatomic potentials based on arbitrary quantum mechanical data. We built a series of Gaussian Approximation Potentials using data obtained from Density Functional Theory and tested the capabilities of the method. We showed that our models reproduce the quantum mechanical potential energy surface remarkably well for the group IV semiconductors, iron and gallium nitride. Our potentials, while maintaining quantum mechanical accuracy, are several orders of magnitude faster than Quantum Mechanical methods.

Single-molecule experiments with theoretical models have allowed one to gain insight into free energy landscape for chemical bond and/or protein folding. For mechanically induced bond rupture, the bond-rupture kinetics may be governed by loading device. However, the role of loading device on the kinetics of mechanical rupture has been rarely received much attention until recently. In this work, we have theoretically and/or computationally studied the effect of loading-device stiffness on the kinetics of mechanical unfolding. Specifically, we have considered a one-dimensional model for a bond rupture whose kinetics is depicted by Kramers' theory. It is elucidated that the kinetics of bond rupture is determined by force constant of loading device. The Brownian dynamics simulation of a bond rupture is considered in order to validate our theory. It is illustrated that the mean rupture force is dependent on the force constant of a loading device, such that increase in the loading-device stiffness leads to the higher bond rupture force. Moreover, we have taken into account the computational simulation of mechanical unfolding of a small protein, i.e. {\beta}-hairpin. Our simulation shows that unfolding force is highly correlated with the stiffness of a loading device. Our numerical and theoretical studies highlight the significance of a loading device on the kinetics of mechanical unfolding of a chemical bond and/or a folded domain in the single-molecule mechanical experiments.

Because traumatic brain injury (TBI) due to blast exposure has become a prominent medical and military problem, similar thresholds should be identified that can put available research results in context and guide future research toward protecting warfighters as well as diagnosis and treatment. At least three mechanical mechanisms by which the blast wave may result in brain injury have been proposed - a thoracic mechanism, head acceleration and direct cranial transmission. These mechanisms need not be mutually exclusive. In this study, likely regions of interest for the first two mechanisms based on blast characteristics (positive pulse duration and peak effective overpressure) are developed using available data from blast experiments and related studies, including behind-armor blunt trauma and ballistic pressure wave studies. These related studies are appropriate to include because blast-like pressure waves are produced that result in neurological effects like those caused by blast. Results suggest that injury thresholds for each mechanism are dependent on blast conditions, and that under some conditions, more than one mechanism may contribute. There is a subset of blast conditions likely to result in TBI due to head acceleration and/or a thoracic mechanism without concomitant lung injury. These results can be used to guide experimental designs and compare additional data as they become available. Additional data are needed before actual probabilities or severity of TBI for a given exposure can be described.

Our results apply to bidders with valuations that are m matroid rank sums (MRS), which encompass most concrete examples of submodular functions studied in this context, including coverage functions, matroid weighted-rank functions, and convex combinations thereof. Our approximation factor is the best possible, even for known and explicitly given coverage valuations, assuming P != NP. Ours is the first truthful-in-expectation and polynomial-time mechanism to achieve a constant-factor approximation for an NP-hard welfare maximization problem in combinatorial auctions with heterogeneous goods and restricted valuations.   Our mechanism is an instantiation of a new framework for designing approximation mechanisms based on randomized rounding algorithms. A typical such algorithm first optimizes over a fractional relaxation of the original problem, and then randomly rounds the fractional solution to an integral one. With rare exceptions, such algorithms cannot be converted into truthful mechanisms. The high-level idea of our mechanism design framework is to optimize directly over the (random) output of the rounding algorithm, rather than over the input to the rounding algorithm. This approach leads to truthful-in-expectation mechanisms, and these mechanisms can be implemented efficiently when the corresponding objective function is concave. For bidders with MRS valuations, we give a novel randomized rounding algorithm that leads to both a concave objective function and a (1-1/e)-approximation of the optimal welfare.

Spekkens	  How would the world appear to us if its ontology was that of classical mechanics but every agent faced a restriction on how much they could come to know about the classical state? We show that in most respects, it would appear to us as quantum. The statistical theory of classical mechanics, which specifies how probability distributions over phase space evolve under Hamiltonian evolution and under measurements, is typically called Liouville mechanics, so the theory we explore here is Liouville mechanics with an epistemic restriction. The particular epistemic restriction we posit as our foundational postulate specifies two constraints. The first constraint is a classical analogue of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle -- the second-order moments of position and momentum defined by the phase-space distribution that characterizes an agent's knowledge are required to satisfy the same constraints as are satisfied by the moments of position and momentum observables for a quantum state. The second constraint is that the distribution should have maximal entropy for the given moments. Starting from this postulate, we derive the allowed preparations, measurements and transformations and demonstrate that they are isomorphic to those allowed in Gaussian quantum mechanics and generate the same experimental statistics. We argue that this reconstruction of Gaussian quantum mechanics constitutes additional evidence in favour of a research program wherein quantum states are interpreted as states of incomplete knowledge, and that the phenomena that do not arise in Gaussian quantum mechanics provide the best clues for how one might reconstruct the full quantum theory.

Lukin|Amir Yacoby	  The ability to control and manipulate spins via electrical, magnetic and optical means has generated numerous applications in metrology and quantum information science in recent years. A promising alternative method for spin manipulation is the use of mechanical motion, where the oscillation of a mechanical resonator can be magnetically coupled to a spins magnetic dipole, which could enable scalable quantum information architectures9 and sensitive nanoscale magnetometry. To date, however, only population control of spins has been realized via classical motion of a mechanical resonator. Here, we demonstrate coherent mechanical control of an individual spin under ambient conditions using the driven motion of a mechanical resonator that is magnetically coupled to the electronic spin of a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color center in diamond. Coherent control of this hybrid mechanical/spin system is achieved by synchronizing pulsed spin-addressing protocols (involving optical and radiofrequency fields) to the motion of the driven oscillator, which allows coherent mechanical manipulation of both the population and phase of the spin via motion-induced Zeeman shifts of the NV spins energy. We demonstrate applications of this coherent mechanical spin-control technique to sensitive nanoscale scanning magnetometry. 	
1203.1479v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.1479v1	2012	Principles of classical statistical mechanics: A perspective from the   notion of complementarity	L. Velazquez	  Quantum mechanics and classical statistical mechanics are two physical theories that share several analogies in their mathematical apparatus and physical foundations. In particular, classical statistical mechanics is hallmarked by the complementarity between two descriptions that are unified in thermodynamics: (i) the parametrization of the system macrostate in terms of mechanical macroscopic observables $I=\{I^{i}\}$; and (ii) the dynamical description that explains the evolution of a system towards the thermodynamic equilibrium. As expected, such a complementarity is related to the uncertainty relations of classical statistical mechanics $\Delta I^{i}\Delta \eta_{i}\geq k$. Here, $k$ is the Boltzmann's constant, $\eta_{i}=\partial \mathcal{S}(I|\theta)/\partial I^{i}$ are the restituting generalized forces derived from the entropy $\mathcal{S}(I|\theta)$ of a closed system, which is found in an equilibrium situation driven by certain control parameters $\theta=\{\theta^{\alpha}\}$. These arguments constitute the central ingredients of a reformulation of classical statistical mechanics from the notion of complementarity. In this new framework, Einstein postulate of classical fluctuation theory $dp(I|\theta)\sim\exp[\mathcal{S}(I|\theta)/k]dI$ appears as the correspondence principle between classical statistical mechanics and thermodynamics in the limit $k\rightarrow0$, while the existence of uncertainty relations can be associated with the non-commuting character of certain operators. 	
1205.0581v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1205.0581v1	2012	Scalable Mechanisms for Rational Secret Sharing	Varsha Dani|Mahnush Movahedi|Jared Saia	  We consider the classical secret sharing problem in the case where all agents are selfish but rational. In recent work, Kol and Naor show that, when there are two players, in the non-simultaneous communication model, i.e. when rushing is possible, there is no Nash equilibrium that ensures both players learn the secret. However, they describe a mechanism for this problem, for any number of players, that is an epsilon-Nash equilibrium, in that no player can gain more than epsilon utility by deviating from it. Unfortunately, the Kol and Naor mechanism, and, to the best of our knowledge, all previous mechanisms for this problem require each agent to send O(n) messages in expectation, where n is the number of agents. This may be problematic for some applications of rational secret sharing such as secure multi-party computation and simulation of a mediator.   We address this issue by describing mechanisms for rational secret sharing that are designed for large n. Both of our results hold for n > 2, and are Nash equilbria, rather than just epsilon-Nash equilbria.   Our first result is a mechanism for n-out-of-n rational secret sharing that is scalable in the sense that it requires each agent to send only an expected O(log n) bits. Moreover, the latency of this mechanism is O(log n) in expectation, compared to O(n) expected latency for the Kol and Naor result. Our second result is a mechanism for a relaxed variant of rational m-out-of-n secret sharing where m = Theta(n). It requires each processor to send O(log n) bits and has O(log n) latency. Both of our mechanisms are non-cryptographic, and are not susceptible to backwards induction. 	
1206.1084v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.1084v2	2013	Overview of Bohmian Mechanics	Xavier Oriols|Jordi Mompart	  This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the Bohmian formulation of quantum mechanics. It starts with a historical review of the difficulties found by Louis de Broglie, David Bohm, and John S. Bell to convince the scientific community about the validity and utility of Bohmian mechanics. Then, a formal explanation of Bohmian mechanics for nonrelativistic, single-particle quantum systems is presented. The generalization to many-particle systems, where the exchange interaction and the spin play an important role, is also presented. After that, the measurement process in Bohmian mechanics is discussed. It is emphasized that Bohmian mechanics exactly reproduces the mean value and temporal and spatial correlations obtained from the standard, that is the Copenhagen or orthodox, formulation. The ontological characteristics of Bohmian mechanics provide a description of measurements as another type of interaction without the need for introducing the wave function collapse. Several solved problems are presented at the end of the chapter, giving additional mathematical support to some particular issues. A detailed description of computational algorithms to obtain Bohmian trajectories from the numerical solution of the Schrodinger or the Hamilton-Jacobi equations are presented in an appendix. The motivation of this chapter is twofold: first, as a didactic introduction to Bohmian formalism, which is used in the subsequent chapters, and second, as a self-contained summary for any newcomer interested in using Bohmian mechanics in his or her daily research activity. 	
1212.1186v3	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1212.1186v3	2013	The Optimal Mechanism in Differential Privacy	Quan Geng|Pramod Viswanath	  We derive the optimal $\epsilon$-differentially private mechanism for single real-valued query function under a very general utility-maximization (or cost-minimization) framework. The class of noise probability distributions in the optimal mechanism has {\em staircase-shaped} probability density functions which are symmetric (around the origin), monotonically decreasing and geometrically decaying. The staircase mechanism can be viewed as a {\em geometric mixture of uniform probability distributions}, providing a simple algorithmic description for the mechanism. Furthermore, the staircase mechanism naturally generalizes to discrete query output settings as well as more abstract settings. We explicitly derive the optimal noise probability distributions with minimum expectation of noise amplitude and power. Comparing the optimal performances with those of the Laplacian mechanism, we show that in the high privacy regime ($\epsilon$ is small), Laplacian mechanism is asymptotically optimal as $\epsilon \to 0$; in the low privacy regime ($\epsilon$ is large), the minimum expectation of noise amplitude and minimum noise power are $\Theta(\Delta e^{-\frac{\epsilon}{2}})$ and $\Theta(\Delta^2 e^{-\frac{2\epsilon}{3}})$ as $\epsilon \to +\infty$, while the expectation of noise amplitude and power using the Laplacian mechanism are $\frac{\Delta}{\epsilon}$ and $\frac{2\Delta^2}{\epsilon^2}$, where $\Delta$ is the sensitivity of the query function. We conclude that the gains are more pronounced in the low privacy regime.

Mead	  Update: A time-independent $n\times n$ PT-symmetric (and symmetric) Hamiltonian is diagonalizable since it has all distinct real eigenvalues and the resulting diagonal matrix is a real symmetric matrix. The diagonalization results an isometry so there shouldn't be any issue with unitarity and unfortunately this very elementary mathematical fact somehow did not draw the authors' attention. However, PT-symmetric quantum mechanics is not out of trouble. For time-dependent PT-symmetric (and symmetric) Hamiltonians (even $2\times 2$ ones) the authors observed that there is a violation of unitarity. Moreover, the first named author showed in his recent article arXiv:1312.7738 that PT-symmetric quantum mechanics is indeed a certain kind of Hermitian quantum mechanics and that in order for time-evolution to be unitary with respect to $J$-inner product (one that gives rise to a Hilbert space structure on the space of state functions), the potential energy operator $V(x)$ must be real. This means that those complex PT-symmetric Hamiltonians that have been studied by physicists are unfortunately unphysical. The first named author discussed in a subsequent article arXiv:1401.5149 that while finite-state PT-symmetric quantum mechanics with time-independent Hamiltonians is not physically any different from Hermitian quantum mechanics, PT-symmetric quantum mechanics exhibits a distinctive symmetry from that of Hermitian quantum mechanics. 	
1305.6971v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1305.6971v1	2013	Incentive Mechanisms for Internet Congestion Management: Fixed-Budget   Rebate versus Time-of-Day Pricing	Patrick Loiseau|Galina Schwartz|John Musacchio|Saurabh Amin|S. Shankar Sastry	  Mobile data traffic has been steadily rising in the past years. This has generated a significant interest in the deployment of incentive mechanisms to reduce peak-time congestion. Typically, the design of these mechanisms requires information about user demand and sensitivity to prices. Such information is naturally imperfect. In this paper, we propose a \emph{fixed-budget rebate mechanism} that gives each user a reward proportional to his percentage contribution to the aggregate reduction in peak time demand. For comparison, we also study a time-of-day pricing mechanism that gives each user a fixed reward per unit reduction of his peak-time demand. To evaluate the two mechanisms, we introduce a game-theoretic model that captures the \emph{public good} nature of decongestion. For each mechanism, we demonstrate that the socially optimal level of decongestion is achievable for a specific choice of the mechanism's parameter. We then investigate how imperfect information about user demand affects the mechanisms' effectiveness. From our results, the fixed-budget rebate pricing is more robust when the users' sensitivity to congestion is "sufficiently" convex. This feature of the fixed-budget rebate mechanism is attractive for many situations of interest and is driven by its closed-loop property, i.e., the unit reward decreases as the peak-time demand decreases. 	
1310.2977v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.2977v1	2013	Statistical earthquake focal mechanism forecasts	Yan Y. Kagan|David D. Jackson	  Forecasts of the focal mechanisms of future earthquakes are important for seismic hazard estimates and Coulomb stress and other models of earthquake occurrence. Here we report on a high-resolution global forecast of earthquake rate density as a function of location, magnitude, and focal mechanism. In previous publications we reported forecasts of 0.5 degree spatial resolution, covering the latitude range magnitude, and focal mechanism. In previous publications we reported forecasts of 0.5 degree spatial resolution, covering the latitude range from -75 to +75 degrees, based on the Global Central Moment Tensor earthquake catalog. In the new forecasts we've improved the spatial resolution to 0.1 degree and the latitude range from pole to pole. Our focal mechanism estimates require distance-weighted combinations of observed focal mechanisms within 1000 km of each grid point. Simultaneously we calculate an average rotation angle between the forecasted mechanism and all the surrounding mechanisms, using the method of Kagan & Jackson proposed in 1994. This average angle reveals the level of tectonic complexity of a region and indicates the accuracy of the prediction. The procedure becomes problematical where longitude lines are not approximately parallel, and where earthquakes are so sparse that an adequate sample spans very large distances. North or south of 75 degrees, the azimuths of points 1000 km away may vary by about 35 degrees. We solved this problem by calculating focal mechanisms on a plane tangent to the earth's surface at each forecast point, correcting for the rotation of the longitude lines at the locations of earthquakes included in the averaging. The corrections are negligible between -30 and +30 degrees latitude, but outside that band uncorrected rotations can be significantly off.

VCG mechanisms are incentive compatible, direct mechanisms that are efficient (i.e., maximise social utility) and individually rational (i.e., agents prefer to join rather than opt out). However, an important assumption of these mechanisms is that the agents will "always" successfully complete their allocated tasks. Clearly, this assumption is unrealistic in many real-world applications, where agents can, and often do, fail in their endeavours. Moreover, whether an agent is deemed to have failed may be perceived differently by different agents. Such subjective perceptions about an agents probability of succeeding at a given task are often captured and reasoned about using the notion of "trust". Given this background, in this paper we investigate the design of novel mechanisms that take into account the trust between agents when allocating tasks.   Specifically, we develop a new class of mechanisms, called "trust-based mechanisms", that can take into account multiple subjective measures of the probability of an agent succeeding at a given task and produce allocations that maximise social utility, whilst ensuring that no agent obtains a negative utility. We then show that such mechanisms pose a challenging new combinatorial optimisation problem (that is NP-complete), devise a novel representation for solving the problem, and develop an effective integer programming solution (that can solve instances with about 2x10^5 possible allocations in 40 seconds). 	
1402.3877v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.3877v1	2014	Particles, waves and trajectories: 210 years after Young's experiment	A. S. Sanz	  Mermin's "shut up and calculate!" somehow summarizes the most widely accepted view on quantum mechanics. This conception has led to a rather constraining way to think and understand the quantum world. Nonetheless, a closer look at the principles and formal body of this theory shows that, beyond longstanding prejudices, there is still room enough for alternative tools. This is the case, for example, of Bohmian mechanics. As it is discussed here, there is nothing contradictory or wrong with this hydrodynamical representation, which enhances the dynamical role of the quantum phase to the detriment (to some extent) of the probability density. The possibility to describe the evolution of quantum systems in terms of trajectories or streamlines is just a direct consequence of the fact that Bohmian mechanics (quantum hydrodynamics) is just a way to recast quantum mechanics in the more general language of the theory of characteristics. Misconceptions concerning Bohmian mechanics typically come from the fact that many times it is taken out of context and considered as an alternative theory to quantum mechanics, which is not the case. On the contrary, an appropriate contextualization shows that Bohmian mechanics constitutes a serious and useful representation of quantum mechanics, at the same level as any other quantum picture, such as Schr\"odinger's, Heisenberg's, Dirac's, or Feynman's, for instance. To illustrate its versatility, two phenomena will be briefly considered, namely dissipation and light interference. 	
1405.5270v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.5270v1	2014	Two-mode squeezing in an electromechanical resonator	I. Mahboob|H. Okamoto|K. Onomitsu|H. Yamaguchi	  The widespread availability of quantum entanglement with photons, in the guise of two-mode squeezed states, can be attributed to the phenomenon of parametric down-conversion. A reinterpretation of this effect with macroscopic mechanical objects can offer a route towards a purely mechanical entanglement and the unique possibility of probing the quantum mechanical nature of our everyday classical world. In spite of this prospect, mechanical two-mode squeezed states have remained elusive due to the inability to recreate the nonlinear interaction at the heart of this phenomenon in the mechanical domain. To address this we have developed a parametric down-converter, in a mechanical resonator integrated with electrical functionality, which enables mechanical nonlinearities to be dynamically engineered to emulate the parametric down-conversion interaction. In this configuration, phonons are simultaneously generated in pairs in two macroscopic vibration modes which results in the amplification of their motion. In parallel, mechanical two-mode squeezed states are also created which exhibit fluctuations far below the thermal level of their constituent modes as well as harbouring correlations between the modes that become almost perfect as their amplification is increased. This remarkable observation of correlations between two massive phonon ensembles paves the way towards an entangled macroscopic mechanical system at the single phonon level.

Tomamichel|A. Mantri|R. Schmucker|N. McMahon|G. Milburn|S. Wehner	  Quantum mechanics and the theory of gravity are presently not compatible. A particular question is whether gravity causes decoherence - an unavoidable source of noise. Several models for gravitational decoherence have been proposed, not all of which can be described quantum mechanically. In parallel, several experiments have been proposed to test some of these models, where the data obtained by such experiments is analyzed assuming quantum mechanics. Since we may need to modify quantum mechanics to account for gravity, however, one may question the validity of using quantum mechanics as a calculational tool to draw conclusions from experiments concerning gravity.   Here we propose an experiment to estimate gravitational decoherence whose conclusions hold even if quantum mechanics would need to be modified. We first establish a general information-theoretic notion of decoherence which reduces to the standard measure within quantum mechanics. Second, drawing on ideas from quantum information, we propose a very general experiment that allows us to obtain a quantitative estimate of decoherence of any physical process for any physical theory satisfying only very mild conditions.Finally, we propose a concrete experiment using optomechanics to estimate gravitational decoherence in any such theory, including quantum mechanics as a special case.   Our work raises the interesting question whether other properties of nature could similarly be established from experimental observations alone - that is, without already having a rather well formed theory of nature like quantum mechanics to make sense of experimental data.

Michelitsch	  In Misrepair-accumulation theory, we have proposed a Misrepair mechanism for interpreting aging. However, Misrepair mechanism is also important in biological adaptation. Misrepair is a strategy of repair for increasing the surviving chance of an organism when it suffers from severe injuries. As a surviving strategy, Misrepair mechanism plays also an important role in individual adaptation, species survival, and species differentiation. Firstly, Misrepair of an injury is one of the manners of individual adaptation; and Misrepair mechanism gives an organism a great potential in adapting to changeable and destructive environment. Secondly, Misrepair mechanism is important in maintaining and enlarging the diversity of genome DNAs of a species; and a large diversity of genome DNAs is essential for the adaptation and the differentiation of a species in different environments. On one hand, somatic Misrepairs are essential for maintaining the sufficient number of individuals in a species, which are the vectors of different genome DNAs. On the other hand, Misrepair of DNA is a source of DNA mutations and the DNA Misrepairs in germ cells may contribute to the diversity of genome DNAs in a species. In conclusion, Misrepair mechanism is a mechanism essential for individual adaptation, species adaptation, and species evolution.

Buenzli	  Bone's mechanostat theory describes the adaptation of bone tissues to their mechanical environment. Many experiments have investigated and observed such structural adaptation. However, there is still much uncertainty about how to define the reference mechanical state at which bone structure is adapted and stable. Clinical and experimental observations show that this reference state varies both in space and in time, over a wide range of timescales. We propose an osteocyte-based mechanostat theory that links various timescales of structural adaptation with various dynamic features of the osteocyte network in bone. This theory assumes that osteocytes are formed adapted to their current local mechanical environment through modulation of morphological and genotypic osteocyte properties involved in mechanical sensitivity. We distinguish two main types of physiological responses by which osteocytes subsequently modify the reference mechanical state. One is the replacement of osteocytes during bone remodelling, which occurs over the long timescales of bone turnover. The other is cell desensitisation responses, which occur more rapidly and reversibly during an osteocyte's lifetime. The novelty of this theory is to propose that long-lasting morphological and genotypic osteocyte properties provide a material basis for a long-term mechanical memory of bone that is gradually reset by bone remodelling. We test this theory by simulating long-term mechanical disuse (modelling spinal cord injury), and short-term mechanical loadings (modelling daily exercises) with a mathematical model. The consideration of osteocyte desensitisation and of osteocyte replacement by remodelling is able to capture the different phenomena and timescales observed during the mechanical adaptation of bone tissues, lending support to this theory. 	
1211.3201v4	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1211.3201v4	2013	Truthful Mechanism Design for Multidimensional Covering Problems	Hadi Minooei|Chaitanya Swamy	  We investigate {\em multidimensional covering mechanism-design} problems, wherein there are $m$ items that need to be covered and $n$ agents who provide covering objects, with each agent $i$ having a private cost for the covering objects he provides. The goal is to select a set of covering objects of minimum total cost that together cover all the items.   We focus on two representative covering problems: uncapacitated facility location (\ufl) and vertex cover (\vcp). For multidimensional \ufl, we give a black-box method to transform any {\em Lagrangian-multiplier-preserving} $\rho$-approximation algorithm for \ufl to a truthful-in-expectation, $\rho$-approx. mechanism. This yields the first result for multidimensional \ufl, namely a truthful-in-expectation 2-approximation mechanism.   For multidimensional \vcp (\mvcp), we develop a {\em decomposition method} that reduces the mechanism-design problem into the simpler task of constructing {\em threshold mechanisms}, which are a restricted class of truthful mechanisms, for simpler (in terms of graph structure or problem dimension) instances of \mvcp. By suitably designing the decomposition and the threshold mechanisms it uses as building blocks, we obtain truthful mechanisms with the following approximation ratios ($n$ is the number of nodes): (1) $O(r^2\log n)$ for $r$-dimensional \vcp; and (2) $O(r\log n)$ for $r$-dimensional \vcp on any proper minor-closed family of graphs (which improves to $O(\log n)$ if no two neighbors of a node belong to the same player). These are the first truthful mechanisms for \mvcp with non-trivial approximation guarantees. 	
1312.1831v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.1831v2	2014	Welfare Maximization and Truthfulness in Mechanism Design with Ordinal   Preferences	Deeparnab Chakrabarty|Chaitanya Swamy	  We study mechanism design problems in the {\em ordinal setting} wherein the preferences of agents are described by orderings over outcomes, as opposed to specific numerical values associated with them. This setting is relevant when agents can compare outcomes, but aren't able to evaluate precise utilities for them. Such a situation arises in diverse contexts including voting and matching markets.   Our paper addresses two issues that arise in ordinal mechanism design. To design social welfare maximizing mechanisms, one needs to be able to quantitatively measure the welfare of an outcome which is not clear in the ordinal setting. Second, since the impossibility results of Gibbard and Satterthwaite~\cite{Gibbard73,Satterthwaite75} force one to move to randomized mechanisms, one needs a more nuanced notion of truthfulness.   We propose {\em rank approximation} as a metric for measuring the quality of an outcome, which allows us to evaluate mechanisms based on worst-case performance, and {\em lex-truthfulness} as a notion of truthfulness for randomized ordinal mechanisms. Lex-truthfulness is stronger than notions studied in the literature, and yet flexible enough to admit a rich class of mechanisms {\em circumventing classical impossibility results}. We demonstrate the usefulness of the above notions by devising lex-truthful mechanisms achieving good rank-approximation factors, both in the general ordinal setting, as well as structured settings such as {\em (one-sided) matching markets}, and its generalizations, {\em matroid} and {\em scheduling} markets. 	
1504.02056v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.02056v2	2016	A Review of Student Difficulties in Upper-Level Quantum Mechanics	Chandralekha Singh|Emily Marshman	  Learning advanced physics, in general, is challenging not only due to the increased mathematical sophistication but also because one must continue to build on all of the prior knowledge acquired at the introductory and intermediate levels. In addition, learning quantum mechanics can be especially challenging because the paradigms of classical mechanics and quantum mechanics are very different. Here, we review research on student reasoning difficulties in learning upper-level quantum mechanics and research on students' problem-solving and metacognitive skills in these courses. Some of these studies were multi-university investigations. The investigations suggest that there is large diversity in student performance in upper-level quantum mechanics regardless of the university, textbook, or instructor and many students in these courses have not acquired a functional understanding of the fundamental concepts. The nature of reasoning difficulties in learning quantum mechanics is analogous to reasoning difficulties found via research in introductory physics courses. The reasoning difficulties were often due to over-generalizations of concepts learned in one context to another context where they are not directly applicable. Reasoning difficulties in distinguishing between closely related concepts and in making sense of the formalism of quantum mechanics were common. We conclude with a brief summary of the research-based approached that take advantage of research on student difficulties in order to improve teaching and learning of quantum mechanics. 	
1601.02689v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.02689v1	2016	Observation of Strong Radiation Pressure Forces from Squeezed Light on a   Mechanical Oscillator	Jeremy B. Clark|Florent Lecocq|Raymond W. Simmonds|José Aumentado|John D. Teufel	  Quantum enhanced sensing is a powerful technique in which nonclassical states are used to improve the sensitivity of a measurement. For enhanced mechanical displacement sensing, squeezed states of light have been shown to reduce the photon counting noise that limits the measurement noise floor. It has long been predicted, however, that suppressing the noise floor with squeezed light should produce an unavoidable increase in radiation pressure noise that drives the mechanical system. Such nonclassical radiation pressure forces have thus far been hidden by insufficient measurement strengths and residual thermal mechanical motion. Since the ultimate measurement sensitivity relies on the delicate balance between these two noise sources, the limits of the quantum enhancement have not been observed. Using a microwave cavity optomechanical system, we observe the nonclassical radiation pressure noise that necessarily accompanies any quantum enhancement of the measurement precision. By varying both the magnitude and phase of the squeezing, we optimize the fundamental trade-off between mechanical imprecision and backaction noise in accordance with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. As the strength of the measurement is further increased, radiation pressure forces eventually dominate the mechanical motion. In this regime, the optomechanical interaction can be exploited as an efficient quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement of the amplitude fluctuations of the light field. By overwhelming mechanical thermal noise with radiation pressure by two orders of magnitude, we demonstrate a mechanically-mediated measurement of the squeezing with an effective homodyne efficiency of 94%. Thus, with strong radiation pressures forces, mechanical motion enhances the measurement of nonclassical light, just as nonclassical light enhances the measurement of the motion. 	
1610.04395v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.04395v1	2016	A Geometric PID Control Framework for Mechanical Systems	D. H. S. Maithripala|T. W. U. Madhushani|J. M. Berg	  These lectures demonstrate the development of a PID control framework for mechanical systems. Based on the observation that mechanical systems are essentially double integrator systems, we generalize the linear PID controller to mechanical systems that have a non-Euclidean configuration space. Specifically we start by presenting the development of the geometric PID controller for fully actuated mechanical systems and then extend it to a class of under actuated interconnected mechanical systems of practical significance by introducing the notion of feedback regularization. We show that feedback regularization is the mechanical system equivalent to partial feedback linearization. We apply these results for trajectory tracking for several systems of interest in the field of robotics. First, we demonstrate the robust almost-global stability properties of the geometric PID controller developed for fully actuated mechanical systems using simulations and experiments on a multi-rotor-aerial-vehicle. The extension to the class of under actuated interconnected systems allow one to ensure the semi-almost-global locally exponential tracking of the geometric center of a spherical robot on an inclined plane of unknown angle of inclination. The results are demonstrated using simulations for a hoop rolling on an inclined plane and then for a sphere rolling on an inclined plane. The final extension that we present here is that of geometric PID control for holonomically or non-holonomically constrained mechanical systems on Lie groups. The results are demonstrated by ensuring the robust almost global locally exponential tracking of a nontrivial spherical pendulum. 	
1611.04193v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.04193v2	2016	Patterns of Selection of Human Movements III: Energy Efficiency,   Mechanical Advantage, and Walking Gait	Stuart Hagler	  Human movements are physical processes combining the classical mechanics of the human body moving in space and the biomechanics of the muscles generating the forces acting on the body under sophisticated sensory-motor control. One way to characterize movement performance is through measures of energy efficiency that relate the mechanical energy of the body and metabolic energy expended by the muscles. We expect the practical utility of such measures to be greater when human subjects execute movements that maximize energy efficiency. We therefore seek to understand if and when subjects select movements with that maximizing energy efficiency. We proceed using a model-based approach to describe movements which perform a task requiring the body to add or remove external mechanical work to or from an object. We use the specific example of walking gaits doing external mechanical work by pulling a cart, and estimate the relationship between the avg. walking speed and avg. step length. In the limit where no external work is done, we find that the estimated maximum energy efficiency walking gait is much slower than the walking gaits healthy adults typically select. We then modify the situation of the walking gait by introducing an idealized mechanical device that creates an adjustable mechanical advantage. The walking gaits that maximize the energy efficiency using the optimal mechanical advantage are again much slower than the walking gaits healthy adults typically select. We finally modify the situation so that the avg. walking speed is fixed and derive the pattern of the avg. step length and mechanical advantage that maximize energy efficiency.

Moreover, for mechanism design, the stability of Nash equilibrium (NE) is demonstrated by showing convergence of specific pre-designed learning dynamics, rather than for a class of learning dynamics. In this paper we consider two common resource allocation problems: sharing $ K $ infinitely divisible resources among strategic agents for their private consumption (private goods), and determining the level for an infinitely divisible public good with $ P $ features, that is shared between strategic agents. For both cases, we present a distributed mechanism for a set of agents who communicate through a given network. In a distributed mechanism, agents' messages are not broadcast to all other agents as in the standard mechanism design framework, but are exchanged only in the local neighborhood of each agent. The presented mechanisms produce a unique NE and fully implement the social welfare maximizing allocation. In addition, the mechanisms are budget-balanced at NE. It is also shown that the mechanisms induce a game with contractive best-response, leading to guaranteed convergence for all learning dynamics within the Adaptive Best-Response dynamics class, including dynamics such as Cournot best-response, $ k- $period best-response and Fictitious Play. We also present a numerically study of convergence under repeated play, for various communication graphs and learning dynamics.

Sanz	  Since its inception Bohmian mechanics has been generally regarded as a hidden-variable theory aimed at providing an objective description of quantum phenomena. To date, this rather narrow conception of Bohm's proposal has caused it more rejection than acceptance. Now, after 65 years of Bohmian mechanics, should still be such an interpretational aspect the prevailing appraisal? Why not favoring a more pragmatic view, as a legitimate picture of quantum mechanics, on equal footing in all respects with any other more conventional quantum picture? These questions are used here to introduce a pedagogical discussion at an elementary level, suitable for undergraduate students, on how to deal with Bohmian mechanics at present, enhancing its aspect as an efficient and useful picture or formulation to tackle, explore, describe and explain quantum phenomena where phase and correlation (entanglement) are key elements. This discussion is presented through two building blocks. The first block is aimed at briefly revisiting the historical context that gave rise to the appearance of Bohmian mechanics, and how this approach or analogous ones have been used in different physical contexts. This discussion will be used to put aside the traditional hidden-variable issue from a more pragmatic view, which is precisely the aspect of interest from a pedagogical viewpoint at the classroom. The second block focuses on elementary aspects of Bohmian mechanics, illustrating them with an application to a simple model of Young's two-slit experiment. The simplicity of this model allows to understand in an easy way how the information conveyed by the Bohmian formulation relates to other more conventional concepts in quantum mechanics, thus showing the potential interest to introduce this approach in undergraduate quantum mechanics courses as a working tool. 	
1709.06639v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.06639v2	2017	Different interpretations of quantum mechanics make different   predictions in non-linear quantum mechanics, and some do not violate the   no-signaling condition	Bassam Helou|Yanbei Chen	  Nonlinear modifications of quantum mechanics have a troubled history. They were initially studied for many promising reasons: resolving the measurement problem, testing the limits of standard quantum mechanics, and reconciling it with gravity. Two results substantially undermined the credibility of non-linear theories. Some have been experimentally refuted, and more importantly, all deterministic non-linear theories can be used for superluminal communication. However, these results are unconvincing because they overlook the fact that the distribution of measurement results predicted by non-linear quantum mechanics depends on the interpretation of quantum mechanics that one uses. For instance, although the Everett and Copenhagen interpretations agree on the expression of Born's rule for the outcomes of multiple measurements in linear quantum mechanics, they disagree in non-linear quantum mechanics. We present the range of expressions of Born's rule that can be obtained by applying different formulations of quantum mechanics to a class of non-linear quantum theories. We then determine that many do not allow for superluminal communication but only two seem to have a reasonable justification. The first is the Everett interpretation, and the second, which we name causal-conditional, states that a measurement broadcasts its outcome to degrees of freedom in its future light-cone, who update the wavefunction that their non-linear Hamiltonian depends on according to this new information.

The presence of a kinematically metastable retained austenite in bearing steels can significantly affect the macro-mechanical and micro-mechanical material response. Mechanical characterization of metastable austenite is a critical component in accurately capturing the micro-mechanical behavior under typical application loads. Traditional mechanical characterization techniques are unable to discretely quantify the micro-mechanical response of the austenite, and as a result, the computational predictions rely heavily on trial and error or qualitative descriptions of the austenite phase. In order to overcome this, in this present work, we use in-situ neutron diffraction of a uniaxial tension test of an A485 Grade 1 bearing steel specimen. The mechanical response determined from the neutron diffraction analysis was incorporated into a hybrid crystal plasticity finite element model that accounts for the martensite's crystal plasticity and the stress-assisted transformation from austenite to martensite in bearing steels. The modeling response was used to estimate the single crystal elastic constants of the austenite and martensite phases. The results show that using in-situ neutron diffraction coupled with a crystal plasticity model, can successfully predict both the micro-mechanical and macro-mechanical responses of bearing steels while accounting for the martensitic transformation of the retained austenite.

Formation Efficiency of   Hot Jupites from High-eccentricity Mechanisms	Ying Wang|Ji-lin Zhou|Liu hui-gen|Zeyang Meng	  Exoplanets discovered over the last decades have provided a new sample of giant exoplanets, hot Jupiters. For lack of enough materials in current locations of hot Jupiters, they are perceived to form outside snowline. Then, migrate to the locations observed through interactions with gas disks or high-eccentricity mechanisms. We examined the efficiencies of different high-eccentricity mechanisms to form hot Jupiters in near coplaner multi-planet systems. These mechanisms include planet-planet scattering, Kozai-Lidov mechanism, coplanar high-eccentricity migration, secular chaos, as well as other two new mechanisms we find in this work, which can produce hot Jupiters with high inclinations even retrograde. We find Kozai-Lidov mechanism plays the most important role in producing hot Jupiters among these mechanisms. Secular chaos is not the usual channel for the formation of hot Jupiters due to the lack of angular momentum deficit within 10^7 Tin (periods of the inner orbit). According to comparisons between the observations and simulations, we speculate that there are at least two populations of hot Jupiters. One population migrates into the boundary of tidal effects due to interactions with gas disk, such as ups And b, WASP-47 b and HIP 14810 b. These systems usually have at least two planets with lower eccentricities, and keep dynamical stable in compact orbital configurations. Another population forms through high-eccentricity mechanisms after the excitation of eccentricity due to dynamical instability. This kind of hot Jupiters usually has Jupiterlike companions in distant orbits with moderate or high eccentricities.

The quantum mechanical results can be then recovered by taking expectations in our pathwise statements.

Sardanashvily	  In Lagrangian mechanics, Noether conservation laws including the energy one are obtained similarly to those in field theory. In Hamiltonian mechanics, Noether conservation laws are issued from the invariance of the Poincare-Cartan integral invariant under one-parameter groups of diffeomorphisms of a configuration space. Lagrangian and Hamiltonian conservation laws need not be equivalent.

This article gives its more algebraic definition and show what is the essential of the submanifold quantum mechanics from an algebraic viewpoint.

Skrinnikov	  Time dependent dynamics of the chaotic quantum-mechanical system has been studied. Irreversibility of the dynamics is shown. It is shown, that being in the initial moment in pure quantum-mechanical state, system makes irreversible transition into mixed state. Original mechanism of mixed state formation is offered. Quantum kinetic equation is obtained. Growth of the entropy during the evolution process is estimated.

Staudt	  A short overview of the direct reaction mechanism and the models used for the analysis of such processes is given. Nuclear reactions proceeding through the direct mechanism and involved in solar hydrogen burning are discussed. The significance of these nuclear reactions with respect to the solar neutrino problem is investigated. 	
9802046v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/9802046v1	1998	Contact geometry in Lagrangean mechanics	Pavol Severa	  We present a picture of Lagrangean mechanics, free of some unnatural features (such as complete divergences). As a byproduct, a completely natural U(1)-bundle over the phase space appears. The correspondence between classical and quantum mechanics is very clear, e.g. no topological ambiguities remain. Contact geometry is the basic tool. 	
9805024v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/9805024v1	1998	Statistical Mechanics in a Nutshell	Jochen Rau	  I give a concise introduction to some essential concepts of statistical mechanics:   1. Probability theory (constrained distributions, concentration theorem, frequency estimation, hypothesis testing);   2. Macroscopic systems in equilibrium (macrostate, thermodynamic variables, entropy, first law, thermodynamic potentials, correlations);   3. Linear response (Kubo formula).

Entropy driven intermittency	Giovanni Gallavotti	  We present a review of the chaotic hypothesis and discuss its applications to intermittency in statistical mechanics and fluid mechanics proposing a quantitative definition. Entropy creation rate is interpreted in terms of certain intermittency phenomena. An attempt to a theory of the experiment of Ciliberto-Laroche on the fluctuation law is presented. 	
0701096v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0701096v1	2007	Classical Analytical Mechanics and Entropy Production	J. Silverberg|A. Widom	  The usual canonical Hamiltonian or Lagrangian formalism of classical mechanics applied to macroscopic systems describes energy conserving adiabatic motion. If irreversible diabatic processes are to be included, then the law of increasing entropy must also be considered. The notion of entropy then enters into the general classical mechanical formalism. The resulting general formulation and its physical consequences are explored.

Lacasta	  An inchworm processive mechanism is proposed to explain the motion of dimeric molecular motors such as kinesin. We present here preliminary results for this mechanism focusing on observables like mean velocity, coupling ratio and efficiency versus ATP concentration and the external load F. 	
9502013v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/9502013v1	1995	Intrinsic and operational observables in quantum mechanics	B. G. Englert|K. Wodkiewicz	  The concept of intrinsic and operational observables in quantum mechanics is introduced. In any realistic description of a quantum measurement that includes a macroscopic detecting device, it is possible to construct from the statistics of the recorded raw data a set of operational quantities that correspond to the intrinsic quantum mechanical observable. 	
9709056v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/9709056v1	1997	Quantum mechanics and elements of reality inferred from joint   measurements	Adan Cabello|Guillermo Garcia-Alcaine	  The Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen argument on quantum mechanics incompleteness is formulated in terms of elements of reality inferred from joint (as opposed to alternative) measurements, in two examples involving entangled states of three spin-1/2 particles. The same states allow us to obtain proofs of the incompatibility between quantum mechanics and elements of reality. 	
9711056v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/9711056v1	1997	A new stochastic interpretation of quantum mechanics	Robert Alicki	  The reinterpretation of quantum mechanical formalism in terms of a classical model with a continuous material "$\Psi$-field" acting upon a point-like particle which is subjected to large friction and random forces is proposed. This model gives a mechanism for sudden "quantum jumps" and provides a simple explanation of "Schr\"odinger Cat" phenomena. 	
9712047v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/9712047v1	1997	Quantum Mechanics is Either Non-Linear Or Non-Introspective	Tristan Hübsch	  The measurement conundrum seems to have plagued quantum mechanics for so long that impressions of an inconsistency amongst its axioms have spawned.   A demonstration that such purported inconsistency is fictitious may then be in order and is presented here.   An exclusion principle of sorts emerges, stating that quantum mechanics cannot be simultaneously linear and introspective (self-observing).

Antoine Suarez	  A new possible version of multisimultaneous causality is proposed, and real experiments allowing us to decide between this view and quantum mechanical retrocausation are further discussed. The interest of testing quantum mechanics against as many nonlocal causal models as possible is stressed.

Guang-jiong Ni	  Why does the $i=\sqrt{-1}$ appear essentially in the quantum mechanics? Why are there operators and noncommutativity (the uncertainty relation) in the quantum mechanics? Why are these two aspects closely related and indivisible? In probing these problems, a new point of view is proposed tentatively. 	
9804076v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/9804076v1	1998	Hamiltonian Formalism in Quantum Mechanics	Boris A. Kupershmidt	  Heisenberg motion equations in Quantum mechanics can be put into the Hamilton form. The difference between the commutator and its principal part, the Poisson bracket, can be accounted for exactly. Canonical transformations in Quantum mechanics are not, or at least not what they appear to be; their properties are formulated in a series of Conjectures.

Comments, Answers, and the Causal   Indistinguishability Condition	Antoine Suarez	  We discuss a number of comments on quant-ph/9801061, and propose to introduce the concept of 'Causal Indistinguishability'. The incompatibility between Quantum Mechanics and Nonlocal Causality appears to be unavoidable: upholding of Quantum Mechanics by experiment would mean to live with influences backward in time, just as we are now living with such faster than light. 	
9811047v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/9811047v1	1998	Maximally Causal Quantum Mechanics	S. M. Roy	  We present a new causal quantum mechanics in one and two dimensions developed recently at TIFR by this author and V. Singh. In this theory both position and momentum for a system point have Hamiltonian evolution in such a way that the ensemble of system points leads to position and momentum probability densities agreeing exactly with ordinary quantum mechanics. 	
9906047v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/9906047v1	1999	The Best Copenhagen Tunneling Times	M. Abolhasani|M. Golshani	  Recently, people have caculated tunneling's characteristic times within Bohmian mechanics. Contrary to some characteristic times defined within the framework of the standard interpretation of quantum mechanics, these have reasonable values. Here, we introduce one of available definitions for tunnelling's characteristic times within the standard interpretation as the best definition that can be accepted for the tunneling times. We show that, due to experimental limitations, Bohmian mechanics leads to same tunneling times.

Helm	  The classical behaviour of a macroscopic system consisting of a large number of microscopic systems is derived in the framework of the Bohmian interpretation of quantum mechanics. Under appropriate assumptions concerning the localization and factorization of the wavefunction it is shown explicitly that the center of mass motion of the system is determined by the classical equations of motion.

Maric| Belgrade| Serbia	  The generalized h-dependent operator algebra is defined ($0\leq h \leq h_o$). For h= h_o it becomes equivalent to the quantum mechanical algebra of observables and for h=0 it is equivalent to the classical one. We show this by proposing how the main features of both mechanics can be defined in operator form. 	
9912019v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/9912019v1	1999	Quantum Mechanics as Information Fusion	George Chapline	  We provide evidence that quantum mechanics can be interpreted as a rational algorithm for finding the least complex description for the correlations in the outputs of sensors in a large array. In particular, by comparing the self-organization approach to solving the Traveling Salesman Problem with a solution based on taking the classical limit of a Feynman path integral, we are led to a connection between the quantum mechanics of motion in a magnetic field and self-organized information fusion.

Capdequi-Peyranere	  Supersymmetry applied to quantum mechanics has given new insights in various topics of theoretical physics like analytically solvable potentials, WKB approximation or KdV solitons. Duality plays a central role in many supersymmetric theories such as Yang-Mills theories or strings models. We investigate the possible existence of some duality within supersymmetric quantum mechanics.

Lindstrom	  We present a general method to derive the classical mechanics of a system of identical particles in a way that retains information about quantum statistics. The resulting statistical mechanics can be interpreted as a classical version of Haldane's exclusion statistics.

The results enable us further to discuss, and to explain the validity of, the equivalence principle in non-relativistic quantum mechanics.

Viglione|Giuseppe Vitiello	  The decoherence mechanism signals the limits beyond which the system dynamics approaches the classical behavior. We show that in some cases decoherence may also signal the limits beyond which the system dynamics has to be described by quantum field theory, rather than by quantum mechanics.

Its usefulness for adiabatic transitions in two energy level systems is also mentioned.

Morandi	  We argue here that, as it happens in Classical and Quantum Mechanics, where it has been proven that alternative Hamiltonian descriptions can be compatible with a given set of equations of motion, the same holds true in the realm of Statistical Mechanics, i.e. that alternative Hamiltonian descriptions do lead to the same thermodynamical description of any physical system.

C. de la Torre	  Only the position representation is used in introductory quantum mechanics and the momentum representation is not usually presented until advanced undergraduate courses. To emphasize the relativity of the representations of the abstract formulation of quantum mechanics, two examples of representations related to the operators aX+(1-a)P and (XP+PX)/2 are presented.

First, I fulfill Andrei Khrennikov's request that I comment on his "Vaxjo Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics," contrasting it with my own present view of the subject matter. Second, I try to paint an image of the hopeful vistas an information-based conception of quantum mechanics indicates. 	
0206016v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0206016v1	2002	The Dirac Equation in Classical Statistical Mechanics	G. N. Ord	  The Dirac equation, usually obtained by `quantizing' a classical stochastic model is here obtained directly within classical statistical mechanics. The special underlying space-time geometry of the random walk replaces the missing analytic continuation, making the model `self-quantizing'. This provides a new context for the Dirac equation, distinct from its usual context in relativistic quantum mechanics.

Mondragon	  We emphasize that there is no spin-statistics connection in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. In several recent papers, including Phys. Rev. A 67, 042102 (2003) [quant-ph/0207017], quantum mechanics is modified so as to force a spin-statistics connection, but the resulting theory is quite different from standard physics.

Our scenario involves a `pretend world' with a `pretend' Heisenberg who seeks to construct a dynamical theory of probabilities and is lead -- seemingly inevitably -- to the Principles of Quantum Mechanics.

This modified quantum mechanics is shown to arise naturally from a fully discrete physics, where all physical quantities are discrete rather than continuous. I compare this theory with the spontaneous collapse theories of Ghirardi, Rimini, Weber and Pearle and discuss some implications of the theory for a realist view of the quantum realm.

Smolin	  It has been suggested that the ability of quantum mechanics to allow secure distribution of secret key together with its inability to allow bit commitment or communicate superluminally might be sufficient to imply the rest of quantum mechanics. I argue using a toy theory as a counterexample that this is not the case. I further discuss whether an additional axiom (key storage) brings back the quantum nature of the theory.

The Schr\"{o}dinger equation in this picture is derived and its solution is examined. We also investigate the close relationship between the moving picture and the Hamilton-Jacobi theory in classical mechanics.

We point out that quantum mechanics can be derived from the invariance of this line element in the canonical formulation. The canonical formulation of quantum statistical mechanics is also discussed.

Timofeevskaya	  In this paper we present a solution of the Einstein's boxes paradox by modern Quantum Mechanics in which a notion of density matrix is equivalent to a notion of a quantum state of a system. We use a secondary quantization formalism in the attempt to make a description particularly clear. The aim of this paper is to provide pedagogical help to the students of quantum mechanics.

One method shows that we can formulate the solution of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation from linear canonical transformations, the other focuses on the generating function which satisfies the Hamilton-Jacobi equation in classical mechanics. We also show that these two methods lead to the same solution of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation.

Orlin Grabbe	  This essay gives a self-contained introduction to quantum game theory, and is primarily oriented to economists with little or no acquaintance with quantum mechanics. It assumes little more than a basic knowledge of vector algebra. Quantum mechanical notation and results are introduced as needed. It is also shown that some fundamental problems of quantum mechanics can be formulated as games. 	
0606121v1	http://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0606121v1	2006	On connection between classical and quantum mechanics	Daniel Sepunaru	  We discuss an alternative version of non- relativistic Newtonian mechanics in terms of a real Hilbert space mathematical framework. It is demonstrated that the physics of this scheme correspondent with the standard formulation. Heisenberg-Schrodinger non-relativistic quantum mechanics is considered adequate and complete. Since the suggested theory is dispersion free, linear superposition principle is not violated but cannot affect results of measurements due to spectral decomposition theorem for self-adjoint operators (the collapse of wave function).

Bell called ``unromantic'': spontaneous wave function collapse and Bohmian mechanics. I discuss some of their merits and report about recent progress concerning extensions to quantum field theory and relativity. In the last section, I speculate about an extension of Bohmian mechanics to quantum gravity.

Sardanashvily	  Geometric (Schrodinger) quantization of nonrelativistic mechanics with respect to different reference frames is considered. In classical nonrelativistic mechanics, a reference frame is represented by a connection on a configuration space fibered over a time axis. Under quantization, it yields a connection on the quantum algebra of Schrodinger operators. The operators of energy with respect to different reference frames are examined.

Apt|Arantza Estévez-Fernández	  In the customary VCG (Vickrey-Clarke-Groves) mechanism truth-telling is a dominant strategy. In this paper we study the sequential VCG mechanism and show that other dominant strategies may then exist. We illustrate how this fact can be used to minimize taxes using examples concerned with Clarke tax and public projects.

We prove that the effective transition probability satisfies (local) detailed balance condition. This enables us to rigorously determine precise form of the transition probability when barrier potentials have certain regularity and symmetry.

Herminghaus	  The impact dynamics between wet surfaces, which dominates the mechanical properties of wet granular matter, is studied both experimentally and theoretically. It is shown that the hysteretic formation and rupture of liquid capillary bridges between adjacent grains accounts reasonably well for most relevant cases of wet granular matter. The various dissipation mechanisms are discussed with particular emphasis on their relevance. Variations of the rupture energy loss with the impact energy are quantified and discussed.

We construct microcanonical and canonical ensemble theory in noncommutative spaces. We consider for illustration some basic and important examples in the framework of noncommutative statistical mechanics : (i). An electron in a magnetic field. (ii). A free particle in a box. (iii).

Navakas	  Processes of mixing and segregation in a packed bed of granular material stirred by a periodically moving rectangular bar are simulated by the discrete element method (DEM). Influence of mechanical properties of the particle material (dynamic friction coefficient, density, elastic modulus) on the segregation intensity is researched. Dynamic friction coefficient was found to have the most noticeable influence to the segregation intensity.

In 1930, few years after Heisenberg, Erwin Schrodinger generalized the famous Uncertainty Relation in Quantum Mechanics, making it more precise than the original. The present study discusses recent generalizations of Schrodinger's work and explains why his paper remains almost forgotten in the last century.

Singh|Chul-Hong Park	  We elucidate a mechanism for obtaining polar behavior in magnetic perovskites based on A-site disorder and demonstrate this mechanism by density functional calculations for the double perovskite (La,Lu)MnNiO$_6$ with Lu concentrations at and below 50%. We show that this material combines polar behavior and ferromagnetism. The mechanism is quite general and may be applicable to a wide range of magnetic perovskites.

Chu	  We illustrate schematically a possible traversing along the path of trefoil-type and $8_{18}$ knots during a specific time period by considering a quantum-mechanic system which satisfies a specific kind of phase dynamics of quantum mechanics. This result is relevant to the composite particle which is present in the initial or final configuration.

Muñoz Díaz	  Classically time is kept fixed for infinitesimal variations in problems in mechanics. Apparently, there appears to be no mathematical justification in the literature for this standard procedure. This can be explained canonically by unveiling the intrinsic mathematical structure of time in Lagrangian mechanics. Moreover, this structure also offers a general method to deal with inertial forces.

Namely, we show that this transformation corresponds to the inversion of the Klein model of Lobachevsky space (non-compact complex projective plane). We also extend this picture to the N=2k superconformal mechanics described in terms of Lobachevsky superspace.

The classical reinterpretation is then used to demonstrate that it successfully reproduces a sufficient condition for cooling schedule in classical simulated annealing, which has the inverse-logarithmic scaling.

Beshtoev	  The aim of this work was to answer the question: Is the direct physical realization of the Higgs mechanism possible? It is shown that this mechanism cannot have a direct physical realization since the condition for this realization is not fulfilled. It means that if in the new collider at CERN a scalar particle is detected, it does not mean that it is a Higgs particle.

Cattani	  In this work we study the Ramsauer-Townsend effect.First, we use the Quantum Mechanical Formalism of Schrodinger. After, it is calculated with the Quantum Mechanical Formalism of de Broglie-Bohm. In this case, we use the Kostin equation, taking into account the energy dissipation of the electrons scattered by sharp edged potential wells.

As a result, we elegantly recover the N=4 supersymmetric mechanics with spin degrees of freedom which was recently constructed in arXiv:0812.4276. This observation underscores the exceptional role played by the ``root'' supermultiplet in N=4 supersymmetric mechanics.

We follow Schr\"{o}dinger's original idea and go beyond this analogy by changing over from the Hamilton's principal function $S$ to the wave function $\Psi$. We thus travel from classical to quantum mechanics through optics.

Skrebnev	  Based on the general thought that mechanics cannot be absolutely exact, supported by pulsed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments on the reversal of time in spin systems, we postulate existence of a probability which do not follow from the Schroudinger equation, or X-probability. It is shown that the X-probability allows explain irreversibility of evolution of macrosystems, and also creates a basis for using probabilistic methods in statistical mechanics and for deliverance from the mechanical determinism.

This leads to some interesting results, and the scheme is extended to the generalized no-signalling boxes framework. Some questions are raised about the use of counterfactual reasoning in quantum mechanics.

Novello	  A mechanism in which gravity is the responsible for the generation of the mass of scalar bosons and fermions was proposed recently [arXiv:1003.5126]. The purpose of the present paper is to extend this scheme to vector bosons. The main characteristic of this mechanism is that the gravitational field acts really as a catalyzer, once the final expression of the mass we obtained depends neither on the intensity of the gravitational field nor on the value of Newton's constant.

Lehnert	  We present an overview of experimental work to embed high-Q mesoscopic mechanical oscillators in microwave and optical cavities. Based upon recent progress, the prospect for a broad field of "cavity quantum mechanics" is very real. These systems introduce mesoscopic mechanical oscillators as a new quantum resource and also inherently couple their motion to photons throughout the electromagnetic spectrum.

Tsallis	  The established technique of eliminating upper or lower parameters in a general hypergeometric series is profitably exploited to create pathways among confluent hypergeometric functions, binomial functions, Bessel functions, and exponential series. One such pathway, from the mathematical statistics point of view, results in distributions which naturally emerge within nonextensive statistical mechanics and Beck-Cohen superstatistics, as pursued in generalizations of Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics.

The concept of wave function itself implies the openness of quantum system. We show that quantum mechanics describes the quantum correlation, i.e., entanglement, and information in a new kind of space, tangnet T^2, where exist the basic quantum structure of qubit and the universal out-in symmetry. This work tries to form a new view to the fundamental problems of the foundation of quantum mechanics.

The simulation basically consists in a cellular automaton embedded in a synchronous environment which defines global discrete instants and broadcast events. The implementation shows how a simulation of fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics can be obtained from the synchronous parallel combination of a small number of elementary components.

Cattani	  We will show for undergraduate and graduate students of physics that Quantum Mechanics is an incomplete and non-local theory. The problem of non-locality is discussed by analyzing the Bell's theorem where are considered correlations between measurements results performed on physical systems that are far apart, but that interacted in the past. The experimental violations of Bell's theorem show a very general result thatquantum phenomena are nonlocal and that, inevitably, Quantum Mechanics is non-local.

Furthermore, by using an algorithmic stage mechanism, this amendment holds in the macro world too.

Silenko	  It is shown that, under the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation conditions, using the Foldy-Wouthuysen representation allows the problem of finding a classical limit of relativistic quantum mechanical equations to be reduced to the replacement of operators in the Hamiltonian and quantum mechanical equations of motion by the respective classical quantities.

1305.2446v2	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1305.2446v2	2014	Approximately Optimal Mechanisms for Strategyproof Facility Location:   Minimizing $L_p$ Norm of Costs	Itai Feigenbaum|Jay Sethuraman|Chun Ye	  We consider the problem of locating a single facility on the real line. This facility serves a set of agents, each of whom is located on the line, and incurs a cost equal to his distance from the facility. An agent's location is private information that is known only to him. Agents report their location to a central planner who decides where to locate the facility. The planner's objective is to minimize a "social" cost function that depends on the agent-costs. However, agents might not report truthfully; to address this issue, the planner must restrict himself to {\em strategyproof} mechanisms, in which truthful reporting is a dominant strategy for each agent. A mechanism that simply chooses the optimal solution is generally not strategyproof, and so the planner aspires to use a mechanism that effectively {\em approximates} his objective function. In our paper, we study the problem described above with the social cost function being the $L_p$ norm of the vector of agent-costs. We show that the median mechanism (which is known to be strategyproof) provides a $2^{1-\frac{1}{p}}$ approximation ratio, and that is the optimal approximation ratio among all deterministic strategyproof mechanisms. For randomized mechanisms, we present two results. First, we present a negative result: we show that for integer $\infty>p>2$, no mechanism---from a rather large class of randomized mechanisms--- has an approximation ratio better than that of the median mechanism. This is in contrast to the case of $p=2$ and $p=\infty$ where a randomized mechanism provably helps improve the worst case approximation ratio. Second, for the case of 2 agents, we show that a mechanism called LRM, first designed by Procaccia and Tennenholtz for the special case of $L_{\infty}$, provides the optimal approximation ratio among all randomized mechanisms.

The metallic seals have an air leak rate of 1.1 x 10-3 cm3atm/m2/day, and mechanical shear strength higher than 8.9 MPa.

We show that all such mechanisms obtain a constant fraction of the optimal welfare at any equilibrium of bidder behavior, via a smoothness argument. This unifies numerous recent results on the price of anarchy of simple auctions.

An alternative formulation in an extended phase space could preserve both principles, but Bell's theorems show that a distribution of probability in a space of local variables can not reproduce the quantum correlations.   An extended phase space is defined in an alternative formulation of Quantum Mechanics. Quantum states are represented by a complex va\-lued distribution of amplitude, so that Bell's theorems do not apply.
