Abstract 

In this paper, the mechanism of fault pressurization in rapid slip events is analyzed on 

the  basis  of  a  complete  characterization  of  the  thermo-poro-mechanical  behavior  of  a 

clayey gouge extracted at 760m depth in Aigion fault in the active seismic zone of the 

Gulf  of  Corinth,  Greece.  It  is  shown  that  the  thermally  collapsible  character  of  this 

clayey gouge can be responsible for a dramatic reduction of effective stress and a full 

fluidization of the material. The thickness of the ‘ultra localized’ zone of highly strained 

material  is  a  key  parameter  that  controls  the  competing  phenomena  of  pore  pressure 

increase  leading  to  fluidization  of  the  fault  gouge  and  temperature  increase  leading  to 

pore fluid vaporization.

Introduction 

The  interest  of  the  interactions  between  circulating  fluids  and  fault  mechanics  with 

particular  focus  on  the  hydro-thermo-mechanical  couplings  has  been  renewed  in  the 

geophysics  community  during  the  recent  years.  Active  fault  drilling  operations  of  the 

Geological  Survey  of  Japan  at  Nojima  Hirabayashi  (Otsuki  et  al.,  2003)  and  of  the 

Corinth  Rift  Laboratory  at  Aigion  (Cornet  et  al.,  2004a)  have  put  emphasis  on  the 

collection of core samples from the fault zones in order to study the material properties 

(strength,  permeability,  porosity)  of  fault  gouge  and  the  effect  of  pore  pressure  and 

temperature in earthquake rupture processes. 

Shear heating tends to increase pore pressure and to decrease the effective compressive 

stress  and  the  shearing  resistance  of  the  fault  material  (Lachenbruch,  1980,  Mase  and 

Smith,  1985,  Wibberley  and  Shimamoto,  2005,  Rice,  2005a,b).  On  the  other  hand 

dilatancy tends to decrease pore pressure. Such couplings have been studied thoroughly 

in a recent paper of Garagash and Rudnicki (2003). Fault zones are often characterized 

by large amounts of clay minerals, which form well-defined structures and orientations 

within the fault zone. These clay minerals inside the fault gouge are widely believed to 

affect significantly the mechanical behaviour of faults since as is the case for normally 

consolidated clays, they tend to contract when heated.  

Within  the  frame  of  the  ‘CRL’  (Corinth  Rift  Laboratory)  project  centred  on  the  south 

western sector of the Gulf of Corinth (http://www.corinth-rift-lab.org), fault zone cores 

from the active Aigion fault have been collected continuously from depths between 708

m  to  782  m.  As  part  of  the  project,  our  work  was  focused  on  the  thermo-poro-

mechanical characterization of fault gouge from the Aigion well.  

The  Gulf  of  Corinth  is  the  most  seismically  active  zone  in  Europe  and  the  fastest 

opening area of continental break-up, with up to 1.5 cm/year of north–south extension 

and  more  than  1  mm/year  of  uplift  of  the  southern  shore  (Tselentis  and  Makropoulos, 

1986). A detailed analysis of the geological structure of the studied area is presented in 

the  recent  paper  of  Micarelli  et  al.  (2003).  During  drilling  in  the  active  Aigion  fault, 

cuttings  were  collected,  and  geophysical  logs,  including  borehole  imaging  and  sonic 

logs, as well as vertical seismic profiles, were completed. This has provided material for 

a  detailed  lithological  and  structural  investigation  of  the  formations  intersected  by  the 

well  presented  in  the  paper  of  Rettenmaier  et  al.  (2004).  The  Aigion  fault  was 

intercepted at a depth of 760m, dipping at an angle of about 60°. The heart of the fault is 

a zone of clay-rich material derived from radiolarites about 1m long (Fig. 1). Above and 

below, brecciated limestones constitute the heavily damaged zone. The thickness of this 

zone is 3 m above the Aigion fault and 9 m below (Daniel et al., 2004).  

Preliminary  results  from  mechanical  laboratory  analyses  on  specimens  taken  from  the 

Aigion fault core have been presented in previous papers (Sulem et al., 2004, 2005). In 

this  paper,  special  attention  is  paid  to  the  transport  properties  of  the  clayey  core  and 

temperature  effects.  Vardoulakis  (2002a,b)  has  demonstrated  the  importance  of 

thermally collapsible and thermally softening clay on the overall dynamic thermo-poro-

mechanical  behaviour  of  clay-rich  gouges.  The  sensitive  parameter  for  the  description 

of  the  thermo-poro-mechanical  coupling  is  the  thermal  expansion  coefficient  of  the 

material.  Possible  collapse  of  the  clay  under  thermal  loading  may  activate  fluid 

pressurisation inside the fault and lead to substantial reduction of the apparent friction.

The experimental data from the Aigion fault core are used in an analysis of the dynamic 

thermo-poro-elasto-plastic behaviour of a rapidly deforming shear band. It is shown that 

shear  heating  and  fluid  pressurisation  is  a  possible  mechanism  leading  to  full 

fluidization of the material inside the shear band.  

Thermo-poro-mechanical characterisation of clayey gouge 

As reports from the drilling site confirm, the clayey gouge which was extracted from the 

Aigion  fault  is  a  remarkably  soft  material,  (see  Fig.  2).  Most  probably  this  is  because 

this  material  was  continuously  loaded  and  unloaded  during  aseismic  and  seismic 

movements  of  the  fault.  Thus  it  is  expected  that  the  effect  of  remoulding  due  to 

sampling  is  of  lesser  importance,  as  long  as  the  density  and  the  water  contents  of  the 

samples  are  preserved  for  testing.  Once  the  Aegion  fault  core  was  taken  from  the 

borehole,  it  was  stored  for  few  days  on  site  and  then  it  was  transported  to  the  Soil 

Mechanics Laboratory of Ecole Nationale de Ponts et Chaussées, where it was stored in 

a  room  with  controlled  temperature  and  humidity.  Obviously  it  was  not  possible  to 

avoid partial drying of the core during extraction, storage and transportation but then it 

was regularly wetted as soon as it was stored in good conditions.  As it was not possible 

to  use  in  the  experiments  the  same  saturation  fluid  as  in  situ,  we  have  used 

demineralized water in which a certain amount of particles from the sample have been 

placed  during  24  hours.  The  mixture  has  been  then  filtered  and  the  resulting  fluid  has 

been used for the saturation of the tested samples. This technique is commonly used in 

soil  testing  to  avoid  any  chemical  influence  of  the  saturation  fluid  on  the  mechanical 

properties of the tested material.

Rapid Fault Shearing, Int. J. Numer. Anal. Meth. Geomech., 2007; 31:523–540. 

The in situ density of the material is reasonably retrieved by applying the in situ stresses 

onto the sample. As results from direct stress measurements inside the borehole are not 

available  at  present,  the  in  situ  state  of  stress  has  to  be  estimated.  Assuming  that  the 

density of the overburden is 2500 kg/m3, we estimate a total vertical stress of about 19 

MPa  for  a  depth  of  760m,  which  in  turn  corresponds  to  an  effective  vertical  stress  of 

11.4 MPa. 

Oedometric test 

The  oedometer  test  is  commonly  used  in  Soil  Mechanics  practice  to  measure 

compressibility.  Here  for  completeness  we  outline  the  basic  concepts  of  this  test:  A 

fluid-saturated  cylindrical  specimen  is  confined  latterly  by  a  stiff  metal  ring  and  the 

specimen  is  stressed  along  vertical  axis.  Due  to  the  lateral  rigid  confinement  of  the 

specimen  the  strains  in  horizontal  directions  are  suppressed.  Porous  stones  are 

employed on the top and bottom of the specimen in order to permit the free drainage of 

the pore-fluid in or out of the specimen. During the test the vertical load is applied in 

small increments. For  each load increment the vertical deformation of the specimen is 

monitored using displacement gauges. Assuming that the grains of the solid constituent 

are incompressible all volume changes are attributed to changes in the voids ratio of the 

specimen  and  are  directly  linked  with  the  extrusion  of  the  pore-fluid  from  the  pore-

space.  Thus  we  relate  the  change  in  the  voids  ratio  of  the  specimen  ∆e  with  the 

volumetric strain εv:

where e0 is the initial voids ratio. 

The  commonly  observed  non-linear  stress-strain  response  of  a  soft  geomaterial  in 

oedometric  compression  makes  it  more  convenient  to  plot  the  void  ratio  versus  the 

effective  vertical  stress 

vσ′   in  a  logarithmic  scale  because.  As  was  first  observed  by 

Terzaghi  (1943),  at  large  stresses  the  corresponding  curve  becomes  a  straight  line,  so 

that a unique parameter, the so-called compression index

is  sufficient  to  characterize  the  compressibility  of  the  material  over  a  wide  range  of 

stresses. Similarly one is defining upon unloading the so-called swelling index Cs . 

In  Fig.  2a  we  see  the  results  from  oedometric  compression  tests  performed  on  a 

saturated  sample  using  a  high-pressure  oedometer  The  measured  compression  index 

Cc=0.11 is typical of a sandy clay. The oedometric test allows the determination of the 

isothermal compressibility coefficient.

By applying the principles of the consolidation theory commonly used in geotechnical

pumping  degassed-deionised  water  on  a  sample  of  the  red  clay  material  Song  et  al. 

(2004) have obtained ranges of 0.9 to 2 × 10-18 m2. This result is consistent with those 

published  in  the  literature.  For  example  for  the  Nojima  fault,  Lockner  et  al.  (2000) 

obtain a permeability of about 10-19 m2 in the center of the shear zone; the same order of 

magnitude  is  obtained  by  Wibberley  and  Shimamoto  (2003)  for  the  Median  Tectonic 

Line Fault, Japan.  

Strength parameters from drained triaxial compression tests 

Drained triaxial compression tests have been performed at room temperature (22°C) and 

at 70°C, and at 8, 16 and 18 MPa confining pressure, on samples of the clayey gouge. 

The corresponding stress-strain curves are shown on Fig. 3a,b.  

At  room  temperature,  for  the  test  at  8  MPa  confining  pressure,  the  loading  phase  was 

interrupted at an axial strain of 7.2 % corresponding to a deviatoric stress of 9.9 MPa. 

This  deviatoric  stress  is  actually  less  than  the  stress  at  which  failure  occurs.  Thus  the 

same  sample  could  be  used  for  another  experiment  if  loaded  at  a  different  higher

pressure. For the tests at 16 MPa and 18 MPa, the material was compacting and reached 

the  critical  state  (i.e.  for  zero  dilatancy)  for  a  maximum  friction  angle  of  φ=27.9°.  In 

triaxial  compression  the  maximum  friction  angle  is  computed  from  the  peak  stress  of 

the loading curve as (Vardoulakis & Sulem 1995)

where σr is the radial stress (confining pressure) and σz is the maximum axial stress. 

The dilatant behaviour which occurs at the end of the test at 18 MPa of confinement is 

attributed to the occurrence of shear-banding in the sample. 

The  frictional  resistance  at  critical  state  of  the  material  increases  slightly  with 

temperature and strain rate. The triaxial experiment run at 70°C at the same strain rate 

as the ones at room temperature (

) yielded a maximum friction angle of 29°. 

As  shown  in  Fig.  4b  changes  in  the  strain  rate  during  the  test  show  also  some 

rate  sensitivity  for  the  frictional  resistance,  with  deviatoric  stress  increasing  with  an 

increased strain rate and decreasing with a decreased strain rate.    

Drained thermal loading of the clayey gouge 

In order to study the effect of temperature on the volumetric behaviour of the material, 

two  heating  tests  of  drained  speciments  have  been  performed  under  isotropic  stress 

conditions. For each test, the sample is first loaded isotropically to its final stress state in 

drained conditions and at constant room temperature. Then, keeping the isotropic stress 

constant, the sample was heated in drained conditions at a rate of 0.02°C/minute up to a 

maximum of temperature change of 32°C. The experimental results are shown in Fig. 4.

The two tests show a good reproducibility and show also that the final state of isotropic 

stress is not influencing the response.  

The important result from these experiments is that the clay-rich material is contracting 

when  heated.  This  phenomenon  represents  a  thermo-plastic  or  structural  collapse.  The

Application to shear heating and fluid pressurization during seismic slip 

We  consider  a  rapidly  deforming  and  long  shear  band  of  thickness  dB  consisting  of 

water-saturated  material  soil.  Inside  such  a  shear-band  the  pore-pressure  p(t,z),  the 

temperature Τ(t,z) and the velocity v(t,z) are assumed to be functions only of time t and 

of position z in the direction normal to the band (Figure 5).

Momentum balance equation 

The  momentum  balance  equation  is  restricted  in  this  study  to  the  one-dimensional 

formulation  in  the  z-direction  as  the  length  scales  in  the  direction  parallel  to  the  fault 

over which the mechanical fields vary are much larger than in the direction normal to it. 

The 1D-momentum balance equation reads as

(16) 

 

As discussed by Rice (2006), the effect of even large accelerations like several times the 

acceleration  of  the  gravity  g  is  insignificant  over  the  small  length  scales  in  the  z-

direction normal to the fault where the heat and fluid diffusion process are taking place 

during  rapid  slip  and  very  high  values  of  pressure  and  temperature  gradients.  For 

example, assuming an acceleration of 10g and a specific mass of the material of 2500 

kg/m3 would result in a change of 2.5×10-2 MPa/m for τ. The relevant length scale in z-

direction is only few mm and thus the variation for τ can be neglected and mechanical 

equilibrium can be assumed.

Consequently, as the shear stress is constant in space, the Coulomb friction law cannot 

be assumed to be met in all deforming regions unless the pore-pressure is also constant 

in space as it is the case in the undrained adiabatic limit.

The undrained adiabatic limit 

A  significant  simplification  of  the  mathematical  model  arises  if  one  neglects  the 

diffusion  of  heat  in  the  surroundings  of  the  rapidly  deforming  shear-band.  This  case 

corresponds to the so-called adiabatic limit. The model may be simplified further if one 

neglects pore-pressure diffusion as well, which corresponds to the 'undrained' limit. The 

undrained adiabatic limit is applicable as soon as the slip event is sufficiently  rapid and 

the  shear  zone  broad  enough  to  effectively  preclude  heat  or  fluid  transfer.  Another 

idealized  situation  is  met  if  one  assumes  that  the  shear  zone  is  infinitely  small.  This 

situation corresponds to the model of slip on a plane for which an analytical solution has 

been  proposed  by  Rice  (2005,  2006).  These  two  extreme  cases  provide  good  first 

approximations of the phenomenon. However, as shown by Rice (2006), the solution of 

slip on a plane overestimates the temperature field, and on the other hand, the adiabatic 

and undrained solution appears to be unstable for localization.  

 

The  set  of  coupled  governing  equations  for  adiabatic,  undrained  shear  for  0 ≤  z ≤  h/2 

and t >0 reads as follows

The results of the evolution of the temperature and of the effective stress are shown on 

Fig. 6 as a function of the normalized displacement u/(h/2) for a slip velocity of 1m/s. 

Assuming that the density of the overburden is 2500 kg/m3, we estimate a total vertical 

stress of about 19 MPa for a depth of 760m, which in turn corresponds to an effective 

vertical stress of 11.4 MPa. 

A key parameter is the actual shear-band thickness. It appears that in the clayey core of 

the  fault  zone,  an  ‘ultra-localized’  zone  of  highly  strained  material  is  formed.  The 

thickness of this zone is of the order of tenths of a millimetre despite a much wider fault 

zone  (Cocco  and  Rice,  2002).  Thus  slip  at  a  centimetre  scale  can  actually  induce 

fluidization of the material inside the shear-band. 

Effect of fluid and heat diffusion 

Rice  (2005)  has  shown  that  the  above  homogeneous  undrained  adiabatic  solution  is 

actually  unstable  in  the  sense  that  small  spatial  non-uniformities  with  wave  lengths 

greater than a critical value grow exponentially with time. For the typical values of the  

thermo-poro-mechanical parameters of the considered gouge, it can be shown that this 

critical  wave  length  is  of  the  order  of  few  tens  of  mm  which  is  comparable  to  the

Note  that  for  a  rock  in  the  elastic  range,  the  pressurization  coefficient  is  given  by 

equation  (A16)  in  Appendix  1.  With  typical  values  of  compressibility  and  thermal 

expansion  coefficient  of  rock  and  water  at  great  depth,  it  is  obtained  that  the  ‘elastic’ 

pressurization  coefficient  is  not  negligible  and  has  values  between  0.3  and  1  (Rice 

2006). For a clayey gouge at relatively low depth (760m), thermal collapse is the only 

mechanism of fluid pressurization. 

Far  field  boundary  conditions  correspond  to  the  initial  temperature  of  28°C  and  total 

stress of 19 MPa.

,  i.e.  full  fluidization  of  the  gouge),  is  reached  after 

0.13s  of  shearing.  We  observe  that,  as  expected,  the  increase  of  temperature  is  more 

important than in case of undrained adiabatic shearing.  

If we assume a shear band thickness which is twice smaller (h=0.5mm), then computed 

results show that vaporization of the pore fluid occurs (Fig. 8). This state is reached at 

t=1.4s for which p=17MPa and T=356°C. Note that fluid vaporization is possible only if 

it is assumed that the soil is not fully saturated. 

We  would  like  to  emphasize  here  that  in  these  computations  the  coefficient  of 

pressurization Λ was assumed to be constant. We have no experimental data about the 

thermal  collapse  of  clayey  soils  at  high  temperatures.  We  might  expect  that  the 

pressurization  coefficient  will  decrease  with  increasing  temperature  due  to  the  limited 

amount of structural water that can be released when heated.

Conclusion 

In  rapid  fault  shearing  of  clay-rich  faults  the  effects  of  pore-water  heating  and 

consequent  pore-pressure  rise  cannot  be  disregarded.  The  Aigion  fault  gouge,  where 

extracted  from  the  Aigion  fault  at  a  depth  of  760  m,  is  a  clay-rock  mixture.  The 

experimental characterization program performed on cores of this material demonstrates 

that  although  the  clay  fraction  is  relatively  small,  it  has  a  significant  influence  on  the 

thermo-mechanical  properties  of  the  material.  The  clayey  core  of  the  fault  has  a  very 

low fluid permeability and exhibits contractant volumetric behaviour when heated. The 

sensitive  parameter  for  the  description  of  the  thermo-poro-mechanical  coupling  is  the 

thermal  pressurisation  coefficient  of  the  material.  It  was  found  that  at  a  nominal 

effective  stress  corresponding  to  760  m  deep  conditions,  this  coefficient  is  about  0.1 

MPa/°C. An analysis of undrained and adiabatic shearing of a thin layer of this clayey 

gouge  has  shown  that  shear  heating  and  fluid  pressurization  is  a  possible  mechanism 

leading  to  full  fluidization  of  the  material  inside  the  shear  band.  A  numerical  solution 

including  heat  and  fluid  diffusion  has  also  been  proposed.  It  has  been  shown  that  the 

thickness of the shear band is a key parameter for the competing effects of fluidization 

of the gouge or vaporization of the pore fluid. 

We  emphasize  the  fact  that  the  parameters  used  in  the  analysis  are  the ones  of  a  fault 

gouge at 760 m depth. The actual nature and rheology of materials at seismogenic depth 

is a challenging question that can only be answered in the future by ultra-deep drilling.

Appendix 1 

Thermal volume changes of saturated clay soils 

 

When  temperature  is  increased  in  drained  conditions,  a  normally  consolidated  clayey 

soil  exhibits  an  irreversible  contraction.  This  thermal  contraction  is  related  to 

physicochemical clay-water interactions based on the change in thickness of the double 

layer with an increase in temperature promoting eventually a breakdown of the adsorbed 

water. In undrained conditions the pore pressure  may develop as the result of heating. 

Experimental results reported by Hueckel and Pellegrini, 1991, have shown the failure 

of  samples  heated  from  70  to  90°C  under  undrained  conditions  with  a  constant  stress 

deviator.   

On the phenomenological level the thermal strain of normally consolidated clays can be 

considered  with  the  frame  of  thermoplastic  hardening  theory  (e.g.  Baldi  et  al.  1988, 

Hueckel and Baldi, 1990, Sultan et al. 2002.) 

The  deformation  of  the  clay  skeleton  can  be  described  using  a  thermoelastic  law.  The 

collapse of  adsorbed water results in the rearrangement of  the internal structure of the 

soil  skeleton  which  causes  an  irreversible  volume  reduction  which  can  describe  using 

thermoplasticity.     

 The porous space of a clay can be seen as a double porosity network. The fluid mass m 

per unit volume of porous medium (in the reference state) can be written as the sum of 

the mass of the free water mf and the mass of the ‘structural’ water ma. The structural 

water  is  bonded  to  the solid  mineral  surfaces  by  physico-chemical  forces.  The  density 

and the thermal expansion of the structural water are different from that of bulk water.

The  incremental  volume  of  drained  water  is  the  difference  between  the  water  volume 

change and the volume change of the total porous space.

In  equation  (A11)  α  is  the  drained  thermal  expansion  coefficient  of  the  saturated  soil 

and αs is the thermal expansion coefficient of the solid fraction. This coefficient can be 

positive or negative depending on the over-consolidation ratio of the clayey soil.

In an undrained heating test the pore fluid pressurization can be deduced from equations 

(A7) and (A13) (with dm = 0) assuming that the mass of structural water released in the 

heating process is not affected by the drainage conditions. This assumption is consistent 

with the experimental observation that the volumetric strain during heating of normally 

consolidated clay is not affected by the stress level.

The  elastic  pore  volume  compressibility 

nβ   can  be  expressed  in  terms  of  the 

compressibility of the material c and of the solid grains cs using the equations of linear 

thermo-poro-elasticity (Mc Tigue, 1986, Rice, 2006)
