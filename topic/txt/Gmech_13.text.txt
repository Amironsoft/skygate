1427 	 a novel model for prediction of crack propagation in gas transmission pipelines |abstract    in this study, a numerical model for the fracture analysis of gas pipelines is developed  we propose a novel model for analysis of slow and fast rates of fatigue crack propagation  the boundary element method by taking the displacement correlation techniques is implemented to compute the stress intensity factor for an existing crack  the proposed model is based on the nonlinear finite element method as a strong computational tool which can be used for fracture and fatigue analyses in gas pipelines  a fortran based finite element in-house code is developed and used in this study    introduction    recently, the initiation and growth rate of crack propagation in both brittle and ductile materials in pipelines have received considerable attention  the ductile fracture is associated with a relatively large plastic zone at the tip of an existing crack while this zone is significantly small in brittle materials  it should be noted that the size of the plastic zone in a crack propagation analysis is proportional to the initial and current length of an existing crack  the failure mechanism always starts with slow-rate crack propagation and ends with a catastrophic failure when the crack propagation rate is significantly high    developing a numerical model in order to estimate the crack growth rate in pressurized pipelines (for a dynamic internal pressure) is of crucial importance  in fact, any fatigue issues or catastrophic failures in a pipeline structure is because of the existence of small micro-cracks in the system (due to manufacturing cares, etc )  in order to control the crack growth rate, normally materials with improved physical and mechanical properties and better resistance to brittle fracture can be used  however environmental factors such as ground and ambient temperatures, humidity, and operating loads also play important roles in crack initiation and growth stages  [1,2] | 
150633-pa 	 well/wormhole model of cold heavy-oil production with sand |summary   cold heavy-oil production with sand (chops) is a nonthermalheavy-oil-recovery technique used primarily in the heavy-oil belt in easternalberta, canada, and western saskatchewan, canada  under chops, typicalrecovery factors are between 5 and 15%, with the average being less than 10% this leaves approximately 90% of the oil in the ground after the processbecomes uneconomic, making chops wells and fields prime candidates forenhanced-oil-recovery (eor) follow-up process field optimization  chops wellsshow an enhancement in production rates compared with conventional primaryproduction, which is explained by the formation of high-permeability channelsknown as wormholes  the formation of wormholes has been shown to exist inlaboratory experiments as well as field experiments conducted with fluoresceindyes  the major mechanisms for chops production are foamy oil flow, sandfailure (or fluidization), and sand production  foamy oil flow aids inmobilizing sand and reservoir fluids, leading to the formation of wormholes foamy oil behavior cannot be effectively modeled by conventionalpressure/volume/temperature (pvt) behavior  here, a new well/wormhole model forchops is proposed  the well/wormhole model uses a kinetic model to deal withfoamy oil behavior, and sand is mobilized because of sand failure determined bya minimum fluidization velocity  the individual wormholes are modeled in asimulator as an extension of a production well  the model grows thewell/wormhole dynamically within the reservoir according to a growth criterionset by the fluidization velocity of sand along the existing well/wormhole  ifthe growth criterion is satisfied, the wormhole extends in the appropriatedirection; otherwise, production continues from the existing well/wormholeuntil the criterion is met  the proposed model incorporates sand production andreproduces the general production behavior of a typical chops well | 
154246-pa 	 development of an efficient embedded discrete fracture model for 3d compositional reservoir simulation in fractured reservoirs |summary   many naturally fractured reservoirs around the world have depletedsignificantly, and improved-oil-recovery (ior) processes are necessary forfurther development  hence, the modeling of fractured reservoirs has receivedincreased attention recently  accurate modeling and simulation of naturallyfractured reservoirs (nfrs) is still challenging because of permeabilityanisotropies and contrasts  nonphysical abstractions inherent in conventionaldual-porosity and dual-permeability models make them inadequate for solvingdifferent fluid-flow problems in fractured reservoirs  also, recenttechnologies for discrete fracture modeling may suffer from large simulationrun times, and the industry has not used such approaches widely, even thoughthey give more-accurate representations of fractured reservoirs thandual-continuum models  we developed an embedded discrete fracture model (dfm)for an in-house compositional reservoir simulator that borrows the dual-mediumconcept from conventional dual-continuum models and also incorporates theeffect of each fracture explicitly  the model is compatible with existingfinite-difference reservoir simulators  in contrast to dual-continuum models,fractures have arbitrary orientations and can be oblique or vertical, honoringthe complexity of a typical nfr  the accuracy of the embedded dfm is confirmedby comparing the results with the fine-grid, explicit-fracture simulations fora case study including orthogonal fractures and a case with a nonalignedfracture  we also perform a grid-sensitivity study to show the convergence ofthe method as the grid is refined  our simulations indicate that to achieveaccurate results, the embedded discrete fracture model may only requiremoderate mesh refinement around the fractures and hence offers acomputationally efficient approach  furthermore, examples of waterflooding, gasinjection, and primary depletion are presented to demonstrate the performanceand applicability of the developed method for simulating fluid flow innfrs | 
154334-pa 	 double-layer expansion: is it a primary mechanism of improved oil recovery by low-salinity waterflooding? |summary   literature review shows that improved oil recovery (ior) by low-salinity waterflooding could be attributed to several mechanisms, such as sweep-efficiency improvement, interfacial-tension (ift) reduction, multicomponent ionic exchange, and electrical-double layer (edl) expansion  although these mechanisms might contribute to ior by low-salinity water, they may not be the primary mechanism  therefore, the main objective of this study is to investigate if the mechanism of edl expansion could be the principal reason for ior during low-salinity waterflooding  low-salinity water results in a thicker edl when compared to high-salinity water, so we tried to eliminate the effect of low-salinity brines on double-layer expansion to show to what extent ior is related to edl expansion caused by low-salinity water  the double-layer expansion is dependent on the electric surface charge, which is a function of the ph of brine; therefore, the ph levels of low-salinity brines were decreased in this study to provide low-salinity brines that can produce a thinner edl, similar to high-salinity brines  zeta-potential measurements were performed on both rock/brine and oil/brine interfaces to demonstrate the effect of brine ph and salinity on edl  contact angle and coreflood experiments were conducted to test different brine salinities at different ph values, which could assess the effect of water salinity and ph on rock wettability and oil recovery, and hence involvement of edl expansion in the ior process  zeta-potential results in this study showed that decreasing the ph of low-salinity brines makes the electrical charges at both oil/ brine and brine/rock interfaces slightly negative, which reduces the double-layer expansion caused by low-salinity brine  as a result, the rock becomes more oil-wet, which was confirmed by contact-angle measurements  moreover, coreflood experiments indicated that injecting low-salinity brine at lower ph values recovered smaller amounts of oil when compared to the original ph because of the elimination of the low-salinity-water effect on the thickness of the double layer  in conclusion, this study demonstrates that expansion of the double layer is a dominant mechanism of oil-recovery improvement by low-salinity waterflooding | 
154939-pa 	 experimental investigation of fracturing-fluid migration caused by spontaneous imbibition in fractured low-permeability sands |summary   during hydraulic-fracturing operations in low-permeability formations, spontaneous imbibition of fracturing fluid into the rock matrix is believed to have a significant impact on the retention of water-based fracturing fluids in the neighborhood of the induced fracture  this may affect the post-fracturing productivity of the well  however, there is lack of direct experimental and visual evidence of the extent of fluid retention, evolution of the resulting imbibing-fluid front, and how they relate to potential productivity hindrance  in this paper, laboratory experiments have been carefully designed to represent the vicinity of a hydraulic fracture  the evolution of fracturing fluid leakoff is monitored as a function of space and time by use of x-ray computed tomography (ct)  the x-ray ct imaging technique allows us to map saturations at controlled time intervals to monitor the migration of fracturing fluid into the reservoir formation  it is generally expected for low-permeability formations (5 to 10 md) to show strong capillary forces because of their small characteristic pore radii, but this driving mechanism is in competition with the low permeability and spatial heterogeneities found in low-permeability sands  the relevance of capillarity as a driver of fluid migration and retention in a low-permeability sand sample is interpreted visually and quantified and compared with high-permeability berea sandstone in our experiments  it is seen that although low-permeability sands are subject to strong capillary forces, the effect can be suppressed by the low permeability of the formation and the heterogeneous nature of the sample  nevertheless, saturation values attained as a result of spontaneous imbibition are comparable with those obtained for high-permeability samples  leakoff of fracturing fluids during the shut-in period of a well can result in delayed gas flowback and can hinder gas production  results from this investigation are expected to provide fundamental insight regarding critical variables affecting the retention and migration of water-based fracturing fluids in the neighborhood of hydraulic fractures, and consequently affecting the post-fracturing productivity of the well | 
155640-pa 	 new analytical model for predicting the unstable zone around the borehole |summary   in this study, a new analytical model, which is computationally lower in cost than current numerical methods, is presented to calculate the radius of the plastic zone around the borehole in underbalanced drilling (ubd) to prevent borehole instability  with this model, it is also possible to analytically calculate the optimal drilling-mud weight, which is the amount of mud weight with no plastic zone  the presented model is based on the mouhr–coulomb failure criterion  the model can be used in both vertical and inclined wells and in poroelastic formations with anisotropic horizontal stresses  predictions from the model provide a reasonable match to the field data and numerical solution results | 
156876-pa 	 evaluation of induced thermal pressurization in clearwater shale caprock in electromagnetic steam-assisted gravity-drainage projects |summary   inductive methods, such as electromagnetic steam-assisted gravity drainage(em-sagd), have been identified as technically and economically feasiblerecovery methods for shallow oil-sands reservoirs with overburdens of more than30 m (koolman et al  2008)  however, in em-sagd projects, the caprock overlyingoil-sands reservoirs is also electromagnetically heated along with the bitumenreservoir  because permeability is low in alberta thermal-project caprockformations (i e , the clearwater shale formation in the athabasca deposit andthe colorado shale formation in the cold lake deposit), the pore pressureresulting from the thermal expansion of pore fluids may not be balanced withthe fluid loss caused by flow and the fluid-volume changes resulting from poredilation  in extreme cases, the water boils, and the pore pressure increasesdramatically as a result of the phase change in the water, which causesprofound effective-stress reduction  after this condition is established, porepressure increases can lead to shear failure of the caprock, the creation ofmicrocracks and hydraulic fractures, and subsequent caprock integrity failure it is typically believed that low-permeability caprocks impede the transmissionof pore pressure from the reservoir, making them more resistant to shearfailure (collins 2005, 2007)  in cases of induced thermal pressurization,low-permeability caprocks are not always more resistant  in this study,analytical solutions are obtained for temperature and pore-pressure risescaused by the constant em heating rate of the caprock  these analyticalsolutions show that pore-pressure increases from em heating depend on thepermeability and compressibility of the caprock formation  for stiff orlow-compressibility media, thermal pressurization can cause fluid pressures toapproach hydrostatic pressure, and shear strength to approach zero forlow-cohesive-strength units of the caprock (units of the caprock with high siltand sand percentage) and sections of the caprock with pre-existing fractureswith no cohesion | 
157360-pa 	 prediction of heavy-oil viscosities with a simple correlation approach |heavy-oil development is becoming increasingly important because of the continuous decline in conventional-oil production  for heavy-oil reservoirs, the oil viscosity usually varies dramatically during production processes such as in thermal processes  when producing heavy oil, the high viscosity is a major impediment to recovery  oil viscosity is often correlated directly to the reserves estimate in heavy-oil formations and can determine the success or failure of a given enhanced-oil-recovery scheme  as a result, viscosity is an important parameter for performing numerical simulation and determining the economics of a project  in this work, a simple-to-use correlation has been developed to correlate the viscosity of heavy oil to temperature and to a simple correlating parameter that can be used for heavy-oil characterization  the reported results are the product of the analysis of heavy-oil data collected from the open literature for various heavy-oil fields around the world  the tool developed in this study can be of immense practical value for petroleum engineers, providing a method for quick assessment of the viscosity of heavy oils  in particular, petroleum and production engineers would find the proposed correlation to be user-friendly, with transparent calculations involving no complex expressions  the new proposed correlation shows consistently accurate results  this consistency could not be matched by any of the widely accepted existing correlations within the investigated range  for all conditions, the new correlation provided better results than existing correlations in the literature | 
158934-pa 	 modelling of cold heavy-oil production with sand for subsequent thermal/solvent injection applications |summary   although proved beneficial and economic for thin reservoirs, the cold heavy-oil production with sand (chops) method has several limitations  the sand produced during chops changes the geomechanical and petrophysical properties continuously and results in open channels in the reservoir known as wormholes  also, the chops method results in a low oil recovery (8–10% original oil in place)  this entails a follow-up enhanced-oil-recovery (eor) process, which is always an option for further exploitation, referred to as post-chops  assessment of such a process through numerical simulation, as the most inexpensive yet most powerful tool, necessitates a comprehensive modelling approach to capture its dynamic physical nature  only through such a realistic model can one obtain reasonably reliable reservoir characteristics after chops that are critically important to assess post-chops applications  to this end, we implemented a fractal pattern of different kinds by use of a diffusion-limited aggregation (dla) algorithm as wormhole domain with a partial dual-porosity approach and a step-by-step simulation technique, taking advantage of a simple mathematical model to integrate the sand-production data with fractal patterns  the wormhole network is assumed to grow with more sand production, respecting geological conditions and well perforation  moreover, its effective properties and the contained fluid can be controlled along its length and pattern at different steps  such an option is of great assistance in the history-matching process  the model was validated successfully with available alberta field data  as a preliminary step to post-chops, several thermal, solvent, and hybrid combinations of both scenarios were considered  the proposed method for chops modelling is a useful approach to initiate a quick post-chops study in practice if sand production history is provided  one may also take advantage of its compatibility with any black-oil, compositional, or thermal simulators | 
159747-pa 	 integrated predrill pore-pressure and borehole-stability prediction for prelude development |pore-pressure (pp) and fracture-gradient (fg) predictions were prepared for prelude development wells in the browse basin in offshore northwest australia  the pp forecasts were based on resistivity- and sonic-based models calibrated with pressure measurements and drilling events, such as kicks from existing wells  fgs were based on leakoff tests and loss events from offset wells and were not necessarily equal to either the minimum compressive principal stress (often considered a lower bound to fg) or the formation-breakdown pressure (often considered an upper bound to fg that includes effects of formation tensile strength and nearwellbore hoop stress)  the minimum compressive horizontal stress was calculated from lithology-dependent effective-stress ratios  maximum horizontal stress was inferred from observed breakouts  pp and stresses were combined with formation properties from well logs and laboratory rock-mechanics tests to provide input for elastoplastic (shales) and poroelastic (sands) boreholestability (bhs) models  these techniques are applicable to exploration, appraisal, or early-development wells that have potential for encountering geopressured formations in high-angle well sections requiring good predrill estimates to adequately plan the casing and drilling programs and determine bhs  the predrill studies can be extended to provide integrated real-time pp and bhs while drilling, and the models can be recalibrated after each well to provide updated predictions for subsequent wells  there are only minor deviations in the predicted pp and fg among the different well locations considered  common features include potential loss zones in the shallow overburden, pressure ramp within the jamieson, pressure regression below the aptian, and near-hydrostatic pressure within the upper swan and below  the bhs models indicate that minimum-required mud weight in deviated sections could be up to 20% higher than that required to balance formation pp  in one well that would cross a suspected fault, the risk of fault reopening or reactivation is low | 
159765-pa 	 3d modeling of multistage hydraulic fractures and two-way-coupling geomechanics/fluid-flow simulation of a horizontal well in the nikanassin tight gas formation, western canada sedimentary basin |summary   unconventional gas is stored in extensive areas known as basin centered continuous-gas accumulations  although the estimated worldwide figures differ significantly, the consensus among the studies relating to unconventional gas resources is that the volumes are gigantic  however, the low permeability in these types of reservoirs usually results in a very low recovery factor to help unlock these resources, this paper presents a new and more accurate way of simulating multistage hydraulic fracturing in horizontal wells in three dimensions by use of single- and dual-porosity reservoir models  in this approach, the geometry (not necessarily symmetric) and orientation of the multiple hydraulic fractures are driven by the prevailing stress state in the drainage volume of the horizontal well  once the hydraulic-fracturing job is accurately modeled in three dimensions, two-way geomechanical coupling is used to history match the produced gas from a horizontal well drilled in the nikanassin naturally fractured tight gas formation of the western canada sedimentary basin (wcsb)  traditionally, the most widely used approaches have their roots in semianalytical calculations simplifying the fracturing system to a planar feature propagating symmetrically away from a line source of injection  in contrast, the computed results presented in this study show that the incorporation of geomechanical effects gives a more realistic representation of the orientation and geometry of hydraulic fractures  reduction in permeability of the natural and hydraulic fractures because of pressure depletion results in more-realistic production predictions compared with the case in which geomechanical effects are ignored  the telling conclusion, in light of the computed results, is that the field of hydraulic fracturing provides an object lesson in the need for coupled 3d geomechanical approaches  the method presented in this paper will help to improve gas rates and recoveries from reservoirs with permeability values in the nanodarcy scale | 
159899-pa 	 impact of completion design on fracture complexity in horizontal shale wells |summary   a proppant-filled fracture induces mechanical stresses in the surrounding rock that cause a reduction in the horizontal-stress contrast and stress reorientation around the open fracture  a 3d geomechanical model is used to simulate the stress reorientation caused by open fractures and to generate horizontal-stress-contrast contour maps  the reduction in horizontal-stress contrast can lead to increased fracture complexity  this paper describes ways to increase fracture complexity by varying the completion design  in this paper, we identify the impact of operator-controllable variables in a completion design on fracture complexity  this can lead to more-effective completion designs that improve well productivity, reservoir drainage, and, ultimately, the estimated ultimate recovery (eur)  the possibility of greater fracture complexity and reduced/effective fracture spacing and, thus, a higher drainage area is demonstrated for the alternate fracturing sequence in comparison to the conventional fracturing sequence  the young’s-modulus value of the shale and the in-situ horizontal-stress contrast are shown to be significant factors controlling the extent of fracture complexity generated in a given reservoir  in addition, the effect of proppant mass injected per stage is also shown to significantly impact fracture complexity  we provide optimal ranges of fracture spacing and proppant volume for the various shale formations analyzed  the use of these guidelines should result in more fracture complexity than would otherwise be observed the results presented in the paper provide the operator with the knowledge to design completions and fracture treatments (proppant volume, fracture spacing, and sequencing) to maximize reservoir drainage and to increase eurs  this should lead to more-effective completion designs |

163591-pa 	 multiparadigm parallel acceleration for reservoir simulation |summary   with the advent of the multicore central-processing unit (cpu), today’s commodity pc clusters are effectively a collection of interconnected parallel computers, each with multiple multicore cpus and large shared random access memory (ram), connected together by means of high-speed networks  each computer, referred to as a compute node, is a powerful parallel computer on its own  each compute node can be equipped further with acceleration devices such as the general-purpose graphical processing unit (gpgpu) to further speed up computational-intensive portions of the simulator  reservoir-simulation methods that can exploit this heterogeneous hardware system can be used to solve very-large-scale reservoir-simulation models and run significantly faster than conventional simulators  because typical pc clusters are essentially distributed share-memory computers, this suggests that the use of mixed-paradigm parallelism (distributed-shared memory), such as message-passing interface and open multiprocessing (mpi-omp), should work well for computational efficiency and memory use  in this work, we compare and contrast the single-paradigm programming models, mpi or omp, with the mixed paradigm, mpi-omp, programming model for a class of solver method that is suited for the different modes of parallelism  the results showed that the distributed memory (mpi-only) model has superior multicompute-node scalability, whereas the shared memory (omp-only) model has superior parallel performance on a single compute node  the mixed mpi-omp model and omp-only model are more memory-efficient for the multicore architecture than the mpi-only model because they require less or no halo-cell storage for the subdomains  to exploit the fine-grain shared memory parallelism available on the gpgpu architecture, algorithms should be suited to the single-instruction multiple-data (simd) parallelism, and any recursive operations are serialized  in addition, solver methods and data store need to be reworked to coalesce memory access and to avoid shared memory-bank conflicts  wherever possible, the cost of data transfer through the peripheral component interconnect express (pcie) bus between the cpu and gpgpu needs to be hidden by means of asynchronous communication  we applied multiparadigm parallelism to accelerate compositional reservoir simulation on a gpgpu-equipped pc cluster  on a dual-cpu-dual-gpu compute node, the parallelized solver running on the dual-gpgpu fermi m2090q achieved up to 19 times speedup over the serial cpu (1-core) results and up to 3 7 times speedup over the parallel dual-cpu x5675 results in mixed mpi+omp paradigm for a 1 728-million-cell compositional model  parallel performance shows a strong dependency on the subdomain sizes  parallel cpu solve has a higher performance for smaller domain partitions, whereas gpgpu solve requires large partitions for each chip for good parallel performance  this is related to improved cache efficiency on the cpu for small subdomains and the loading requirement for massive parallelism on the gpgpu  therefore, for a given model, the multinode parallel performance decreases for the gpgpu relative to the cpu as the model is further subdivided into smaller subdomains to be solved on more compute nodes  to illustrate this, a modified spe5 (killough and kossak 1987) model with various grid dimensions was run to generate comparative results  parallel performances for three field compositional models of various sizes and dimensions are included to further elucidate and contrast cpu-gpgpu single-node and multiple-node performances  a pc cluster with the tesla m2070q gpgpu and the 6-core xeon x5675 westmere was used to produce the majority of the reported results  another pc cluster with the tesla m2090q gpgpu was available for some cases, and the results are reported for the modified spe5 (killough and kossack 1987) problems for comparison | 
163609-pa 	 a generalized framework model for the simulation of gas production in unconventional gas reservoirs |summary   unconventional gas resources from tight-sand and shale gas reservoirs have received great attention in the past decade around the world because of their large reserves and technical advances in developing these resources  as a result of improved horizontal drilling and hydraulic-fracturing technologies, progress is being made toward commercial gas production from such reservoirs, as demonstrated in the us  however, understandings and technologies needed for the effective development of unconventional reservoirs are far behind the industry needs (e g , gas-recovery rates from those unconventional resources remain very low)  there are some efforts in the literature on how to model gas flow in shale gas reservoirs by use of various approaches - from modified commercial simulators to simplified analytical solutions - leading to limited success  compared with conventional reservoirs, gas flow in ultralow-permeability unconventional reservoirs is subject to more nonlinear, coupled processes, including nonlinear adsorption/desorption, non-darcy flow (at both high flow rate and low flow rate), strong rock/fluid interaction, and rock deformation within nanopores or microfractures, coexisting with complex flow geometry and multiscaled heterogeneity  therefore, quantifying flow in unconventional gas reservoirs has been a significant challenge, and traditional representative-elementary-volume- (rev) based darcy's law, for example, may not be generally applicable  in this paper, we discuss a generalized mathematical framework model and numerical approach for unconventional-gas-reservoir simulation  we present a unified framework model able to incorporate known mechanisms and processes for two-phase gas flow and transport in shale gas or tight gas formations  the model and numerical scheme are based on generalized flow models with unstructured grids  we discuss the numerical implementation of the mathematical model and show results of our model-verification effort  specifically, we discuss a multidomain, multicontinuum concept for handling multiscaled heterogeneity and fractures [i e , the use of hybrid modeling approaches to describe different types and scales of fractures or heterogeneous pores - from the explicit modeling of hydraulic fractures and the fracture network in stimulated reservoir volume (srv) to distributed natural fractures, microfractures, and tight matrix]  we demonstrate model application to quantify hydraulic fractures and transient flow behavior in shale gas reservoirs | 
163648-pa 	 unconstrained voronoi grids for densely spaced complex wells in full-field reservoir simulation |summary   accurate representation of near-well flow is an important subject matter in reservoir simulation  in today’s field-scale reservoir simulation, cell-centered structured grids remain the predominant practice  typically, well-inflow performance of the perforated cells is connected to the finite-volume solution by means of well indices that may not be well-defined when the wellbore intersects the finite-volume cells in a complex trajectory  fine gridding is also required to resolve the flow dynamics in the near-well regions  strong grid-orientation sensitivities can also contribute to the numerical errors and may require significant local grid refinement to alleviate  there are ongoing research-and-development (r&d) efforts on applying unstructured grids to better represent the near-well flow in reservoir simulation, but their applications are mainly in single-well study or sector modeling with a few wells  some of the reasons cited for this include (1) the lack of an effective, easy-to-use full-field complex well-gridding tool; (2) the lack of supporting unstructured workflow for full-cycle reservoir simulation; (3) the cost of unstructured-grid simulation; and (4) the availability of post-analysis and visualization tools for unstructured-grid simulation  the paper describes a novel method to automatically generate unstructured grids that conform to complex wellpaths in field-scale simulation  the method uses a multilevel approach to place cells optimally within the solution domain on the basis of the "regions of interests " the wellbore geometry is honored by means of the construction of a near-well grid that is complemented with multilevel quad-tree (fig  1) refinements to achieve the desired resolution in grid transition zones  the method includes an algorithm to remove small cells and pinching cells on the basis of local grid quality measures and cell prioritization to honor wellpaths  the gridding process forms a component of a production-level reservoir-simulation workflow  the use of unstructured grid results in computational savings by placing cells where the resolution is needed  an in-house massively parallel simulator is used to run the unstructured-grid models  simulation examples for full-field applications with hundreds of complex wells by use of both structured grids and unstructured grids will be used to compare results, accuracy, and performance of the gridding method for reservoir simulation | 
163672-pa 	 development of an analytical injectivity model for non-newtonian polymer solutions |summary   in applications of polymer flood for enhanced oil recovery (eor), polymer injectivity is of great concern because project economics is sensitive to injection rates  in-situ non-newtonian polymer rheology is the most crucial factor that affects polymer injectivity  there are several ongoing polymer-injection field tests in which the field injectivities differ significantly from the simulation forecasts  we have developed an analytical model to more accurately calculate and predict polymer injectivity during the field projects to help with optimum injection strategies  significant viscosity variations during polymer flood occur in the vicinities of wellbores where velocities are high  as the size of a wellblock increases, velocity smears, and thus polymer injectivity is erroneously calculated  in the university of texas chemical flooding simulator (utchem), the solution was to use an effective radius to capture the "grid effect," which is empirical and impractical for large-scale field simulations with several hundred wells  another approach is to use local grid refinement near wells, but this adds to the computational cost and limits the size of the problem  an attractive alternative to previous approaches is to extend the peaceman well model peaceman 1983) to non-newtonian polymer solutions  the polymer rheological model and its implementation in utchem were validated by simulating single-phase polymer injectivity in coreflood experiments  on the basis of the peaceman well model and utchem polymer rheological models covering both shear-thinning and shear-thickening polymers, an analytical polymer injectivity model was developed  the analytical model was validated by comparing results of different gridblock sizes and radial numerical simulation  we also tested a field case by comparing results of a fine-grid simulation and its up-scaled coarse-grid model  a pilot-scale polymer flood was simulated to demonstrate the capability of the proposed analytical model  the model successfully captured polymer injectivity in all of these cases with no need to introduce empirical parameters | 
163814-pa 	 prediction of stimulated reservoir volume and optimization of fracturing in tight gas and shale with a fully elasto-plastic coupled geomechanical model |summary   hydraulic fracturing is essential for the economic development of tight gas reservoirs and shale-gas reservoirs  current techniques are unable to predict the stimulated-reservoir-volume (srv) dependence on fracturing-job and rock-mechanics parameters, which precludes any meaningful optimization  in the authors’ previous work on the srv-propagation prediction, the combined tensile/shear fracturing model applied to the fracturing of tight gas formations has shown the creation of a relatively narrow, focused srv that resembled behavior dominated by a single fracture  in this work, the model has been significantly improved by the implementation of a rigorous full newton elasto-plastic solution of the geomechanics of rock containing induced fractures  the results reveal interesting features of complex-fracture propagation in tight formations, which are in broad agreement with the shapes of srv’s obtained from microseismic imaging  the developed code is flexible enough to allow either tensile or shear fracturing or occurrence of both to be examined on the basis of initial reservoir conditions  different cases of 2d and 3d simulations will be presented that demonstrate some important features of the process  first, it is found that a wide srv can result in cases in which initial reservoir conditions are close to the shear-fracturing point, such as in formations with microfractures, partially cemented natural fractures, and abnormally high initial pore pressure  second, the srv width is found to depend on the horizontal stress contrast, as expected  third, wide srv growth is associated with constant or increasing pumping pressure necessary for further failed-zone growth as a result of the loss of elastic coupling by off-planar failure propagation  further, under high injection pressure, an efficient fracture elasto-plastic constitutive model developed can drive both maximal and minimal effective stresses to zero or tensile, and, therefore, the creation of tensile fracturing can be predicted simultaneously with shear fracturing  this will then provide a means of modeling proppant transport  the new model is a significant step toward the development of an integrated predictive tool for the optimization of shale-gas development | 
163839-pa 	 laboratory measurement of hydraulic-fracture conductivities in the barnett shale |summary   horizontal wells that intersect multistage transverse fractures created by low-viscosity fracturing fluid with low proppant loadings are the key to revitalizing production from the mississippian barnett shale in the fort worth basin in texas  however, direct laboratory measurements of both natural- and induced-fracture conductivities under realistic experimental-design conditions are needed for reliable well-performance analysis and fracture-design optimization  in this work, a series of experiments was conducted to measure the conductivity of unpropped natural fractures, propped natural fractures, unpropped induced fractures and propped induced fractures with a modified american petroleum institute (api) conductivity cell at room temperature  fractures were induced along the natural bedding planes, preserving fracture-surface asperities  natural-fracture infill was taken into consideration during conductivity measurements  proppants of various sizes were placed manually between rough fracture surfaces at realistic concentrations  the two sides of the rough fractures either were aligned or were displaced with a 0 1-in  offset  after pressure testing on the system integrity, nitrogen was flowed through the proppant pack or unpropped fracture to measure the conductivity  results from 88 experiments show that the conductivity of hydraulic fractures in shale can be measured accurately in a laboratory with appropriate experimental procedures and good control on experimental errors  it is proved that unpropped, aligned fractures can provide a conductive path after removal of free particles and debris because of the brittleness and lamination of shale  moreover, poorly cemented natural fractures and unpropped displaced fractures can create conductivities up to 0 5 md-ft at formation-closure stress, which is one to two orders of magnitude greater than the conductivity provided by cemented natural fractures and unpropped aligned fractures  this study shows that propped-fracture conductivity increases with larger proppant size and higher proppant concentration  longer-term fracture-conductivity measurements indicate that, within 20 hours, the fracture conductivity could be reduced by as much as 20% | 
163843-pa 	 analyzing production data from hydraulically fractured wells: the concept of induced permeability field |summary   this work introduces a new model for the production-decline analysis (pda) of hydraulically fractured wells on the basis of the concept of the induced permeability field  we consider the case when the hydraulic-fracturing operation--in addition to establishing the fundamental linear-flow geometry in the drainage volume--alters the ability of the formation to conduct fluids throughout, but with varying degrees depending on the distance from the main fracture plane  we show that, under these circumstances, the reservoir response departs from the uniform-permeability approach significantly  the new model differs from the once promising group of models that are inherently related to power-law-type variation of the permeability-area product and thus are burdened by a mathematical singularity inside the fracture  the analysis of field cases reveals that the induced permeability field can be properly represented by a linear or exponential function characterized by the maximal induced permeability k0 and the threshold permeability k*  both these permeabilities are induced (superimposed on the formation) by the hydraulic-fracturing treatment; thus, the model can be considered as a simple, but nontrivial, formalization of the intuitive stimulated-reservoir-volume (srv) concept  it is quite reasonable to assume that the maximum happens at the fracture face and that the minimum happens at the outer boundary of the srv  the contrast between maximal and minimal permeability, sr-1/4-k0/k*, will be of considerable interest, and thus, we introduce a new term for it: stimulation ratio (sr)  knowledge of these parameters is crucial in evaluating the effectiveness of today’s intensively stimulated well completions, especially multifractured horizontal wells in shale gas  the approach describes, in a straightforward manner, the production performance of such wells exhibiting transient linear flow and late-time boundary-dominated flow affected also by a skin effect (i e , by an additional pressure drop in the system characterized by linear dependence on production rate)  this work provides the induced-permeability-field model within the single-medium concept, and shows that some features widely believed to require a dual-medium (double-porosity) representation are already present  advantages and drawbacks related to applying the concept in a dual-medium approach will be discussed in an upcoming work  we present the model and its analytical solution in laplace space  we provide type curves for decline-curve analysis, closed-form approximate solutions in the time domain, field examples, and practical guidelines for the analysis of commonly occurring production characteristics of massively stimulated reservoirs | 
163860-pa 	 constraints on simultaneous growth of hydraulic fractures from multiple perforation clusters in horizontal wells |summary   in spite of the fact that multistage hydraulic fracturing from horizontalwells is the fastest growing and arguably the most economically importantapplication for well stimulation, numerous fundamental questions remain thatare relevant to determining how long to make each isolated interval and howmany perforation clusters to place within each interval  this paper providesnew insights into this problem by predicting how many hydraulic fractures canbe expected to grow simultaneously from multiple perforation clusterspressurized by a single injection stage  these predictions are obtained from acoupled mathematical model that includes the contributions of fluid flow, rockbreakage, and pressure loss through the perforations to the total powerrequirements for the growth of arrays of multiple hydraulic fractures  fortypical shale gas stimulations, radial hydraulic fractures are predicted togrow from all perforation clusters, with progressive reduction in the number ofhydraulic fractures, thereby maintaining a ratio of the radius to the spacingthat is a small amount less than unity  if the hydraulic fractures arecontained to a height h, then multiple perkins-kern-nordgren (pkn) -likehydraulic fractures are predicted to continue growing, with the length of eachhydraulic fracture increasing throughout the injection and with a spacing thatis approximately 1 5 h when perforation losses are strong andapproximately 2 5 h when perforation losses are negligible  thesegeometric predictions are consistent with previously published observationsbased on microseismicity associated with stimulations in the barnett shale | 
163872-pa 	 thermal reactivation of microfractures and its potential impact on hydraulic-fracture efficiency |summary   core studies have revealed the presence of abundant cemented microfractures in many tight formations  further independent studies have revealed the opening of some of these microfractures on the wall surface of main hydraulic fractures  in addition, early-production well-testing analysis in some of these cases provides estimates for the hydraulically-induced-fracture surface area, which is much larger than fracture dimensions estimated in fracturing design or provided by the location of microseismic events  opening of small-sized fractures could be a possible reason for this discrepancy  in this paper, we show to what extent thermal stresses induced by temperature difference between fracturing fluid and formation fluid could provide the driving force to open a portion of these small, cemented natural fractures lying on the surface of hydraulic fractures  moreover, through combination of stress analysis and empirical fracture-distribution models obtained from outcrops, we calculate the increase of total reservoir/fracture contact surface under the condition of microfracture activation  our thermoelasticity analysis reveals the effect of the pump rate and temperature of the fracturing fluid on the number of activated microfractures  the results show that the volume of the microfractures varies depending on the length of the microfracture, rock properties, and time  at the end of the paper, through an example, we show that activation of only a small portion of these microfractures can increase the total fracture/formation contact area considerably and, consequently, increase initial production  reservoir-pressure changes caused by production might partially close or reopen these microcracks during production; hence, the effectiveness of these microfractures could be mainly restricted to the early life of the reservoirs | 
164534-pa 	 fines migration in fractured wells: integrating modeling with field and laboratory data |summary   production and drawdown data from 10 subsea deepwater fractured wells have been modeled with an analytical model for unsteadystate flow with fines migration  the simulation results and the field data indicated a good match, within 5%  a sensitivity study conducted on initial concentration of fines, flow rate, maximum finesmobilization velocity, fines distribution, formation damage, and filtration coefficients confirmed that the model-matching parameters are within values reported commonly in the literature  this paper describes the methodology used to integrate the modeling predictions with field and laboratory data to identify probable causes for increasing skins and declining productivity-index values observed in some of the wells under investigation  it discusses the results of an experiment designed to simultaneously assess the effects of pressure depletion and compaction on fines production and permeability with a triaxial-stress apparatus  this is, to the best of our knowledge, the first time an experiment of this nature is reported in the literature  the good match between the modeling and the field data, further validated with laboratory experiments, allows for discussion of long-term predictions on well productivity impacting current reservoir-management strategies and field-development plans | 
165108-pa 	 imbibition and water blockage in unconventional reservoirs: well-management implications during flowback and early production |summary   driven by field logistics in an unconventional setting, a well may undergo weeks to months of shut-in after hydraulic-fracture stimulation  in unconventional reservoirs, field experiences indicate that such shut-in episodes may improve well productivity significantly while reducing water production  multiphase-flow mechanisms were found to explain this behavior  aided by laboratory relative permeability and capillary pressure data, and their dependency on stress in a shale-gas reservoir, the flow-simulation model was able to reproduce the suspected water-blocking behavior  results demonstrate that a well-resting period improves early productivity and reduces water production  the results also indicate that minimizing water invasion in the formation is crucial to avoid significant water blockage | 
165138-pa 	 produced-water-reinjection design and uncertainties assessment |summary   produced-water reinjection (pwri) is an important strategy for deriving value from waste water (abou sayed et al  2005), but its implementation can face challenges related to injectivity and safety issues  reinjection in fracturing regime is often the only option to guarantee the sustainability of injectivity (detienne et al  2005), but it can present some risks to be anticipated early in the design phase  the first objective of a pwri-design study is to supply water-quality specifications to petroleum architects (in terms of solid and oil contents) to allow for the design of water-treatment facilities  the second objective is to supply injection-pressure specifications for the design of injection pumps and an injection network  these specifications must allow for sustaining well injectivity over the life of the field, while preventing any risk of caprock failure  the water-quality specification is of prime importance because a maximum of contaminant injection is sought to minimize the cost related to water treatment, but at the same time, it must prevent any injectivity loss or excessive increase of pressure beyond which fracture confinement is no longer possible  water quality and injection pressure are thus linked to each other  they are deduced by simulation on a case-by-case basis  the modeling approach used by total was presented in previous publications (detienne et al  1998, 2005; ochi et al  2007)  the objective of this paper is to detail the manner in which the two parameters are deduced when uncertainties on input data are considered  indeed, a workflow for uncertainty management based on experimental design and monte carlo theories was implemented to combine the simultaneous effect of a relatively large number of uncertain parameters, each of them being characterized by its own probabilistic distribution  two-thousand simulations were run systematically, and water-quality and injection-pressure specifications were supplied with a probabilistic value (p10, p50, and p90)  application of this approach to real-design examples is detailed and discussed in this paper | 
165148-pa 	 time-dependent fracture-interference effects in pad wells |summary   hydraulic fracturing in shale formations induces microseismic events in a region we refer to as the microseismic volume  many of these microseismic events are signatures of failure in the formation that are believed to be a result of induced unpropped (iu) fractures beyond the primary propped fracture  areally extensive microseismicity may be evidence that these iu fractures occur and extend spatially beyond the propped fracture during pumping in many unconventional reservoirs  we present evidence that these fractures close over time after pumping is stopped and that this closure of iu fractures can have a significant impact on stress interference between fractures  to illustrate these effects, microseismic and radioactive-tracer data are presented for four laterals drilled and fractured from a single pad  two wells on this pad were fractured with the consecutive-fracturing sequence, and the other two wells were fractured with the zipper-fracturing sequence  geomechanical simulations were performed to model the pad scenario and explain the microseismic and tracer observations, with emphasis on the two different fracturing sequences  our simulations show that the opening of the iu fractures results in significant temporary changes to the stress field in the rock  one consequence of this is that later fracture stages tend to propagate into the open-fracture networks of iu fractures created earlier because of stress reorientation  this can lead to inefficient usage of fluid, proppant, and capital because the region that is being stimulated has already been stimulated by the previous stage  by analyzing the net pressure, radioactive-tracer data, and microseismic data from the four-well pad, we show that these iu fractures close over time because the fracture fluid leaks off  this reduces the stress shadow, and subsequent induced fractures are no longer subjected to the significantly altered stresses, allowing for more-efficient fracture-network coverage by subsequent fractures in a horizontal well  on the basis of the data presented and computer simulations, we propose the idea of maximizing the time between fracturing in the microseismic volume of a recently fractured region (within operational constraints)  the time required for the iu fractures to close can be estimated from our models and varies on the basis of the reservoir and fluid properties from several hours to days  one example of how this is accomplished in practice is zipper fractures  however, our work suggests that there also may be other fracture-sequencing strategies for accomplishing this | 
165343-pa 	 an efficient reservoir-simulation approach to design and optimize unconventional gas production |summary   shale-gas production has gained worldwide attention over the past several years  production from shale-gas reservoirs requires horizontal drilling with multiple hydraulic fracturing to obtain the most economical production  however, there are high cost and uncertainty because of many inestimable and uncertain parameters (e g , reservoir permeability, porosity, fracture spacing, fracture half length,fracture conductivity, gas desorption, geomechanics, and existing natural fractures)  therefore, the development of a way to quantify uncertainties and optimization of shale-gas production in an efficient and practical method is clearly desirable  in this paper, we present a user-friendly and efficient framework to obtain the optimal gas-production scenario by optimizing the uncertain factors by integrating several commercial simulators, an economic model, design of experiment (doe), and response-surface methodology (rsm) with a global optimization search engine  specifically, we use factorial design to screen insignificant factors and find the most influential design and uncertain factors; then, we use rsm to design over those most influential factors to fit a response surface using net present value (npv) as the objective function; finally, we identify the most economical production scenario under conditions of uncertainty  eight uncertain parameters [i e , porosity, permeability, reservoir thickness, reservoir pressure, bottomhole pressure (bhp), fracture spacing, fracture half-length, and fracture conductivity] with a reasonable range on the basis of barnett-shale information are investigated  also, different gas prices are considered for the optimization process  this framework is effective and efficient for hydraulic-fracturing- treatment design and production-scheme optimization in unconventional gas reservoirs  it can contribute to providing guidance for engineers to modify the design of a hydraulic-fracture treatment before the actual fracture treatment |

166209-pa 	 intelligent completion inside uncemented liner for selective high-rate carbonate matrix acidizing |summary   this paper describes the design, testing, installation, and performance of the first fully completed well by use of an intelligent inner completion inside an uncemented liner with openhole packers for zonal isolation  the well-design concept evolved from technical challenges associated with completing long cased-and-cemented laterals in the mature ekofisk waterflood  the term fully completed implies full reservoir access along the pay length for production and high-rate matrix acid stimulation by use of limited entry for fluid diversion within well segments  the paper covers the development and qualification of customopenhole 7 5/8-in -liner components that can handle high differential pressures and severe temperature fluctuations of 200°f; the marriage of this complex liner with a five-zone intelligent-completion system; and results from 1 year of system-integration testing  the paper also discusses the strategic placement of both mechanical openhole and inner-string packers based on caliper and drilling logs; challenges met and overcome during installation; and comprehensive downhole-gauge data that confirms the performance of each component before, during, and after the stimulation  the ekofisk field waterflood began in 1987 and continues to date, exceeding expectations for improved oil recovery while mitigating reservoir compaction  as the waterflood matures, new wells are more often found partially water-swept  limited infrastructure for lifting and handling the high water production has led to increased emphasis on isolating these water-swept intervals  cased, cemented, and perforated completions have traditionally been used for this service  effective placement of cement is challenging in horizontals 4,000–8,000 ft in length, where rotation of the liner is not possible and high effective-circulating densities limit rates during cementing  wide variations in reservoir pore pressures, often in excess of 2,000-psi difference along the lateral, are typical of the ekofisk chalk and compound the difficulties of cementing  as a result, a new method for zonal isolation has been developed to ensure the success of future infill-drilling campaigns  the design and careful planning that went into the fully completed openhole uncemented-liner strategy resulted in a successful field trial and has proved this solution to be an effective alternative to cemented reservoir liners in long horizontals where zonal isolation is critical  use of the intelligent-well system (iws) allowed offline acid stimulation without rig, coiled-tubing, or wireline intervention  what would have traditionally been a significant water producer, with three water-swept zones totaling nearly 2,000 ft across a 4,000-ft reservoir section, has turned out to beone of the best oil producers in the field, with nearly zero watercut  production results show high productivity with highly negative acidized-completion skins with large investments in intelligent completions to provide zone-specific inflow control and water shutoff, isolation outside the liner becomes much more important  over recent years, the ekofisk wells have illustrated the difficulty of achieving effective cement along lengthy reservoir targets  the openhole fully completed solution combining an accessorized uncemented liner with an inner intelligent-completion string will allow operators to push the limits in terms of lateral length while maintaining full control over producing and nonproducing zones | 
166332-pa 	 characterizing hydraulic fracturing with a tendency-for-shear-stimulation test |summary   the classical concept of hydraulic fracturing is that a single, planar, opening mode fracture propagates through the formation  in recent years, there has been a growing consensus that natural fractures play an important role during stimulation in many settings there is not universal agreement on the mechanisms by which natural fractures affect stimulation, and these mechanisms may vary depending on formation properties  one potentially important mechanism is shear stimulation, in which increased fluid pressure induces slip and permeability enhancement on pre-existing fractures  we propose a tendency-for-shear-stimulation (tss) test as a direct, relatively unambiguous method for determining the degree to which shear stimulation contributes to stimulation in a formation  in a tss test, fluid injection is performed while maintaining the bottomhole fluid pressure slightly less than the minimum principal stress  under these conditions, shear stimulation is the only possible mechanism for permeability enhancement (except, perhaps, thermally induced tensile fracturing)  a tss test is different from a conventional procedure because injection is performed at a specified pressure (rather than a specified rate) with injection at a specified rate, fluid pressure may exceed the minimum principal stress, and it may cause tensile fractures to propagate through the formation  if this occurs, it will be ambiguouswhether stimulation was because of shear stimulation or tensile fracturing  maintaining pressure less than the minimum principal stress ensures that the effect of shear stimulation can be isolated  low-rate injectivity tests could be performed before and after the tss test to estimate formation permeability  an increase in formation permeability would indicate that shear stimulation has occurred  the flow-rate transient during injection may also be interpreted to identify shear stimulation  numerical simulations of shear stimulation were performed with a discrete-fracture-network (dfn) simulator that couples fluid flow with the stresses induced by fracture deformation  these simulations were used to qualitatively investigate how shear stimulation and fracture connectivity affect the results of a tss test  two specific field projects are discussed as examples of a tss test, the enhanced geothermal systems (egs) projects at desert peak, nevada, and soultz-sous-forets, france | 
166425-pa 	 fifteen years of expandable-sand-screen performance and reliability |summary   expandable-sand-screen (ess), a technology concept envisaged by shell and initially developed by petroline, was first field trialed in 1997 with the idea that eliminating the annulus between the sand screen and wellbore would improve downhole sand control and allow enhanced reservoir performance and management  by the end of 2012, ess was installed in 677 wells, with 418,184 ft of screen deployed globally  as such, ess has matured as a viable sand-control technology combining openhole-gravel-pack functionality with the installation simplicity of a standalone-screen (sas) completion  with performance, reliability, and long-term well life expectancy of paramount importance to field-development economics, an extensive internal installation database has been maintained for weatherford’s ess systems  over the past 15 years, observation and analysis of design, planning, field implementation, and useful life cycle have been documented in this database  this performance insight provides the foundation for future reliability and has been used to identify learning opportunities, influencing the product evolution and technology-application envelope  with performance and reliability analysis provided and discussed in detail, the applicable ess envelope is outlined  product design enhancement, methodical application evaluation, and rigorous operating procedures result in improved successful use  analysis of both infant and production failure trends are presented and show improvement  these data are used to estimate future life predictions by use of recognized reliability-analysis tools  the applicability of ess in openhole wells is highlighted, with continuing performance in oil producers, gas producers, water injectors, and underground-gas-storage applications  there are various sand-control technologies successfully used in reservoirs around the globe  this study outlines the applicable envelope for ess use, providing insight to enable informed evaluation, life-of-well risk appraisal, and, ultimately, reliable sand-control-completion selection for existing or new field-development appraisal |

167259-pa 	 simulation of hydrate dynamics in reservoirs |summary   gas hydrates in reservoirs are generally not in thermodynamic equilibrium, and there may be several competing phase transitions involving hydrate  formation of carbon dioxide (co2) hydrates during aquifer storage of co2 involves roughly 10 vol% increase compared with groundwater  dissociation of hydrate toward undersaturated fluid phases involves the same level of contraction  hydrate phase transitions are generally fast (scales of seconds) compared with mineral dissolution and precipitation, and it is unlikely that a time-shifted explicit coupling to geomechanical analysis will be able to capture the appropriate dynamic couplings between flow and changes in stress  the need for geomechanical integrity of the storage site therefore requires a reservoir simulator with an implicit solution of mass flow, heat flow, and geomechanics  and because co2 involved in hydrate is also involved in different geochemical reactions, we propose a scheme where all possible hydrate formation (on water/co2 interface, from water solution, and from co2 adsorbed on mineral surfaces) and all different possible dissociations are treated as pseudoreactions, but with kinetics derived from advanced theoretical modeling  the main tools for generating these models have been phase-field-theory (pft) simulations, with thermodynamic properties derived from molecular modeling  the detailed results from these types of simulations provides information on the relative impact of mass transport, heat transport, and thermodynamics of the phase transition, which enable qualified simplifications for implementation into retrasocodebright (rcb) (saaltink et al  2004)  the primary step was to study the effect of hydrate growth or dissociation with a certain kinetic rate on the mechanical properties of the reservoir  details of the simulator and numerical algorithms are discussed, and relevant examples are shown | 
167676-ms 	 a new geomechanical model explaining source mechanisms of events induced by hydraulic fracturing in shale |optimization of stimulation is key to successful development of unconventional reservoirs  microseismic monitoring is the most powerful tool to help us understand where and what is happening during and after the stimulation  yet very little is understood about the relationship between microseismicity and hydraulic fractures: some believe microseismic events are part of the hydraulic fractures, some believe they are resulting from stress changes and fluid leak-off  microseismic datasets with accurate event locations complemented with source mechanisms lead us to a new level of understanding of the interaction between hydraulic fracturing and seismic response  there are at least four geomechanical models to explain observed failure mechanisms and the opening (or closing) of hydraulic fractures (seismic tensile opening, leak-off cloud of seismicity around the hydraulic fracture, shearing between aseismic tensile opening and horizontal fractures shearing on vertical planes)  unfortunately none of these models is consistent with observations presented in this study  hence we developed a new geomechanical model of bedding plane slippage induced by hydraulic fractures in shale reservoirs  we present a case study including detailed source mechanism inversion for a microseismic dataset from hydraulic fracturing of a shale gas play in the north america  we observe source mechanisms dominated by shear failure with dip-slip and strike-slip sense of motion  the dip-slip mechanisms are prevailing oriented with shear planes along the maximum horizontal stress  this can be explained as slippage on beddings planes caused by aseismic opening of hydraulic fractures  this model explains large energy difference between seismic and hydraulic energy, and prevailing orientation of the shear planes of the microseismic events  in addition, the bedding planes are weak planes in the shale formation likely to fail  the model can better constrain fundamental parameters of induced hydraulic fractures and describe hydraulic fractures and their interaction with the shale plays |

167685-ms 	 drainage estimation and proppant placement evaluation from microseismic data |microseismic data was acquired with a permanently installed shallow buried array of geophones during the hydraulic fracturing of 17 wells in the marcellus shale  the processed results were used to conduct a multi-disciplinary study integrating geology, geomechanics, reservoir and completion engineering, and ultimately, production data  a stress inversion from focal mechanisms was performed, and correlations were made between hydrocarbon production and microseismic results  that work, in conjunction with the variability in the stimulation approach, was used to optimize the treatment design on an individual wellbore and on a field development scale  incorporating information from source mechanisms, an event magnitude calibrated discrete fracture network (dfn) was designed taking into account the seismic energy of the events, rock properties, the injected fluid volume as well as fluid efficiency  evaluating the placement of proppant inside the dfn allowed for discerning between the part of the stimulated rock volume (srv) that contributes to production in the long term, and the part of the reservoir that was affected by the treatment but may not be hydraulically connected over a longer period of time  finally, the permeability of the stimulated fracture system was calculated from the microseismic results  this allowed for the evaluation of the drainage volume and estimation of production | 
167692-ms 	 optimizing lateral lengths in horizontal wells for a heterogeneous shale play |a successful evaluation and development program in oil- and gas-bearing shales requires considerable analysis and investment, not to mention optimization to insure a profitable outcome  accelerating the optimization, reducing capital expenditures, and improving lifecycle npv for the asset is a very attractive goal  seven shale properties are key drivers to successful play economics  however the heterogeneity of shales makes well location selection difficult without appraisal well logs and geostatistical mapping of shale property quality  the analysis method lets an operator quickly high-grade areas within a large, heterogeneous shale play using logging suites from a limited number of wellbores in the play  further, the methodology has been extended to quantify the play’s potential reward vs  risk distribution for in-fill drilling investments  this study extends the method to optimizing lateral lengths of horizontal wells  geostatistics provides a means to determine correlation lengths of aggregate shale properties known to be critical to successful economics  the correlation length is used to determine the appropriate length of the horizontal well lateral, restricting it within the highest rock quality for stimulation effectiveness and production rates  since optimal lateral lengths can be predicted using this approach, it is now possible to pinpoint the best wellhead location, the best landing point for the horizontal portion of the well, and set the optimal length of the lateral  this reduces the drilling of unproductive lateral lengths and targets stimulations  by shortening the ‘trial and error’ evaluation lifecycle stage using this methodology, an operator can develop an asset more quickly and at less cost than with previous approaches | 
167697-ms 	 modeling transportation logistics, water use, and surface footprint for shale gas field developments |for the development of unconventional resources enormous efforts are required  all the necessary operations cause short-term as well as long-term impacts on the environment and on the social life  in order to study those potential impacts and to find measures to keep them as low as possible, modeling contributes significantly to this goal  the herein described model is a fully integrated model that comprises every key component for such a development between the geological extent of the shale formations up to the pipeline and distribution network  geology makes up the baseline for all calculations  however, especially in central europe, many areas on the surface are restricted, or even inaccessible due to various regulations  all necessary operations have to fit within these given subsurface and surface boundary conditions as well as the regulatory framework  well designs, stimulation treatment designs and the resulting logistics form a complex mathematical network and multidimensional analysis is required in order to find development options that meet the environmental standards, by still allowing companies to be economical  the combination of all those various kinds of disciplines is a highly complex task and hybrid modeling techniques are required to systematically approach such a problem  system dynamics modeling in combination with agent based modeling and gis data allows to study tasks as the relative increase of truck transportation in a specific area when loading the model with actual central european traffic data  further, the model shows the implication on various concerns as water consumption or land use and surface footprint  using proper visualization techniques, the model presents a means of communication to the stakeholders  the industry’s efforts on minimizing the effect of a development on social life and the environment can herewith be described in an effective and scientific way |

167957-ms 	 a comprehensive experimental study on wellbore strengthening |1  description of the material: wellbore strengthening are techniques to increase the mud weight window by adding lost circulation materials (lcm) to drilling fluids  several hundred tests have been performed to investigate the applicability, effectiveness and engineering of various strengthening wellbore techniques  the experimental techniques included simulated fractures by two plates or sandstone blocks with a borehole  in the block test, two independent stresses were applied to the block faces parallel to the wellbore, which simulated horizontal stress anisotropy under downhole conditions  drilling fluid, with and without lcm, was pumped into the wellbore to simulate breakdown, mud loss, and fracture sealing  the types of tests performed include: • breakdown down tests under different stress anisotropy and magnitude to establish the baseline results and to validate the results with rock mechanics • remedial treatment with lcm added after breakdown when fractures are induced, and preventive treatment with background lcm in active mud to study effectiveness of preventive versus remedial treatments • fracture sealing and strengthening of induced fractures versus pre-fractured rock blocks of different fracture apertures  2  application: to increase the mud weight window and to allow drilling of otherwise un-drillable wells without lost circulation or well control issues  3  results, observations, and conclusions: some of the results, observations and conclusions from the several thousand tests are: 1) if the lcm blending and concentration are designed correctly, the fracture sealing pressure is always higher than the breakdown pressure; 2) preventive treatment is more effective than remedial treatment, especially for depleted formations; 3) filter-cake quality appears to have a strong effect, which is consistent with model predictions; 4) minimum lcm concentration are required to quickly form a seal strong enough for a given fracture aperture; 5) recommendations on lcm sizing and concentration for given fracture apertures  4  significance of subject matter valuable lessons have been learned from this comprehensive experimental study  the results have produced design software and have significantly increased the success of wellbore strengthening | 
167963-ms 	 fracture gradient from leakoff test: pitfalls of using lot data from nonvertical wells |leak-off tests (lots) are routinely performed by the drilling industry after drilling a few feet below a new casing shoe  the recorded leak off pressure (lop) primarily establishes the upper mud weight (mw) limit for the next hole section   field-wide lop data usually show some spread at a given depth  lower bound trend of lop data is used as the base case for fracture pressure prediction and planning of future wells  for the field under study, lops obtained at the 9 5/8” casing shoe show a scatter of 800 psi (2 ppg mw equivalent)  the average depth of the casing shoe is ~7900 ft and the lops are spread over a depth interval of only 260 ft  in such a situation, taking the lower bound of lop data for fracture gradient estimation may lead to an overly conservative well design  from a drilling perspective, narrow margin drilling conditions would be invoked in what is really not a narrow drilling window situation  the study investigated the scatter in the lops to understand the cause in terms of rock mechanics, well trajectory and in-situ stresses  the study indicated that lops measured in inclined wells may need an ‘adjustment’ prior to use for predicting fracture pressures for future wells with a different inclination or azimuth  the reported lops are from boreholes scattered over the field having an inclination of ~45<u+00ba> and varying azimuths  attempts to understand the scatter in terms of subtle differences in lithology and pore pressures at the casing shoe failed  however, a careful analysis of the well trajectory with respect to the orientation of in-situ stresses successfully explained the differences in measured lop values, assuming they represent initiation of new tensile fractures rather than leak-off into existing fractures  the field is in normal faulting stress regime with anisotropic horizontal stresses  in such cases, the stress redistribution around a borehole is strongly influenced by the borehole geometry  to cause a leak-off in an unfractured intact formation, the bottom-hole pressure must overcome the tensile strength and the minimum principal stress around the borehole  due to stress redistribution, inclined wells in the direction of shmin yield higher lops compared to near-vertical wells or inclined wells in other orientations  for a given stress state and rock strength, different lops can be expected solely based on the trajectory of the inclined borehole w r t  in-situ stresses  this study highlights the caution needed in interpreting lop values in inclined wells drilled in different azimuths  depending on horizontal stresses anisotropy, lop measured in inclined wells may need a careful scrutiny of the trajectory vis-a-vis stress direction before consideration in well design for new wells  understanding tolerance of well trajectory to losses can help us drill deeper and safer |

167991-ms 	 selecting safe mud weight window for wellbore in shale while drilling using numerical simulation |description for drilling in the anisotropic rocks like shales which often have extensive microfractures and bedding planes, the analytical solutions solved for linearly elastic, isotropic rock are obviously not applicable  furthermore, the interaction between the drilling mud and host rock has to be considered when drilling in shales  the mud fluid pressure diffusion into the rock can have significant impact on the wellbore stability if the permeability of the rock matrix is high  the mud fluid can still penetrate/invade into the weak planes even if the rock matrix has ultra-low permeability  the pressure diffusion will change the effective stress near the wellbore thus directly influence the wellbore stability  the fluid penetration/invasion in the bedding planes can induce shearing slippage along the bedding planes/microfractures and/or cause rock strength deteriorated, thus leihading to wellbore instability application it is very challenging to work out analytical solutions for stress distribution and strength limit around the wellbore with all the aforementioned effects included, numerical modeling approach has to be used instead  actually, most major issues encountered in the drilling through shales can be resolved in numerical simulation, i e , the rock material can be realistically represented as anisotropic, heterogeneous material with nonlinear elastic-plastic constitutive behavior  the bedding planes can be included in the model directly  the significance of fluid penetration and fluid diffusion can be evaluated by performing fluid-mechanical coupling analysis  the strengthening or weakening effect of chemical additives can also be considered by realistically varying material strength as functions of time, mud pressure or any other parameters  the wellbore stability is assessed by solving equilibrium equations and constitutive laws at every point in the problem domain in real time so the inertial and transient effects are strictly respected results, observations, and conclusions the numerical code is validated in a couple of classic borehole problems  the collapsed borehole at the depth of 1200 m in the maastrichtian shale in the north sea field is revisited as a case study  the originally designed mud weight is assessed in the numerical model and a new mud weight is recalculated with impacts of microfractrues and bedding planes considered  the safe drilling of sidetrack wells in the maastrichtian shale is achieved with the recalculated safe mud window significance the bedding planes, anisotropic elasticity, time-dependent mechanical behavior introduced by fluid-mechanical interaction and rheology of rock formations, strength hardening/softening, etc  have tremendous impacts on the mud weight selection for safe drilling through shale  this work shows that a numerical code which can accommodate all these factors is a suitable tool for calculating safe mud weight with the said complications considered | 
167992-ms 	 analysis of spiraled borehole data using a novel directional drilling model |description of the material  the paper describes an analysis of the spiraling observed in four wells  the analysis relies on a novel borehole propagation model that results from considerations involving (i) a bit/rock interaction law linking the forces acting on the bit to its penetrations, (ii) kinematics relationships relating the bit motion to the local borehole geometry, and (iii) a beam model to determine the lateral force and moment at the bit resulting from the deflection of the bha imposed by the stabilizers  the model leads to the formulation of a set of delay differential equations to evolve the borehole inclination and azimuth, with the configuration of the bha embodied in the coefficients of the equations  the spatial delays reflect the borehole trajectory feedback introduced by the stabilizers  application  the analytical form of the evolution equations makes it possible to determine, via a linear stability analysis, the conditions leading to spiraling of the borehole  results, observations, and conclusions  the stability of the system depends essentially on the magnitude of a dimensionless parameter (the product of a bit property measuring its lateral steerability and the scaled weight-on-bit, reduced to account for the bit wear) in relation to a critical value, function of the positions of the stabilizers  the system is unstable, i e  spiraling of the borehole is likely to occur, if this dimensionless quantity is less than the bifurcation value  the equations indicate that instability is promoted by a shorter bit gauge, an increase of the bit wear, or a reduction of the weight-on-bit  this method has been validated with downhole data from four wells  in total, three vertical sections, an inclined section drilled with a bha is equipped with a push-the-bit rss system, and three building sections (two with a point-the-bit and one with a push-the-bit system) have been analyzed  for each of them, the model accurately predicts the appearance of spiraling  significance of subject matter  borehole spiraling impairs borehole quality, hampers well logging, reduces penetration rates, compromises zonal isolation, and delays well completions  using field data from four boreholes, this paper shows that spiraling can be predicted by studying the stability of the directional drilling system  the model can thus be used at the design stage to predict the stability features of a system and prevent or limit the appearance of borehole spiraling | 
167992-pa 	 analysis of spiraled-borehole data by use of a novel directional-drilling model |summary   this paper describes the application of a directional-drilling model to the phenomenon of wellbore spiraling and compares its predictions with field data  the spiraling tendency of a bottomhole assembly(bha) is determined from a stability analysis of the delay differential equations (ddes) that govern the propagation of a borehole  these propagation equations are derived from a novel mathematical model, constructed by combining a bit/rock-interaction law, which relates the force and moment acting on the bit to its penetrations per revolution through the rock; kinematic relationships, which link the bit motion to the local borehole geometry; and a model for the bha, which expresses the force and moment at the bit as a function of the external loads and the deflection imposed by the stabilizers  spatial delays, associated with the positions of the stabilizers, account for the feedback of the borehole geometry as the stabilizers interact with the wellbore  the analytical form of the propagation equations makes it possible to perform a stability analysis and determine whether borehole spiraling is expected  the coefficients of the propagation equations embody the characteristics of a particular drilling system; these include the bha configuration, bit properties, and the active weight wa, a reduced downhole weight on bit (wob) that depends on the actual downhole wob, the state of wear of the bit, and the rock strength  if the bit trajectory is unstable, then any perturbation in the borehole geometry is amplified gradually, eventually leading to the generation of a spiraled hole  the stability of the bit trajectory essentially is controlled by the magnitude of a dimensionless group, a function of the lateral steering resistance of the bit, the active weight, and properties of the bha, relative to a critical value that depends only on the bha configuration  predictions of the stability analysis are compared with field data from spiral holes pertaining to eight sections from four wells drilled with different bit types and bha configurations  the paper shows that the propensity of a bha to spiral can be estimated by the model by assuming reasonable values for parameters such as the lateral-steering resistance and the part of the wob transmitted by the cutter wear flats  this ability means that the model can be used to optimize bha designs and determine critical wob levels, both of which will mitigate the creation of spiraled holes |

168024-ms 	 degradable fiber pill for lost circulation in fractured reservoir sections |lost circulation is one of the main causes of nonproductive time during drilling and cementing operations  existing solutions are mainly based on particulates and are often added to drilling fluids to plug fractures or build up filtercake to cure losses  when applied for curing losses in reservoir sections, it is desirable that the plugging materials self-degrade to leave undamaged formation for hydrocarbon production while maintaining sufficient stability to allow well completion  the main challenge is designing the lost circulation material to provide plug stability and cleanup within a desired time frame over a broad bottomhole temperature range  fiber-laden fluids have shown good fracture plugging behavior, depending on fluid velocity and flow rate  to apply this concept to lost circulation applications, we designed a novel, fiber-laden fluid that can easily be prepared on surface, allowing compatibility with bottomhole assemblies at high flow rate  once inside the fracture, in conjunction with the decrease in velocity, fibers bridge and then plug the fracture, thus regaining circulation  the plug is formed by compacted fibers and particles, creating a strong structure inside the fracture  depending on the flow rate and the fracture aperture, the plugging can happen anywhere inside the fracture from a few inches to a few feet from the wellbore  this makes the formed plug more resistant against further drilling, reaming and casing or tool running operations  one of the main novelties of the system comes from the fibers that are specially designed to degrade in an adjustable time scale sufficient to ensure plug stability until the well is completed  with time, the plug undergoes further degradation, leading to nondamaged formation for production  the novel degradable solution has been successfully applied to three cases of total losses  in the first application, 75 barrels were prepared and pumped through the bottomhole assembly without recorded pressure increase, indicating good pumpability  full circulation was restored and the well was drilled to completion  the two other applications cured total losses in reservoir sections of a carbonate formation by pumping 50-barrel pills through open ended drillpipe  all plugs were designed to degrade within 7 to 10 days, the time required to complete the section drilled |

168028-pa 	 understanding the thermo-hydromechanical pressurization in two-phase (steam/water) flow and its application in low-permeability caprock formations in steam-assisted-gravity-drainage projects |summary   steam-assisted gravity drainage (sagd) is one successful thermal-recovery technique applied in alberta oil-sand reservoirs  when considering in-situ production from bitumen reservoirs, one must reduce viscosity for the bitumen to flow toward the production well  steam injection is currently the most promising thermal-recovery method  although steamflooding has proved to be a commercially viable way to extract bitumen from bitumen reservoirs, caprock integrity and the risk of losing steam containment can be challenging operational problems  because permeability is low in albertan thermal-project caprock formations, heating greatly increases the pressure on any water trapped in pores as a result of water thermal expansion  this water also sees a great increase in volume as it flashes to steam, causing a large effective-stress reduction  after this condition is established, pore-pressure increases can lead to caprock shear failure or tensile fracturing, and to subsequent caprock-integrity failure or potential casing failure  it is typically believed that low-permeability caprocks impede the transmission of pore pressure from reservoirs, making them more resistant to shear failure (collins 2005, 2007)  in considering the "thermo-hydromechanical pressurization" physics, low-permeability caprocks are not always more resistant  as the steam chamber rises into the caprock, the heated pore fluids may flash to steam  consequently, there is a vapor region between the steam-chamber interface penetrated into the caprock and the water region within the caprock which is still at a subcritical state  this study develops equations for fluid mass and thermal-energy conservation, evaluating the thermo-hydromechanical pressurization in low-permeability caprocks and the flow of steam and water after steam starts to be injected as part of the sagd process  calculations are made for both short-term and long-term responses, and evaluated thermal pressurization is compared for caprocks with different stiffness states and with different permeabilities  one can conclude that the stiffer and less permeable the caprock, the greater the thermo-hydromechanical pressurization; and that the application of sagd can lead to high pore pressure and potentially to caprock shear, and to subsequent steam release to the surface or potential casing failure |

168578-ms 	 factors controlling the simultaneous propagation of multiple competing fractures in a horizontal well |abstract   the use of multiple clusters per stage can reduce the number of stages needed to place a given number of fractures in a horizontal wellbore   however, there is concern that some of the perforation clusters may not propagate fractures at all as the fractures compete for frac fluid and fracture width  in this paper, the influence of various hydraulic fracturing design parameters and in-situ conditions on the resulting fracture dimensions and propagation patterns is studied  a 3d geo-mechanical model was built using abaqus to simulate the propagation of multiple competing fractures in a horizontal well   the reservoir was modeled as a porous elastic medium using pore pressure stress elements, and a plane of pore pressure cohesive elements was inserted at each perforation cluster to model fracture propagation   also, flow distribution among perforation clusters was simulated using a parallel resistors model    using this model, a number of simulations were run with a combination of perforation cluster spacing, number of perforation clusters, fracture height, frac fluid viscosity, pumping rate, young’s modulus of the target formation, and formation heterogeneity   the results demonstrated that increasing perforation cluster spacing or decreasing the number of perforation clusters reduced stress interference between the fractures, and more fractures propagated   a high frac fluid viscosity increased fracture widths and led to more stress interference   higher pumping rates led to longer and wider fractures, and to an increase in the number of propagated fractures   thicker target formations and taller fractures required wider perforation cluster spacing   additionally, a higher young's modulus of the target formation led to more fracture interference, suggesting wider cluster spacing   lastly, the introduction of any degree of heterogeneity significantly altered the fracture propagation patterns noted above    based on the results of these simulations, the following recommendations are made   first, there exists an optimum number of perforation clusters per fracture stage  this optimum depends primarily on the fracture design, the stage spacing and the mechanical properties of the formation   second, slick water fracs have a better chance (compared to more viscous fluids) of propagating uniform multiple fractures when closely spaced multiple perforation clusters are used   third, higher pumping rate should be adopted to ensure that a fracture propagates from all perforation clusters   fourth, even small scale heterogeneities should be considered, as they can significantly alter the fracture propagation pattern   lastly, when the target formation is relatively thick or has a high young’s modulus, a wider fracture spacing, a higher pumping rate, and a lower viscosity frac fluid should be used |

168582-ms 	 discrete fracture network generation from microseismic data using moment-tensor constrained hough transforms |abstract   reservoir simulation and prediction of production associated with hydraulic fracturing requires the input of the fracture geometry and the fracture properties such as the porosity and retained permeability  various methods have been suggested and applied for deriving discrete fracture networks (dfn) from microseismic data as a framework for modeling reservoir performance  although microseismic data is the best diagnostic for revealing the volume of rock fractured, its incompleteness in representing the deformation induced presents a challenge to calibrate and represent complex fracture networks created and connected during hydraulic fracture stimulation  we present an automated method to generate dfn models constrained by the microseismic locations and fracture plane orientations derived from moment tensor analysis  we use a hough transform technique to find significant planar features from combinations of the microseismic source locations  we have modified the technique by using an equal-probability voting scheme to remove an inherent bias for horizontal planes  the voting mechanism is a general grid search in the space of fracture strike, dip and location (, respectively) with grid cell sizes scaled by uncertainty estimates of  we constrain fracture orientations with weighting based on the moment-tensor orientations of neighboring events and their associated uncertainties  using two case studies, we demonstrate that our automated technique can reliably extract the complex fracture network based on good matches with the event cloud trends and the input moment tensor orientations  we also tested the sensitivity of the technique to event location uncertainty  with increasing location uncertainty, the details of the fracture network extracted are diminished with events grouping to larger scale features, but the general shape and orientation of the fracture network obtained is insensitive to the location uncertainty | 
168585-ms 	 poroelastic versus poroplastic modeling of hydraulic fracturing |abstract   with the increasing wide use of hydraulic fractures in the petroleum industry it is essential to accurately predict the behavior of fractures based on the understanding of fundamental mechanisms governing the process  the prevailing approach for hydraulic fracture modeling relies on linear elastic fracture mechanics (lefm)  generally, lefm that uses stress intensity factor at the fracture tip, gives reasonable predictions for hard rock hydraulic fracturing processes, but often fails to give accurate predictions of fracture geometry and propagation pressure in soft/unconsolidated formations  the reasons are that the fracture process zone ahead of the crack tip , elasto-plastic  material  behavior  and  strong  coupling  between  flow  and  stress cannot be neglected in these formations  recent laboratory testing has revealed that in many cases fracture propagation conditions cannot be described by traditional lefm models  rather, fractures develop in cohesive zones  in this study, we developed a fully coupled poroelastic and poroplastic hydraulic fracturing model with cohesive zone method which is able to model crack initiation and growth considering process zone effects  the impact of formation plastic properties on fracture process is investigated for both short term and long term injection and the results are compared with elastic formation  in addition, the main factors that affect the poroelastic backstress and the effects of formation plasticity on a hydraulic fracture are also investigated  the results indicate that both poroelastic backstress and formation plasticity lead to higher net pressure, but they have an opposite impact on fracture geometry  poroelastic backstress tends to reduce fracture width while formation plasticity tends to increase fracture width  it was also observed that plasticity can reduce closure pressure below minimum horizontal stress  poroelastic backstress is mostly controlled by the leak-off rate and formation permeability and the effects of plasticity are mostly influenced by in-situ stress, plastic properties and pore pressure  we also found that the effective toughness method which is used to quantify fracture process zone effect in soft formation tends to underestimate the fracture width and overestimate fracture length even if it can match the net pressure  ignoring plasticity in certain formations can lead to inaccuracy of fracture geometry, net pressure prediction and fluid efficiency calculations  the deviations of real fracture geometry from elastic formation model can have great impact on well production, especially in unconventional, low-permeability reservoirs  so for a more accurate modeling of fracturing in plastic formation, the whole affected region around the fracture should be considered, especially when the plastic deformation area is large  | 
168586-ms 	 comprehensive multiple fracture pressure analysis tests to appraise and develop unconventional organic-rich carbonaceous shales in north kuwait |abstract    a comprehensive diagnostic data-fracturing campaign (fracture pressure analysis: fpa) was undertaken by the gas fields development group (gfdg) of north kuwait in january-march 2013  the campaign involved executing fpas on the primary zone of interest (organic-rich carbonaceous shale: ocs) as well as underlying and overlying carbonates to establish “fraccability” and in particular the hydraulic frac vertical containment aspect, which are much needed for the successful planning of an appraisal program     this paper summarizes the resuts of those fpa tests and how the acquired data is used to calibrate the wellbore geomechanical model  this initial fpa campaign is the onset of a more comprehensive evaluation program planned for 2013 onwards  fpa sequences were executed on the ocs, underlying and overlying formations with encouraging results  the main concern was whether the ocs would yield hydraulic fracture (fracture initiation) below surface treatment pressure limitation of 13,500 psi (maximum allowable surface pressure)  the fracture initiation was successfully established in all three zones  in addition, multiple “fracture re-opening tests” were performed to evaluate the ranges of the fracture closure stresses during the leak-off  multiple down-hole memory gauges were utilized to ensure elimination of wellbore effects on treatment pressure  kcl-laden incompressible water-based fluid system enhanced with friction reducer was utilized in all three stages to ensure minimal friction loss and damage  this formation suite has very complex mineralogical attributes as it is a mixture of clastics, carbonates and hydrocarbons, with reservoirs that can be very tight (possibly at micro-darcy)     this campaign will lead to an optimal selection among the vertical completion options (hydro-fracturing design), and will help to successfully plan for horizontal well completions | 
168589-ms 	 impact of accurate fractured reservoir flow modeling on recovery predictions |abstract   the design and evaluation of hydraulic fracture modeling is critical for efficient production from tight gas and shale plays  the efficiency of fracturing jobs depends on the interaction between hydraulic (induced) and naturally occurring discrete fractures  we describe a coupled reservoir-fracture flow model which accounts for varying reservoir geometries and complexities including non-planar fractures, faults and barriers  in addition our model is coupled with linear elasticity using iterative coupling to solve a multi-phase biot system  the approach presented here is in contrast with existing averaging approaches such as dual and discrete-dual porosity models where the effects of fractures are averaged out  we model the fractures and reservoirs explicitly, which allows us to capture the flow details and impact of fractures more accurately  moreover, accurate modeling of solid deformations necessitates a better estimation of fluid pressure inside fracture, which our flow model provides  we utilize different flow models for the fractures and the reservoir closely capturing physics when needed  a quantitative comparison is made in order to identify situations where a multiphysics flow description is critical to accurate prediction compared to an averaging based approach  we present several numerical tests, including a field scale case study, to illustrate the above features and their impact on recovery predictions  | 
168589-pt 	 fracture propagation, fluid flow, and geomechanics of water-based hydraulic fracturing in shale gas systems and electromagnetic geophysical monitoring of fluid migration |abstract   we investigate fracture propagation induced by hydraulic fracturing with water-injection, using numerical simulation  for full 3d rigorous modeling, we employ a numerical method that can model failure due to tensile and shear stresses, dynamic nonlinear permeability, the dual continuum approach, leak-off in all directions, and thermo-poro-mechanical effects  from the numerical results, fracture propagation is not the same as propagation of the water front, because fracturing is governed by geomechanics, whereas water saturation is determined by fluid flow  at early times, the water saturation front is almost identical to the fracture tip, showing that the fracture is mostly filled with injected water  however, at late times, advance of the water front is retarded, compared to the fracture propagation, yielding a significant gap between the water front and the fracture top, which is filled with reservoir gas  we also find considerable leak-off of water to the reservoir  the inconsistency between the fracture volume and the volume of injected water cannot properly estimate the fracture length, when it is estimated based on the simple assumption that the fracture is fully saturated with injected water  as an example of flow-geomechanical responses, we identify pressure fluctuation under constant water injection, because hydraulic fracturing is itself a set of many failure processes, in which pressure drops every time when failure occurs  the fluctuation decreases as the fracture length grows  |we also study application of electromagnetic (em) geophysical methods, because the em geophysical methods are highly sensitive to changes in porosity and pore-fluid properties, such as water injection into gas reservoirs  we employ a 3d finite-element em geophysical simulator and evaluate the sensitivity of the crosswell em method for monitoring fluid movements in shaly reservoirs  for the sensitivity evaluation, reservoir models are generated through the coupled flow-geomechanical simulator and are transformed via a rock physics model into electrical conductivity models  it is shown that anomalous conductivity distribution in the resulting models is closely related with injected water saturation but little with newly-created unsaturated fractures  the numerical modeling experiments demonstrate that the crosswell em method can be highly sensitive to conductivity changes that directly indicate the migration pathways of the injected fluid  accordingly, the em method can serve as an effective monitoring tool for distribution of injected water (i e  migration pathways) during hydraulic fracturing operations | 
168591-ms 	 cement sheath integrity during hydraulic fracturing; an integrated modeling approach |abstract   recent arguments about the possibility of underground water pollution in particular regions have raised significant concerns regarding wellbore integrity during hydraulic fracturing in shallow formations  in this paper, we take a look at the containment of annulus cracks that might develop during hydraulic fracturing treatments  wellbore integrity is highly dependent on the integrity of the bonding between the cement and the formation as well as the bonding between casing and cement  cement heterogeneity resulted from unsmooth borehole surfaces, complex geological conditions, mud cakes, and cement contamination  excessive fluid pressure during hydraulic fracturing could provide the driving force not only for initiation and propagation of fractures in longitudinal and transverse directions, but also in cases of low confining pressure, it may lead to fracture propagation around the casing, i e  annulus cracks  a coupled three-dimensional poroelastic model with embedded cohesive zones is used to simulate different fracture propagation scenarios that may occur in vertical and horizontal wells during hydraulic fracturing stimulations  the cohesive layer theory is utilized to model initiation and propagation of transverse, longitudinal and delamination fractures  using the numerical analysis provided in this paper, few hydraulic fracturing cases were simulated by taking the advantage of the treatment pressure data and petrophysical logs, and the results were compared with the post-treatment radioactive tracer logs available for these wells | 
168594-ms 	 discrete element modeling results of proppant rearrangement in the cooke conductivity cell |abstract   the study of propped fracture conductivity began in earnest with the development of the cooke cell which later became part of the initial api standard   subsequent developments included a patented multi-cell design to conduct four tests in a press at the same time   other modifications have been used by various investigators   recent studies by the stim-lab proppant consortium have indicated that the flow field across a cooke proppant conductivity testing cell may not be uniform as initially believed which resulted in significantly different conductivity results   post- test analysis of low temperature metal alloy injections at the termination of proppant testing prior to the release of the applied stress suggest that higher flow fields may be expected along the top of the proppant pack compared to the middle of the pack due to modifications made to the original cooke cell design  to evaluate these experimental findings, a physics-based two-dimensional (2-d) discrete element model (dem) was developed and applied to simulate stress distribution in the cooke cell and proppant rearrangement during conductivity testing as a function of stress   numerical simulations of the testing apparatus are critical to understanding the impact of modification to the testing cell as well as understanding key proppant conductivity issues     the 2-d dem model was constructed to represent a realistic cross-section of the cooke cell with a distribution of four material properties, three that represent the cooke cell (steel, sandstone, square rings), and one representing the proppant  in principle, cooke cell materials can be approximated as assemblies of independent discrete elements (particles) of various sizes and material properties that interact via cohesive interactions, repulsive forces, and frictional forces  the macroscopic behavior can then be modeled as the collective behavior of many interacting discrete elements  this dem model is particularly suitable for modeling proppant mechanical interactions subjected to an applied stress, where the experimental cell is represented as a cohesive body composed of a large number of discrete elements, and proppants can be modeled as the individual discrete particles with various sizes (following the proppant size distribution-density function used in the test) that exhibit no cohesive strength between the particles    initial 2-d dem modeling results suggest that proppant rearrangement and non-uniform stress distribution can develop across the proppant pack due to square ring modifications  compaction along the edge of the proppant pack beneath the square ring seal result in a disproportionate lower flow field along these edges as compared to the middle of the proppant pack  these results suggest that reported conductivity values determined by the cooke cell may be biased to overestimate the actual conductivity of the proppant due to modifications to the standard cooke cell  such modifications should be carefully evaluated as to their consequences on determining the proppant conductivity |

168630-ms 	 enhancing recovery in shales through stimulation of pre-existing fracture networks |abstract   microseismic monitoring has become an attractive option for tracking hydraulic fracture stimulations because, unlike most other monitoring techniques, it can illuminate the behavior of fractures away from treatment wells  however, in most cases, the potential for microseismics in terms of developing an overall picture of fracture interactions within the reservoir is not fully exploited  based on the analysis of microseismicity associated with stimulations in naturally fractured shale reservoirs, we illustrate how, using advanced seismic signal analysis techniques, namely seismic moment tensor inversion (smti) approaches, we can stimulate a pre-existing fracture network  as well, we can identify: 1) the failure type, such as shear or tensile failure associated with rough fracture surfaces, 2) the fracture connectivity related to the number of intersecting fractures in a volume, 3) the fracture intensity based on the developed fracture lengths per volume, 4) the fluid flow pathways and enhanced fluid flow volume as related to the relative degree of open fractures, and 5) the distribution of fracture lengths (power law distribution)  based on our analysis, we identify that most failures observed are mixed-mode failures, typically shear-tensile with either crack opening or crack closure components of failure  the fractures themselves are generally related to the failure of pre-existing natural fractures rather than in the creation of new fractures  based on the finite sampling (bandwidth limitations), fracture sizes are limited to joint lengths and follow a power law distribution  by examining the spatial and temporal behavior of opening dominated failures, maps of over-lapping zones of potential enhanced fluid flow were identified  in many ways, stress induced fractures during single stages prepared the reservoir for subsequent stages that overall enhanced the interconnectivity and complexity of fractures thereby enhancing fluid flow opportunities  we further discuss, as outlined in these case studies, how, using smti, the microseismic data show that the stimulation program as designed achieved its objectives  overall, we further suggest that these defined seismic parameters can then be used to refine, validate and constrain geomechanical models used as input to reservoir models and further optimize well and stage spacing to effectively drain a reservoir and provide better defined reserve estimates | 
168632-ms 	 calibration of well logs with mini-frac data for estimating the minimum horizontal stress in the tight gas monteith formation of the western canada sedimentary basin: a case study |abstract   the determination of the minimum horizontal in-situ stress is one of the most important aspects in the characterization of geomechanical behavior of petroleum reservoirs, since a good knowledge of such stress is critical in many activities of practical importance, including design of hydraulic fracturing treatments and estimation of the distribution of minimum horizontal stresses for reservoir simulation purposes    the main objective of the study is to calibrate well logs with available mini-frac data for estimating the minimum horizontal stress in the tight gas monteith formation, nikanassin group of the western canada sedimentary basin (wcsb)  for deep formations like monteith, the minimum stress is generally horizontal  thus, the focus of this research is the minimum horizontal stress of the monteith formation    first, actual values of the minimum horizontal stress at different well locations are acquired from the analysis of surface pressure data during mini-frac treatments  next, the estimates calculated from an existing correlation and from actual minifrac data are matched for calibration purposes  finally, biot’s constant values are determined in order to generate a correlation applicable to the monteith formation  vertical biot’s constants ranging between 0 1 and 0 2 are obtained in this study  horizontal biot’s constant is assumed to be equal to 1 0    three vertical wells located in the same township with available compressional and shear sonic logs and mini-frac data are selected for this work  five additional wells in the same general area are selected to assist in the analysis  the monteith was hydraulically fractured in isolation in these wells  this aspect is important because there are many commingled completions in the area from which selective monteith data are not available  it is concluded that assuming a vertical biot’s constant equal to 1 0 is not appropriate for the monteith formation in the study area  the procedure presented in this paper is robust and has the potential to help obtaining more reliable values in other tight formations around the world |

168642-ms 	 limited height growth and reduced opening of hydraulic fractures due to fractureoffsets: an xfem application |abstract   hydraulic fracture propagation through a layered medium often exhibits a complex fracture path due to lateral shifting of the fracture path after passing through an interface  the existence of these offsets in the fracture path has been confirmed by mapping of mined fractures and by laboratory experiments  in addition to the stress contrast and material contrast, these offsets act as another mechanism for fracture-height containment  in order to investigate fracture height growth problem, we have considered a case of plane-strain fractures propagating from an injection point and propagating in a predetermined path  fracture offsets of a given length and angle are prescribed within the predetermined path  in this way, we parametrize the problem of fracture offsets in order to quantify their effects on the fracture height growth and fracture opening reduction at the fracture offset (pinching effect)  this is done while keeping a hydrostatic state of confining stresses in order to observe only the geometric effect of the fracture offset  we use a recently developed hydraulic fracturing code based on the extended finite element method (xfem)  this code solves the fluid flow in the fracture and the elastic response of the fracture in a fully coupled manner solving for the fracture velocity using the complete hydraulic fracture tip asymptotics    for different combinations of independent parameters (i e , formation moduli, far-field stresses, fluid injection rate, ratio of offset length to the length of the straight fracture and the offset angles) we investigate the effect on the fracture height growth and the reduction in fracture opening at the fracture offset  a detailed parametric study shows that while each parameter affects the fracture height containment, the fracture opening reduction is dominated by the fracture offset angle which is a geometric effect of the fracture offsets  this has a profound effect on the proppant bridging at the fracture offset |

168989-ms 	 statistical reverse model to predict mineral composition and toc content of marcellus shale |unconventional shale reservoirs possess low matrix permeability and cannot produce economically without effective placement of horizontal laterals and effective hydraulic stimulation  it is critical to recognize brittle units amenable to hydraulic fracturing and rich in organic matter  shale mineralogy affects not only the effectiveness of stimulation, but also the ratio of free to absorbed gas  heterogeneity in shale reservoirs expressed by mineral composition, organic matter richness and brittleness significantly influences shale-gas production  although providing the necessary information, core data and pulsed neutron spectroscopy (pns) logs are limited by cost considerations to an insufficient number of wells in order to sufficiently characterize reservoir heterogeneity  we present an approach of petrophysical analysis and statistic reverse modeling to better determine mineral concentration, organic matter percentage, and volume of gas and water using conventional logs in the marcellus shale (appalachian basin, usa)  core data and pns logs are utilized to guide and demonstrate the results  the statistically based reverse model incorporates random errors of logging, and solves mineral composition through matching the original logs with mineralogy models  the effectiveness of statistical reverse models is enhanced through removing the effects of minerals with significant petrophysical response (e g , barite) and fluids  barite strongly affects the mineralogical estimates in shale  the concentration of such minerals can be predicted by the difference between pe curve and a trend line  fluid volumes are predicted by a modified shaly-sand model with uranium concentration through understanding the effect of organic matter  the methodology proposed provides an approach to predict mineral composition and organic richness and the corresponding mineralogical properties (e g , geomechanical and free-to-absorbed gas ratio)  the proposed approach aids in recognizing geologic and engineering targets, designing horizontal well trajectories, targeting fracturing strategies and understanding shale depositional environments and processes  the proposed approach can be extended to other organic-rich shale reservoirs |

168991-ms 	 the potential effect of network complexity on recovery of injected fluid following hydraulic fracturing |it is believed that in many cases, hydraulic fracturing in shale causes the generation of a complex fracture network  one process that has been proposed as an explanation for network complexity is the termination of a propagating fracture when it reaches a preexisting fracture  fracture termination has been described in laboratory experiments and mine-back studies and could lead to branching of the fracture network, generating complexity  however, network branching process could lead to reduced fluid recovery  continuous pathways for flow must pass through fractures of a variety of orientations, with different closure pressures  we studied this process using cfrac, a hydraulic fracturing simulator that couples fluid flow with the stresses induced by fracture deformation in large, complex discrete fracture network models  simulations were performed with two different networks: (1) a complex, branching network of both new and preexisting fractures and (2) several linear, continuous fractures  the simulations show how fluid recovery can be drastically reduced by the closure of bottleneck fractures in the complex fracture network case  these results also demonstrate that identification of fracture "closure" from pressure transients at the wellbore does not necessarily indicate that open fractures are not remaining in the formation  this could have consequences for estimation of formation permeability and consequently for estimation of drainage volumes |

168994-ms 	 cross-correlating seismic attributes with cumulative production from horizontal wells in the middle bakken unconventional reservoir |the middle bakken reservoir is considered an unconventional play in the study area  the available 3d seismic shows the reservoir to be “thin” (below seismic resolution)  the reservoir depends on hydraulic fracturing to free hydrocarbons from the tight formation by creating a complex fracture network which cannot be measured by reflection seismic since the 3d seismic survey is shot before the drilling campaign  as a result, the relationship between seismic attributes and unconventional production is poorly documented and even more poorly understood  during analysis of one particular 3d seismic survey in the north dakota bakken play area, we recognized 16 seismic attributes that showed statistically robust correlations with cumulative productions from 19 middle bakken h1 wells (h1 indicating the initial horizontal production well in a particular dsu - drilling spacing unit) in the study area  this was accomplished via a workflow that exhaustively searched a set of 99 interpretation-based seismic attributes derived from the interpretation mapping software  these attributes, along with 2 engineering production parameters readily available (total length of completion intervals and number of stages) were passed into a multi-linear regression model where backward elimination was employed to eliminate the statistically redundant attributes  the final linear statistical models based on the extracted seismic attributes from wellbore completion intervals show that relative acoustic impedance is the only statistically significant attribute remaining (from the original 16 robust attributes) to predict the cumulative production in the study area   | 
168997-ms 	 from streamlines to fast marching: rapid simulation and performance assessment of shale gas reservoirs using diffusive time of flight as a spatial coordinate |current industry practice for characterization and assessment of unconventional reservoirs mostly utilizes empirical decline curve analysis or analytic rate and pressure transient analysis  high resolution numerical simulation with local pebi grids and global corner point grids has also been used to represent complex non-planar fracture geometry, conductivity and to estimate subsequent well performance  while the analytic tools are fraught with simplified assumptions, numerical simulation techniques are computationally expensive and do not provide the more geometric understanding derived from the depth of investigation and the drainage volume calculations  we propose a novel approach for rapid field-scale performance assessment of shale gas and shale oil reservoirs  our proposed approach is based on a high frequency asymptotic solution of the diffusivity equation in heterogeneous reservoirs and serves a bridge between simplified analytical tools and complex numerical simulation  the high frequency solution leads to the eikonal equation that governs the propagation of a ‘pressure front’ in the reservoir  the eikonal equation generalizes the depth of investigation to heterogeneous and fractured reservoirs and provides an efficient way to calculate drainage volume, pressure depletion and well performance  most importantly, the eikonal equation can be solved using the fast marching method which can be orders of magnitude faster than conventional numerical simulators  the speed and versatility of our proposed method makes it ideally suited for high resolution reservoir characterization through integration of static and dynamic data  the major advantages of the proposed approach are its simplicity, intuitive appeal and computational efficiency  we demonstrate the power and utility of our method using a field example that involves history matching, uncertainty analysis and performance assessment of a shale gas reservoir located in east texas  a sensitivity study is first carried out to systematically identify the ‘heavy hitters’ impacting the well performance  this is followed by a history matching and uncertainty analysis to identify the fracture parameters and the stimulated reservoir volume  a comparison of model predictions with the actual well performance shows that our approach is able to reliably predict the pressure depletion and rate decline |

169009-ms 	 microfracturing in tight rocks: a delaware basin case study |abstract   the geomechanical properties of an unconventional reservoir or shale, especially the minimum in-situ stress and fracture gradients, are important for several applications such as mud weight optimization and completion design  two common methods of direct stress testing are using a wireline formation tester (wft) with straddle packers and surface-pressure-based fracture injection tests (fits)    microfracturing was performed at several depths using a wft in tight clastic and shale oil formations in a well in west texas  in the same well, microfracturing was also performed using the fit method, and hence, the two results could be compared  imaging logs show many drilling-induced fractures in the target intervals, but formation testing with straddle packers did not provide any successful pressure measurements or formation fluid samples because of the low permeability and lack of a natural fracture network in the near-wellbore region  however, fractures were successfully induced in multiple zones by using the wft microfracturing tool, and the results compare favorably with the geomechanical logs  downhole quartz pressure gauges used with the microfracturing are very sensitive and can be used to calibrate surface-pressure-based fits  microfractures can be induced with less than a few gallons of drilling mud, and the pressure response is observed downhole without any frictional losses or time lag  in addition, the closure time derived from microfracturing is much shorter than the surface fit-based closure time; however, microfracturing entails additional rig time    in-situ stresses control the orientation and propagation direction of hydraulic fractures  microfractures are tensile fractures that open in the direction of least resistance  these fractures are also affected by hoop stress in the near-wellbore region, drilling induced fractures, and borehole breakouts  results indicate that stress gradients, which vary widely across the basin and lithofacies, are controlled by local and regional stresses  the stress gradients derived from microfractures are compared to sonic-log derived gradients and indicate that a symbiotic relation exists in calibrating and quality controlling sonic logs, image logs, and microfracture testing    intervals with drilling-induced fractures that extend beyond 3 feet tend to give lower stress gradients from microfracture testing and these zones should be avoided for microfracturing  existing natural open fractures reduce the ability of the wft tool to seal against the borehole and to create and propagate a fracture in the formation  the location of unaltered formation should be promptly identified for testing prior to entry into the borehole  this may entail having wellsite interpreters as data transmission speeds can pose a constraint while uploading and interpreting image logs offsite  sonic-log-derived models for stress gradients can be calibrated with pore pressure and overbalance from wft  stress gradients generated from microfracture testing can be used to calibrate parameters such as biot’s constant in the sonic stress gradient models derived from poroelastic theory  ideally, several lithofacies should be targeted for microfracturing to provide a representative stress profile  imaging logs run after microfracturing can give an indication of the extent and direction of microfractures | 
169012-ms 	 a sensitivity study of potential co2 injection for enhanced gas recovery in barnett shale reservoirs |abstract   shale gas production has been gaining worldwide attention over the past several years  this is due to the economic gas reserves using two current advanced technologies that are horizontal drilling and multistage hydraulic fracturing  shale has a high total organic content (toc) that may adsorb significant amount of natural gas  in addition, laboratory and theoretical calculations indicate that organic-rich shales adsorb co2 preferentially over ch4  hence, the extent of organic matter in shale plays an important role in determining the feasibility of co2 injection with potential benefit of enhanced gas recovery (egr)    the performance of co2 injection and ch4 recovery in shale reservoirs is a complex function of several engineering parameters including fracture half-length, fracture conductivity, and fracture height, operating parameters such as injection volume and injection time, and geologic parameters including reservoir permeability, porosity, and thickness  nevertheless, the effects of the above uncertain parameters on the process of co2-egr are not clearly understood and systematically studied  therefore, it is absolutely critical to quantify uncertainties and investigate the most important influential parameters controlling this process    in this paper, we employ numerical reservoir simulation techniques to model multiple hydraulic fractures and multi-component langmuir isotherms  two scenarios for co2 injection are investigated when the primary gas production decreases to the economic limit: (1) co2 flooding in two horizontal wells, and (2) co2 huff-n-puff in a horizontal well  a series of reservoir simulations based on design of experiment (doe) are performed on the best scenario to investigate the critical parameters that control this co2-egr process in the barnett shale  this work enables operators to plan ahead of time and optimize a tertiary shale gas production process by considering the different investigated influential parameters |

169079-ms 	 estimation of oil production rates in reservoirs exposed to focused vibrational energy |elastic wave-based enhanced oil recovery (eor) is being investigated as a possible eor method, since strong wave motions within an oil reservoir - induced by earthquakes or artificially generated vibrations - have been reported to improve the production rate of remaining oil from existing oil fields  to date, there are few theoretical studies on estimating how much bypassed oil within an oil reservoir could be mobilized by such vibrational stimulation  to fill this gap, this paper presents a numerical method to estimate the extent to which the bypassed oil is mobilized from low to high permeability reservoir areas, within a heterogeneous reservoir, via wave-induced cross-flow oscillation at the interface between the two reservoir permeability areas  this work uses the finite element method to numerically obtain the pore fluid wave motion within a one-dimensional fluid-saturated porous permeable elastic solid medium embedded in a non-permeable elastic semi-infinite solid  to estimate the net volume of mobilized oil from the low to the high permeability area, a fluid flow hysteresis hypothesis is adopted to describe the behavior at the interface between the two areas  accordingly, the fluid that is moving from the low to the high permeability areas is assumed to transport a larger volume of oil than the fluid moving in the opposite direction  the numerical experiments were conducted by using a prototype heterogeneous oil reservoir model, subjected to ground surface dynamic loading operating at low frequencies (1 to 50 hz)  the numerical results show that a sizeable amount of oil could be mobilized via the elastic wave stimulation  it is observed that certain wave frequencies are more effective than others in mobilizing the remaining oil  we remark that these amplification frequencies depend on the formation’s elastic properties  this numerical work shows that the wave-based mobilization of the bypassed oil in a heterogeneous oil reservoir is feasible, especially when combined with another eor method, such as wettability alteration by low-concentration surfactant injection  the extension of this research into a more realistic three-dimensional reservoir model would help determine the optimal locations and frequencies of wave sources that could maximize the volume of mobilized oil |

169572-ms 	 multi-stage hydraulic fracturing design in horizontal wells with the use of drill cuttings |successful multi-stage hydraulic fracturing of horizontal wells requires a clear understanding of the in-situ stress profile  this implies knowledge of rock properties and pore pressure variations throughout the wellbore  these properties can be determined with a good level of certainty when complete data sets are available  in practice, however, data scarcity from horizontal wells is the rule rather than the exception  this has led in most instances to performing multi-stage hydraulic fracturing jobs in symmetric intervals throughout the horizontal well without regard to the optimum locations where hydraulic fractures should be initiated  this study shows how data extracted from drill cuttings collected in a horizontal well can be used for optimizing multi-stage hydraulic fracturing  the cuttings are used in the laboratory for measuring porosity and permeability and for estimating geomechanical properties (e g  young modulus, poisson’s ratio, brittleness index)  the data permit generating the in-situ stress profile and pore pressure variations  a comparison is made of two cases in a horizontal well of the western canada sedimentary basin (wcsb), where only a gamma ray log is available: in one case drill cuttings are used for estimating geomechanical properties to select fracture initiation zones; in the other case symmetric fracturing stages are selected without giving consideration to geomechanical properties  the conclusion is reached that the petrophysical and geomechanical knowledge acquired from the study of drill cuttings leads to better rates and improved ultimate recoveries | 
169575-ms 	 simulation study of co2 huff-n-puff process in bakken tight oil reservoirs |abstract   advancements in horizontal drilling with hydraulic fracturing have enabled commercial oil production from bakken tight oil reservoirs  however, the primary recovery factor remains very low (less than 15%), resulting in the high volume of oil remaining in place  hence, it is extremely important to investigate the application of enhanced oil recovery methods  carbon dioxide (co2) injection as a huff-n-puff process is a preferred approach to improve oil recovery in tight reservoirs  in this work, we present the effect of co2 molecular diffusion and performed a series of sensitivity studies to quantify the impacts of reservoir properties such as permeability and fracture properties such as fracture half-length, fracture conductivity, number of fractures, and operation parameters such as co2 injection rate, injection time, soaking time, number of cycle of co2 huff-n-puff and co2 diffusivity on the co2 huff-n-puff process for enhanced oil recovery in the bakken formation    a numerical model was built using the typical reservoir and fracture properties from middle bakken to simulate co2 huff-n-puff process  in this process, we consider co2 molecular diffusion term to swell oil in matrix since darcy velocity is negligible due to low permeability  the numerical model was validated with field production data from a horizontal well in middle bakken  based on the history matching results, the relative permeability curves such as water-oil relative permeability and liquid-gas relative permeability, are obtained  furthermore, the wettability for the middle bakken is found to be weak water wet  simulation results show that the most important parameter is co2 injection rate, followed by co2 injection time, number of cycle, co2 diffusivity  the other parameters such as fracture conductivity, co2 soaking time, permeability and fracture half-length are less sensitive based on the range investigated in this study  the range for the incremental oil recovery factor at 30 years of production is obtained as 2 5% - 9 4%  this work can provide fundamental understanding of the key parameters controlling the co2 huff-n-puff process for enhanced oil recovery in the bakken formation |

170051-ms 	 evaluating the importance of geomechanical and reservoir properties when history matching 4d seismic data in sagd wells |it is becoming increasingly common to use 4d seismic surveys on sagd projects to characterize the steam chamber size, shape and growth  the use of this type of survey in history matching sagd simulation models has also grown significantly, allowing engineers to match not only the volumes, temperatures and pressures, but the shapes of the steam chambers as well  in the authors’ experience, however, before 4d seismic surveys can be used confidently to history match the steam chamber shapes, we need to understand what 4d seismic represents  prior proposals suggest steam or gas chamber volume, stress change volume or temperature change volume  to investigate this, the current study examines the impact of various physical property changes impacting the surveys (in particular, geomechanical effects), so that the appropriate 4d seismic history matching criterion are established    to determine how the above factors impact the 4d seismic surveys, this study investigates the relative impact of various property changes that occur in-situ during the sagd process, with the intent to determine what changes have the biggest impact on seismic velocity  a number of sagd simulation runs were conducted using typical oil sands geology with fully coupled geomechanics  afterwards, the change in pressure-wave velocity and shear-wave velocity at the simulation grid blocks at various times during the simulation was calculated  the property changes of temperature, pressure, stresses, saturations and fluid properties were also calculated, and then categorized in terms of the significance each factor has to the 4d seismic data  this categorization serves to identify the appropriate sagd history matching criterion, to improve the quality, confidence and predictability of a sagd simulation model | 
170053-ms 	 an integrated approach to building history-matched geomodels to understand complex long lake oil sands reservoirs, part 2: simulation |simulation is one of the most important and powerful reservoir engineering tools for understanding reservoir performance, devising operating strategies, and solving production problems  simple homogeneous models are suitable for understanding basic reservoir engineering parameters and for simple sensitivity analyses  however in real reservoirs with heterogeneities such as at nexen long lake, a comprehensive geomodel which includes all the available geology and geophysics knowledge is necessary in order to extract the greatest value from the simulation efforts    a geomodel is representative of the real reservoir if simulation of the geomodel is able to reproduce the production history of the reservoir (history matching)  for a typical sagd pad, the parameters to be matched include the injection and production rates, downhole injection pressures, and pressure and temperature of observation wells    based on our experience, for this process to be effective and reasonably timely a team consisting of the geologist, geophysicist, geomodeler, production and reservoir / simulation engineer must work interactively and in an iterative, “trial and error” fashion    the geomodelling part is presented in part 1(10), of this paper and in part 2 the simulation results are reviewed  the simulation process can be divided into three main parts - history matching, sensitivity analysis and forecasting  once the history matching part is done, the geomodel is ready to be used for the other two parts    high water saturation zones, also referred to as lean zones and top water, play an important role in different stages of a sagd project  a detailed strategy is necessary to deal with them and to optimize the production  simulation results show that one needs to be able to increase the total fluid rate and solve the sub-cool limitations at the time of contact with these lean zones    the stars thermal simulator from computer modeling group (cmg) was used to do all the reservoir simulations in this paper |

170062-ms 	 feasibility study of using transient temperature analysis to evaluate fracture length in cyclic steam stimulation process |in cyclic steam stimulation (css), steam is usually injected above fracturing pressure into oil sands to achieve desired injectivity; thus fractures are generally induced  the induced fractures will affect heating and flow patterns and thus affect the choice of well spacing and steam injection strategies  therefore, it is critical to evaluate fracture length for successful css projects    transient temperature analysis (tta) is a technique which uses well-bore transient temperature data to estimate reservoir/wellbore characteristics  this paper discusses the feasibility of using tta to evaluate the lengths of steam-induced fractures in cold lake oil sands by using wellbore transient temperature data in the soaking period of css  numerical simulation model was first established based on history matching production data of a typical well in cold lake oil sands  then the effect of different fracture lengths on temperature response in soaking phase was examined  simulation results shows, in the middle and later period of soaking phase, linear relationships are found when temperature drop versus square root time are plotted  however, the correlation between fracture length and the slope is not clear  based on the heated zone size and heated zone shape analysis at the very first moment of soaking phase, it is found the combined impact of reservoir permeability, reservoir thermal conductivity and fracture length determines the shut-in temperature response, which can be reflected on the slopes of the plots, with certain injection volume  but the qualitative representation of slope using fracture length, permeability and thermal conductivity cannot be found based on the results of finite difference based simulator due to the minor impact of fracture length on heated zone size and numerical dispersion  a more accurate simulation tool is recommended to explore the feasibility of using transient temperature analysis to evaluate fracture length in css process | 
170064-ms 	 understanding the impact of temperature-dependent thermal conductivity on the steam-assisted gravity-drainage (sagd) process  part 1: temperature front prediction |steam-assisted gravity drainage (sagd) is the preferred thermal recovery method used to recover bitumen from athabasca deposits in alberta, canada   in sagd, steam injected into a horizontal injection well is forced into the reservoir, losing its latent heat when it comes into contact with the cold bitumen at the edge of a depletion chamber   heat energy is transferred from steam to reservoir, reducing the viscosity of the bitumen, which flows under gravity toward a horizontal production well  conduction is the main heat transfer mechanism in early sagd, and reservoir thermal conductivity is a key parameter in conductive heat transfer   conductive heat transfer occurs at a higher rate across reservoirs with higher thermal conductivity, which in turn affects the temperature profile ahead of the steam interface   consequently, a reservoir with higher thermal conductivity will result in higher reservoir heating rates, and higher oil production rates  when the oil sands reservoir undergoes a temperature change from reservoir temperature to steam chamber temperature the thermal conductivity decreases up to 25% (depending on the initial reservoir and steam temperature), which affects the temperature profile and conductive heating within the reservoir   this study provides a modified butler’s model which includes a temperature-dependent thermal conductivity value  a simplified method is suggested using the thermal conductivity at average temperature of steam and reservoir will keep error under 1% for the range of sagd applications  this novel approach is the first of its kind to incorporate a temperature-dependent thermal conductivity within the reservoir to a sagd analytical model | 
170066-ms 	 environmental impact of bitumen extraction with thermal recovery |the continuous and growing demand for energy and carbon based products requires the extraction of massive bitumen resources  due to extremely high viscosities of bitumen, the most effective bitumen extraction methods are thermal enhanced oil recovery (eor) methods such as in-situ combustion (isc), steam assisted gravity drainage (sagd), steam flooding (sf), and hot water injection (hwi) which are known as environmentally unfriendly bitumen extraction methods  in this study, we investi-gated the environmental impact of in-situ bitumen extraction by isc, sagd, sf, and hwi, experimentally  the original oil, water, and rock, produced oil and water, and spent rock samples originated from each recovery method were analyzed through fourier transform infra-red (ftir) spectroscopy, inductive coupled plasma – mass spectroscopy (icp-ms), ph, viscosity, and api gravity measurements  the environmental impact was investigated according to the amount and content of produced water and gas samples and the quality of oil to reduce the impact during bitumen refining  the experimental results showed that while with isc, the least amount of water is produced; the produced water requires more severe treatment due to its high metal and sulfur contents, and low ph level  on the other hand, since the amount of the produced water for sagd, sf, and hwi is higher, the produced water management poses handling problems  the oil production from isc results in the greatest recovery with upgraded oil which will reduce the environmental impact for oil processing when compare to sagd, hwi, and sf  while all processes produced more or less the same amount of gases, sagd and sf have additional gas production due to steam generation  as conventional resources decline, it is essential to address environmental challenges to produce from these massive oil sand resources  in this study, the environmental impacts of bitumen extraction with thermal eor were examined extensively | 
170071-ms 	 oil drainage characteristics during the sagd process to explain observed field performance |the general concept of the sagd process is that a steam chamber first expands to the top of the reservoir and thereafter continues to grow by lateral expansion   consistent with this concept is the expectation that the steam oil ratio (sor) rises as the sagd operation matures, driven by expanding contact area and heat losses between the steam chamber and the overburden    however, analysis of a number of successful sagd projects, with operating histories of 10 years or more indicates that there is clear evidence that observed performance can deviate significantly from the performance predicted by the above concept  one particularly interesting set of observations shows a declining or unchanged sor at the mature stage   an examination of this sor behavior and several other unexpected sagd performance characteristics detected in the field are presented    it is proposed that the above field performance characteristics are consistent with the interpretation that the steam chamber does not rise to the top of the reservoir prior to expanding laterally   in these cases oil production is achieved by two different mechanisms: one is expansion of the steam chamber and the other is drainage of oil from the layer above the steam chamber  a simulation method and the results of a number of history matching studies are presented to explain the oil and gas flow in the layer above the steam chamber and its contribution to observed sagd performance | 
170073-ms 	 a new approach to stimulating thin and stranded oil sand reservoirs: a simulation study |several recovery processes have been proposed for heavy oil and oil sand reservoirs, depending on the reservoir and fluid properties  among these, steam-assisted gravity drainage (sagd) is widely used, and surface mining is considered the best approach in very shallow depths  however, deposits exist that are too shallow for sagd but too deep for mining, requiring special techniques to recover the hydrocarbon economically  in addition, significant reserves are left behind as stranded reserves, as well as reserves that are usually characterized with weak caprock integrity and without enough pay thickness for sagd to be economically viable  this paper focuses on a new technology that involves creating several mechanically induced inclusions in a single well  the production process is similar to a single-well sagd  this method is proposed to assist both more uniform steam injection and bitumen production processes  the current setup is developed for vertical well applications; however, upon successful planning, the next version will be employed for horizontal applications    the current system consists of a vertical well with multiple vertical inclusions, which are used for simultaneous steam injection and liquid production purposes  steam is injected into the upper part of the formation, and the drained liquid is collected at the bottom of the inclusions  unlike the conventional steam chamber geometry in sagd processes, steam moves outward from the inclusion faces into the formation and tends to move laterally out and vertically upward over time  simulation studies of the system show that the success of such a technique depends on the inclusion dimensions as well as injection rate and pressure  in this study, the effects of inclusion dimensions and steam properties on the performance of such a process are investigated  reservoir simulations of realistic reservoir conditions show promising results in terms of cumulative steam oil ratio (csor) and production rate  early peak oil production occurred at approximately 100 days from the startup, and the csor dropped to under 3 m3/m3 after 100 days  the optimum inclusion dimensions and the best injection scenario for different net pays at different depths and geological conditions are illustrated in the paper  |

170104-ms 	 the polymer in polymer flooding: is its value overestimated? |reservoir recovery processes are complex and typically entail several physical or chemical mechanisms  polymer flooding has often been depicted to be dominated by one mechanism:  water viscosification reduces the mobility ratio, and stabilizes the displacement front to increase oil recovery  increasingly though the contribution of mechanisms other than water viscosification is becoming understood  this paper points out two novel insights into polymer flooding: (1) the intrinsic value of the polymer is likely being overestimated and (2) the practice of operating the polymer flood with incomplete voidage replacement may indeed be optimal    the conversion of a conventional waterflood to a polymer flood entails significant injectivity reduction, up to 50% or more  the maintenance of complete voidage replacement (vrr = 1) would thus require an increase in the number of injectors, or a reduction of total production rate or both  as both interventions reduce the economic returns, most projects operate with incomplete voidage replacement (vrr < 1)  we have previously reported that a vrr < 1 improves the waterflood response of heavy oil reservoirs   thus using the vrr = 1 waterflood as the comparison benchmark to the polymer response may overestimate the value of viscosification – the intrinsic value of the polymer  to quantify this, we have performed numerical simulations of polymer flooding for vrrs ranging from 0 4 to 1 4, deconvolving the relative contributions of the viscosification and vrr < 1 mechanisms   we observe that a polymer flood operated with vrr > 1 (above the oil bubble point) underperforms a polymer flood with a vrr < 1 by as much as one third  we conclude that the intrinsic value of the polymer is overestimated |

170114-ms 	 caprock integrity analysis during a sagd operation using an anisotropic elasto-plastic model |massive steam injection during a steam assisted gravity drainage (sagd) operation results in significant changes in pore pressure, temperature, stress and volumetric strain in the reservoir sand  these changes trigger the deformation and stress redistribution of the overburden strata, which could lead to containment breach of the caprock through shear or tensile failure  isotropic models have commonly been used to assess caprock integrity  these models are believed to be deficient in capturing the anisotropic response of shale and mudstone, which has been well documented in applications other than sagd caprock studies    we developed an iteratively coupled hydro-thermo-mechanical model to evaluate caprock integrity in sagd reservoirs by coupling a geomechanical model (flac) and a thermal reservoir simulator (cmg stars)  we investigated the impact of sagd operations on stress distribution in the caprock using an anisotropic model that we implemented in flac  we repeated the analysis by using the same tool and model, but with the assumption of isotropic shale, and compared the results  incorporating anisotropy in the model showed an impact on the state of caprock stress and failure pressure of the caprock  it was concluded that shale anisotropy cannot be neglected in caprock integrity investigations | 
170122-ms 	 on the use of particle size distribution data for permeability modeling |particle-size distribution (psd) is a list of values that defines the relative amount of particles present according to the size in a sample  the psd of the mcmurray formation sediments characterizes rock granulometry and is a fundamental indicator of sediment’s nature   the size distribution of the component solid particles in the mcmurray formation sediments relates to their porosity, volume of water and bitumen contained within the pore space, and to depositional environment, including lithological association, stratigraphy, aerial distribution, and associated physical processes    particle size distribution is known to be a significant factor for evaluating bitumen recovery from an oil sands mine  this is because presence of fines (evaluated by psd analysis) affects the hot water separation process, processing plant recovery prediction and provides grade control  presence of more fines translates into lower recovery from commercial oil sands processing  in this paper we investigate whether the particle size distribution should be also considered a critical parameter for evaluation and estimation of permeability of an oil sands reservoir    we show using the data from the cenovus energy’s telephone lake lease that there is a strong relationship between permeability and particle size distribution data  we also show that the information provided by the psds for permeability prediction is more significant than the one inferred from a simple porosity-permeability relationship  subsequently, we comment on permeability modeling using particle size distribution data and list the techniques available for cleaning and modeling of multivariate psds    we document a methodology for accurate modeling of psds and provide a workflow for incorporating these data in improved understanding and modeling of permeability and its distribution |

170132-ms 	 a numerical investigation of the hydraulic fracturing mechanism in oil sands |this paper describes a numerical investigation of hydraulic fracturing in oil sands during cold water injection  previous studies have shown that hydraulic fracturing in unconsolidated or weakly consolidated sandstone reservoirs is highly influenced by the low shear strength of these materials and is quite different from competent rocks  as such, existing classical hydraulic fracture models are incapable of predicting the fracturing process of weak sandstone reservoirs  this paper presents a numerical tool to simulate hydraulic fracturing in oil sands and weak sandstone reservoirs    a smeared fracture approach is adopted in the simulation of tensile and shear fracturing in oil sands  the model incorporates various phenomena expected in hydraulic fracturing, including poroelasticity and plasticity, matrix flow, shear and tensile fracturing and concomitant permeability enhancement, saturation-dependent permeability, stress dependent stiffness and gradual degradation of oil sands due to dilatant shear deformation and strain localization    the results of the hydraulic fracturing simulation indicate that poroelasticity as well as shear fracturing can result in breakdown and propagation pressures larger than the maximum in-situ stress  applying such pressures in fracturing operations can compromise the caprock integrity  it is found that at injection pressures below the vertical stress, saturation-dependent relative permeability and the development of shear fractures in the reservoir highly influence the injection response |

170192-ms 	 contribution of geomechanics in evaluation of heat transfer mechanisms at mobile zone of sagd and es-sagd |efficient recovery of heavy oil and bitumen in western canada has widely been applied with thermal-based processes  the well-known steam-assisted gravity drainage (sagd) takes advantage of the strong dependency of bitumen viscosity on temperature ranging from 10 to 250 °c  the latent heat of injected steam is released as the steam chamber develops and causes the bitumen to mobilize and drain under the effect of gravity toward the production well  co-injection of solvent with steam (es-sagd) may help to reduce the oleic phase viscosity adjacent to chamber edge by offsetting the temperature reduction effect    while many researchers are currently tackling the optimal operational conditions from a fluid property point of view (pressure, solvent fraction, etc ), less attention was paid to the impact of heat transfer due to incorporation of geomechanics into occurring physics  such simplifications in analyzing the real processes physics would result in neglecting of the convection flow of heat along with conduction  considering the dramatic changes in temperature at the chamber edge, the induced thermal geomechanical responses would lead to a faster fluid movement  the fluid mobility at the edge of chamber would even increase more, mainly because of temperature-dependant heat capacity of water, changes in absolute and relative permeabilities, and possible wettability alteration   if a multi-component solvent is used (es-sagd), the assessment of production performance would get more complicated due to the different condensation dynamics of light versus heavy components and the possible gas-blanket effect caused by the co-injected solvent    in this study, the geomechanical changes due to pressure and temperature effects were considered at the steam chamber, for both sagd and es-sagd scenarios  the thermo-poro-elasticity concept, with elastic constitutive rock behaviour, was chosen for geomechanical study  the primary impacts of geomechanics on the physics of es-sagd were rock and fluid alterations, and changes in petrophysical properties (porosity and absolute permeability)  assuming a potential change in rock and fluid interaction due to geomechanics, the same analysis was conducted for a multi-component solvent with different condensation profiles  it was shown how the use of solvent will adversely affect the induced thermal geomechanics contribution  the findings of this paper can be used as a guideline for further experimental studies on the effect of geomechanics in thermal-based recovery processes |

170651-ms 	 fracture characterization of a carbonate reservoir by dfn modeling: a case study |abstract   one of the main challenges in development of the fractured reservoirs is the identification of “sweet spots” which are the most intensely fractured areas of a field, maintaining a long term production with minimized risks in drilling  this paper presents a multi-disciplinary approach including g&g (geology & geophysics), petrophysics and reservoir engineering perspective to overcome this difficulty in a particular oil reservoir by defining the fracture systems that mainly contributes to the hydrocarbon storage capacity and flow dynamics    sambayat field is one of the most important naturally fractured carbonate reservoirs located in the southeast turkey  reservoir zones in the field include a number of reverse, synthetic and antithetic faults and related fracture sets which are hydraulically in contact with each other  in this context, characterizing the fracture network becomes the most critical issue in the analysis of production and the development strategy of the field    for this purpose; besides the conventional open-hole log analyses, image log interpretations have also been performed in order to evaluate the properties of the fractures  to honor these interpretations; dynamic (drill stem test & production) and static (outcrop & core) data have been evaluated together  distributions of the petrophysical properties and the fractures have been done by using stochastic methods in full-field scale  at the end of the modeling study, a dual porosity geological model has been generated by using the discrete fracture network (dfn) approach with respect to the estimated fracture characteristics    as the result of the previous characterization study, new well locations and their optimized orientations had been determined and the results coincided with the expected types of fractures estimated in the dfn model  after updating the model with the new well data and the enhanced functionalities in the modeling software, additional well locations have been proposed which will play a role in one step further of the study; simulation    this study has contributed to our knowledge about the characteristics of a naturally fractured carbonate reservoir which is similar to the ones explored in southeast turkey and to some extend in middle east  it should also be noted that, our approach in this particular study is a newly developing technique and could be used for the promising “previously overlooked” unconventional reservoirs    introduction   sambayat oil field is located in the southeastern part of turkey covering an area of 3 5 km2 (figure-1)  the field was discovered in 2008 by using 2d seismic data interpretation  after putting the first well on production, new wells had been drilled to define the extent of the reservoir which showed different aspects in terms of reservoir performance when compared with the nearby fields in the basin  most of the wells started production with higher rates than expected and the test results showed that reservoir has complex fault and fracture systems which have an important role not only in the fluid flow but also in the storage of fluids with a connected fracture network system |

170703-ms 	 estimating sand production volume in oil and gas reservoir |abstract   sand control techniques are widely used in industry to prevent sand production   however these techniques significantly increase completion cost and complexity as well as can potentially impact production and field economics   hence it is preferred not to install sand control if one can be assured that the sand volume which will be produced is manageable   however, there are no tools or workflows which can consistently and accurately predict the expected sand volume and timing over the life of the field without a large range of uncertainty    in this study, sand production characteristics were tested in three different sandstone outcrops under varying fluid flow conditions   the test results show different sanding behavior for brine, oil, and gas flow   samples tested with brine fail catastrophically when stress is applied which slightly exceeds the onset of sand production stress   samples with gas flow produce small amounts of sand even when the stress significantly exceeds the onset of sand production   the test results also demonstrated the importance of drawdown pressure on sand production, where an increase in drawdown has the potential to significantly increase the sand production   subsequently both numerical and empirical models were developed to estimate and predict sand production volume   these models have been able to model field sand production cases reasonably well   introduction   risk of sand production is considered to be a major economic and technical issue in field developments with large expected drawdowns, depletion or relatively unconsolidated rock   unnecessary sand control leads to expensive completions and potentially high skins which can result in lower productivity and poor recovery   however, inadequate sand control may lead to sand production problems   the produced sand can erode and damage downhole and surface equipment, including downhole pumps, chokes and flowlines   produced sand may also fill the wellbore, restrict production, and require costly workovers and cleanup operations     historically, downhole sand control equipment is installed to eliminate sand production from these formations   as reserves are discovered in ever more challenging environments, such as deep water, heavy oil, and high-pressure/high-temperatures, well completions are required to balance multiple conflicting operational and business drivers   traditional downhole sand control methods can significantly increase the complexity and cost of the completions which can challenge the field development economics   for these reasons, allowing some sand production and managing sand on surface has gained momentum in recent years [1-3]     in order to manage sand on surface, predicting the onset of sand production is not sufficient   significant effort in the industry has been focused on modeling the evolution of sand production with time both experimentally and theoretically [4-9]   sand production is a complex process   sand production rate and volume are not controlled only by geomechanical factors, such as rock strength and stresses, but are also influenced by hydrodynamic processes   reservoir depletion, changing production rate, increasing water cut, and changing gas-oil ratio over the well life all influence the sand production rate and volume    therefore modeling and predicting sand production rate and volume over time is much more problematic than predicting the onset of sand production |

170714-ms 	 integrated analysis for fracture identification during hydraulic fracturing |abstract   in order to improve our understanding of the interaction of the hydraulic fracture with pre-existing structures in reservoirs, we focused on separating microseismicity related to the hydraulic fracture propagation and microseismicity occurring along the pre-existing structures  we analyzed microseismic activity detected during the stimulation job in a horizontal well with ten stages  the microseismicity aligns in two major trends, e-w and ne-sw  the microseismicity in the ne-sw trend is aligned with the maximum horizontal stress and is related to the hydraulic fracture propagation  the e-w trend is related to the interaction of the hydraulic fracture with the pre-existing structures in the area  some stimulated stages show very clear and distinguished spatial separation of microseismicity related to the two trends while some stages have more complex pattern  we combine several techniques that help to distinguish various types of seismicity: data set separation, geomechanical, magnitude-frequency, and well pressure analyses   the synthesis of the various methods helps to improve our understanding of the well stimulation  overall, we almost doubled the number of hydrofractures and fault/fracture zones in comparison to the original interpretation based only on the microseismic mapping and we better constrained the half-lengths of the hydraulic fractures  the detailed data analysis strongly suggests that some hydraulic fractures may be aseismic    introduction   the intersection of the pre-existing fractures during the well stimulation can cause fluid loss into the fracture and therefore unnecessary cost  depending on the local situation, the leak of fluid along the pre-existing structures can also cause an environmental harm  in terms of production, pre-existing fractures can act as a conductive zone    we analyze microseismic activity detected during the stimulation job in a horizontal well containing ten stages  the microseismicity aligns in two major trends, e-w and ne-sw (figure 1)  only some stages show clear development of the hydraulic fracture when other stages are at least partially aseismic (in a sense “not detected by a surface array”)  in some stages, microseismic activity increases towards the end of pumping and continues strongly afterwards (figure 2)  the questions related to this data set are summarized as:   the two main microseismic trends seem to be related to two different processes: the hydrofracture propagation and the reactivation of the pre-existing fractures  can we separate microseismicity related to the two processes? the hydraulic fracture will most likely propagate in the different direction than is the orientation of pre-existing faults/fractures  does the separation help to determine the length of the hydraulic fracture? |are the aseismic areas an aseismic hydraulic fracture or an unstimulated area? |why each stage has different microseismic activity? is it due to the local conditions? |why is microseismicity recorded mainly towards the end and after the end of pumping?   microseismic data sets are often very complex and difficult to understand  this is due to the fact that the stress field is varying in the reservoir during the reservoir stimulation and that the reservoir is heterogeneous  these conditions change from reservoir to reservoir and even from well to well causing thus that the microseismic data sets are often incomparable   very often, however, a complex microseismic data set is attempted to be interpreted as a single physical process or in a statistical manner  we would like to make a point that it is important to understand the data set and to separate microseismic data related to either different physical process prior the interpretation |

170721-ms 	 diagenetic influence of aqueous co2 on fracture conductivity of shaly rocks |abstract   most sedimentary rock formations (tight or highly porous) have geochemical characteristics that can lead to significant reactive ion exchange processes in aqueous media in the presence of carbondioxide  while geomechanical properties such as rock stiffness, poisson’s ratio and fracture geometry largely govern fluid flow characteristics in deep fractured formations, the effect of mineralization can lead to flow impedance in the presence of favorable geochemical and thermodynamic conditions  shale caprock which seals more than 60% of oil and gas reservoirs have natural fractures that are unevenly distributed in the geosystem   experimental works which employed the use of analytical techniques such icp-oes, xrd, and sem/eds techniques in investigating diagenetic and micro-structural property of crushed shale caprock/co2-brine system concluded that net precipitation reaction processes can affect the distribution of petrophysical nanopores in the seal rock  the results showed that geochemical precipitates can be formed such that fluid flow through open micro and macro fractures may be constrained  simulation results reported by various researchers suggested that influx-induced mineral dissolution/precipitation reactions within shale caprocks can continuously close micro-fracture networks, while pressure and effective-stress transformation first rapidly expand then progressively constrict them  this experimental research investigates the impact of in-situ geochemical precipitation on conductivity of open micro-fractures under geomechanical stress conditions  fracture conductivity in core samples of shale caprock with known mineralogical composition from different formations where co2 injection is on-going are quantitatively evaluated under axial and radial stress using pressure pulse-decay liquid permeametry/core flooding systems  modeling of the diffusion controlled fluid flow and induced fracture diagenetic alterations in the shale caprocks can be performed using cmg-gem with artificial core imposing axial and radial geomechanical stress  the possibility of rock-fluid geochemical interactions constricting natural fracture conductivity in long term subsurface co2 sequestration can lead to significant improvement in shale caprock seal integrity and mitigate injection induced geomechanical perturbation    key words: fracture diagenesis, conductivity loss, aqueous carbondioxide, shale geochemistry, geomechanics | 
170733-ms 	 dependence of organic pore wettability on kerogen maturity: a water droplet microscopic simulation study |abstract |wettability in the organic pores of shales, known as kerogen, is essential information required for hydrocarbon estimation, multiphase flow transportation modeling, and the prediction of the recoveries and placement of hydraulic fracture water, especially in intermediate maturity oil shales  the process of kerogen maturation is accompanied by the loss of functionalized molecules, leading to a reduction of h/c and o/c values  these ratios are typically reflected in the van krevelen diagram and are used to classify types of kerogen depending on their maturity degree  recent studies have documented laboratory evidence of water content in kerogen  this leads to key questions of whether kerogen may have mixed-wet characteristics and how it is likely to depend on kerogen maturity  |in this paper, we present a pore-scale study analyzing the role of kerogen maturity on the wettability of organic pore systems  the traditional graphene model is chosen as a proxy for the organic matter  by grafting varying amounts of functionalized groups onto this surface, we construct the kerogen with varying degrees of maturity  we then study droplets of pure water on different surfaces and determine contact angles to quantify wettability  |we find that the contact angle variations of water droplets have a strong dependency on kerogen maturity  as the density of the surface functionalized groups increases, the wettability in kerogen could possibly be altered from hydrocarbon-wetting, to neutral-wetting, or even become hydrophilic  additionally, we also demonstrate that there is a critical density of surface functionalized groups beyond which the kerogen pore system may be considered to be largely water-wet when water forms sheets adjacent to the pore wall  our results indicate that the wettability in kerogen is very likely to be mixed-wetting  |introduction |shale resources are vast and abundant worldwide  in the united states, the organic-rich shale plays are vital to domestic energy supply and currently constitute the most productive oil and gas fields (eia 2013)  the tremendous growth in development activity is mainly due to the utilization of horizontal well drilling and hydraulic fracturing to enlarge contact volume in these extremely low permeability reservoirs  the underlying production mechanisms, however, are not fully understood  multi-disciplinary research focused on shale geomechanics and petrophysics, modeling of transport and storage, completions design and drilling continue to be driven by the considerable knowledge gaps in our understanding of shales  |the low recovery of hydraulic fracture water is one of the several key observations that remains poorly understood  for the haynesville shale, recoveries as low as 5% have been reported while for the barnett and marcellus shales, the recovery of hydraulic fractured water tends to approach values closer to 50% (king 2012)  the possible answers to this could be partly related to the mixed wettability characteristics of shales (elijah 2011) and high capillary forces (sondhi et al  2011), as they may lead to counter-current imbibition of water when shales are exposed to hydraulic fractured water (qin 2007)  hence, our current wettability study could provide some insights into this issue  |quantification of shale gas-in-place estimates includes free, adsorbed, and solution gas (ambrose 2011)  the free gas is usually stored in the inorganic matrix where relatively larger pores and fractures exist  the adsorption phenomena are considered to be restricted to kerogen, which is the organic material and is finely dispersed within the inorganic matrix (akkutlu et al 2011)  the significant amount of surface areas in the organic matter provides sufficient space for adsorption and the importance of it to the total gas-in-place estimates has been recently reported in xiong et al  (2012), fathi et al  (2012)  in addition, the pore confinement has an important impact on the amount of adsorption (diaz-campos 2010) and could possibly change phase behavior substantially (sapmanee 2011, devegowda et al  2012, didar 2012, firincioglu 2013, travalloni et al  2013)  wettability is an important rock property as it affects the hydrocarbon in-place estimation and the quantity of hydrocarbon recovered  our current view of the inorganic pore systems is water wetting in shales (elijah 2011)  however, the wettability in the organic matter is still a topic that is not fully understood  | 
170746-ms 	 experimental and analytical core and geomechanical data analysis of a tight oil carbonate formation |abstract |unconventional resources around the world and particularly in north america have been revitalized as a result of advancements in hydraulic fracturing and horizontal wellbore technology  this has created a new wave of hydrocarbon exploration, exploitation and development in most of the tight hydrocarbon plays in western canada  the multidisciplinary (geochemistry, geomechanics and geophysics) approach and the use of nanotechnology in the petroleum industry have not only helped us to improve our knowledge and understanding of these tight and complex reservoirs and their associated systems, but have also resulted in an upsurge of hydrocarbon recovery  |this study focuses on the results of several analyses performed on different core samples from the swan hills formation, which is predominantly a calcium carbonate oil reservoir in the western canadian sedimentary basin  routine and special core analyses of the core plugs were conducted to determine reservoir properties, including bulk and skeleton density, porosity by helium pycnometry, and pore size distribution by mercury injection capillary method (micp)  stress-dependent permeability of the rock (matrix) was measured using the pulse decay permeability method  triaxial compression tests were also conducted to determine the young’s modulus and poisson’s ratio, compressive strength, and residual strength after peak failure  linear mohr–coulomb failure envelopes (cohesion and friction angle) were also constructed for the intact rock and the rock after failure  furthermore, short-term and long-term conductivity of acid etched fractures were measured  |empirical and theoretical correlations were used to model short- and long-term stress-dependent acid fracture conductivity  nierode-kruk’s model was found to best fit the laboratory data among all models  constants in nierode-kruk’s model that depend on rock embedment strength and dissolved rock equivalent conductivity are reported  effects of different acid concentrations on permeability and conductivity were discussed in detail  creep testing was performed to determine time-dependent deformation of samples under confining stress  it was found that creep strain is dominated by primary creep stage  time-dependent creep deformation is minimal for tested samples under various confining pressures  mineralogy, rock fabric and wormhole growth were investigated using x-ray diffraction (xrd), scanning electron microscope (sem) and computed tomography (ct) scanning techniques  |introduction |this study analyzed 10 core samples from two different wells in the swan hills formation (fig  1), a prolific oil reservoir in central alberta  both studied wells are vertical wells located in the same township and range in the swan hills area and are labelled as well a and well b in this paper  true vertical depths of selected core samples for well a and b are 2,450-2,477 m and 2,514-2,549 m respectively  the purpose of this study is to quantify the formation, elastic, mechanical and inherent properties of studied samples so these can be compared to field conditions  this study also discusses limitation of data and constraints on the use of data  opertaionally, the presented data can be used in this and geologically analogous areas to optimize drilling and completion programs, to mitigate downhole problems and for future drilling  additionally this data can be useful for production forecasting and reserve evaluations | 
170749-ms 	 evolution of porosity, permeability, and fluid saturations during thermal conversion of oil shale |abstract   the in-situ conversion process, called icp, is a thermal recovery process that was developed to produce oil and gas from kerogen-bearing oil shale   in-situ conductive heating of the oil-shale reservoir converts its kerogen (hydrogen-rich solids) into oil and gas (fluids) plus coke (hydrogen-deficient solids)     while coke is left behind on the rock, hot vapor and heavy oil flow through the thermally altered oil shale to producer wells, and predicting icp recovery performance depends on having an accurate characterization of the flow and storage behavior of the oil shale   however the rock fabric changes radically during icp - the rock’s porosity and permeability change with time in a complex way   while changing pore geometry (and pore-wall composition) also results in changing relative-permeability (kr) and capillary-pressure (pc) curves, this work focuses on the evolution of oil and gas saturations (which dictate how kr’s and pc’s influence icp performance), as well as the change in porosity and its resulting alteration of oil-shale permeability    numerous pyrolysis experiments were performed in the laboratory, where crushed oil shale was heated and effluents were monitored   furthermore, through a series of otherwise identical experiments that were stopped at different degrees of conversion, changes in the oil-shale solids were determined by analyzing the spent rock   through these experiments, a reservoir simulation model was developed that, for a variety of oil shales and time scales, captures the chemical-reaction kinetics for the solids and fluids, and the phase behavior of the fluids   sensitivity studies with this model identified the changing oil-shale fluid-transport properties as a key driver for icp performance    in this work, the icp simulation model is used to illustrate icp reservoir physics for different oil shales   simulations reveal how changing in-situ fluid compositions (due to chemical reactions, temperature increase, etc ) not only result in changing fluid properties, but also complex behavior with time for oil and gas saturations, and this saturation history governs in part the flow of oil and vapor to producers and thus icp performance   the early time following kerogen conversion is a period of higher oil saturation and thus higher oil mobility, illustrating how icp production can include the flow of both vapor and heavy oil to producer wells    another key to icp success is the permeability history that results from the evolving porosity   as kerogen converts to fluids, porosity first increases (owing to reactive grain loss), then decreases (from the deposition of coke)   while porosity behavior was determined from grain volumes measured in crushed-rock experiments, some complementary tests on pyrolyzed intact rock reveal increasing oil-shale permeability during icp, which enables production from rock whose original permeability is quite low  also simulations show that 90% of the pattern pyrolyzes after there are already permeable pathways developed connecting the pyrolyzing regions to the producer well    introduction   oil shale is rock that contains kerogen, which may be considered a solid form of petroleum   there are immense resources of oil shale worldwide (biglarbigi et al , 2010): on the order of 8 trillion barrels of oil, more than ? of which is in the northwest united states |

170801-ms 	 elastic anisotropy of unconventional shale at reservoir conditions - new, faster laboratory characterization technique |abstract |most unconventional shale formations are transversely isotropic with a vertical axis of symmetry  to fully characterize the elastic anisotropy of a transversely isotropic rock, five independent elastic constants are required  in the laboratory, this tranditionally translates to measuring the wave velocities on at least three separate adjacent core plugs with various orientations - one parallel, one perpendicular, and one at 45° to the bedding  however, it is difficult to drill multiple adjacent core plugs with good quality from a whole core of gas shale because of its weakness and brittleness  |this paper presents a simpler, alternative technical lab procedure of characterizing the elastic anisotropy of transversely isotropic rocks from one horizontal core plug only  the plug is cut parallel to the bedding of the whole core   in the test, it is jacketed in a core holder specifically designed to simultaneously measure six wave velocities at each pressure step: axial compressional, two axial shear, radial compressional and two radial shear  by adjusting the relative position of the sample bedding to the radial velocity transducers, variations of wave velocities with angles is determined; thereafter, the five elastic constants and three thomsen parameters are calculated  for validation, one synthetic rock sample was constructed comprising thin layers of various materials  three plugs were cut adjacently from the artificial rock in various orientations: one parallel, one perpendicular, and one at 45° to the bedding  the ultrasonic velocity measurements showed that elastic constants derived from the horizontal plug match very well with those from three plugs, confirming that only one horizontal core plug is necessary to analyze the elastic anisotropy of the transversely isotropic media  |the method's feasibility and applicability was demonstrated by performing the elastic anisotropy analysis at room temperature and various confining pressures on two real rock samples: one tight sand plug and one unconventional shale plug  both plugs are cut horizontally and exhibit characteristics of layers/beddings or a horizontal zone filled with different minerals  for the tight sand plug, wave velocities measured along the axial direction are in good agreement with those from the radial direction  however, the similar phenomenon was not observed for the shale plug  we analyzed the discrepancy using the micro-ct imaging technique   the three-dimensional geometrical structure of the plug was obtained, and the difference was found to be caused by the non-parallelism of the zone to the symmetry axis of the plug |

170814-ms 	 innovative reservoir pressure management technology facilitates safe drilling in pressure depleted reservoirs |abstract |the example field in the gulf of mexico has been on production for seven years  natural reservoir pressure decline has altered the stress regime and reservoir sand fracture pressure in certain regions of the field  company drilling practices have established maximum drilling pressure depletion limits (dpdl) which are based on geomechanical analysis and wellbore strengthening theory  these limits must be considered to ensure safe and reliable drilling of new development wells in producing reservoirs  as reservoir pressure declines with production, the pressure depletion at a future well’s target location may exceed the dpdl for that location  the risk of this occurrence may be managed through production curtailment at neighboring wells  this would reduce the pressure depletion at the target well location  however, this action would result in deferred production and value loss  production curtailment can be minimized by sequencing the wells to take advantage of the characteristics of the existing well stock and the reservoir  |a full-field reservoir simulation model (ffm) is one of the tools used to guide the well sequencing in order to honor dpdls at proposed well locations and minimize production curtailment  building a robust well sequence is a multi-week trial-and-error process  the process determines if the dpdl at a target well location is exceeded, then selects the existing offset producers that need to be curtailed, and the duration of the offset well production deferral to raise the target well location reservoir pressure  the arduous, lengthy process precluded extensive “what-if” scenario evaluation  the resulting drilling sequence would have required significant production deferral over a time window in the future to facilitate drilling of the proposed development wells  the challenge was to optimize the development well drilling plan to reduce, if not eliminate, the field production deferral while drilling all the new wells safely by honoring the dpdls at the proposed target locations  the challenge was met by developing a new automated, systematic and efficient procedure  this entailed building a pressure depletion tracking and management algorithm into the reservoir simulator and coupling it with the company’s existing proprietary technology for field development option evaluation and optimization  this novel technology development automatically tracks the pressure at each target well location in the reservoir simulation model, selects the offset wells/zones that require production curtailment, and calculates the curtailment duration for thousands of potential well sequences to drill the future development wells  the well sequences are then ranked on the ability to honor the dpdls at the target locations and associated production deferral  |the technology has made a step change in the evaluation cycle time by automating the systematic investigation of over 2000 well sequences, many of which are not intuitive  errors were minimized through a standardized process that also permitted a broader evaluation of alternative reservoir scenarios  it has allowed us to evaluate the impact of various uncertainties including: dpdls, stress path re-pressurization ratio, well productivity, and reservoir connectivity  this technology allows one to either develop a drilling sequence of water injectors and producers which minimizes/eliminates the offset producer curtailment or minimizes the offset producer curtailment for a given development well drilling sequence  we were then able to make an informed choice in selecting a well sequence that best achieves the multiple goals of drilling new wells safely, leveraging learning, identifying risk mitigation strategies, and reducing production deferral and enhancing value | 
170830-ms 	 understanding mechanisms for liquid dropout from horizontal shale gas condensate wells |abstract   the presence of nanopores in tight, rich-gas-condensate wells (3,000 to ~10,000 scf/stb) may hold long-term gas/oil ratio (gor) trends constant with time as observed in production data from some north american shales  this finding contrasts with some of the numerical simulation forecasts performed on calibrated pressure/volume/temperature (pvt) models based on bulk laboratory pvt data  research efforts have pointed to a decrease in the pvt phase envelopes of hydrocarbon fluids confined in nanopores  this would delay the onset of dew point pressure and condensate liquid dropout and could be one of the causes of the observed constant producing gor in the wells studied    an understanding of fluid properties in nanopores is fundamental to predicting the onset of condensate dropout in shale reservoirs  one approach may be molecular dynamics simulations that can shed the light on the difference in behavior of larger-chain hydrocarbon molecules at kerogen surfaces and bulk pore space  additionally, shale gas condensate production management may be more fully optimized by understanding both the effects of hydraulic fracture degradation with drawdown and liquid dropout in the production string  an integrated approach of this kind can help optimize liquid-rich shale reservoir production management    introduction   gas condensates behave contrary to what we expect from “normal” gases: an isothermal decrease in pressure causes liquid to form at the condensate dewpoint because of interactions between heavier molecules in the gas condensate fluid  gas condensates typically produce with gas-oil-ratio (gor) between 3,300 and 15,000 scf/stb, although the upper limit is less well defined (mccain 1990)    as the pressure in the near-wellbore region drops below the dewpoint during production, liquid condensate droplets are formed and tend to remain in the reservoir rock and not produce because of relative permeability effects  this generally causes the producing gor to increase with time  a ring of condensate liquid may form around the wellbore and reduces the gas deliverability (deng 2013) or well productivity  after significant condensate liquid saturation builds up, some of the condensate liquid begins to flow towards the producing well (fan 2005)  well productivity decline in shale gas condensate wells may be more severe because pressure drawdown gradients are large  yet a number of shale gas condensate wells are still producing in north america years after first production, suggesting that the productivity of these wells may not be dramatically declining    liquid hydrocarbon production from tight organic mudstones has increased in recent years, in line with a favorable commercial environment  despite this, industry still lacks understanding of hydrocarbon fluid flow in the nanopores in these reservoirs because their behavior is so highly unconventional  the complexity of fluid flow and fluid properties in unconventional reservoirs has led to technological challenges in nanoscale measurements and modeling  | 
170835-ms 	 fracturing fluid effects on young's modulus and embedment in the niobrara formation |abstract |shale plays and the evolving technologies of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing are driving the petroleum industry in many regions  due to their low permeability, hydraulic fracturing is necessary for economic production in these shale systems  the success of these reservoirs is dependent on optimized hydraulic fracturing designs, and requires an understanding of the mechanical properties of these reservoirs  |one of these properties, young’s modulus, can weaken the formation if it is reduced  this weakening of the formation can, in turn, lead to; increased proppant embedment into the fracture face and a subsequent loss of conductivity  in low permeability shale reservoirs, the conductivity achieved through fracturing is just as critical as in other formations, thus making proppant embedment an issue that needs to be fully understood  this paper focused on how different fracturing fluids impacted the young’s modulus of the niobrara shale, a major producing formation in the states of colorado and wyoming, and how this change affects proppant embedment and conductivity with certain proppants  |nanoindentation technology was used to determine young’s modulus changes in niobrara core samples after they were saturated for 30 days in certain fracturing fluids, and after they were heated under temperature (180°f) for five days  treated samples were then subjected to high pressure (3030 psi) with selected proppants, simulating a fracture to test the proppant embedment profiles using scanning acoustic microscope (sam) and profilometer measurements  |the experimental results showed that young’s modulus decreased with fluid exposure regardless of the fracturing fluid type and also increased (rebounded) after a certain saturation time  the magnitude of decrease in young’s modulus values was dependent on fluid type and saturation time  in one extreme case, (when kcl+friction reducer fluid was used as treatment fluid for 30 days) young’s modulus decreased by approximately 80%  the young’s modulus reduction is believed to be mainly caused by a weakening of the calcite minerals  higher reductions experienced by kcl based fluids could be due to a detrimental chemical reaction between kcl and calcite minerals  results also showed proppant embedment and crushing are inevitable under the tested circumstances and are dependent on distributed stress on the contact points as well as proppant type and fluid exposure  |introduction |over the last few decades, natural gas and oil production from unconventional shale systems has increased significantly  these reservoirs are essential parts of the present and future of the oil and gas industry  throughout the last 40 years, the petroleum industry has progressed from conventional gas reservoirs, to tight gas reservoirs, to ultra-low matrix permeability unconventional shale-gas reservoirs (kundert and mullen, 2009)  shale reservoirs are becoming increasingly important day-by-day due to the production success and abundance of reserves  the energy information agency has shale resource estimates of 335 billion bbl of oil and 7,795 tcf of gas for the world and 58 billion bbl of oil and 665 tcf of gas for the united states (energy information agency, 2013)  the significance of these numbers, and with conventional reservoirs depleting, unconventional reservoirs across the globe will have to supply the world with energy and meet the high demands of hydrocarbon usage  for unconventional reservoirs to satisfy the world energy demand, their reservoir properties must be carefully studied and new technological developments should be utilized to achieve economically optimized production levels | 
170839-ms 	 on the use of a full-field geomechanical model to influence and optimize field development decisions: case study from an hpht field in south china sea |abstract   drilling overpressured and deep reservoirs is a challenge in itself, but can be complicated by the need to drill through depleted (depressurized) shallower reservoirs  the field under study consists of multiple stacked clastic reservoirs bounded by steeply dipping sealing faults  the deeper reservoirs fall in the high pressure high temperature (hpht) category and account for one third of the in-place volumes  ideally, field development for such stacked reservoirs is recommended through the “bottom-up” strategy to prevent late-in-life drilling through depleted zones with reduced drilling window and increased risk of fluid losses and well failure  here, this would imply drilling and developing the deeper hpht reservoirs before the shallow, normally pressured reservoirs  from a technical and financial perspective, it is tempting to develop and produce the shallow, normally pressured reservoirs (that contain 70% of the volumes and also have better flow properties) first, and bring the deeper hpht reservoirs on-stream later  but, is such phased development of the reservoirs possible? or would producing from the shallower reservoirs first permanently damage our ability to drill and produce the deeper hpht reservoirs at a later stage in field life? these were the questions we tried to answer in this work    we built a full-field finite element model to simulate the geomechanical response of the reservoirs to pressure depletion i e  quantify the displacement, strains and total stress changes in and around the reservoirs as a function of production  such geomechanical models can serve as a predictive tool to help answer the questions above  in this paper, we show the construction and application of such a geomechanical model in field development planning  our paper highlights how our geomechanical model results were applied, together with other work, to develop this field safely and efficiently, emphasizing field life cycle value    background   the drilling window for any hole section is defined as the pressure difference between the fracture gradient (the maximum allowable mud weight (mw) that may cause fracturing of the formation) and the minimum mw required to balance pore pressure and prevent hole collapse   at reservoir depths, for fields in normal faulting (sv > shmax > sh) or strikeslip faulting (shmax > sv > sh) stress regime, the fracture propagation gradient is mainly driven by the magnitude of the minimum total horizontal stress (sh)  the sh in the reservoirs changes due to hydrocarbon production operations (decreases with reservoir depletion)  therefore, with depletion, the upper bound of the allowed mw i e  the fracture gradient decreases in the reservoirs    the minimum mw for depleted sand-shale reservoir system is driven by the wellbore pressure required for shale borehole stability  in depleting reservoirs, the thicker interbedded shale layers may remain at or close to the virgin fluid pressures across production period due to low permeability  the minimum mw for depleted sand-shale reservoir system is then driven by the wellbore pressure required for shale borehole stability  thus, the drilling window progressively reduces with depletion as the minimum mw is maintained, while the maximum allowable mw is reduced [1, 2, 3] | 
170850-ms 	 fault reactivation as mechanism of early water production in unconsolidated sandstones reservoirs |abstract |there are several case studies showing that water injection apparently induces fault reactivation in oil and gas fields  however, there are not many publications in literature relating water production increasing with fault reactivation caused by depletion  the unexpected water production by fault reactivation related to depletion, promotes a huge impact on an oil field production, reducing the reservoir drainage efficiency and causing premature aging of operating plants, in some cases generating production bottlenecks due to produced water treatment limitations  |this paper presents parameters that influence fault reactivation mechanism and their importance in early water production  |in order to evaluate the phenomenon, a failure stability parameter that can be monitored during reservoir production time life is proposed and its behavior can be analyzed by comparison with produced water rate  the methodology is based on mohr-coulomb failure criterion using a simplified approach  |basically, the method considers the change in the state of effective stresses, vertical and horizontal, during production and its ratio (<u+03c3>h/<u+03c3>v) called k0 the relationship of effective stress necessary for the mohr circle touches the envelope of rupture for a given frictional angle, called k1, is also considered  |thus, it is possible to observe the stress state changing as field production occurs using flow simulation  fault reactivation analysis is obtained from the difference k0 minus k1, being k0 less or equal to k1, the condition at which depletion can   induce faults in the reservoir  the method has been successfully applied on an unconsolidated sandstone reservoir from campos basin, explaining the evolution of anomalies in bsw (basic sediment and water) values that could not be predicted ignoring the theory of fault reactivation by depletion  |recognizing that fault reactivations contribute to the unexpected water production is an important changing of paradigm in oil industry  the determination of the parameter of reactivation by depletion constitutes an important mark to indicate the right moment for beginning waterflooding  many mature fields that present high water cut values, previously thought to have occurred due to rising of water-oil contact, may be revisited and restudied using the theory of fault reactivation by depletion  the approach can help to identify undrained-overlooked areas where infill drilling projects could be implemented, extending oil production and increasing oil recovery factors |

170943-ms 	 natural fractures in unconventional shale reservoirs in us and their roles in well completion design and improving hydraulic fracturing stimulation efficiency and production |abstract |most of the shale reservoirs in us land are naturally fractured  the fracture intensity and types vary from one shale to another  even within the same shale in the same field, the heterogeneity of fracture intensity can be often expected to be high in a horizontal well  the current popular geometrical completion design can potentially ignore the existence of natural fractures   hence, maximizing stimulation efficiency without understanding existing natural fractures can be a challenge   in this paper, study was made of the majority of the published case studies related to natural fractures in the us shales in the last 20 years  the evidence of natural fractures from either outcrops or subsurface data, i e  core, borehole images, or other data is summarized for each studied shale  the latest studies show that the hydraulic fracture propagation can be strongly influenced by existing natural fractures regardless of whether they are open or closed  the roles of existing fractures in the shales include: 1) providing enhanced reservoir permeability for improved productivity if they are open and effectively connected by hydraulic fractures; 2) promoting much better fracturing network complexity regardless of whether they are open or closed prior to the stimulation; 3) giving possible negative impact sometimes, i e  high water cut, if they are connected with wet zones below or above the reservoirs  it can be concluded that engineered completion designs that employ accurate knowledge of natural fracture data, in-situ stresses, and other reservoir and completion quality indicators as inputs can provide opportunities for enhancing stimulation efficiency and fracturing network complexity  this in turn can lead to better connectivity to a larger reservoir volume and access to more drainage area in the shales  |introduction |the us shale gas story actually featured natural fractures  william hart, a local gunsmith, drilled the first commercial natural shale gas well in us in fredonia, chautauqua county, ny in 1821, in shallow, low-pressure rock with fractures[1] [2]  the well was first dug to a depth of 27ft in a shale which outcropped in the area, then later drilled to a depth of 70ft using 1 5 inch diameter borehole  the produced gas was piped to an innkeeper on a stagecoach route[1]  then the well was produced without any stimulation for 37 years until 1858 when it supplied enough natural gas for a grist mill and for lighting in four shops  it was a combination of the idea from mr  hart to drill the well and the presence of the natural fractures in the gas shale that made the 1st commercial shale gas discovery possible in shale gas history |

170952-ms 	 60 years of multi-fractured vertical, deviated and horizontal wells: what have we learned? |abstract |multiple fracture placements in single wells have a sixty year history with first applications soon after hydraulic fracturing was patented  fracturing technology has been applied to offshore deviated wells, sand control wells, tight gas, coal, chalks, shales and conglomerates in turn as “conventional” reservoir limits were reached and each “new unconventional” reservoir was encountered  as fracturing technology was adapted to make an “unconventional” reservoir into a conventional reservoir, the adaptations and evolutions needed became part of the technology tool box waiting for the next challenge  each innovation improved and stretched the reach of completions and production engineering as new findings were incorporated to monitor, model, optimize and extend the ranges of fracturing use for high and low temperatures, high stress formations and a variety of other challenges  |this review looks at the development of multi-fractured wells from its first application in vertical wells where one well could now do the task of three wells, to the first modern application of highly multi-fractured horizontal wells used in chalks, shales and tight oil and gas reservoirs  the technical focus is on the learning procession covering details of casing wear, cyclic pressure application, isolation mechanisms, perforation placement, well spacing and fracture spacing  |the technical literature and field learnings have both been searched for applicable information with a surprising variety of engineering application details brought forth that are useful in optimizing a single well or a whole development  |introduction |beginning with the first multiple fractured vertical wells in 1952, two years after hydraulic fracturing was commercialized, multiple fracturing found a home in vertical wells and was soon common both in on-shore and off-shore wells where the geologic basins contained stacked or thick pay zones (clark & fast, 1952; neill, et al , 1957; kruger, 1973; strubhar et al , 1974; strubhar & glenn, 1974, montgomery & smith, 2010)   ever since the advancements of hydraulic fracturing provided two to over ten times the production possible in an unfractured well, the wellbore, be it vertical, deviated or horizontal, has been widely viewed as a platform for hydraulic fracture stimulation delivery (coulter, 1976; austin, et al , 2009; al-shamma, et al , 2014) | 
170954-ms 	 the effect of changing fracture compliance on pressure transient behavior during diagnostic fracture injection tests |abstract   diagnostic fracture injection tests (dfit) are commonly interpreted with g-function derivative plots  in these plots, an upward deviation from linearity is generally attributed to fracture height recession or transverse storage  this interpretation neglects changing fracture compliance during closure  results presented in this study show that in low permeability formations, an upward deviation of the g-function plot g*dp/dg is caused by a sharp reduction in fracture compliance due to closure  it is not necessary to invoke more complicated explanations such as height recession or transverse storage  the specific shape of the g*dp/dg curve is controlled by factors that affect fracture compliance before and after closure  these factors include the fracture height, fracture stiffness, and the residual aperture (which is affected by the microscopic and macroscopic roughness of the created hydraulic fracture)  wellbore storage broadens the post-closure peak in the g*dp/dg curve  a curve of g*dp/dg that constantly increases during the shut-in period may be caused by wellbore storage, rather than fracture tip extension  in higher permeability formations (with non-zero wellbore storage), the effect of fracture compliance is less important  as a result, changing fracture compliance during closure does not have a significant effect on the pressure transient plots, and closure decreases the rate of pressure decline because it reduces the rate at which fluid can leak off into the matrix  in all cases, as long as a single planar fracture has formed, the best pick for the minimum principal stress is at the deviation from linearity on the g*dp/dg plot, whether or not this departure is concave up or concave down  closure picks via a tangent to near the peak in g*dp/dg (as is commonly performed) may significantly underestimate the minimum principal stress  these picks should be confirmed with other measurements, such as a subsequent injection period or a pump-in flow-back test  the fact that an extremely sharp upward trend in g*dp/dg is generally not observed in dfit tests suggests that the actual geometry of the created fracture is rougher and more complex than is typically assumed by standard models | 
170956-ms 	 evaluation of gas adsorption in marcellus shale |abstract |production from shale gas reservoirs plays an important role in natural gas supply in the united states  horizontal drilling and multi-stage hydraulic fracturing are the two key enabling technologies for the economic development of these shale gas reservoirs  it is believed that gas in shale reservoirs is mainly composed of free gas within fractures and pores and adsorbed gas in organic matter (kerogen)  it is generally assumed in the literature that the monolayer langmuir isotherm describes gas adsorption behavior in shale gas reservoirs  however, in this work, we have analyzed several experimental measurements of methane adsorption from the marcellus shale core samples that deviate from the langmuir isotherm, but obey the bet (brunauer, emmett and teller) isotherm  to the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to find that gas adsorption in a shale gas reservoir behaves like multilayer adsorption  consequently, investigation of this specific gas desorption effect is important for accurate evaluation of well performance and completion effectiveness in shale gas reservoirs based on the bet isotherm  the difference in calculating original gas in place based on both isotherms is discussed  we also perform history matching with one production well from the marcellus shale and evaluate the contribution of gas desorption to the well’s performance  history matching shows that gas adsorption obeying the bet isotherm contributes more to overall gas recovery than gas adsorption obeying langmuir isotherm, especially early time in production  this work provides better understanding of gas desorption in shale gas reservoirs and updates our current analytical and numerical models for simulation of shale gas production  |introduction |in recent years, the boom of shale gas production was fueled by the improvements in horizontal drilling and multi-stage hydraulic fracturing technologies  as a result, shale gas has become an increasingly important source of natural gas supply in north america and around the world  in nature, gas shales are characterized by extremely small grain size, extremely low permeability on the order of nano-darcy (10-6 md), small porosity, and high total organic carbon (toc)  shale can serve as both source and reservoir rock  the amount of gas in place in shale is strongly affected by the toc, clays, and the adsorption ability of methane on the internal surface of solid (martin et al , 2010)  in general, complex fracture networks that are generated connect the shale formation and the horizontal well  shale matrix has strong gas storage capacity but cannot transport the gas for long distance because it is very tight; a fracture network can transport the gas efficiently due to large hydraulic conductivity but has limited storage capacity (lane et al , 1989; carlson and mercer, 1991)  since a part of gas in shale reservoirs is adsorbed, investigation of gas adsorption can provide critical insights into evaluation of well performance, shale characterization, and optimization of fracture design in shale gas reservoirs | 
170969-ms 	 advances in understanding wettability of tight and shale gas formations |abstract |this paper aims at understanding the factors controlling the wettability of unconventional rocks  in the first part, we report the results of comparative imbibition experiments on several binary core plugs from the montney tight gas formation, which is an enormous tight gas fairway in the western canadian sedimentary basin  both contact angle and imbibition data indicate that the formation is strongly oil-wet  however, the ratio between oil and water imbibition rate of these samples is higher than what capillary-driven imbibition models predict  this discrepancy can be explained by the strong adsorption of oil on the surface of a well-connected organic pore network that is partly coated by pyrobitumen  we also define a wettability index by using the equilibrium imbibed volume of oil and water in binary plugs  oil wettability index is in general positively correlated to the total organic carbon (toc), measured by the rock-eval technique  in the second part, we report similar imbibition experiments on several binary core samples collected from the cores drilled in the shale members of the horn river basin  in contrast to the montney (mt) samples, the horn river (hr) samples imbibe significantly more water than oil  this observation contradicts the contact angle results which suggest that the hr samples are strongly oil-wet  clay hydration, imbibition-induced microfractures, depositional lamination, and osmotic potential are collectively responsible for the excess water uptake  we also measure and compare spontaneous imbibition of oil and water into the crushed packs of the similar hr samples  interestingly, in contrast to the intact samples, the crushed samples consistently imbibe more oil than water  the comparative study suggests that the connected pore network of the intact hr samples is water-wet while the majority of rock including poorly connected pores is oil-wet overall, the results suggest that the well-connected pore network of the mt samples is dominantly hydrophobic and is very likely to be coated by pyrobitumen  this is the main reason why these samples imbibe more oil than water  on the other hand, the well-connected pore network of the hr samples is strongly hydrophilic primarily due to the presence of clay minerals and precipitated salt crystals coating the rock grains  |introduction |increasing the energy demand has shifted the industry focus towards unconventional resources worldwide  recent advances in horizontal drilling and multi-lateral/multi-stage hydraulic fracturing has unlocked the challenging unconventional resources  however, successful and sustainable development of such reservoirs requires correct characterization of reservoir properties (burke et al , 2011)  in particular, knowing the reservoir rock properties such as permeability, porosity and wettability (wetting affinity) is critical for reserve estimation, production forecasting and designing optimum fracturing and treatment fluids  |the affinity of a reservoir rock on a particular fluid is defined as wettability, which depends on various factors such as rock mineralogy and the properties of the materials coating the rock surface (anderson, 1986; rao et al , 1994; hamon, 2000; mohammed b et al , 2010; mohammadlou et al , 2012)  characterizing the wettability of reservoir rocks is important for 1) selecting fracturing and treatment fluids, 2) investigating residual phase saturation and its pore-scale topology, 3) investigating the occurrence water blockage at fracture face, and 4) selecting relevant capillary pressure and relative permeability models for reservoir engineering calculations | 
170972-ms 	 a practical petrophysical approach for brittleness prediction from porosity and sonic logging in shale reservoirs |abstract |brittleness has been used as one of the important descriptors for the characterization of unconventional shale reservoirs  the degree of brittleness in shale reservoirs is determined upon the basis of its mineralogical composition, which can be obtained from mineralogical logging tools (such as ecstm, flextm, gemtm, litho scannertm), or xrd tests in the laboratory  generally, measurements of mineralogical brittleness are obtained from physical sources and lead to relatively reliable interpretation results  however, mineralogical logging is expensive and not commonly available in the shale play  alternatively, brittleness can also be calculated from dynamic young’s modulus and poisson’s ratio, but the absence of shear slowness in some wells restricts its wide application  internal friction angle based brittleness can give similar interpretation results as the preceding two methods, but its accuracy depends highly on the quality of correlations  it is observed that the curves of the three different brittlenesses demonstrate similar shapes  therefore, we have attempted to build correlations between mineralogical brittleness and porosity or sonic compressional slowness for typical shale plays (woodford, barnett, and eagle ford shale), and have proven their validity with the data obtained from wells not included in the development of correlations  applications of these findings include: (1) enabling the possibility of evaluating brittleness in plays lacking mineralogical and shear sonic loggings, thus reducing the quantity of laboratory testing, (2) inspiring operators to develop in-house correlations of brittleness for shale gas plays, and (3) investigating similar correlations in emerging unconventional oil plays, such as granite wash  |keywords: brittleness; unconventional shale; hydraulic fracturing; elemental logging; tight oil | 
170977-ms 	 effect of fluid rheology and reservoir compressibility on microseismicity during hydraulic fracturing |abstract |microseismic monitoring, as an essential surveillance tool of hydraulic stimulation, enables the industry to optimize the development of unconventional reservoirs ranging from wellbore azimuth and wellbore spacing to completion and treatment design as well as providing a means for quality control and treatment efficiency evaluation  in order to correctly interpret microseismic data, a clear understanding of the mechanisms driving the generation of microseismicity is crucial  it is widely accepted and supported by full moment tensor inversion that microseismic activity associated with subsurface fluid injection is mainly caused by shear failure  microseismic events can be separated into two main categories: near-field events and far-field events  near-field events are the microseismic events close to the induced fracture (i e  hydraulic fracture); as a result, the stress shadow effect (i e  stress perturbation around a hydraulic fracture) is the dominant factor controlling such events  far-field events are events that are not occurring in the vicinity of the tensile hydraulic fracture, hence the stress shadow effect is not the dominant phenomenon, but they are mainly controlled by pore pressure diffusion  recent seismicity-based permeability characterization models couple fluid flow and reservoir geomechanics in order to capture microseismic mechanisms and calculate bulk reservoir-scale permeability  the same fundamentals were used in a forward modeling sense; by knowing reservoir properties we were able to predict the spatio-temporal distribution of microseismic activity  the effects of three parameters, including reservoir fluid viscosity, fracture fluid viscosity, and total reservoir compressibility were studied  furthermore, the microseismic response of the reservoir in conjunction with instantaneous pump attributes was investigated  a physics-based model showed that increasing the viscosity of both reservoir and hydraulic fracture fluid will decrease the local extent of the propagation of the microseismic cloud  studying the effect of reservoir compressibility showed that an increase in total reservoir compressibility decreases the local extent of the microseismic cloud  results of the analysis were then used to explain observations made in field data and described in the literature  |introduction |microseismic events associated with subsurface fluid injection and hydraulic fracturing are well-known phenomena in the industry and literature (ohtake, 1974; raleigh, 1976; fletcher and sykes, 1977; pearson, 1981; simpson et al  1988; fehler and philips, 1991; zoback and harjes, 1997; sasaki, 1998; warpinski et al  2001; audigane et al  2002; maxwell et al  2010; olson et al  2011; mcclure, 2012; tarrahi and jafarpour, 2012; hosseini, 2012; zoback and gorelick, 2012; hosseini, 2013)  it is widely accepted and supported by full moment tensor inversion that microseismic activity associated with subsurface fluid injection is mainly caused by shear failure  microseismic passive monitoring is a tool in the industry for reservoir stimulation monitoring and hydraulic fracturing treatment quality control  in order to be able to interpret microseismic data and relate it to the engineering parameters pertaining to oil and gas production such as well placement and hydraulic fracture characteristics, a clear understanding of the mechanisms governing microseismicity is essential | 
170983-ms 	 simulations of impact of fracture models on shale gas well productivity |abstract   shale gas reservoirs are difficult to produce unless effectively stimulated  hydraulic fracturing along with drilling has been a technology that makes it possible to produce natural gas from such reservoirs  hydraulically fractured wells are usually modeled in fracture simulators, and it has been observed from the literature that modeling of horizontal wells with multiple hydraulic fractures is needed in the industry  in this paper, a series of simulations are carried out to quantify the effect of the performance of various types of fracture models on the productivity of the well  the fracture closure stress acting on the proppant placed in the pay zone arises as a result of the stresses and pressures acting on and in the fracture  these stresses are also known to bring about a change in the fracture flow capacity and conductivity, thereby having a significant influence on the reservoir performance  in this paper, various fracture models are considered and have been simulated in a fracture simulator, to observe their impact on the productivity of the well  further, mathematical modeling of the fractures has been done to observe the effect of stress on the fracture characteristics, and hence on the production  the main aim of this paper is to assess the impact of fracture models and its characteristics on shale productivity and to quantify the effect of stress on fracture | 
171001-ms 	 time-dependent initiation of multiple hydraulic fractures in a formation with varying stresses and strength |abstract   the premise of classical hydraulic fracture breakdown models is that hydraulic fracture growth can only commence when the wellbore pressure reaches a critical value, sufficient to overcome the tensile strength of the rock  however, rocks are well-known to exhibit static fatigue, that is, delayed failure at stresses below the tensile strength  in this paper we explore the consequences of delayed failure on initiation of multiple hydraulic fractures  specifically, given a certain breakdown pressure, we investigate the conditions under which subsequent hydraulic fracture(s) can initiate within the timeframe of a stimulation treatment in regions of higher stress and/or strength due to delayed failure mechanisms  the results show that wells completed in shallower formations are more sensitive to variations in strength while wells completed in deeper formations are more sensitive to variations in stress  furthermore, cases in which all hydraulic fractures breakdown according to the same pressurization regime, that is, all are "fast" (non-fluid-penetrating) pressurization or else all are "slow" (fluid-penetrating) pressurization cases, are highly sensitive to small stress/strength variability  on the other hand, if the first hydraulic fracture initiation is in the "fast" pressurization regime and subsequent fracture(s) are in the "slow" pressurization regime, then the system is robust to a much higher degree of variability in stress/strength  practically, this work implies that methods aimed at moderately reducing the variability in stress/strength among the possible initiation points (i e  perforation clusters) within a particular stage can have a strong impact on whether multiple hydraulic fractures will initiate  additionally, this analysis implies that pumping strategies that encourage "fast", non-penetrative breakdown of the first initiation point followed by the opportunity for fluid-penetrating, "slow" breakdown of subsequent initiation points could be highly effective at encouraging multiple hydraulic fracture initiation | 
171004-ms 	 frictional pressure losses of slurries in straight and coiled tubing – part i: model statistical analysis |abstract   hydraulic fracturing has increased immensely in recent years  an accurate prediction of frictional pressure losses of fracturing slurries is crucial for successful treatment and to avoid premature screen-out or even treatment failure  scarce data and lack of theoretical basis of slurry flow, especially in coiled tubing has led to very limited number of correlations that are available to predict slurry frictional pressure losses  yet, the accuracy of the available correlations is still questionable    the current paper presents a statistical comparative analysis of the available frictional pressure losses correlations for slurry flow in straight and coiled tubing employing the recently introduced math modeling technique that gives weight for the models known as akaike information criterion, aic  with the help of aic, the authors evaluated the available correlations to examine their accuracy  the results show that none of the available correlations can accurately predict friction pressure losses of slurries  the correlations show some reasonable accuracy within a very limited data range  however, they fail outside this range indicative of their poor applicability  aic shows how much information is lost when using these correlations which can lead to erroneous results, and even job failure  this fact keeps the gates widely opened for more in-depth experimental, analytical, and theoretical analysis for better understanding of flow behavior of fracturing slurries aiming at developing a more realistic correlation to predict their frictional pressure losses  this paper represents the authors' first step toward developing such correlation, with the application of information theory and aic |

171167-ms 	 lessons learnt from the large scale application of image logs to unconventional resources |abstract   image logs are a key tool in understanding unconventional reservoirs, providing geomechanical information and characterisation of natural fractures   this information can prove crucial in completion design and optimising production, especially where hydraulic stimulation is considered     image log datasets associated with unconventional developments can be large, utilise a variety of different tool types and contain data across multiple vintages   the size of the datasets requires multiple interpreters to facilitate interpretation in a reasonable time frame, while the different tool types require an interpretation scheme that is effective for image logs of different types   these factors necessitate a rigorous quality assurance system to ensure the data quality, and consistency of interpretation across multiple interpreters and tool types to maximise the utility of the interpretation results    this paper presents a workflow for assessing large image log datasets practically derived from assessment of large datasets from multiple unconventional and conventional assets as applied to large australian unconventional assets  key elements of this workflow include:   a tool independent quality control checklist that can be applied prior to interpretation  |classification of image quality with respect to image log type  |classification system for coal bed methane cleat characterisation of coals  |classification system for fracture characterisation independent of tool type  |classification system for stress related deformation independent of tool type  |a post interpretation quality control checklist to ensure consistency between multiple interpreters    introduction   the drive to increase reserves and production has lead to more and more unconventional play types being developed with an ever increasing number of projects    unconventional play types typically require a large number of wells due to the smaller drainage areas for each individual well (holditch, 2006)  these wells need to be placed and completed in the optimal manner to maximize production rates and recovery   the state of stress, the mechanical rock properties and the exisitence of pre-existing fracture networks all provid key information for well placement and completion strategy (holditch, 2006)   this has lead to significant numbers of image logs being acquired in the unconventional plays   for example two significant projects in queensland australia are planning to drill large numbers of wells  the qclng project plans to drill 6000 wells over the life of the project (qgc, 2012) while the glng project is planning to drill upto 6100 wells during the life of the project (santos, 2013)   it is expected that a significant proportion of these wells will have image logs   even if the proportion is small, the number of image logs is large |

171414-ms 	 reservoir simulation with hydraulic fractures: does it really matter how we model fractures? |abstract   hydraulic fracturing is a key technology to developing unconventional resources  at the planning stage, the prediction of production profiles in the presence of designed hydraulic fractures in the reservoir model is very important  various analytical methods available are inadequate to produce reliable production profiles by accurately modeling irregular reservoir shape, permeability heterogeneity, multiphase flow and the presence of natural fractures  any standard reservoir simulator facilitates these modeling features; the key challenge is, however, to model the propped hydraulic fractures accurately in the reservoir  techniques such as negative skin, equivalent well radius and a uniform conductivity rectangular fracture are common built-in features in almost all available reservoir simulators  the imperative questions are (1) how good are these techniques to reliably model the flow through a non-rectangular fracture having non-uniform conductivity, and (2) how to model the combination of propped hydraulic fractures and stimulated reservoir volume (srv) in the presence of stimulated natural fractures? this paper presents the results from two case studies that reveal the shortcomings and simulation difficulties with negative skin, equivalent wellbore radius and uniform conductivity rectangular fractures  the paper also presents improved techniques to model propped hydraulic fractures with nonuniform conductivity in nonrectangular geometry (as usually designed) and srv in the reservoir model for reservoir simulations  the comparison of results and discussion of various techniques are expected to enable engineers to understand why in certain conditions built-in features may not be possible to use because of numerical instabilities during simulation, and the range of variations in prediction from various techniques  the improved technique presented in this paper, which is based on a local grid refinement technique, can provide more reliable production prediction and can overcome numerical instabilities (though it is generally more computation intensive)    introduction   hydraulic fracturing technology is in increased demand to develop unconventional resources such as tight clastic, shale and coal seams reservoirs  at the decision-making stage, predicting the production profile in the presence of hydraulic fractures is the key to the development of unconventional resources  there are simplified analytical methods that can seldom model the complexity of a real production system: irregular reservoir shape, reservoir heterogeneity, multiphase flow, natural fractures, multiple transverse fractures, irregular fracture conductivity and various production constraints  modeling hydraulically stimulated shale reservoirs is more complex and requires the modeling of the stimulated reservoir volume (srv) by incorporating the stimulated (permeability enhanced) natural fractures in addition to the created hydraulic fracture    the above-mentioned complexities can be managed, to some extent, in reservoir simulation software that predicts the production profile from a hydraulically fractured reservoir  the reliability of such simulation results is, however, heavily dependent upon the specialized skills and expertise of the modeler on how to model more realistic hydraulic fractures, and if applicable, the stimulated natural fractures in the reservoir model  various techniques of hydraulic fracturing modeling coupled with reservoir simulations were recently published (weill and latil, 1992; dean and schmidt, 2008; ji et al , 2009; bogachev and shelkov, 2010)  however, some of the methods are not readily available or user friendly in the design environment and others are based on certain assumptions within which the above discussed modeling complexities can not be integrated  the key objectives of this paper are, therefore, to present a technique for modeling hydraulic fractures in the commercially available reservoir simulators as close to the designed fracture(s) as possible (fig  1), and to investigate the effects of deviation from it on production prediction by other techniques  |

171607-ms 	 integrated reservoir characterization and 3d modeling of the monteith formation: tight gas sandstones in the western canada sedimentary basin, alberta, canada |abstract   the monteith formation is an important tight gas reservoir in the deep basin, alberta, and consists of a progradational succession of shallow marine sediments, non-marine carbonaceous and coaly, coastal plain facies, and coarse-grained fluvial deposits, from base to top, respectively  this study compares rock properties and production performance of the uppermost lithostratigraphic unit (“monteith a”) and the lowermost portion (“monteith c”) of the monteith formation in the western canada sedimentary basin (wcsb) in alberta    the study is based on multi-scale description and characterization techniques using cores and drill cuttings, including multiple laboratory measurements of key reservoir parameters such as porosity and permeability  a second stage of the study involves the use of laboratory measurements obtained from cores and drill cuttings and their integration with well logs to produce a numerical 3d model of the study area  the 3d model is used to history match gas production, and forecast performance of new wells in those areas where the geologic model indicates potential for gas production  the ultimate goal is to provide a better understanding of the distribution of reservoir properties in the study area, for developing drilling prospects and their production potential  in addition to that, the reservoir modeling stage is carried out by implementing a recently developed methodology that integrates a variable shape distribution (vsd) model, capable of capturing different reservoir properties through the whole scale spectrum without any data truncation  this new methodology introduces an extension of the vsd approach for reservoir simulation purposes    the results are showing that the monteith a unit has better rock quality than the shallow marine sandstones of the monteith c interval  this is most likey due to larger pore throat apertures ranging between 0 5 and 1 microns, relatively higher proportion of preserved intergranular pore space within these coarser-grained framework grains  furthermore, the best production performance is found from wells that are actually producing from the uppermost interval  the resulting 3d reservoir model will allow to improve field development strategies for this and other similar unconventional gas reservoir in the deep basin of alberta | 
171616-ms 	 enhanced fluid flow: an improved method for estimating stimulated reservoir volume |abstract   in hydraulic fracture treatment programs microseismic imaging is often used to determine geometrical dimensions of the fracture network  the geometrical dimensions can be measured using fracture lengths, widths, and heights, or as an estimation of the potential volume that will contribute to production typically referred to as the stimulated reservoir volume (srv)  these srv values are often used in reservoir models to plan and optimize a completion plan  most techniques involve simply fitting a volume to these events   however, microseismic events also provide information on the deformation, energy and stress release and other seismic parameters that can possibly be used to constrain and provide realistic srv estimates  in this paper, we investigate how srv values vary by comparing standard approaches, with values as calculated based on seismic deformation and by taking into account the source types and fracture orientations derived from seismic moment tensor inversion (smti) to define regions of enhanced fluid flow (eff), akin to srv estimates for fracture networks with propped or opening components of failure  by using a representative microseismic dataset from a shale gas play in north america, differences in approach are considered, and we conclude that eff derived srv estimates are likely a better reflection and more accurate representation of potential yields and estimates of reservoir volume    introduction and background   microseismic monitoring of hydraulic fracturing is becoming increasingly recognized as a technology that offers validation and feedback on the growth of stimulated volumes, either in real-time during pumping or through post analysis of the waveforms recorded on the sensor arrays deployed around the reservoir   a key parameter that is commonly being determined from microseismic data is stimulated reservoir volume (srv)    in general, a common approach to estimate srv is by measuring the length, width, and height of the overall event distribution either by stage or for the overall stimulation  over the past decade, this approach has not really changed even though our physical understanding of the processes leading up to and associated with microseismicity has evolved, including the ability to estimate fracture size, failure types, event strength or deformation, and the energy and stress released by the generation of microseimic events  in this paper, we discuss three approaches of using microseismic data to determine srv:  by the event distribution, by characterizing the total deformation associated with the event distributions, and by considering the spatial variability in failure type as derived through seismic moment tensor inversion (smti)   in the latter case, events expected to contribute to production are identified based on the interaction of fractures within an established discrete fracture network of shear-tensile opening events   in general, the various approaches estimate srv by enclosing isosurfaces, which allows fracture extents and volumes to be characterized geometrically and further used to optimize completion plans and well designs | 
171625-ms 	 a geomechanical model for high-volume, proppantless, slickwater hydraulic fracturing operations in the tight-gas sands of the williams fork formation, piceance basin, colorado |abstract   high-volume (>200mbbls/well), slickwater hydraulic fracturing operations on vertical williams fork wells in the piceance basin, co have resulted in >2x increases in initial production rates and estimated ultimate gas recoveries   here we present a model for the role of increased water-injection volumes in increasing well productivity   predominantly vertical, east-west striking natural fractures, as indicated by interpreted image logs, are optimally oriented for shear failure with respect to the east-west maximum horizontal stress direction   borehole breakout modeling of the same image log dataset suggests a large maximum horizontal stress, further critically stressing existing vertical natural fractures   hydraulic fracturing and leakoff were modeled using commercial modeling platforms to constrain both the 2d hydraulic fracture dimensions as well as changes in reservoir pressure during and after injection   post and syn-injection reservoir pressure distributions, natural fracture distributions, and stresses were then put into an in-house geomechanical modeling program to determine the magnitude and distribution of shear failures along natural fractures associated with changes in net effective stresses   all models worked in tandem to history match injection rates, injection pressures and microseismic event distributions   modeling results show that an elevated reservoir pressure due to high injection rates and water volumes during hydraulic fracturing result in the stimulation of more natural fracture orientations over a greater area, thereby increasing the size and permeability of the stimulated reservoir volume   the lack of necessity for proppant in williams fork completions suggests that most of the fractures are failing in shear and are self propping, which allow for benefit from reactivated natural fractures that are not hydraulically connected back to the wellbore via propped tensile fractures  therefore, injection-enhanced stimulations are likely associated with large stress anisotropies and abundant natural fractures that are chiefly oriented subparallel to the maximum horizontal stress azimuth   the ability of the rocks to “self prop” will dictate the magnitude and duration of permeability enhancement  so although only self propping rocks will see long term benefit from the shear failure of natural fractures, this model may still have utility when assessing the early-time productivity of more ductile and compliant reservoirs, which will see a degradation in productivity as the reservoir is drawn down and fractures begin to close | 
171627-ms 	 in-situ and induced stresses in the development of unconventional resources |abstract   multistage hydraulic fracture stimulation of horizontal wells often results in asymmetric hydraulic fractures, which are suboptimal for draining reservoirs  field observations suggest that hydraulic fractures grow further than expected toward, and sometimes up to and beyond, adjacent producing wells  such interference from nearby wells is of increasing importance in densely drilled unconventional reservoirs, where hydraulic fracturing is common  eventually, the underlying mechanism needs to be factored into well spacing plans and hydraulic fracture treatment designs, which can either mitigate the undesired consequences of the nonvirgin conditions, or take advantage of them    an integrated approach has been developed to quantify depletion-induced stresses  in this approach, a three-dimensional (3d) mechanical earth model (mem) is constructed using the finite-element method to initialize the in-situ stresses  coupled simulation between the dynamic reservoir model and the geomechanical model is used to quantify stress variation, induced by pressure depletion of the parent well  the altered stress profile is then used as input to a hydraulic fracture design    the methodology has been applied to an unconventional resource play in the williston basin in north america  in this example, three adjacent horizontal wells were hydraulically fractured and put on production sequentially within four years  the analysis indicated that the minimum horizontal stress decreased in the area between a newly drilled well and the nearby producing well; whereas the area on the opposite side of the new well showed no obvious stress variations  formations above and below the depletion zone experienced an increase of minimum horizontal stress as a balance effect of the finite-element calculation  fracture modeling using the depletion-induced stresses showed that the effective half-length of the fracture directed toward the depleted well can extend up to two times the length of the hydaulic fracture in the opposite direction    introduction   in the last decade, there has been an increased emphasis on improving multistage hydraulic fracture stimulations of horizontal wells in unconventional resources  the stimulation technique has revolutionized the exploitation and production of unconventional reservoirs worldwide  multiple horizontal wells are often drilled and completed in one pad unit because of the operational, environmental, and economic advantages  to achieve the best production and recovery, operators want to know the optimal spacing of wells and the ideal timing of infill drilling and completions  the hydraulic fracture geometry influences the drainage area and the resulting hydrocarbon recovery, which will in turn affect the decisions regarding well spacing, timing of infill drilling, and completion design    in-situ stresses are the predominant factors influencing hydraulic fracture propagation and containment  normally, the first horizontal well in a drilling unit, which is also called the parent well, experiences original reservoir pressure and virgin in-situ stresses  hydraulic fractures in this parent well are usually balanced symmetrical wings unless there are local structure complexities (zeng et al  2003)  after a production period, wells drilled and completed nearby a parent well are usually called infill wells  as drilling density increases, infill wells are drilled and completed where fluid pressures and/or rock stresses have already changed due to production in nearby wells  observations suggest that hydraulic fractures grow further than expected toward, and sometime up to and beyond, adjacent producing wells (warpinski et al  1982; mukherjee and poe 1995; dohmen et al  2013)  such interference from nearby wells is of increasing importance in densely drilled unconventional reservoirs where hydraulic fracturing is common  it was recently demonstrated that hydraulic fracture asymmetry will affect well productivity as well as overall hydrocarbon recovery of the area (mata et al  2014) | 
171632-ms 	 dependence of stress-induced micro-seismicity on natural fracture properties and in-situ stress |abstract    the opening and propagation of a hydraulic fracture introduces stress and pressure changes around it that could potentially lead to slippages of natural fractures  if detected, the associated microseismicity is commonly used to indirectly measure the geometry of the hydraulic fracture and the stimulated rock volume  one source of microseismicity is the fluid leakoff and pressure increase into the natural fractures  as pressure increases, the effective stress is reduced and shear failure of the natural fractures can be triggered  the natural fractures can also be reactivated in absence of leakoff due to the stress changes induced in the rock due to the opening of the hydraulic fracture itself and due to the inflation of the natural fractures intersected by the main hydraulic fracture  the volume in which stress changes alone can reactivate natural fractures is commonly thought to be small and localized near the hydraulic fracture tips  yet, this paper shows that when the presence of natural fractures is explicitly taken into account, together with the potential propagation of further stress changes as the natural fractures slip, then such reactivated volume can be substantially larger  the results presented here demonstrate the importance of local stress heterogeneities in the potential generation of microseismicity and highlight how the local stress heterogeneity directly depends on the mechanical properties of the natural fractures | 
171633-ms 	 petrophysical and geomechanical characteristics of canadian tight oil and liquid-rich gas reservoirs |abstract   the results from an ongoing laboratory study investigating petrophysical and geomechanical characteristics of the montney and bakken formations in canada are presented  the primary objectives are to 1) fully characterize the pore network (porosity, pore size distribution) and fluid transport (permeability) properties of these formations in areas with limited datasets; 2) investigate the interrelationship between petrophysical and geomechanical characteristics of these fine-grained tight reservoirs; and 3) analyze the effects of different geological factors on porosity, pore size distribution and permeability  the techniques used for characterization include: rock-eval pyrolysis (tmax, toc); bitumen reflectance; petrography (grain size); helium pycnometry; low-pressure gas (n2) adsorption (surface area, pore size distribution); pressure-decay profile permeability, pulse-decay and crushed-rock gas (n2, he) permeability; fracture permeability and mechanical hardness tests    rock-eval analysis and microscopic observations indicate that most samples are organic-lean (average toc content: 0 3%), ranging from fine-grained siltstone to very fine-grained sandstone (grain size: 31 8-53 7 <u+03bc>m)  the measured pulse-decay and crushed-rock permeability values increase significantly with increasing porosity (2 1-14 1%), ranging between 1 1·10-6 and 7 3·10-2 md  for the plugs analyzed (“as-received”), profile (probe) permeability values (9 1·10-4 - 6 7·10-3 md) are consistently higher than pulse-decay (1 6·10-5 - 9·10-4 md) and crushed-rock (1 1·10-6 - 5 4·10-5 md) permeability values  corrected profile (probe) permeability values for “in-situ” effective stress (5 3·10-5 - 1·10-3 md) are, however, comparable with the pulse-decay (1 6·10-5 - 9·10-4 md) permeability values  unpropped fracture permeability, determined using an innovative procedure in this work, can be significantly (up to eight orders of magnitude) higher than matrix permeability under similar effective stress conditions  the grain size and mechanical hardness data are correlated to permeability  the dominant pore throat diameter controlling fluid flow is estimated for all samples using winland-style correlations; these values agree with those obtained from low-pressure n2 adsorption analysis    applying multiple innovative analysis techniques on a large number of samples (26 m of slabbed core, 22 core plugs and their accompanying cuttings), this study provides a roadmap to fully characterize the fluid storage and transport properties of fine-grained tight oil and liquid-rich gas reservoirs  we demonstrate that pore structure, large- and fine-scale (cm-size) permeability heterogeneity, and mechanical characteristics of tight oil and liquid-rich gas reservoirs can be suitably-characterized using the methods we have used with application to flow-unit identification and mechanical stratigraphy determination  we further present useful correlations between petrophysical and geomechanical properties for the reservoirs studied |

171648-ms 	 understanding the optimum fracture conductivity for naturally fractured shale and tight reservoirs |abstract   with the development of unconventional shale and tight reservoirs, stimulation treatments that place multiple transverse fractures have received a greater attention in recent years  the post-frac productivity of such low-permeability reservoirs is largely determined by the matrix-fracture contact area with appropriate fracture conductivity  although it is often anticipated that the fractures are infinitely conductive, the general belief is that the production increases with the proppant amount injected    this paper presents an approach to assess the optimum proppant amount injected by determining the post-frac conductivity  first, using three-dimensional finite difference reservoir simulations in a naturally fractured reservoir, which has both the hydraulic fracture and natural fractures modeled explicitly as discrete grid blocks, we find cumulative production as a function of fracture conductivity  for a fixed propped length and production time, we observe a critical conductivity beyond which the production is insensitive to the conductivity  the critical conductivity is then obtained as a function of the propped length and production time  the numerical results show that the critical conductivity increases with propped length and decreases with production time  the effect of stimulated natural fracture properties (intensity and permeability) on the critical conductivity is then investigated  for reservoirs with matrix permeability in the range 20-1000 nd, natural fractures increase the short-term critical conductivity but decrease the medium to long-term ones  the paper also evaluates the influence of water production, cluster spacing, and bhp flowing pressure on the critical conductivity    this study demonstrates that agarwal type curves based on linear flow are not appropriate for naturally fractured reservoirs and lead to errors in estimation of critical conductivity  the results of this study can be useful for selecting the type and amount of proppant for stimulation of unconventional reservoirs    introduction   recent advances in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing have enabled economic production from north american shale and tight reservoirs  these include multi-stage fracturing using plug-and-perf method, use of slickwater as fracturing fluid and various completion tools  due to low recovery factors and fast declining rates, well productivity in such low-permeability reservoirs is driven by the stimulation effectiveness to create a large matrix-fracture contact area  therefore, optimizing the completions parameters (stage spacing, proppant and fluid type, open-hole vs  cemented etc ) has become an integral part of the field-development program    shale reservoirs are complex, heterogeneous and often characterized by the presence of natural fractures, faults and planes of weakness  the interactions between hydraulic and natural fractures can lead to non-planar, complex fracture growths  however, such network growth is not fully understood and the field validation has been challenging  although microseismic measurements have provided some insight into the complex fracture network growth (king 2010), microseimics can only capture a small portion of rock deformation and cannot provide any information about proppant and conductivity distribution (cipolla and wallace, 2014)  diagnostic tools such as production logs, fiber optics, tracers etc  are often qualitative and severely limited by non-uniqueness of the interpretation  in addition, the accuracy of current fracture models to simulate the network fracture growth is limited to only 2d (mcclure 2014) and pseudo-3d models (weng et al , 2011; meyer et al  2013)  all these factors have made completion engineers to choose the optimization parameters based on ad-hoc, trial-and-error approaches | 
171653-ms 	 advances in understanding liquid flow in gas shales |abstract   understanding water uptake of gas shales is critical for designing fracturing and treatment fluids  previous imbibition experiments on unconfined gas shales have led to several key observations  the water uptake of dry shales is higher than their oil uptake  furthermore, water imbibition results in sample expansion and microfracture induction  this study provides additional experimental data to understand the effects of rock fabric, complex pore network, and clay swelling on imbibition behavior    we systematically measure the imbibition rates of fresh water, brine and oil into the confined and unconfined rock samples and crushed packs from different shale members of the horn river basin  we also measure the ion diffusion rate from shale into water during imbibition experiments  the results show that confining the shale samples decreases the water imbibition rate of samples tested parallel to the bedding  however, it has a negligible effect on water uptake of samples tested perpendicular to the bedding and on ion diffusion rates  the comparative study suggests that, for both confined and unconfined samples, water uptake is higher than oil uptake  the liquid imbibition and ion diffusion rates along the bedding are higher than those against the bedding  surprisingly, the crushed samples show a completely different behavior  the oil uptake of crushed packs is higher than their water uptake  the data suggest that the connected pore network of the intact samples is water wet while the majority of rock including poorly connected pores is oil wet  this argument is backed by complete spreading of oil on fresh break surfaces of the rock    1  introduction   tight oil and gas reservoirs, considered "unconventional resources", have been emerged as a significant source of energy supply in the united state and canada, to supplement the decreasing supply of conventional resources and meet the increased global demands on oil and gas (frantz et al, 2005; zahid et al , 2007; khlaifat et al , 2011)  unconventional resources with ultralow matrix permeability are capable of producing oil and gas at economic rates when completed by hydraulically fractured horizontal wells (ning et al , 1993)  during hydraulic fracturing, a great amount of water-based hydraulic fracturing fluid with low proppant concentration is injected into the target formation to create multiple fractures and increase the contact surface between the wellbore and reservoir (holditch and tschirhart, 2005; palisch et al , 2010)  however, only a small fraction of injected fluid, typically 10 to 20%, can be recovered during the clean-up phase (king, 2012; cheng, 2012)  spontaneous imbibition of fracturing fluid is known as the primary mechanism for fracturing fluid loss and ineffcient water recovery (cheng, 2012; bennion et al , 2005; paktinat et al , 2006; shaoul et al , 2011; roychaudhuri et al , 2011)  other possible mechanisms which control the behavior of the retained water in the reservoir include gravity segregation and stress-sensitive fracture conductivities (holditch, 1979; gdanski et al , 2009; parmar et al, 2012; 2013; 2014) | 
171667-ms 	 benefits of controlled hydraulic fracture placement: theory and field experiment |abstract   today, shale reservoirs are completed with multiple hydraulic fractures  for efficiency reasons, hydraulic fracturing is typically “staged”, each stage comprising of multiple perforation clusters with the aim of initiating one hydraulic fracture per cluster  cluster spacing is an important parameter to optimize, but the following is still unanswered: what is the minimum spacing that can be achieved between hydraulic fractures, given that both formation heterogeneity and stress shadow play a governing role?   this paper uses a new model for the simultaneous initiation and propagation of hydraulic fractures from a horizontal well  based on this model and observed field results from a well completed with 92 single-entry fracture treatments, new insights on the lack of robustness associated with multiple cluster plug-and-perf completion are presented  without a large perforation friction pressure drop, there is a minimum spacing of clusters below which, fractures are “shut down” by the stress shadow effect  the stress shadow can, however, be mitigated with a large perforation pressure drop when there is no stress variation between clusters  moreover, significant stress variations along clusters can be overcome by engineering the limited entry technique (choking down clusters in low stress zones), provided that the corresponding stress variations are known    the limited entry technique however fails to enable hydraulic fracture initiation and development from all of the perforation clusters if there is a significant variation of near-wellbore pressure drop associated with the complexity of the fracture geometry in the near-wellbore when re-orienting toward the far-field in-situ stress direction    downhole pressure measurements from an experimental well completed with 92 single-entry fractures show large variations in near-wellbore pressure drop, highly correlated with the variations in breakdown pressures even though the stress variation estimated from the mineralogy are very small along the lateral  had this well been completed with stages of 4 clusters each, a significant portion of the clusters would not have initiated and most of the slurry would have been taken by less than half of the clusters   using the single-entry fracturing technique, each of the perforation clusters has initiated and propagated fractures as designed | 
171682-ms 	 chemical and mechanical aspects of wellbore stability in shale formations: a literature review |abstract   drilling a shale formation with no borehole problems can be a challenging task  with high content of clays, shale formations are prone to swelling, dispersion, tight hole and other problems  those problems are well-documented in literature  different types of clays give different types of problems  for example, when it is exposed to water, a shale sample with a high percentage of smectite tends to swell while another shale sample with a high percentage of kaolinite tends to disintegrate and disperse  the mechanism that destabilizes reactive shale when it comes in contact with water differs from on shale sample to another  it is important to know which mechanism is taking place in order to be proactive and inhibit the drilling fluid with the appropriate inhibitor  it is also important to characterize the shale sample in terms of its geological structure, mineralogical composition and interaction potential    shale characterization and testing methods include but not limited to the following: x-ray analysis, degradation and reorientation evaluation using scanning electron microscope (sem), cation exchange capacity (cec) determination, swelling test, dispersion test, slake durability test, bulk hardness test, accretion test, shale membrane test, inhibition durability test and uniaxial and triaxial compression tests    different types of shale inhibitors and stabilizers have been used in the industry such as: potassium chloride, calcium chloride, silicates, polyamines, glycol and lignosulfonate  each of them has a mechanism by which it can inhibit the hydration, disintegration and dispersion of clays in the presence of water    this paper discusses the physio-chemical and chemico-mechanical effects of shale-drilling fluid interactions and the associated drilling problems that are most frequently encountered while drilling shales formations  it also reviews the most common shale testing methods used to evaluate the interaction potential of various shale-drilling fluid systems  moreover, the paper describes different mechanisms by which shale can be inhibited and wellbore stability problems can be mitigated    introduction   about 75% of the formations drilled worldwide are shale formations with a high sensitivity to water-based muds  these formations are well-known for their high clay content and associated wellbore instability problems (steiger, 1992)  when clay-rich rocks are exposed to water, they start to react and behave like unconsolidated rocks  the extent of reaction, the mechanism and the consequences differ from one type of clay to another  for example, kaolinite clay tends to disperse in water, illite clay tends to disperse but to a lesser extent while smectite clay tends to swell  because shales from different zones have different clay mineralogy, the response of every shale zone is usually different when exposed to water    in addition to swelling and dispersion, another source of wellbore instability while drilling shale formations is the disturbance of stresses around the borehole  the stresses around the borehole can be resolved into three main stresses: vertical stress, minimum horizontal stress and maximum horizontal stress  these stresses are altered and rearranged depending on several factors such as hydrostatic pressure of drilling fluid, swelling and hydration pressure effect and the overbalance pressure used to support the borehole wall  because of the low permeability and high capillary suction of shale matrix,  a phenomenon called mud pressure penetration develops when drilling shale with overbalance pressure  an increase in the pore fluid pressure will result from the small volume penetrating into the wellbore and, therefore, wellbore instability will be triggered (riley et al , 2012)| 
171702-ms 	 effect of co2 sequestration period on the mechanical properties of carbonate aquifers |abstract   geological sequestration of carbon dioxide (co2) in underground formations is the most promising way to decrease the greenhouse emissions into atmosphere  the understanding of long term effects of co2 storage in carbonate aquifers is challenged by many uncertainties including geochemical effects of co2 on carbonates and the coupled chemical–mechanical effects  the carbon dioxide dissolves in water forming bicarbonate which will dissociate to carbonic acid  this acid dissolves calcites in carbonate rocks  as a result, the mechanical properties of the aquifer changes through this interaction  it is therefore necessary to study the effect of carbon dioxide sequestration on the integrity of a given formation to get safe and effective long-term storage of co2 sequestration in deep saline aquifers  to the best of our knowledge, previous works on co2 sequestration have focused on the impact of co2 injection on the petrophysical and mechanical properties of formation rocks but the injection occurred in a short period, which was not enough for carbon dioxide to react with formation brine and thus the chemical reaction that will impact the properties of the rocks    the main objective of this paper is to investigate the effect of co2 storage on the mechanical properties of carbonate aquifer rocks that were exposed to soaking with co2  furthermore, the effect of the duration of co2-brine contact time or solubility time on these properties was investigated  co2 was stored in the cores at 2000 psi and 100<u+00ba>c for different time periods ranging from two weeks to three months  the cores were then analyzed for the mechanical properties using acoustics, unconfined compression, and indirect tensile strength testing machines    results showed that storing co2 for longer times changed the rock mechanical properties significantly  samples in which co2 was stored for longer times exhibited greater change in mechanical properties compared to those in which co2 was stored for shorter time   the geochemical interaction between co2, brine, and rock is time dependent making changes in rock mechanical properties also time dependent    introduction   the emissions of carbon dioxide have become the main contributing factors of a continuing increase in the temperature of the earth leading to global warming  currently, the techniques of decreasing these emissions have been established including the capture and geological storage of carbon dioxide  there are four areas that are relevant to the geological sequestration of carbon dioxide:   enhanced oil recovery (eor),  |storage in depleted oil and gas reservoirs,  |storage in deep saline aquifers, and |enhanced coal bed methane recovery (ecbmr) (nguyen et al , 2003; jaeger, 2005)    among these areas, the storage of carbon dioxide into deep saline aquifers is considered to be the most effective and advanced technology for reducing the emission co2 when compared to other sequestration technologies | 
171704-ms 	 a predictive model to link molecular structures to carbonate rock wettability: adsorption of various organic molecules on flat and rugged calcite surfaces |abstract   wettability is a key petrophysical property which impacts multiphase flow in porous media  it is generally believed that rock wettability in subsurface reservoirs has been established by adsorption of organic molecules during oil invasion and that the majority of carbonate reservoirs are mixed-wet or oil-wet as a consequence hereof  thus, insight into which molecules actually bind to the carbonate rock, estimation of molecule-specific relative adsorption affinities and the importance of the crystalline calcite structure is pivotal to decipher the origin of wettability in carbonate reservoirs – and modification hereof in eor processes    we applied advanced density functional theory (dft) to calculate adsorption energies of 36 different organic molecules on top of calcite with two different crystalline structures, namely flat {104} and rugged calcite {318}  we made an in-depth statistical analysis of the data and the work stands out to our knowledge as the most comprehensive and systematic quantitative study of adsorption of organic molecules reported to date  we show that molecules with a carboxylic group adsorb to calcite with highest affinity and that all 36 molecules bind with significantly higher affinity to rugged calcite as compared to flat calcite  strikingly, this adsorption enhancement was most significant for molecules with functional groups containing nitrogen and oxygen  this suggests that regions in carbonate rocks with rugged surfaces of calcite have an inherent thermodynamic preference to become more oil-wet as compared to flat calcite surfaces when exposed to organic molecules with polar functional groups    we applied cosmo (conductor-like screening model) theory in conjunction with our recently published generalized sigma moment (gsm) model to derive a predictive correlation to estimate calcite type-specific molecular adsorption energies  we derived two models with significant prediction power (r2=0 95 and r2=0 9) and show from nonlinear regression and clustering analysis that the electrostatic polarity of the organic molecules is the single most important determinant of adsorption energy    the thorough analysis and the correlations we present here are valuable and powerful tools for quantitative prediction of adsorption energies of wettability-modifying organic molecules and for deciphering the origin of wettability of carbonate rocks  |

171735-ms 	 interaction between multiple injections using tightly coupled fluid-structure interaction computational algorithm |abstract   recent technologies developed for drilling, completion, and fracturing in horizontal wells have allowed the oil and gas industry to effectively use multistage fracturing stimulation treatments to help improve production in tight and unconventional gas and oil reservoirs  the fracturing process usually involves placing multiple perforation clusters exposed to the injected fluid in each treatment’s stage  it has been shown that very strong interactions occur between the fractures propagating from the clusters, which further influence the effectiveness of production following a fracturing treatment  this paper presents a computational methodology to simulate and analyze the major physics associated with the interactions between multiple injections using a tightly coupled fluid-structure interaction (fsi) numerical model for hydraulic fracturing  this approach uses the finite element method (fem) to computationally evaluate the stresses and deformation of elastic rock blocks  nonpenetration contact conditions between adjacent solids, coupled with tensile and shear failure models, are developed to describe fracture evolution and its interaction with the rock blocks  the fluid flow in opened fractures is modeled using the cubic law formulation  the proposed coupling computational method leads to an integrative algebraic system for a set of variables that fully describes this multiphysics phenomenon, including rock block corner displacements and lagrange multipliers for cases where the blocks are in contact, along with the fluid’s pressure at junctions of the opened fracture network  the suggested algorithm solves all of the unknowns simultaneously and in a tightly coupled manner  this algorithm is not limited to the specific study of the interactions between hydraulically induced fractures from different perforation clusters, but it can also be used to properly describe the interactions between hydraulically induced fractures and natural fractures  yet, because of the existence of natural fractures, the interactions between multiple injections become more complicated than the interactions between only hydraulically induced fractures  in these cases, the natural fractures between multiple injections provide a stronger interaction and pathways for injected fracturing fluid between multiple injections  the spacing of injection clusters is studied for its effect on fracture length and the width of fractures for each injection cluster  | 
171755-ms 	 an integrated drilling and geomechanics approach helps to successfully drill wells along the minimum horizontal stress direction in khuff reservoirs |abstract   saudi aramco is drilling horizontal wells along the minimum horizontal stress direction in an attempt to generate multiple transverse fractures during stimulation to increase gas production and enhance recovery  however, drilling operations in these wells are difficult due to wellbore instability because of the higher mud weights required to minimize formation breakout due to prevailing in-situ stress conditions  increased mud weight also led to higher differential pressure across the variably depleted reservoir layers, which when coupled with formation instability, created greater challenges for the drilling team  these conditions resulted in a significantly increased number of stuck pipe incidents, incurring noticeably high nonproductive time including loss of bottomhole assemblies in the hole  to address these problems, an integrated approach between drilling expertise, applied geomechanics, and advanced mud logging technology was applied to successfully overcome stuck pipe events arising from wellbore instability and differential sticking  additionally, the drilling and tripping practices were customized to confront borehole instability issues  further, to account for formation heterogeneity and varying in-situ stresses, the predrill mechanical-earth-model (mem) was updated during drilling using real-time drilling geomechanics (rtdg)  in addition, advanced cutting return-monitoring technology was  used, which helped hole cleaning to minimize the risk of stuck pipe due to formation failure (excessive cuttings)  an insight into the planning, challenges encountered, and procedures implemented to successfully drill the planned horizontal wells will be presented |

171993-ms 	 prediction of reservoir formation collapse in a carbonate gas field in abu dhabi uae using coupled reservoir geomechanical modelling |abstract   formation collapse in reservoirs where the pressure has not been maintained during depletion can cause permeability reduction, completion damage and well failure, interrupting production and affecting the ultimate recovery from the reservoir  the problem is particularly acute within severely depleted areas of the field    in this paper a carbonate gas field was investigated  for this developed field, a further production plan has been scheduled to deplete the reservoir up to the year 2063 without any reservoir pressure maintenance  the objective of this study is to investigate the possibility of formation collapse of the productive zone, well failure and completion integrity damage particularly within the severely depleted areas  coupled reservoir geomechanical modelling was conducted, and different scenarios were investigated to understand the impact of uncertainty in mechanical properties and the presence of faults and fractures    the results indicate that pore collapse is likely to be the main failure mechanism of high porosity formations with high levels of depletion  onset of formation failure is likely to happen around 2018 to 2020, and it is recommended to monitor the production rate of those wells located in high porosity and high depletion areas  pressure maintenance should be implemented if the reservoir pressure falls below 1000 psi in the later stages of production    key words: formation collapse; carbonate gas reservoir; pressure maintenance; coupled reservoir geomechanical modelling; abu dhabi    introduction   a giant onshore abu dhabi carbonate gas field in the united arab emirates was investigated  the total area of the field is approximately 1200 km2, but the area of investigation covers approximately 644 km2  it is located approximately 85 kilometers sw of the city of abu dhabi  the reservoir thickness of this investigated field is around 90 ft , and the depth of the reservoir top is at about 8500 ft  the reservoir was discovered in 1958 and came on stream in 1963  as shown in fig  1, a production plan has been scheduled to further deplete the reservoir from about 2000 psi today, to 600 psi by 2063  in this plan, no pressure maintenance is scheduled  lack of pressure maintenance could result in formation collapse, which would adversely affect the production and ultimate recovery of this reservoir    in this study, the construction of 1d mechanical earth models (mems) at ten existing wells was carried out for the gas field  on the basis of seismic interpreted horizons and faults, a 3d mem was constructed  then, a coupled reservoir geomechanical modelling approach was used to analyze the risk of the reservoir formation collapse, identifying where, when and at what pressure the collapse would occur  to capture a representative in situ condition, a pre-production initial stress state was simulated and calibrated with measurements and observations in the 1d mems  to model the geomechanical behaviour in the reservoir from pre-production to present day, and then to the year 2063, a coupling between reservoir simulation and geomechanical modeling was performed, where the impact of the gas field depletion on reservoir deformation can be assessed with production time  to understand the impact of the mechanical property uncertainty and fault/fracture presence, four scenarios were performed, including a base case (case 1), a case with weak faults (case 2), a case with weak faults and formation (case 3), and a case with weak faults and formation with fractures (case 4) | 
172009-ms 	 pore pressure prediction in ultra-deep salt formation in tarim basin |abstract   one of the major challenges during drilling in ultra-deep salt formation in tarim basin is to predict pore pressure accurately  the salt formation buried at 6000-7800m, which had been affected by tectonic events  currently, the industry mainly relies on the empirical relations, such as velocities and resistivity trends, to predict pore pressure  consequently, many investigators have shown these methods are largely based on shale behavior, which reduces the reliability of purely trend-based methods in predicting salt formation overpressure    in this paper, pore pressure mechanism can be obtained from the existing wells data-- including the characteristics of geological structure, pore pressure distribution and logging response directly pertinent to the salt formation  a new model for pore pressure prediction in salt formation is proposed based on the small deflection bending theory of thin plate and poroelasticity theory  this model includes in-situ stress state, tectonic deformation curvature and elastic modulus which were not included in the existing models    according to the field data analysis, the tectonic compression is the primary overpressure generation mechanism  this approach, based on a rock-physics model, is an improvement over existing pore-pressure prediction methods, which mainly rely on empirical relations  moreover, it is the fundamental to understand the mechanism of the overpressure generation    with more than 45 wells predicted with this proposed model, the average error is less than 8%  thus, recommendations for drilling in salt formation can be given    introduction   pore pressure is the fluid pressure in the pore spaces of porous rock  hydrostatic pressure is referred to the pressure of fluid columns gravity induced, which is proportional to the fluid density and the vertical heights of fluid columns  pore pressure varies from hydrostatic pressure  when pore pressure exceeds the hydrostatic pressure at the particular depth, it is defined as overpressure (zhang, 2011)    pore pressure is one of the most important parameters for drilling engineering  poor knowledge of pore pressure causes high costs, even affects the oilfield production and severely leads to blowout, lost circulation and wellbore instability  due to the salt characteristic of plastic creep and anisotropy, it has been affected by complex geologic and tectonic events, making it difficult to accurately understand the overpressure generatation mechanism, establish the pore pressure prediction model and calculate pore pressure profile (saleh, s , 2013; rizvi, a , 2013)    pore pressure, especially, overpressure, is caused by many mechanisms  the currently accepted pore pressure generation mechanisms mainly are: (1) undercompaction (fertl, 1976); (2) source mechanisms, includes hydrocarbon generation (hunt, 1990), smectite to illite digenesis in shales (dutta, 1983; dutta, 2002), thermal (baker, 1972); (3) mechanical mechanism, includes shear (yassir, 1996), tectonic stress (traugott, 1997); (4) lateral pressure transfer in sand (swarbrick, 1998)  in general, there is a predominant mechanism for a special study block  the overpressure generation mechanisms of salt formation are directly related to the nature of tectonics acting on the sediments in published literature  | 
172013-ms 	 laboratory measurements on changes in carbonate rock properties due to co2-saturated water injection |abstract   carbon dioxide enhanced oil recovery (co2-eor) is gaining attention as a technique for reducing environmental impact and enhancing crude oil recovery  the injected co2 reaches supercritical states at certain temperature and pressure conditions to be miscible with crude oil  then, miscible co2-oil mixture has lower viscosity and higher mobility than oil alone, leading to increased oil recovery rate  however, carbonate minerals are known to dissolve when co2 is injected into reservoirs; therefore, it is important to evaluate how properties of rocks in a carbonate rock reservoir are affected by co2-eor  in this study, co2-rich water was injected on carbonate rock samples mainly collected from middle eastern oil field and laboratory measurements including sem image, liquid chromatography analysis, nmr t2 relaxation time and elastic wave velocity measurement, were conducted  the dissolution states of carbonate minerals were investigated by sem images  furthermore, liquid chromatography analysis was applied to co2-rich water flooded through the samples to detect the amount of dissolved carbonate minerals  the porosity increase estimated from the chromatography analysis could be 0 6% or higher at 100 pore volumes (pv) injection  on the other hands, it was observed that samples became shorter as injection increased  the sample shortening may be caused by mechanical compaction associated with pressure loading test  the corresponding porosity reduction due to the sample shortening was estimated; magnitude of the average value of four sample is comparable to porosity increase due to chemical dissolution  elastic wave velocity measurements showed p-wave velocity decreased in all the samples, as the amount of co2 -rich water increased; p-wave velocity increase at 100 pv was 2 - 10 %  s-wave velocity decrease was also observed to be 2 - 4% in the most of samples  moreover, intensity reduction of small size pore was observed by nmr t2 relaxation time analysis  thus, it was confirmed that effects of co2-rich water injection on reservoir rock properties cannot be negligible    introduction   the co2-eor technology improves oil recovery rate by injecting co2 into a reservoir  the injected co2 reaches supercritical states at certain temperature and pressure conditions (31 1°c and 7 38 mpa or higher), attaining physical properties similar to those of oil and becoming miscible with oil  mixtures of supercritical co2 and oil have lower viscosity and higher mobility than oil alone, leading to increased oil recovery rate  this technique is also considered to be an environmentally friendly technique because it injects co2 underground to prevent emission of co2 to the atmosphere    it has been known that carbonate minerals are dissolved due to the acidity of co2  the effects of mineral dissolution on the rock properties have been investigated by laboratory measurements, and the results have been reported (e g , vanorio et al , 2011; grombacher et al , 2012)  vanorio et al  (2011) conducted experiments on carbonate rock samples that were injected with co2  changes in physical properties, such as acoustic velocity and porosity, were measured, and changes in rock microstructures were observed by sem images  the results showed that micritic carbonate minerals were dissolved with aqueous solutions of co2, leading to increased porosity and decreased acoustic velocity  grombacher et al  (2012) also conducted integrated laboratory measurements including nmr, sem and ct-scan for carbonate rock samples injected with co2  they reported changes in acoustic velocity, permeability, and microstructures | 
172016-ms 	 dynamic modelling for well design, increasing operational margins in challenging fields |abstract   the easy oil is gone and current field developments requires different approaches to produce oil and gas reserves in the most effective and economic ways, keeping the safety standards as high as technologically possible    the use of dynamic hydraulic modelling software to predict and establish wellbore pressures and temperature in challenging wells (e g : narrow margin window, hpht or mature/depleted reservoirs), enable drilling engineers (de) to make the well design within the operational limits for drilling, tripping, casing and cementing operations, thus allowing access to reserves  however, this process must start with a management of change in the philosophy that still is being applied today in planning and operational procedures (steady state modelling)    this process starts with an in-depth review of the expected pore/fracture pressures, wellbore stability window and temperature profile along the well trajectory  the prediction of the operational window for each of the well sections will then be used to review the optimal mud weight including the dynamic ecd/esd management and dynamic kick tolerance limitation for the proposed fluid, considering the operational transient effects on the well design  subsequently, dynamic surge and swab and cementing calculations are included in the review to ensure that pore and fracture pressure limits are maintained during all operations  bottomhole temperatures as well as surface temperatures can then be reviewed and predicted to ensure that downhole tools and other components can be used according to tool specifications    a combination of drilling techniques combined with real time pore pressure predictions, dynamic modelling and online drilling systems supported by the powerful computational technologies available nowadays, will change the way we plan and work our challenging fields in the near future    this paper will explore the fundamentals of the dynamic drilling modelling required during the well planning process, in addition to a brief description of “online drilling systems”, to allow safe access to challenging fields    introduction   the well planning process is extensively known across the industry since it has been in practice for more than 100 years  however, as we are reaching deeper reservoirs and working in more challenging conditions such as harsh environments, deep water, high pressure high temperature (hpht) or mature/depleted fields, common design practices are reaching the capability limits and therefore, are required to re-think the old ways in order to produce new solutions    with today’s high and fast computational capacities available for all disciplines, it is now possible to introduce very complex equations and analyze, almost in real-time the interaction between the different phenomenons’s affecting the drilling process  this enable the engineers to produce more accurate results and therefore, to have a better and realistic representation of reality during the early planning phase    lately, many operators have decided to move into transient solutions that offers a more realistic modelling of the system and allow them to open new opportunities and boundaries for drilling practices that before where unavailable | 
172037-ms 	 geomechanical characterisation of analogue sandstones for the yield energy approach to prediction of debris production and wellbore stability |abstract   characterisation of the mechanical and petrophysical properties of quarried sandstones was conducted to assess their suitability as reservoir rocks  five sets of outcrop sandstones, covering a range of porosity and permeability were identified as potential geomechanical analogues for north sea sandstones  a comprehensive series of mechanical and petrophysical tests were undertaken in order to evaluate the mechanical properties of the sandstones (modulus of elasticity, poisson's ratio and compressive strength) over a range of confining pressure likely to be encountered in the north sea and basic petrophysical characteristics defined by grain density, porosity and permeability  the quarried sandstones have been found to be suitable reservoir analogues  the post failure sand production potential of the sandstones was examined by investigating the failure modes and analysing the granulometric characteristics of the comminution debris created by post peak strength sliding along shear surfaces    data generated from the laboratory testing were used as input parameters to investigate the propensity of sand debris production and formation stability in a hypothetical wellbore using the yield energy model  this model quantifies the energy available for rock fragmentation and describes the extent of the yield zone as a function of production rates and drawdown pressures  the geomechanical appraisal, which is a necessary component of the approach, also serves as a source of representative mechanical properties data available as input for reservoir simulators and other rock mechanics related analysis  the model was found to be applicable for a wide range of sandstones    1 introduction   the stress state of a sandstone reservoir and subsequent changes in the in situ stress state of the reservoir due to petroleum related operations is a significant factor on the performance and recovery of producing assets  rock strength properties are affected by stress changes due to drilling process and production/injection operations  yield and fragmentation of rock occurs when the rock is exposed to stresses which exceed its failure criterion, creating a yield zone and hence the potential for well instability and sand production  sand debris production prediction and wellbore stability studies are among some major activities that rely on rock mechanical data  thus, the ability to predict the mechanical parameters of a reservoir formation is key to avoiding wellbore instability and evaluating the sanding potential of the reservoir rock mechanical properties for petroleum engineering applications are usually obtained from direct measurement on reservoir core samples or alternatively, indirectly by applying correlations of mechanical data with other core and log parameters (edlmann et al , 1998)  since none of the correlation methods can directly yield static strength value without appreciable uncertainty, laboratory testing on core samples remains the most reliable means of obtaining reservoir rock mechanical parameters  however, the acquisition of core samples from whole reservoir interval is prohibitively expensive (ameen et al , 2009), in most cases the number of  representative cores are insufficient for a complete mechanical characterisation across relevant intervals of the reservoir (holt et al , 2005)  the utilisation of analogue sandstone samples can offer a cost effective means of evaluating reservoir strength parameters against the prohibitive expensive and unreliable representative core samples from the field  a question that commonly arises is how representative are the analogue samples compared to the actual reservoir samples  it is essential for an analogue to possess the salient and critical features of the reservoir rock particular in relation to the objective of the test  in order to satisfy these requirements, it becomes absolutely necessary to establish both physical and mechanical relationship between the analogue samples and the reservoir rocks |

17235-ms 	 shale-fluid interactions and drilling fluid designs |abstract   drilling of shale has long been a challenge due to the strong sensitivity of shale to drilling fluids  improper selection of drilling fluid may cause strong shale-fluid interaction and, consequently, wellbore instability  it is critical to design drilling fluids so as to minimize the shale-fluid interaction    shale can possess different behaviors when in contact with fluid (e g , fracturing, swelling, and dispersion)  the differences in shale-fluid interaction are mainly related to its clay minerals, structure, bedding and thin laminae, and pre-existing fractures  the rate and strength of interaction vary for different shales  while strong fracturing or dispersion could happen in just a few minutes for some shales, other shales exhibit only very weak fracturing after days in contact with the same fluid  confining pressure can significantly reduce the propagation of fractures, but pre-existing fractures can be enlarged or extended due to fluid invasion    due to the variations of shale and the resulting differences in shale-fluid interactions, the shale behavior of fluid in one area or formation cannot always be extrapolated to another area or formation  for a specific shale formation, the understanding of diagenesis, bedding and thin laminae, pre-existing fractures, and abundance and distribution of reactive clays such as smectite, helps predict the potential shale instability  for example, if shale with high smectite content has not experienced substantial compaction and thermal alteration, it may show a strong tendency for dispersion  alternatively, if high-smectite shale has experienced strong compaction and thermal alteration and shows laminated structures, fracturing along bedding planes or laminae could be the dominant deformation mechanism in fluids  our laboratory tests indicate that even for highly reactive shale, proper inhibition can be achieved if the composition and concentration of chemical additives in drilling fluids are selected appropriately    introduction   drilling of shale has long been a challenge due to its strong potential for wellbore instability, which is mainly caused by the imbalance of in-situ stresses and/or interactions between drilling fluid and shale (lai 1999; van oort 2003)  the mechanical failure of shale related to stress status can be minimized or prevented by the adjustment of mud weight and changing the drilling trajectory  nevertheless, chemical interactions have to be minimized through the selection of proper drilling fluid chemistry    wellbore stability is not an issue for most shale formations with oil-based and synthetic-based drilling fluid, or "mud??  however, high costs and environmental restrictions have largely limited the use of oil-based drilling fluid  for water-based drilling fluid (wbm), the chemical interaction between rock and fluids due to both water and ionic species fluxes from and into the rock could cause wellbore instability  therefore, design of wbms with appropriate chemical additives is critical to the success of drilling practices both economically and environmentally (simpson et al  1995; ewy and morton 2008; gomez and he 2006, 2012)    this paper will focus on the chemical interactions between shale and water-based drilling fluids  the paper will first explore the behavior of shale in fluids and investigate the relationship between the interaction behavior and rock properties  then laboratory test results are presented that indicate shale-fluid interactions are strongly dependent on fluid chemistry  even for highly reactive shale, appropriate composition and concentration of chemical additives can effectively reduce its interaction with fluids | 
172355-ms 	 combination of cj-dswp and hwu for accomplishing efficient well abandonment in nigeria |abstract   a major global oil and gas producer has recently embarked on decommissioning of temporarily abandoned wells onshore, nigeria  this was largely informed by a drive to ensure commitment to safeguarding of people and the environment and to ensure industry regulatory compliance/best practice  in addition in some cases human habitation has since encroached around these wells; most of which were drilled over 30 years ago and have since outlived their useful life    the decommissioning entailed total removal of both surface and sub-surface well equipment, installing permanent barriers to effectively isolate fresh water reservoirs from hydrocarbon bearing reservoirs in an environmentally safe manner, and subsequently restore the surface location, as close as possible, to its original state  therefore, traditionally a conventional work-over rig would have been required    however, after an in-depth analysis –technical, economic and safety- the producer chose a combination of the hydraulic workover unit (hwu) and the casing jack dual stage work platform (cj-dswp) over the conventional workover rig  the hwu3 and cj-dswp4 was provided by tecon oil services, an indigenous services company  the hwu and cj-dswp are compact hydraulic units with very small foot print; hwu rigged up directly on the wellhead2, is used to pooh (pull out of hole) the tubing strings and to secure/plug the well, cj-dswp deploys internal pressure pipe cutter to cut the casing, safely pull the casing to surface and cut them to shorter lengths for easy handling    the combination of the hwu and cj-dswp has safely decommissioned over 4wells as at december 2013 and also brings a huge cost saving compared to conventional workover rig  this paper is a review of how the hwu and cj-dswp duo have been able to accomplish this  it highlights the advantages hwu-cjdswp offered and as well as the challenges that were encountered | 
172361-ms 	 wellbore stability management in weak bedding planes and angle of attack in well planing |abstract   borehole instabilities during drilling are more common in shale formations than in most other rock formations  the assessment of in-situ stress and analysis of borehole failure due to instability and weak bedding planes represents one of the most critical factors when evaluating borehole stability that causes borehole failure  significant amount of research have been done in this area which resulted in various mathematical models about the issue of borehole failure, stability and plane of weakness due to bedding  so far, unified decision about the plane of weakness and failure of borehole on shale is yet to be fully realized by the industry, the most common of these losses are: widening of the well, washouts, stuck pipes, cavings, and deformation of the casing, amongst others  this work highlights the effect of shale bedding plane failure on wellbore stability and the angle of attack for stable drilling conditions in weak bedding planes by developing a robust tool to account for the criterion/conditions for identifying and drilling weak bedding planes , the rock strength for weak bedding planes (uniaxial compressive strength ucs), minimum mud pressure to prevent shear failure & wellbore slip or slip shear failure in weak bedding planes and suitable attack angle to the bedding planes was also developed    the proposed tool has increased drilling efficiency and has been validated with field data  the advantage of this process is reduction in drilling difficulties and non productive time (npt) in field operations in the niger delta where well construction targeting deeper horizons are proving to be a challenge  the new rock strength for weak bedding planes (ucs) helps to predict the minimum mud pressure to prevent shear failure & wellbore slip or slip shear failure in weak bedding planes having determined the best angle to place the well (angle of attack) |

172392-ms 	 comparative analysis of geomechanical parameters using cores, sonic and gamma ray logs for optimal well design |abstract   geomechanics data are usually dependent on log data and reservoir rocks often deforms due to depletion in the life of a field  these changes occur as a result of changes in the stress on such rocks which are imposed by drilling, production and injection activities and these changes can be unfavourable to the operators when drilling new wells in the same field  thus, these changes have to be accurately predicted and mitigated (if undesirable)   in this study, the accuracy of these vital geomechanical parameters obtained through sonic and gamma ray logs were compared and a correlation between both was established  comparison was also made with respect to key indices including cost, safety, ease of acquisition etc  only unconfined compressive stress (ucs) as a geomechanical parameter was evaluated using several logging methods  the correlation coefficient range of 0 993 to 1 for various well logs analysed from the unconfined compressive stress obtained from the sonic and gamma ray logs  this would prove very useful especially for the marginal field operators in nigeria and mature fields that do not have sonic logs as it would enable a more accurate derivation of geomechanical properties and the accruing benefits of a geomechanical analysis study   the nagging limitation of the petrophysical log approach is the accuracy of the logs as spurious correlations were noticed from defective logs |

17272-ms 	 shallow gas confirmation by slow shear wave using new lwd sonic quadrupole technology |abstract   a re-development drilling campaign was planned for a brownfield in south east asia  in previous campaigns, conducted between 10 and 20 years ago, limited data had been acquired in the shallow to intermediate sections  at the time extensive wellbore stability issues led to stuck pipe events and lost wireline strings  the absence of data from the shallow sections resulted in difficulties for seismic ties and identifying potential shallow hazards    the planned development phase involved long 12 <u+00bc> in hole sections from a very shallow depth, with extensive borehole builds from vertical to 68°  in order to acquire shallow hole information, log data requirements led to a long bottom hole drilling assembly including multipole sonic measurements    the sonic measurements were acquired using a new multipole sonic tool in an 8 inch collar  real time quality control using transmitted coherence peaks and pumps off stations gave confidence in the real time compressional data  post processing of the full recorded mode waveforms confirmed the real time values  for shallower intervals leaky-p dispersive processing allowed determination of formation compressional signals (differentiating formation and mud where they are close in value)  formation shear values were always slower than the mud and so were not available from the monopole signal  the quadrupole mode contained slow shear through the majority of the section  shear data was seen in the range of 275 - 920 usec/ft  the compressional and shear data is the shallowest borehole sonic data acquired in the field to date  presence of shallow permeable gas was confirmed by good quality shear sonic data in a highly unconsolidated formation  the sonic data was also used for seismic inversion  historically acquisition of shallow interval sonic data has been problematic in south east asia due to soft formations and wellbore stability issues  this paper demonstrates the use of lwd mulitpole sonic to address this challenge to reduce drilling risk and geological uncertainty    introduction   sonic measurements have evolved significantly from initial rather simple application for correlating surface seismic sections in the 1950s (aron et al ,2008)  a sonic while drilling tool (lwd) was first introduced in 1995 with monopole measurements only  theoretical and laboratory work conducted in the 1980s described the use of quadrupole methods for borehole sonic shear measurements (winbow, 1985, schmitt, 1988 and chen, 1989)  more recently, quadrupole sonic lwd tools have been introduced in the industry (tang et al , 2002, market et al , 2007, and kinoshita et al , 2008) to address the need for a continuous shear measurement in applications such as geomechanics, amplitude versus offset (avo) modeling and other seismic interpretation, and vp/vs to detect the presence of gas    in offshore south east asia, the shallow section formations are commonly poorly consolidated and exhibit very slow acoustic properties  formation shear slowness (dts) is always slower than the mud slowness in these conditions and is not available from the monopole signal  the older generation lwd monopole tools therefore could not detect the shear values in this environment  with borehole conditions deteriorating with time in these poorly consolidated formations, wireline sonic data has been very difficult to obtain  this resulted in limited sonic data  acquired over the shallow section in the past for seismic tie in and shallow gas hazard identification  therefore there has been a high demand to have an lwd tool which can give good quality continuous compressional and shear slowness in this region   the measurements are applicable to most of the brownfields in the south east asia region | 
17278-ms 	 study of damage evaluation of hydraulic fracturing to reservoirs |abstract   classic hydraulic fracturing analysis is based on tensile strength of rock, failure criteria of fracture mechanics or mohr-coulomb criteria  the existing hydraulic fracturing theories consider little of permeability of fracture reservoir and effective fracturing range, which is exactly the purpose of fracturing  on the other hand, when evaluating effect of massive hydraulic fracturing (mhf), there may be lots of fracture initiation points and cracks due to large range of mhf, which brings huge challenges to numerical calculation of hydraulic fracturing    mhf will have an effect on a large range of reservoir and accompany in-line micro-earthquakes, which indicate that lots of hydraulic fractures of different scales and directions are generated  therefore, there will be difficulties to analyze cracking and propagating and estimate geometrical parameters by tensile criteria or fracture criteria  even if the classic method is feasible, processing of element grid after rock failures will be a problem    aguilera (1995) considered shear failure criteria as failure criteria of rocks and proposes fracturing theory of divergent or branched cracks, and that explains the generation of in-line micro-earthquakes in hydraulic fracturing  but the present analysis is just a qualitative method but not quantitative method    in fact, the basic goal of hydraulic fracturing is enhancing permeability of reservoirs as large as possible rather than producing one or two fractures  analysis of fracturing effects is analyzing the influence of effective fracturing range on reservoir permeability  while the existing hydraulic fracturing theories just consider propagations and fracture initiations of one or two cracks but little of the quantitative estimation for effective fracturing range    hence it is necessary to find a better mechanical method to make up deficiencies of the existing fracturing analysis and overcome the difficulties of processing element grid after rock failures    this study introduces continuum damage mechanics (gurson damage model) to hydraulic fracturing, analyzes theories and techniques of hydraulic fracturing of porous reservoirs in terms of continuum damage mechanics and discusses damage effects of hydraulic fracturing to reservoirs  an analysis evaluation system of hydraulic fracturing continuum mechanics is set up, and by using damage theories, a method of analyzing hydraulic fracturing in fissured porous reservoirs is discussed    introduction   hydraulic fracturing theories are divided into two schools (aguilera, 1995): the conventional school believes that hydraulic fractures are perpendicular to minimum principal stress and the prior research is the discussion of one or two fractures' initiations and propagations near wellbore  three problems mainly solved are (gidly, 1995; economides, 2000; wang and zhang, 1998): fracture criteria, the direction of fracture propagation and the geometry of hydraulic fractures  fracture criteria includes tensile strength criteria and fracture mechanics criteria | 
17279-ms 	 underbalanced drilling technology for unconventional tight gas reservoirs |abstract   the increased demand for more sources of clean energy such as natural gas from unconventional reservoirs has forced the industry to explore the more challenging tight gas reservoirs  tight gas reservoirs constitute a significant proportion of the world's natural gas resource and offer great potential for future reserve growth and production  however, to meet future global energy demand, access to tight gas reservoirs requires innovative and cost effective technical solutions    yet, tight gas reservoirs are often characterized by complex geological and petrophysical systems as well as heterogeneities at all scales  exploring and developing tight gas accumulations are both technically and commercially challenging due to the large subsurface uncertainty and low expected ultimate recovery per well  appraisal of deep tight gas reservoirs offers many challenges, including production rate predictions when wells are drilled overbalanced  overbalance leads to near wellbore damage to the rock matrix and fractures  damage to natural fractures intersecting the well can prevent their detection leading to missed productive intervals    in addition, the operating environment is very challenging and that affects the decisions for data acquisition  the use of salt-saturated mud systems creates a contrast and uncertainty in the data  hence, the quality of data acquired is compromised    in the 80's hydraulic fracturing of deviated wells was the method of choice for developing tight gas reservoirs worldwide  although sound in principle, in practice problems were experienced and caused either by poor cleanup due to fluid incompatibility, erosion of surface facilities or early water breakthrough due to fracturing into the water leg    in the 90's horizontal drilling became common practice as new drilling technologies developed and proved to be very successful in many tight gas fields  however, conventional drilling operations introduced foreign fluids and solids into the reservoir which lead to several different formations damage mechanisms that prevented the identification of the gas production potential from these wells    in the late 90's underbalanced drilling (ubd) was introduced, mainly to avoid the frequent drilling problems associated with total losses into these tight gas reservoirs  however, significant productivity gains were also observed and this became a key driver to apply the same ubd technology in tight gas fields    this paper provides a technical overview of the state-of-the-art ubd technology used to develop unconventional tight gas reservoirs  two real case histories from eastern jordan and south west algeria will be presented and discussed    introduction   the increased demand for more sources of clean energy such as natural gas from unconventional (tight) reservoirs has forced the industry to explore for more challenging tight gas reservoirs   new production will probably come from more difficult to produce reservoirs  in general it was accepted that static evaluation tools (logging, coring and seismic), that have proven so important for conventional reservoirs, were inadequate to characterize tight gas reservoirs and that a shift to use of dynamic flow data was needed | 
17280-ms 	 permeability multiplier prediction using 3d obc seismic data |abstract   this work describes an approach in characterizing fractured reservoir of upper jurassic carbonate using seismic azimuthal anisotropy  the ultimate objective of this study was to attempt to map permeability multiplier inter-well for the contribution to the simulation model and the subsequent development plan of an oil field offshore abu dhabi    the azimuthal seismic anisotropy for fracture prediction method showed fractures that are similar to those indicated by well methods and therefore seismic can be used to detect natural fractures between wells  the confidence in the seismic fracture prediction method's ability to capture information about fracture in carbonate reservoir has increased if the well data are accurately integrated    the study interval exists in the dense zone of the upper jurassic reservoir with total thickness of 120'  the fractures evidence have been compiled from well data, such as core, fmi, orthogonal shear sonic, production test, multi-arm caliber… etc  present day stress is captured from induced fractures direction, borehole breakout, offset field stress map, eocene structure map and world stress map  all compiled information's indicated maximum horizontal stress of n10°-30°e direction    the four sectored wide azimuth seismic data set have been fitted to an ellipse to find out the fast and slow velocity direction and the difference between those velocities  the interval velocity is sensitive to lithology, porosity, pore fill; the vint-slow is sensitive to the minimum horizontal stress  the lower the vintslow, the less the minimum horizontal stress, which allows the fracture apertures to be more open    it is observed that the seismic anisotropy map for fractures showed a dominated direction (nne-ssw) that match with present day stress field  the azimuthal vint records current day stress field, not paleo-stress field  good correlation between well permeability multiplier and the fractures map, particularly at the two reference wells    following the analysis of the azimuthal seismic anisotropy maps such as azimuthal amplitude and interval velocity, a good correlation has been observed between the seismic anisotropy components and the production well test  the two seismic anisotropy components that showed a great deal of link with the computed well permeability multiplier are the computed slow interval velocity and the anisotropy azimuth deviation from the known present day stress    therefore, the following equation has been written to invert those azimuthal seismic components into permeability multiplier  the resulted map showed match at both input wells and one blind well |

173179-pa 	 gas flow tightly coupled to elastoplastic geomechanics for tight- and shale-gas reservoirs: material failure and enhanced permeability |summary   we investigate coupled flow and geomechanics in gas production from extremely low-permeability reservoirs such as tight- and shale-gas reservoirs, using dynamic porosity and permeability during numerical simulation  in particular, we take the intrinsic permeability as a step function of the status of material failure, and the permeability is updated every timestep  we consider gas reservoirs with the vertical and horizontal primary fractures, using the single- and dynamic double-porosity (dual-continuum) models  we modify the multiple-porosity constitutive relations for modeling the double porous continua for flow and geomechanics  the numerical results indicate that the production of gas causes redistribution of the effective-stress fields, increasing the effective shear stress and resulting in plasticity  shear failure occurs not only near the fracture tips but also away from the primary fractures, which indicates generation of secondary fractures  these secondary fractures increase the permeability significantly, and change the flow pattern, which, in turn, causes a change in the distribution of geomechanical variables  from various numerical tests, we find that shear failure is enhanced by a large pressure drop at the production well, a high biot's coefficient, and low frictional and dilation angles  smaller spacing between the horizontal wells also contributes to faster secondary fracturing  when the dynamic double-porosity model is used, we observe a faster evolution of the enhanced-permeability areas than that obtained from the single-porosity model, mainly because of a higher permeability of the fractures in the double-porosity model  these complicated physics for stress-sensitive reservoirs cannot properly be captured by the uncoupled or flow-only simulation, and, thus, tightly coupled flow and geomechanical models are highly recommended to describe accurately the reservoir behavior during gas production in tight- and shale-gas reservoirs and to design production scenarios smartly | 
17323-ms 	 reservoir fracture characterization and modeling in a shuaiba reservoir |abstract   massive mud losses, well logging, seismic data together with observed conformance issues and significant variation in well performance suggest a well developed fracture system in a regional shuaiba reservoir   proper characterization of such fractures plays a critical role in modeling reservoir fluid flow and production    fracture corridors are the dominant fluid flow paths in shuaiba reservoirs and are the focus of this study  their spatial distribution and conductivity are characterized by integrated analysis based on drilling, logging, core, seismic, and well performance  geological analysis, including tectonic/structure history, strain/stress variation, and rock mechanical stratigraphy are performed to better understand the fracture system    overall well performance is clearly related to fracture distribution throughout regional fields  during early stages of production, before water flooding, conductive fracture corridors connected the underlying aquifer to producers and occasionally resulted in premature water breakthrough in high strain areas  following the implementation of water injection, these fracture corridors also connect some injectors and producers  as a result, continued development requires recognizing and mapping these fracture corridors   this is done by acquiring saturation data in recent horizontal wells  together with borehole image data, the width and configuration of fracture corridors can be characterized    a practical approach is taken in 3d fracture modeling  fracture corridors are interpreted in 3d by integrating all static and dynamic data available  their conductivity is classified into high, mid and low using dynamic data and mud losses  fracture distribution and flow properties are related to or constrained by geologically more predictable attributes including reservoir curvature, current day stress field, structure pattern, and mechanical stratigraphy    using the approaches described above, an improved characterization of the fracture system was developed and exported to a geologic model for use in a dynamic simulation model to better predict waterflood performance    introduction   a producing oil field, located offshore qatar, was discovered and began producing oil in the early 1960s  shuaiba deposits consist mainly of microporous mudstones and wakestones with a small percentage of grain-dominated rocks localized in shoals along northwestern area of the field  current shuaiba oil recovery is relatively low due to low rock matrix permeability, which is complicated by a system of fracture corridors that led to early breakthrough and early well abandonment in some areas of the reservoir    conductive faults and fractures have long been known to be important factors to fluid flow in middle east shuaiba reservoirs  studies have documented the evidence for fluid flow in conductive faults based on the results of petrophysical logs and well production performance  of the 16 early shuaiba wells in the field, three wells produced the majority of the shuaiba oil  these three wells are located within or in close proximity to mapped fault zones | 
173463-stu 	 experimental study on stress sensitivity of naturally fractured reservoirs |abstract |stress sensitivity of a naturally fractured reservoir is regarded as pronounced where pressure decrease induced by production is believed to cause significant changes in fracture apertures  most laboratory investigations suggest that decrease in reservoir pressure would lead to great loss of fracture conductivity and rapid production decline  but till today, no such evidence from the production practices has been documented; on the contrary, there are some reported cases where depletion could potentially maintain even increase the extraction rate  |to solve the discrepancy, experiments were performed when permeability of fractured cores was measured in the process of increasing confining pressure with a constant pore pressure  in production, formation overburden pressure represented by laboratory confining pressure seldom alters and it is the pore pressure that virtually changes  to cope with that, effective stress was applied in the study, where biot’s coefficient for fracture effective stress was theoretically derived and found equal to fracture porosity  improved evaluation method was then given based on effective stress and stress-dependent permeability correlations  at last, a general evaluation criterion was established where stress sensitivity levels were classified based on stress-sensitivity index  |the evaluation of four cores reveals that, the stress-dependence of fracture permeability turns out to be weak if evaluated with a low value of biot’s coefficient directly resulting from small fracture porosity  the study also indicates that fracture is strongly sensitive to confining pressure change in laboratory, but only weakly sensitive to the reservoir pressure change in production, which might reconcile the discrepancy between laboratory study and production practice | 
173476-stu 	 permeability of organic-rich shale |abstract |measured permeability of an organic-rich shale sample vary significantly with applied laboratory conditions, such as the confining pressure, temperature and the measurement fluid type  this indicates that the measured quantity is influenced by several mechanisms that add complexity to the measurement  the complexity is mainly due to stress dependence of the matrix permeability  also, it is due to the fact that organic-rich shale holds significant volumes of fluids in sorbed (adsorbed, dissolved) states, sorption can also influence the permeability through its own storage and transport mechanisms  the stress-dependence and sorption effects on permeability could develop under the reservoir conditions and influence the production, although we currently do not have a predictive permeability model that considers their co-existence  |in this work this is accomplished by considering that the shale matrix consists of multiple continua with organic and inorganic pores  stress-dependency of the permeability comes along with slit-shape inorganic pores, whereas the sorption effects are associated with nano-scale organic capillaries  a simple conceptual flow model with an apparent shale permeability is developed that couples the molecular transport effects of the sorbed phase with the stress-dependence of the inorganic matrix  |sensitivity analysis on the new permeability model shows that the stress-dependence of the overall transport is significant at high pore pressure, when the effective stress is relatively low  diffusive molecular transport of the sorbed phase becomes important as the stress gets larger and, hence, the inorganic pores close  the constructed apparent permeability versus pore pressure curves show the dominance of the molecular transport as permeability improvement characterized by appearance of a minimum permeability value at the intermediate values of the pressure  the new permeability model can be used easily in history-matching a well performance and optimizing its production  |1  introduction |a shale well production profile is characterized by a large initial production rate followed by a sharp decline  the rate decline during the first year of production could be as large as 90 % of that recorded during the first days  because of this production behavior and due to economical considerations, the operators continuously drill and complete wells in the field  this way, an overall production is maintained in the field, which makes the field operations still profitable  as a consequence, an enormous amount of well data on drilling, well completion and production is coming from the field within a very short time span compared with the conventional reservoirs  commonly, the engineers do not have sufficient time to analyze the production from each well and relate the analyses to well-performance and near-well reservoir characteristics  consequently, the large production data set is more commonly used with the statistical indicators for the ongoing development of the whole field  understanding the physics underlying the production and using that knowledge in the decision-making process comes at lower priority for the development  however, when it reaches to a maturity and tested in the field, the knowledge could help decrease the uncertainties in production and lead to improved recoveries | 
173482-stu 	 completion design using sand management approach based on sanding prediction analysis for hpht gas wells |abstract |this paper outlines our selection of well completion design based on the results of sand production prediction for each of the development wells and the total sand production to be expected from the field  the methodology on the formation failure and modeling analysis for sand production and sand rate prediction is provided for the hpht gas and gas condensate field located offshore in the uk’s central north sea  sand production caused by the failure of reservoir formations through pressure depletion and drawdown pressure could lead to a significant loss in well production, well/facility damage or ultimately total well failure  the key objective of this evaluation and sand rate prediction analysis was to develop a well completion design that will deliver effective sand control throughout the producing life of the field  |over the field life it is both critical and prudent to predict the sanding potential of a given reservoir during continuous well production for any completion design under consideration  this paper illustrates our comprehensive geomechanics investigation for sanding potential and sand rate prediction analysis for all the planned wells to be drilled and completed in the very thick sandstone reservoirs  we’ll also show that if the reservoir rock strength and its variability along depth are properly measured for each well (through well core testing and log data analysis), the conditions that induce sand production issues for each specific interval could be predicted  in addition, the most important factors contributing to sanding problems have been identified to be the rock strength, flowing bottom-hole pressure, reservoir pressure, in-situ stresses, and flow rate  therefore if permeability distribution and oil/gas and water saturations were measured (for each well) in addition to the reservoir rock strength, the optimal completion method to reduce the likelihood of sand production problems without significantly impacting production could be found  a 3d non-linear elastic-plastic finite element model incorporated with a fluid-flow module (reservoir component) has been effectively used to conduct such analysis  the key findings from this investigation can be summarized as follows: |the sand production rates based on the planned reservoir depletion and production schedules are predicted for each of the eight wells as planned for the field development; |we can further update the original sand rate prediction model using the new rock strength and permeability/porosity test results obtained from the immediate testing of the new well cores as retrieved from one of the early development wells; |the predicted sand rates in both daily and total sand production are low enough to warrant our sand management (rather than sand exclusion) approach to this new field; and |the sand prediction results enable us to come up with optimal well platform/facility design to cope with the predicted sand rates to be produced throughout the reservoir life  the production engineers can also make sure that the overall safety of the facility is to be achieved by conducting regular and periodic inspections of any likely sand erosion for the surface chokes or pipes in the wells that especially have been forecast to produce more prolifically with relatively higher sand rates  
17357-ms 	 the applications of laser technology in downhole operations - a review |abstract   downhole operations in the petroleum industry include drilling and completing the well for production  experiments conducted on different types of lasers have shown the potential of the cutting - edge technology being applied in downhole operations  one of the tests was conducted on miracl (mid infrared advanced chemical laser) to determine its feasibility for drilling and perforating petroleum wells and another was on coil (chemical oxygen-iodine laser) to determine the least specific energy (se) needed to destroy varying rock types  this paper presents the applications of laser technology in downhole operations such as drilling, perforation, stimulation, vaporizing stuck pipes, tracer detection, treatment of asphaltene deposition and cutting of subsurface equipment such as casings, tubing strings etc  its benefits are presented in terms of effects on rate of penetration (rop), operational downtime, formation damage, clay treatments, flow enhancement and overall well deliverability  laser technology has been utilized successfully in the medical industry, manufacturing industry, nuclear industry etc  therefore, its applications in downhole operations are major strides in the petroleum industry and a means of optimizing downhole operational practices  it has been reported that integrating laser technology with conventional drilling technology will immensely improve drilling efficiency but this has not been so far applied in the field  conclusions derived from a two year project funded by the gas research institute (now gas technology institute) in 1997 on "adapting star wars high-powered lasers to drilling natural gas wells," are that lasers can cut rock of all lithologies; shear power shares importance in cutting rock with such parameters as wavelength, purge gas pressure and hole size; and historical and widely accepted theoretical calculations of the laser power needed to spall (break), melt and vaporize rock are significantly higher than experimental values  just like any new technology, laser technology has its challenges and they are highlighted accordingly    introduction   the most reliable way to detect oil and gas is by drilling an oil well  from the onset, oil wells have been drilled using cable tool (percussive) drilling method  this method of drilling was gradually replaced by rotary drilling in the twentieth century  as research and development progresses, laser drilling was developed in the 90&apos;s  an oil well needs to be completed to flow the well  well completion includes casing, cementing, perforation, stimulation etc  various studies have been conducted to evaluate the suitability of this breakthrough technology in downhole operations and they have all yielded positive results | 
17364-ms 	 new methods for quantitative reservoir quality prediction in sandstones |abstract   the efficiency of a sandstone reservoir is a function of the initial depositional parameters (grain-size, sorting and composition) and of the post-depositional evolution during burial  the depositional parameters are closely linked to the sedimentary environment and the post-depositional evolution depends on the paleo-dynamic geological setting that conditions both the burial rates and the temperature history    the reservoir quality of sandstone was appraised in the past mostly in a qualitative way either by using close-by cored wells information or by taking into account the log porosity from adjacent wells  in the recent years more quantitative approaches to predictions were developed  the reservoir quality is currently appraised in eni e&p with two methodologies  the first is proprietary and is based on the reservoir efficiency index© (e-rei), a quantitative indicator of the quality of a clastic reservoir calculated from thin sections on the base of the quantitative petrographic data  a dedicated geostatistical tool (softkrig) was developed in order to map the e-e-rei values on the base of twt, depth or temperature driver maps   the second methodology is based on the use of a reservoir quality modelling software (touchstone™), developed in the frame of an industrial consortium and able to predict the mechanical compaction, the quartz cement precipitation and the illite formation and thus to model porosity and permeability    the methodologies are complementary and have been applied on paleozoic african reservoirs  the main factor, reducing reservoir quality, was identified in the cementation by quartz, while the preserving mechanism, increasing reservoir quality, was recognized in the presence of early diagenetic clay coatings    the case-study shows the pros and cons of applying the two methodologies  in particular the e-e-rei mapping is recommended for the play fairway analysis of reservoir quality, while touchstone is more suitable for the sensitivity analysis and for the determination of the porosity/permeability values on a given prospect    the two methodologies are limited one by the fact that is deterministic, the other by its ability to model only some of the diagenetic events that take place during burial  in order to overcome these problems, transport-reaction models may be used  a first attempt to apply these models, already used in carbonate diagenesis and reservoir quality prediction, to sandstones showed that there are way forward in applying this methodology    introduction   the reservoir quality quantitative prediction (rqqp) of a sandstone reservoir is a fundamental activity aimed at the delivery of maps that may be used for the evaluation at level of play/leads/prospects and, more in general, for the ranking of the different zones of an explorative area/concession  this provides a significant contribution to the explorative activity from basin to prospect scale    the reservoir quality of siliciclastic sediment, that will become sandstone, is basically determined by:   the vertical (thickness) and horizontal (areal) dimension of the sand body; this is directly linked to the energy of the environment of deposition and influences the presence and amount of sand deposited in each point of the basin; |the depositional initial petrographic characteristics (such as grain-size, sorting and the presence of detrital clays in the pore space) and the original composition of the sediment in terms of type of grains (quartz, feldspars, lithic grains…); both features are determined by the energy of deposition and, for composition, by the source-area of the sediments; 
17372-ms 	 new erosion resistance pdc bit coating eliminates balling in water-based drilling fluids, saudi arabia |abstract   the tendency of pdc (polycrystalline diamond compact) bits to ball in soft shale formations when drilling with wbm is well documented, especially in deep/high-pressure applications  the capacity of shale to absorb water causes the formation to stick to the bit body and cutting structure compromising drilling efficiency  balling also clogs the nozzles and junk slots reducing hydraulic effectiveness/cooling leading to accelerated cutter wear and premature bit failure    in saudi arabia's fields, a typical well requires approximately 1,600-2,200 ft of a 12-in  vertical borehole or 3,000 ft of a 12-in  directional borehole to be drilled through carbonates, shale and claystone lithologies  the middle part of the section is composed of mainly claystone, which is the most problematic zone  in recent wells, bit balling incidents through the claystone interval was reducing average rate of penetration (rop) to less than 10 ft/hr, and in certain cases forced to pull out of hole (pooh)  pdc bits with various hydraulics configurations and non-stick coatings were tested in an attempt to alleviate balling issues  the thin layer eroded before the bit entered the problematic zone, exposing the rough bit body    an r&d initiative determined mechanical and electrochemical sticking contributes to bit balling  the investigation revealed a coarse bit body increases surface area and adhesive force  when mud flow stops an electrostatic force can cause clay to stick to the bit surface  based on these findings a new type nickel-phosphorus electroplating process was implemented that creates a thick/durable coating with an extremely strong chemical bond    this paper reviews the investigation process and findings of three case studies in the saudi arabian fields  the new anti balling coating was applied to a seven bladed pdc design and run on a powered point-the-bit rotary steerable system  the bottom-hole assembly (bha) drilled the entire section achieving a field rop record  drill bits with the new anti-balling coating were also tested in vertical wells in different gas fields setting new bit performance benchmarks    application review   in a large gas field in saudi arabia, containing several distinctive sub-fields, a 12 in  hole size section needs to be drilled through a mixed sequence of rocks that are comprised of limestones, dolomites, anhydrites, siltstones and shales  a particularly problematic section of the well occurs through a shale formation that is reactive to hydration  in this section, bit balling, as well as stabilizer balling, is a known occurrence with the water-based mud that is utilized  this causes a drastic reduction in rop and sometimes bits are pulled prematurely but they are typically in good condition once seen at surface (fig  1)  field experience has shown that the cutting structure is partially balled up while drilling, causing the low rates of penetration    use of drilling fluid additives to help reduce the potential risks of bit balling has been investigated and introduced into the application, showing some improvements  the overall drilling performance through this interval, especially the low rop, is still a major concern for the operator in these wells |

17439-ms 	 emerging technologies and the future of hydraulic fracturing design in unconventional gas and tight oil |abstract   as industry leaders seek solutions to the myriad of challenges facing unconventional projects, research and development efforts continue in the area of multistage fracturing design   these research activities are focused on the identification of novel approaches to hydraulic fracturing (hf) design that can lead to more effective design practices in the future     this paper describes emerging technologies within the building blocks of hf design for multi-stage horizontal wells, and proposes how application of these technologies can lay a foundation for the development and evolution of future industry practices  the industry debate on hf design commonly revolves around a perceived need for more powerful software tools that can capture complex fracture geometries  this perspective or position within the broader industry is due in large part to the cloud of microseismic induced events that is oftentimes observed to envelop a treatment area   some interpret that these events arise from very complex fracture geometry, and therefore modeling tools with increased specialization are needed        rather than focusing only on the ability of the software to replicate complex fracture geometries, a higher-level and integrated view of hf design is recommended  as shown in fig  1, this integrated approach considers the progressive analysis and application of subsurface diagnostics and modeling capabilities, and how they can influence meaningful decisions in the area of hf design  in reality, the capability for hf design is as strong as the weakest of these three components and need not rely solely on modeling capability | 
17447-ms 	 estimation of rock compressive strength using downhole weight-on-bit and drilling models |abstract   in unconventional gas and tight oil plays, knowledge of the in situ rock mechanical profiles of the reservoir interval is critical in planning horizontal well trajectories and landing zones, placement of perforation clusters along the lateral, and optimal hydraulic fracture stimulation design   in current practice, vertical pilot holes and/or the laterals are logged after drilling, and the sonic and neutron log results are interpreted along with mechanical rock properties measured in the laboratory on core material   however, coring, logging, and core analyses are expensive and time consuming   in addition, as they are typically only performed in a few wells that are assumed to be representative, there is considerable uncertainty in extrapolating results across wide areas with known variability in stratigraphy, faults, thicknesses, hydrocarbon saturations, etc    this paper reports a method for estimating mechanical rock properties and in situ rock mechanical profiles in every well in a development, based on calibration from initial rock core analyses plus drilling data that is routinely acquired  wellbore friction analysis was coupled with a torque and drag model to estimate in situ unconfined compressive strength (ucs) and young's modulus (ym) profiles  the key process steps include:  a) calculate the weight and wellbore friction force of each element of the drill string from bottom to the surface; b) adjust the hook load (hl) by subtracting the weight of the hook and entire drill string; c) iteratively compute the friction coefficient to match calculated and observed hl; d) estimate downhole weight-on-bit (dwob) by applying a stand pipe pressure correction to the calculated hl and considering potential sliding and abrasiveness; e) use a rate of penetration (rop) model developed for polycrystalline diamond compact (pdc) drill bits considering a force balance between a drill bit geometry and formation and a wear function depending upon the formation abrasiveness and bit hydraulics to compute confined compressive strength (ccs)  the resulting ccs was correlated to ucs and ym using regression constants obtained from laboratory triaxial test data on whole core  using examples from horizontal wells in a siltstone play in alberta, canada, this manuscript demonstrates a workflow to estimate rock strength from drilling data  the predicted ucs and ym values were compared with log data and potential uncertainties arising out of drilling data are discussed    introduction   in conventional and unconventional plays alike, a typical way to characterize the subsurface is to make measurements of the formation penetrated by the wellbore with logging tools that are either carried behind the drill bit (logging while drilling) or else run in the well after the drill string is removed (wireline or drill pipe-conveyed logging)  because this adds cost and risk, for unconventional gas or tight oil (ugto) projects that may have hundreds to even thousands of producers, typically only early appraisal wells plus later, areally scattered wells are designed with extensive logging and laboratory core characterization programs   the assumption is that lateral variability and local heterogeneties are not great and that these data-rich penetrations sufficiently constrain the reservoir properties in the areas between them   in ugto projects, good representations of the in situ stress profile and geomechanical rock properties are required to optimize the well trajectories and landing zones, placement of perforation clusters along the lateral, and hydraulic fracture stimulation design | 
17453-ms 	 reservoir rock typing of upper shu |abstract   core samples from 10 wells in lower cretaceous limestones of the upper shu'aiba formation were characterized by conventional core analyses, petrography, bulk chemical analyses, and mercury injection capillary pressure data to define reservoir rock types (rrt) for input to reservoir modeling  initial grouping by lithofacies allows linkage of rock types to a 3d geological model, but results in rrt with high degrees of overlap in petrophysical properties  when diagenesis is included, however, in the form of porosity cut-offs added to the lithofacies criteria, rrt can be defined having both 3d geological significance and distinct ranges of pore-throat size distribution    the use of total porosity as a rock typing criterion is based on the interpretation that porosity is controlled on reservoir scale by depositional clay content of the local stratigraphic environment  the seaward and uppermost parts of the clinoforms have low clay and thus highest porosity  although most of the pore space is microporosity, higher total porosity corresponds with higher proportions of macropores and probably also with greater frequency of open fractures, resulting in better permeability  high-porosity samples also have several systematic positive differences in micp characteristics from lower-porosity samples of the same lithofacies    because both lithofacies and porosity are related to the sedimentological and stratigraphic organization of the upper shu'aiba clinoforms, the rrt defined by these criteria can potentially be implemented in a reservoir model for assigning particular ranges of petrophysical properties to distinct portions of each clinoform  by this procedure, seven rrt have been defined in the present selection of samples |

17526-ms 	 coupled static and dynamic modeling of a jurassic arab formation reservoir: parameter sensitivities and impact on the quality of history-matched simulation outputs, dukhan field, state of qatar |abstract   a close coupling of geoscience and engineering disciplines has generated a history-matched model for the dukhan arab c reservoir serving as a platform for testing of forward development strategies   the arab c reservoir is a heterogeneous organization of limestone and dolomite lithologies deposited on a shallow water jurassic ramp system   hydraulically, the 80 ft thick interval represents a network of grainstone conductors compartmentalized by muddy carbonate baffles resulting in layer-constrained dynamic behavior   the reservoir has been under development for over sixty years, with an early period of natural depletion followed by peripheral water injection utilizing hundreds of vertical and horizontal producers and injectors    as part of an effort to update the field development plan, a new geologic model was developed that formed the basis for reservoir simulation studies and depletion planning   initially, a series of tests were conducted to determine the sensitivity of model responses to input variables, and these tests helped to guide subsequent static model adjustments   horizontal permeability defines aquifer response, waterflood front advance and early pressure trend, while vertical permeability significantly controls subsequent dynamic behavior   thin mudstone baffles are common at parasequence boundaries and their continuity and association with stylolites determines inter-zonal vertical communication   variable salinity of injected water was shown to have a large impact on water encroachment patterns and derivation of appropriate relative permeability functions improved the calibration of the full-field dynamic reservoir simulation model   knowledge of the controlling parameters ranked according to dynamic sensitivity facilitated an emphasis on regional variations constrained by geological trends and helped to minimize the requirement for localized adjustments     lessons learned as a result of this geoscience-engineering feedback can expedite future model building by focusing technical expertise on the most critical parameters controlling fluid flow    introduction   the qatar petroleum-operated dukhan field is located onshore qatar, approximately 80 km west of doha (figure 1)   the arab c reservoir interval is a carbonate anticlinal structure lying 5500-7000 ft below the surface and is approximately 70 km long by 8 km wide   the arab c interval is about 80 ft thick with moderate to high reservoir quality (typically 18 % porosity, 100 md permeability)   a high degree of vertical heterogeneity relates to a sedimentary origin in a near-shore shallow ramp environment featuring high-order depositional cyclicity   lateral ranges of 1-4 km for baffling thin-beds supports a localized layer-constrained dynamic behavior, though communication pathways are impacted by sporadic occurrences of cross-cutting conductive and resistive faults   arab c production development began in 1949 with a period of natural depletion followed by conversion to water drive in the 1960s via peripheral water injection utilizing hundreds of vertical and horizontal producers and injectors | 
17547-ms 	 using stochastic seismic inversion as input for 3d geomechanical models |abstract   the dual issues of band-limited vertical resolution and nonuniqueness of deterministic inversion results has led to the development of methodologies known as geostatistical, or stochastic, inversion  in these approaches, seismic data are typically inverted directly into a high-resolution geological model  compared to deterministic inversion, stochastic methods deliver multiple realizations that are consistent with the available well and seismic data    the seismic inversion process is inherently nonunique, meaning that there is an unbounded number of elastic property models that fit the seismic data equally well above some threshold misfit  we explore the notion of the equally large number of possible stress states that could be interpreted from same seismic observations    we make use of stochastic inversion results to incorporate the impact of subseismic uncertainty in seismic-driven geomechanical models  by taking ultiple realizations from a prestack stochastic inversion--acoustic impedance, vp/vs, and density--we generate and feed a series of distributions of elastic constants into a finite element stress simulator  the multiple stress solutions allow us to account for uncertainties in the inversion results that can be ultimately captured in a suite of numerical models to predict a set of possible geomechanical states of a field  therefore, beyond a unique geomechanical forecast for a field, we can now solve for the range of variability in geomechanically safe operational parameters within the field's development plan    introduction   determinisic seismic inversion has become a standard practice in the industry  conventional deterministic seismic inversion results provide important information about the spatial distribution of reservoir properties between wells (see bosch et al  2010; bailey et al  2010)  together with well data, deterministic seismic inversion can be used to construct 3d geomechanical models (see herwanger and koutabeloulis, 2011; rodriguez-herrera et al  2013; adachi et al  2012; sengupta et al  2011)  for instance, it provides a means to populate the geomechanical models with mechnical properties, which ultimately affects the response of the subsurface to the presence of loading/unloading mechanisms and guides the distribution of stress in the  model    typically, however, deterministic seismic inversion results have limited vertical resolution compared to the scale of the well logs  in addition, the seismic inversion process is inherently nonunique, meaning that there are an infinite number of elastic property models that fit the seismic data  the output of a deterministic inversion is limited to to the input seismic resolution, capturing only a bulk elastic response and with all layering details smeared over the seismic wavelength  at such a level of detail, there can be multiple combinations of layer stacks that generate the same seismic response above some threshold misfit    as an alternative, stochastic seismic inversion generates a set of realizations that agree with the bulk seismic response and well data and that can account for uncertainties or non-uniqueness associated with the seismic inversion process  the multiple realizations can be ultimately captured in a suite of geomechanical models fed by the avo inversion outputs, which in turn can provide insight to the range of possible responses of the reservoir under the prescribed geological conditions  the following sections will explore this idea | 
17565-ms 	 subsurface cuttings injection: technical challenges and opportunities |abstract   the progression of new and remote field development, including arctic and deepwater, inherently increases the volume of cuttings and waste generated from drilling, completion and production operations  the economic and environmental impact of this waste management including transportation, treatment and final disposal is considerable and can be drastically decreased through subsurface cuttings and waste injection  this environmentally friendly disposal solution provides an effective and practical way to minimize associated health, safety and environmental risks by eliminating transportation needs and potential accidents, and therefore reducing the long-term project environmental footprint    nowadays, cuttings injection is considered a proven technology for the final disposal of drilling waste through subsurface injection into an engineered subsurface strata or formation where the injected waste is safely contained for permanent storage  the logistical constrains of transporting large volumes of produced waste to the final disposal site poses many challenges in large-scale field development, where the most cost-effective solution is often to drill a dedicated injector well, process and inject all the produced waste at the single cuttings injection site    an application of comprehensive fracture-mapping techniques is a major step in ensuring that the target formation will be suitable to accommodate all waste volume injected  fracture mapping the waste domain complexities represents valuable information, not only in the overall planning of drilling operations, but in the fundamental and invaluable need to provide sound engineering and assurance for the waste subsurface containment    this papers describe the driving factors and opportunities for implementing cuttings injection in one of the largest and complex development projects in the northern part of caspian sea where ecologically sound drilling, stringent environmental regulations and  "zero discharge?? policy commitment are critical for the success of the drilling operations and overall field development    introduction   the exploration and production (e&p) industry has become more ambitious in searching out new frontiers, with notable successes over the past decade, particularly in offshore and arctic  more than half of all oil and gas reservoirs discovered and major development projects worldwide over past 10 years have been in remote and challenging operating environments, and in many instances, with limited support infrastructure and extraordinary environmental protection commitment in the highly sensitive areas  in fact 20 years ago a significant amount of these reservoirs, particularly deepwater and arctic, were still not proven and, in most cases, were not even on our industry's radar screens    it is now estimated that more than 200 new remote offshore and arctic fields will enter production over the next four years in response to the criticality of meeting global energy demands over the next decade  field development capital expenditures are expected to triple by 2020 with majority of this growth taking place in the atlantic and arctic basins - particularly in angola, brazil, russia, norway, canada and the us  other countries with complex but solid activity include australia, azerbaijan, egypt, kazakhstan and uae | 
17568-ms 	 on the impact of depletion on reservoir seal integrity: geomechanical model application |abstract   for a safe and efficient reservoir development, it is important to understand if, how, when and where faulting and fracturing will occur as a function of reservoir production or stimulation operations, or in case of a dumpflood or an internal blow-out situation  this paper describes 1) the making of a numerical geomechanical model to achieve this understanding, 2) the uncertainty in geomechanical model results, and 3) how the model results were applied in operational decisions for production and on reservoir fluid containment  the case study presented here is one of deep-gas production from stacked thin (few meters) sandstone reservoirs vertically separated by shale layers and laterally cut by steeply-dipping sealing normal faults, with pore pressure differences of several mpa across the faults in many sand-shale and sand-sand juxtapositions  we calculated the effective normal stress (sn) and maximum shear stress (tmax) along the faults and in the country rock as a function of pore  pressure changes documented in the field development plan  the sn - tmax data were compared with fault slip and fracture-opening criteria based on mohr-coulomb frictional slip and tensile fracturing laws using fault cohesion, fault-friction-angle, and tensile strength as input  the geomechanical model results indicate that the current operational criterion of a maximum pore pressure difference of 7 mpa across the faults can be increased to 10 mpa without creating shear failure or tensile fracturing  this would lead to greater operational flexibility, cost reduction (less wells), and accelerated yet safe production     introduction   reservoir rocks deform when their pore pressure is changed due to hydrocarbon production or because of fluid injection  a pore pressure reduction (depletion) increases the average effective stress on the rock, and leads to compaction (densification) and porosity reduction  a pore pressure increase, on the other hand, decreases the average effective stress on the rock, and leads to a bulk-volume increase (dilation) and to a porosity increase  because the compacting or dilating reservoir remains connected to the rock around it, there will be deformation, displacements and total stress changes in these rocks too (teufel et al  1991, zoback 2007)  these total stress changes in the non-reservoir rock do not "stop?? at the boundary of the reservoir, but are transmitted to the reservoir as well, interacting with the total stress changes within the reservoir proper  therefore, pore pressure changes in the reservoir are typically accompanied by changes in the total stress in and around the reservoir  together, they make up the operation-induced change in effective stress in and around the reservoir, also known as the stress path (addis et al  1996, hettema et al  2000, nelson et al  2006, sayers and schutjens 2007, davison et al  2013)  particularly strong total stress changes (due to depletion or injection) are expected in fault-bounded reservoir compartments, because of the (often) strong fault-position-controlled lateral variation in operation-induced pore pressure change  hence, rather than the common "pancake??-model where the overburden acts like a dead weight (see figure 1a), in pore pressure compartments | 
17572-ms 	 integration of petrophysical scal measurements for better understanding heterogeneity effects in carbonates: case study using samples from a super giant field in abu dhabi |abstract   characterization of carbonate reservoirs is challenging as well as daunting due to the inherent heterogeneities that occur at all scales of observation and measurement  heterogeneity in carbonates can be attributed to variable lithology, chemistry/mineralogy, pore types, pore connectivity, and sedimentary facies  these complexities can be related to processes controlling original deposition and their subsequent diagenesis    reservoir cores from super giant producing carbonate field in abu dhabi have been used in this study  x-ray ct scanning, thin sections, porosity, permeability, mercury-derived drainage capillary pressure (pc) and pore throat size distribution (ptsd) have been used to define the petrophysical groups and different sedimentary facies  the effects of carbonate heterogeneity on reservoir behavior have been studied by correlating rock structure/texture and pore-throat size distribution to formation resistivity factor, cementation exponent (m), and to relative permeability  the effects of wettability and rock nature have been discussed based on the relative permeability trends observed on the main rock types covered in the field    less heterogeneous reservoir rocks with muddy structure and uniform pore throat size distribution (ptsd) have moderate poroperm characteristics and tend to be less tortuous with average cementation exponent m at 1 85  more heterogeneous rocks with grainy/muddy or grainy structures and bimodal/heterogeneous ptsd have very good poroperm characteristics and tend to be more tortuous with range of cementation exponent m values from 2 20 to 2 50  large variations have been obtained in imbibition relative permeability curves among the different rock types, which were explained on the basis of rock structure, ptsd curves and poroperm characteristics  the more heterogeneous rock types present more oil-wet behavior than the less heterogeneous rock types    the full integration of resistivity and phase flow laboratory results with geological heterogeneities showed consistent trends in reservoir characteristics, and offered in-depth understanding of the reservoir rock properties for potential investigations in further field development using ior/eor techniques    introduction   accurate knowledge of petrophysical properties is required for efficient management and prediction of future performance of oil and gas reservoirs  this knowledge necessitates the understanding of physical properties of the reservoir rocks and the interactions of various fluids with interstitial surfaces, and the distribution of pores and minerals within the porous medium  the quantification of the effect of heterogeneity on electrical petrophysical properties helps reduce uncertainty in the estimations of water saturation from resistivity logs  furthermore, the evaluation of the effect of heterogeneity on relative permeability helps in the understanding of the reservoir dynamic behavior and fluid distribution in addition to wettability and residual oil saturation after water and/or gas injection    core laboratory data can help establish a sound basis for reservoir modeling and develop effective strategies for reservoir exploitation (secondary and eor) schemes (masalmeh and jing, 2008)  however, the full characterization and rock typing of core samples are often overlooked in special core analysis (scal) programs  this would lead to unrepresentative selection of the core samples and would raise questions about the effectiveness of the core data in the reservoir model and its calibration |

17594-ms 	 new insights into hydraulic fracturing of shale formations |abstract   shale has certain characteristic features that make it difficult to evaluate in a traditional laboratory setting  the unique characteristics of shale formations include very low permeability, the existence of microfractures, and sensitivity to contacting fluids  advances in the testing of shale have remained relatively stagnant   as a result, current shale fracturing practices and technologies are mainly based on simulation models, and experience from conventional formations  therefore, the objective of this study is to develop an experimental setup to measure the hydraulic breakdown pressure for fractures in shale cores , and to use the setup to study the effects of different parameters such as fluid types and characteristics, injection rate, shale bedding, acid injection, and different additives and systems on the breakdown pressure, fracture shape, and fracture direction    cores  from a mancos shale outcrop were evaluated in this study  based on experimental results, breakdown pressures in shale formations have a strong exponential relationship with the fluid viscosity, where increasing fluid viscosity increased the breakdown pressure  in addition, linear relationship was observed between the injection rate of fracture fluids and the breakdown pressure  even for shale with low hcl solubility (less than 2 wt%), the breakdown pressure of the shale formation was reduced by injection of hcl acid, and a  further increase in  the  acid contact time will reduce the breakdown pressure further  also, additives designed to improve the flow of fracturing fluid in microfractures tend to reduce the breakdown pressure and enhance fracture complexity  finally, fracture complexity increases with reduced viscosity and/or increased acidity of the fluid  nitrogen gases will maximize the fracture complexity    introduction   shales are fine-grained sedimentary rocks that can be rich sources of petroleum and natural gas  over the past decade, the combination of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing has allowed access to large volumes of shale gas/oil that were previously uneconomical to produce, seale (2007)  in north america, shale reservoirs such as the bakken, barnett, montney, haynesville, marcellus, and most recently the eagle ford, niobrara and utica shales are drilled horizontally and then completed with multistage fracture stimulation (eerc 2013)  these completion techniques may allow more than 30 stages to be pumped into the horizontal section of a single well, mooney (2011)  the production of oil and natural gas from shale formations has rejuvenated the natural gas industry and reversed the oil production decline in the united states  of the natural gas consumed in the united states in 2009, 87% was produced domestically  shale gas resource and production estimates increased significantly between the 2010 and 2011 and are likely to increase further in the future, international energy outlook (2013)  the natural gas resources for gas shale in the usa are estimated to be around 500-1,000 tcf and oil around 25 billion barrels, eia (2011)    shales have certain characteristic features that make them difficult to evaluate in a traditional laboratory setting  the most important characteristics are low permeability, the existence of microfractures, and sensitivity to contacting fluids  shales consist of minerals of variable composition mixed with organic matter commonly occurring finely dispersed in the matrix, or in thin laminae  mechanical properties strongly depend on the volume fractions of minerals, kerogen and pore fill  attempts have been made to relate acoustic velocity, and velocity anisotropy to the degree of kerogen maturity of the shales (vernik and nur, 1994; vernik and liu, 1997; and prasad and mukerji 2003)  prasad et al  (2009) showed that in low-porosity shales, velocity was directly correlated to kerogen content and textural heterogeneity; elastic impedance, velocity, and density increase with increasing shale maturity  most studies on mechanical properties of shales were achieved using compressional or tensile loads (jizba, 1991; brown et al , 2002; gurevich, 2002; pham et al  2005; tran, 2009; saenger and steeb, 2011; and lin and lai 2013)  few studies using hydraulic fracturing fluids to break the shale cores have been reported |

17600-ms 	 ordovician source rocks and devonian oil expulsion on bolide impact at siljan, sweden - the re-os story |abstract   to test the effectiveness of the re-os system for tracing source rocks and marking the time of maturation and expulsion, we examined a natural system in which key variables are controlled   hydrocarbon source rocks (late ordovician fjacka shale) and adjacent, partly contemporaneous reservoir rocks (carbonate mounds) are exceptionally well exposed in quarries, drill core and outcrop in the siljan area of central sweden   at 377 ma, a giant meteorite impacted the region heating early paleozoic sections, including immature ordovician-silurian hydrocarbon source rocks   oil seeps and asphaltene coatings in carbonates just outside the siljan impact crater attest to hydrocarbon maturation associated with the impact   the size of the impact supports elevated temperatures over a maturation-migration period of 10 to 1000 ka, not unlike that for some sedimentary basins   the siljan "field laboratory?? permits sampling of source rock and migrated oils in immediately adjacent units - uniquely, with the time of maturation temporally pinned by the bolide impact   through re-os analyses of the source rock and analyses of the oil it generated, we found the re-os isotopic system to be intact at two of three shale localities, obtaining the expected late ordovician and early silurian depositional ages   in contrast, the re-os isotopic compositions and erratically varying os concentrations derived from the oil seeps suggest infusion of shale-derived oil with os derived from the bolide   thus, we show that shales generally retain their os isotopic systematics, even under extraordinary circumstances, whereas small quantities of migrating oil at siljan were easily overwhelmed by the strong os isotopic signature carried by the bolide     a unique opportunity at the siljan impact site   seventy percent of meteorites leave their mark in the sedimentary record[1], yet little is known about the response of sedimentary targets on impact   the consequences of meteorite impacts for the continental and oceanic sedimentary record inform questions of climate change and mass extinction, both critical concepts to understanding deposition of source rocks   for two reasons, application of the re-os isotopic system to impacted black shales provides a unique opportunity to examine hydrocarbon maturation and migration   first, the extreme contrast between re-os concentrations and os isotope compositions in sedimentary versus extraterrestrial reservoirs readily permits detection of both end members   second, maturation and migration are nearly coincident and reduced to a geologic instant at the moment of impact   that moment is a well-dated heating event at 377 ma - the impact age of the giant siljan bolide smashing into the late devonian (frasnian) seabed     re-os and hydrocarbons   key inputs for modeling hydrocarbon systems are identity of source rock(s) and the maturation and migration time(s)   typically, biomarkers are used to link migrated hydrocarbons to specific source rocks   this tool may be compromised by biodegradation of the oils, however   time of maturation is generally estimated from models of burial history and is therefore dependent on estimates of biostratigraphic ages, sediment thickness and compaction history, and subsidence rates   re-os geochemistry overcomes some of these limitations and assumptions, serving as an intact tracer with a clear time component; biodegradation does not appear to compromise re-os systematics | 
17632-ms 	 regional in-situ stress mapping: an initiative for exploration & development of deep gas reservoirs in kuwait  |abstract   koc has undertaken an initiative to generate a regional in situ stress map for 23 kuwait oil and gas fields using the data from more than 400 wells  key objectives of this project are to integrate all available well data sources from these fields to derive the in situ stress orientation and also to create an interactive digital stress map supported by sub-surface structural geological data including formation seismic horizons, faults and well markers with the help of visualization software  in this way, the outcome of this project is available as an interactive geomechanical knowledge base which can be viewed at regional scale    the results of this project indicate that the maximum principal stress azimuth in cretaceous formations is consistent with the regional zagros tectonics and it is more or less uniform n45° (±10°) e direction even across major fault systems  however the sub-salt jurassic formations exhibit high variability in stress orientation across faults as well as in the vicinity of fracture corridors  in addition to the patterns seen in stress orientation, the geomechanical models from each field exhibited that the gotnia salt is mechanically decoupling the highly stressed, strong, jurassic formations from shallower, relatively lower stressed and weaker cretaceous formations  it was also found that these stress anomalies in jurassic formations coincide with associated fault and fracture corridors which appear to be critically stressed  characterizing critically stressed fractures at the wellbore scale provided an understanding of possible permeable fracture sets that could contribute to gas flow    this paper discusses detailed results of the regional stress distribution patterns including innovative criteria developed to manage quality control of stress orientation data, correlation between stress anomalies and structural geological elements in kuwait and also covers insights developed for exploration and development strategies of deep gas reservoirs in kuwait    introduction and objectives   mapping of sub-surface structures and in situ reservoir properties have been in practice by explorationists for more than a century  the structural maps and profiles provide understanding of geological history and conditions that are essential for play evaluation  many conventional oil & gas fields in the world have been explored and developed and many are at a mature state  however, limited data are available to map the present day in situ stresses in these fields, as typical conventional exploration techniques assume theoretical stress estimations based on a regional understanding of tectonic history related to the evolution of a particular field structure  occasionally, seismic attributes have been used to complement these geological estimates  consequently, there has been little appreciation of the influence of in situ stresses on exploration and development strategies  more recently, it has been realized that geomechanics plays a key role in various ways from exploration through field development including wellbore stability analysis (for improved drilling experience) to reservoir geomechanical analysis (for optimization of production) | 
17643-ms 	 recent advancements in vessel desanding technology |abstract   production of formation sand and other solids with wellstreams has been a big challenge in the petroleum industry  presence of sand in the production stream can cause erosion of upstream facilities and - even more commonly - clogging of flowlines and accumulation in production vessels; reducing residence time and performance of separator internals    several methods have been applied in the petroleum industry to remove deposited sand from production vessels  some of the drawbacks with these technologies are: localized sand removal, excessive use of water, interference on vessel liquid levels, compromise of water and oil quality, risks of clogging, huge sand system infrastructural size etc  direct consequence of these situations would be unmanageable disturbances on production operations, and eventually leading to unplanned shutdown, and production loss    recent innovations on design of vessel desanding internals at fmc technologies are the dual and single vessel desanding systems  while the dual desanding system integrates a set of systematically arranged jet nozzles and a novel hydrodynamically designed suction system, the single desanding system is a unique combination of a smart elliptical fluidization technique and suction in a single compact design  this paper presents both technologies, with special focus on their developments and qualifications  case studies are presented; highlighting the benefits of the new technologies, as well as their application possibilities    keywords: sand production, vessel desanding technology, fmc technologies    introduction   sand and other solid particles are usually produced with oil, gas and water from most reservoirs in the world   in the united states, reservoirs in the gulf of mexico, california and texas tend to produce more sand  around the world, sand production is common in west africa, canada, china, venezuela trinidad, cameroon, middle east, indonesia and parts of the north sea1  the phenomenon of sand production is directly related to any/combination of the following: unconsolidated nature of some reservoirs, high drag forces created by increased produced fluid and accelerated water influx    as explained by the illustrative schematics in figure 1, disintegrated sand particles from the formation rock matrix are transported up the wellbore, through the production system  thus unconsolidated sandstone reservoirs would tend to produce more sand particles, especially when the wells are becoming mature, with lots more water influxing  proppant solids are also produced from wells following fracturing treatment programs    although downhole sand control mechanisms are usually in place in most wells, certain cut-size of sand particles would eventually get produced to the surface because wide particle size distributions always exist in the reservoir  this ranges from 1micron to over 10,000 micron  sand particles produced to the surface leads to a wide range of operational challenges |

17964-ms 	 3d numerical dynamic geomechanical analyses of compaction, subsidence and fault reactivation throughout multiple producing and injecting reservoirs of a sarawak offshore oil and gas field, malaysia |abstract   a thorough 3d finite-element (fe) geomechanical study was over undertaken for an oil and gas field offshore sarawak, malaysia, to assist the development management  the field comprises eight major reservoirs with three of them planned for water injection to improve recovery  the historical well drilling data, wireline logs, production data, field tests and newly obtained laboratory test data provided inputs for deriving a wellbore-based 1d geomechanical model for the field  the 1d model was calibrated to well drilling observations before being up-scaled and populated in a 3d geomechanical model for the entire field  the model was implemented in an fe simulator to dynamically analyze reservoir compactions, platform site subsidence, fault reactivation potential and cap rock breaches that might be induced by reservoir depletion and injection in the full life cycle planning of the field management    the results showed a maximum subsidence of 0 72 m above the shallowest depleting reservoir and a subsidence of approximately 0 62 m at the seabed in year 2032  injection slightly reverses the subsidence induced by depletion and the subsidence at the centre of the seabed is approximately 0 58 m in year 2050  the corresponding subsidence at the platform sites reaches 0 58 m in year 2032 and reduces to 0 54 m in year 2050  depletion tends to reduce fault reactivation potential within the depleting and close underlying intervals, but enhances fault slip likelihood near the upper bounding zones  faults segments bounding the deepest producing reservoir, which contains the most depletion, is predicted to have the highest potential for fault shearing in the late stages of production  injection reverses the trend of fault reactivationpotential  there are no caprock integrity issues with the three main injection reservoirs for the entire field life    introduction   the study field is in offshore sarawak, malaysia and truncated by two sets of major faults with one set (alpha) in the south and the other (beta and gamma) in the north of the field   there are dozens of hydrocarbon-bearing zones separately deposited in the upper to lower coastal plain environments of interbedded sandstones, shales and siltstones  the shallower zones comprise gas reservoirs; intermediate reservoirs exhibit small oil rims; and deep reservoirs show gas condensate  eight reservoirs, labelled as r1, r2, … and r8, have been either in production, or in water injection, or within future production consideration  fig  1 shows the plan and cross-section views of the field structure    after the field discovery in 1967, production commenced in 1972 from three major reservoirs: r4, r5 and r6, with r6 started water injection since 1994 follow by r4 and r5- in 2017  in addition, the other 5 reservoirs, including a deeper overpressured pure gas reservoir, r8, will begin production in 2017  thereafter, depletion and recharge of pressure is expected from multiple reservoirs undergoing either production or injection    pressure depletion from production or pressure recharge because of injection induces stress changes in the depleting/injecting reservoirs and their bounding formations  consequently, the stress changes in multiple reservoirs and bounding zones can induce various geomechanical problems, e g , wellbore drilling instability, sand production, reservoir compaction, overburden subsidence, fault reactivation and caprock fracturing  those geomechanical issues can impact well planning, platform facilitating and production management for future field development | 
18000-ms 	 new inversion method to determine in-situ stress from borehole induced fractures |abstract   the drilling induced tensile fractures can be observed from borehole image logs but they must be differentiated from natural fractures  this paper focuses on the understanding of hydraulically or artificially induced tensile fractures while drilling  we present an inversion method using rigorous principles of mechanics, to determine the in-situ formation stress state from observed induced tensile fractures  contrary to common practices where only vertical or near vertical wells can be analysed, the present method is applicable to wellbores of all orientations  for a geological rock formation and area where the in-situ stress regime can be assumed to be similar, all the relevant borehole image logs can be included to provide information to yield the most probable subsurface in-situ stress state  the proposed inversion method directly solves for the in-situ stress states given any single set of observed tensile fracture location and orientation  it provides not only an estimate for the minimum horizontal stress magnitude and direction, but also the maximum horizontal stress magnitude which is usually very difficult to pin down  the resultant equations are non-linear and a simple numerical scheme is adopted for the solution  although published data on borehole images of fractures with corresponding in-situ stress information are scarce, two observed field data from published papers are chosen for comparison    introduction   in-situ stresses in deep rock formations reached equilibrium over geologic time; but drilling, production and injection processes cause deformation in the rock mass and change these stresses, and often negatively impact the operator’s development plan  if they are not well anticipated, the challenges and costs of managing a prospect can far exceed the initial field development expectation  therefore, it is vital to characterize the undisturbed in-situ stress and evaluate potential impact of field development induced rock stress changes  two examples that come to mind are 1) enhanced oil recovery field development where injection scheme takes place under hydraulic fracturing condition and 2), the development of unconventional resources such as shale gas, where the effectiveness of hydraulic fracturing to access hydrocarbon is impacted by the in-situ stress regime  the latter, for instance, is encountered in china's sichuan basin where operators are striving to determine whether hydraulic fractures in certain areas of the basin are developed under thrust-faulting or reverse-faulting stress regime (yuan et al, 2013)  a reverse-faulting stress regime implies that the hydraulic fractures would grow in a horizontal ‘pancake’ fashion, diminishing its effectiveness in draining the reservoir | 
18023-ms 	 pre-salt carbonate reservoir analog selection for stimulation optimization |abstract   hydrocarbon production optimization in pre-salt carbonate reservoirs is a main focus for oil and gas research in brazil  stimulation treatment design optimization requires good knowledge of the reservoir properties and excellent understanding of the interaction between rock formation and treating fluid  this paper investigates these interactions through laboratory tests determining the compatibility of fluids used in matrix stimulation with different pre-salt carbonate rock types  the objective of this work is to relate the geology, petrophysics, and geomechanics of the pre-salt reservoirs to their expected stimulation response    because of the difficulty in obtaining downhole cores and the destructive nature of most tests, the study focused on samples collected from a pre-salt carbonate analog: the coquinas formation (schafer 1973) from the sao miguel quarry, northeast brazil (chagas de azambuja filho et al  1998)  a thorough geology-based study of the coquinas formation, including routine core analysis (fzi) microtomography, and thin section study was conducted  usually these grain-supported carbonates show different amounts and types of primary porosity, closed and reopened by multiple diagenetic phases    throughout the 25-m thick coquinas reservoir, five rock types in 13 layers with permeability ranging from microdarcy to almost 1 darcy were identified  all rock types were subjected to routine mineralogy evaluation and various petrophysical, geomechanical, and spectroscopic measurements  six of the thirteen layers were selected to perform core flow tests with a viscoelastic surfactant technology based diverting acid fluid (al-mutawa et al  2005; chang et al  2001; samuel et al  1997)  this is the first extensive study reporting the efficiency of a viscoelastic diverting acid system in the pre-salt analogue coquinas carbonate formation outcrop cores  spectroscopic measurement showed wormhole creation and, in some cases, rock texture alteration or fine migration  through the study we identified the flow units and characterized the rock behavior when chemically stimulated  the conclusions from this study will enable us to tailor and optimize stimulation treatments of pre-salt carbonate reservoirs    introduction   the offshore pre-salt in brazil comprises a group of recently discovered fields with promising oil reserves in the coquinas formation or the above the microbialites section  for example, lula (ex-tupi) field, the lead field of the santos cluster, is believed to hold between 5 to 8 billions barrels of oil equivalent (beltrao et al  2009)  the pre-salt reservoirs are currently the focus of research in brazil; however, the scarceness of downhole samples collected makes destructive tests very difficult to perform, and so analysis must be performed on analogues  the onshore coquinas formation from northeast brazil is taken here as analogue of the pre-salt carbonates | 
18045-ms 	 core analysis challenges and solutions in characterizing coal mechanical properties for successful drilling and completion of horizontal coal bed methane well |abstract   despite the dramatic growth of exploration and appraisal activities for coalbed methane (cbm) wells in the bowen basin, there is still a lack of understanding on the impacts of geomechanics toward well planning, drilling issues caused by borehole stability, and production performance  from the regional core rock mechanics analysis performed so far, we have observed that coals are generally weak and are prone to failure that can lead to significant consequences in drilling and completion for cbm production wells  the geomechanics issues become prominent, especially for long reach and complex multibranched laterals wells, as rock mechanical properties vary along the coalseam target  proper characterization of rock mechanical properties, especially the unconfined compressive strength (ucs), is essential in wellbore stability analysis    in this paper, we focus on geomechanics laboratory core analysis techniques to characterize ucs, challenges in ucs core testing on coal samples, and a case study which compares results from five different types of ucs testing on coal and siltstone samples: conventional uniaxial compression, pseudo-ucs, single stage triaxial, multi-stage triaxial, and scratch    introduction   wellbore stability issues have significant impact in drilling and completing cbm wells in the bowen basin, especially in long-reach and complex multi-branched lateral wells  geomechanics evaluation can be performed to mitigate wellbore stability issues by optimizing the mud weight required to keep a stable borehole (puspitasari et  al , 2014)  done correctly, this type of evaluation has the potential of preventing costly short- and long-term drilling and completion problems    proper characterization of rock mechanical properties is essential in wellbore stability analysis  the unconfined compressive strength (ucs) is the most important rock strength parameter to describe stability at the borehole wall (fjaer et al , 2008)   ucs is defined as the strength of a rock or soil sample when crushed in one direction (uniaxial) without lateral restraint (allaby & allaby, 2014)  a continuous ucs profile along a wellbore is typically estimated using mathematical and empirical equations that uses well logs (such as sonic, density, and gr log) and/or interpreted petrophysical parameters (such as volume of clay, total porosity, and effective porosity)  to ensure that the log-derived ucs is representative of the actual rock strength, the equations must be calibrated with direct measurement from laboratory core tests    laboratory core tests to characterize rock strength   several types of laboratory test can be performed to characterize rock strength  the tests are typically done on cylindrical samples (core plugs) obtained at the depth of interest  the size of the plug is typically 1 5 in  in diameter and 3 in  long  for small grain-size rock, such as shales, smaller plug sizes can be used  the small shale plug size is ideally 1 in  in diameter and 2 in  long, but it can also be as little as 0 75 in  in diameter and 1 5 in  long  table 1 compares of some of the most common tests used to measure ucs in the industry  |

18094-ms 	 improved methods for assessing in situ stress in unconventional shale reservoirs in tectonically stressed settings |abstract   shale reservoirs are being actively exploited in several tectonically stressed regions around the world  these tectonic settings often mean that the development of these fields requires an adequate quantification of the in situ principle stress magnitudes and their orientation  achieving this goal can be complicated by the heterogeneous, inelastic, and/or anisotropic mechanical properties of these shales and the associated vertical and lateral variation in pore pressure and stress through the target zones and bounding intervals  for these reasons, the commonly used techniques of determining stress state from mini-frac type data and using this data to calibrate log derived stress profiles may be misleading unless certain additional factors are measured and considered  we present some case study workflow examples from productive shales in tectonically stressed settings where a more rigorous analysis of the injection test data and of the shale petrophysical properties has allowed an improved, more accurate assessment of stress state  in particular, utilizing well testing theory in the analysis of mini-frac data has given us additional understanding of hydraulic fracture behavior in some tectonically stressed shales  horizontal fracture growth through shear activation of bedding-parallel fabric can be a preferred fracture propagation mechanism in these shales and this behavior can be diagnosed by this improved workflow  anisotropic mechanical fabric of these shales can be measured in core more regularly and more efficiently due to recent instrumentation advances  these improvements allow for a more accurate distinction between the impact of rock fabric anisotropy and of stress induced acoustic anisotropy on modern sonic logging tool response | 
18104-ms 	 case study: a challenging large-scale fracturing in sichuan basin |abstract   the success of commercial production of shale gas/oil in north america encourages other countries, such as china to replicate the u s  shale gas revolution  the sichuan basin located in southwest of china is one of the largest proven shale formations with complex tectonics compared with us shale plays  the shale has natural fractures and local earth stress is complex  the high formation stresses make initiating hydraulic fractures difficult  therefore, very high surface fracturing pressure and high horsepower is needed to perform large scale fracturing jobs and initiate hydraulic fractures    there are two types of shale formations in the sichuan basin, one is a lacustrine formation that is not a common formation globally to produce hydrocarbons and the other a marine formation  a couple of appraisal wells have been successfully drilled and fractured with commercial gas production rates in both formations  one horizontal shale gas appraisal well in the lacustrine formation was drilled with 4,102 meters (13,454ft) in total measured depth (md), 3,088 meters (10,129ft) in true vertical depth (tvd) and 815meters (2,673 ft) in horizontal section  the 10-stage ball-activated sleeves and open hole packers system were chosen as the multistage fracturing completion design  based upon the research and analysis of this formation, the largest ever shale gas frac operation in china was completed in january, 2013  a total of 265 7m3 (990,000lbs) of proppant and 8625 5m3 (2,278,616 gals) of frac fluid were pumped into the target formation with a maximum surface fracturing pressure of 61mpa (8,847psi) and a pump rate of 12 4 m3/min (77 9 bbls/min)  this frac operation set 2 new records in china for the proppant tonnage and the frac fluid volume     this paper will provide a comprehensive view of this successful fracturing operation in the lacustrine formation including formation evaluation, fracturing design and fracturing completion strategy such as determining the optimal number of frac stages per lateral, proppant type and mesh size, volumes of proppant pumped on each stage, fracture completion tool, fracturing fluid type, and injection rate   the success of the fracturing job in this well marks a new breakthrough in gas field exploration in the sichuan lacustrine formation and provides a guideline for future shale gas frac operations in similar formations or blocks     introduction   due to rapid development in the last few decades, china is one of the most energy hungry countries in the world  to date, china is still heavily reliant on coal for energy which severely affects pollution, emissions and efficiency  to address these problems, the government has become more and more aware of the need to change energy consumption composition, i e  reduce coal usage and increase use of natural gas  what is important is that china has great potential for natural gas production, especially for shale gas       in china, compared with marine formations from which a large amount of oil and gas has been produced, very limited attention has been paid to lacustrine formations, such as the xujiahe formation in sichuan basin where there exists good conditions for potential commercial reservoirs  as the shale gas industry in north america has successfully developed and been leading the world, learning from north america is a good choice to accelerate shale gas development for china  based on these considerations, the well in this case study was intended to be drilled as one of appraisal wells to find out the commercial production potential of the xujiahe formation and execute a multistage hydraulic fracturing based on applying us technology and experience  |

18143-ms 	 anisotropic wellbore stability model and its application for drilling through challenging shale gas wells |abstract   this paper describes a new anisotropic wellbore stability model and its application in a challenging shale gas well in china  wells drilled through laminated rocks like shales –particularly deviated wells such as laterals - are often less stable than comparable wells drilled into non-laminated rocks  this results in significant wellbore instability issues that can elevate drilling operation costs substantially  traditional wellbore stability analysis considers the formation as a homogeneous isotropic material using isotropic elastic near wellbore stresses together with isotropic borehole failure criteria such as mohr-coulomb  in anisotropic rocks, for example in highly laminated shales and fractured rocks, those models are no longer valid as borehole failure can occur along weak planes    we have developed such an anisotropic wellbore stability model in which the rock anisotropic elastic properties and anisotropic strength characteristic are incorporated  near borehole induced stress is computed by lekhnitskii-amadei solution to account formation anisotropic behavior, and wellbore shear failure mechanism is modeled by a modified plane-of-weakness model, where the classical plane-of-weakness failure criterion is adopted to identify the onset of rock sliding along a weak plane; and the active shearing effect is adopted to judge whether the onset sliding at the borehole wall will develop and cause borehole instability  arbitrary bedding/fracture orientations as well as arbitrary wellbore trajectory and in situ stress orientation is considered by this model  the model can predict the extent of failure region around the wellbore and then provide mud weight window for safe and effective drilling    additionally, this approach was programmed into a software system and applied to a field case study - wellbore stability analysis and mud weight computation for a slightly deviated pilot well drilling through laminated shales   the laminated shales are penetrated by high-angle natural fractures  our modeling results shows the design borehole can be drilled without encounting severe instability issue, however, borehole damage due to either weak planes (laminated layers and fractures) sliding or rock matrix shear failure were predicted  the borehole damage mode and severity is largely dependent on borehole relative orientation with the weak planes, and the directions and magnitudes of the in situ three principal stresses  the computed borehole damage was compared to borehole image (fmi) and caliper measurement and gave a good agreement   subsequently this model was applied to predict the mud weight window for an extended reach drilling (erd) in the field and provide wellbore stability analysis to drill high-deviated wells in the area  we showed that this developed model is effective to provide insight in understanding borehole failure mechanisms, and provide more reasonable mud weight window which can be used to effectively mitigate wellbore instabilities in anisotropic condition | 
18159-ms 	 coupled fluid flow and geomechanics modeling for dfit analysis in unconventional gas development |abstract   in tight reservoirs development such as shale gas it is important and yet difficult to predict the size and orientation of the drainage area around a hydraulically fractured well  often the drainage area is determined by near-well fractures  diagnostic fracture injection test (dfit) is an effective way of predicting many reservoir parameters  however, it is challenging to uniquely interpret fractures’ geometry, dimension and spacing  a forward model is desired to correlate the dfit responses with different fracture configurations and the associated drainage area    we present a 2d model that couples fluid flow with geomechanical deformations in hydraulically fractured reservoirs by solving biot's equation  both fluid pressure/velocity and deformations are solved on a finite element mesh  fracture space is distinguished from the rest of the matrix by high porosity/permeability and low elastic strength  the fem mesh is adaptively refined at the fractured area to allow the fractures to be reasonably thin and arbitrarily spaced  pseudo time iteration is applied to seek for convergence between fracture opening/closure and fluid pressure changes  dfit is simulated with the new numerical model with a single (bi-wing) fracture case and a complex fracture case  the complex fracture case is made by adding transverse fractures to the two wings of a single fracture  the numerical results reveal pressure changes of reservoir fluid due to matrix and fracture deformations as well as due to fluid leak-off  the model is able to generate synthetic well pressure data that show all the type curves given by analytical dfit theory  the complex fracture case results in pressure transient such that the flow regime rapidly evolves into pseudo-radial flow    for idealized bi-wing fracture cases, this model is consistent with existing analytical tools for dfit interpretation  the advantages of this model are the ability to implement complex fractures, and the ability to extend to 3d for non-vertical fractures (briefly mentioned in the appendices)    synthetic dfit data from the model developed in this study has been compared to a field example from a shale gas reservoir  the discrepancy between the model result and field example suggests that some special constitutive law is needed for the modeled fracture areas to appropriately capture the real fracture closure process    introduction   when a well is subjected to production or fracturing injection, the fluid flow is likely accompanied by the solid deformation  in most cases of conventional reservoirs, the initial pore volume is much larger than the volume changes that are caused by the matrix strain with competent rock grains  for this reason, the fluid flow is often modeled independently without coupling with deformation  in the cases of tight and shale gas reservoirs however, the pore volume is comparable to the strain caused volume changes  the fluid flow modeling then needs to be coupled with the solid deformation    we present our work on modeling a hydraulically fractured reservoir subjected to production or injection, where the fluid and solid are coupled by solving biot's equation  the model is capable of generating synthetic well test data that show all the characteristic type curves given by the analytical dfit theory  the paper is organized as follows: | 
18187-ms 	 an overview of hydraulic fracturing stimulation practices of a joint cooperation shale gas project in sichuan basin |abstract   shell china exploration and production company and its affiliates are operating in the pioneering joint cooperation project (jcp) in the sichuan basin that targets unlocking the lower silurian longmaxi shale gas play  since 2010, both verticals and horizontals have been drilled and completed with various hydraulic fracturing technologies implemented  supported by extensive data gathering and analysis, the hydraulic fracturing stimulation practices have significantly evolved to improve the quality and repeatability of completion results  this paper reviews the development of hydraulic fracturing stimulation practices in longmaxi shale gas play in the studied area     unlike most of the north american shale gas plays, the longmaxi shale gas play is characterized by high formation pressures, close-to-overburden in-situ minimum stresses, low horizontal stress anisotropy, and regionally active tectonics, the combination of which presents unique challenges to hydraulic fracturing stimulation  the combination of these geologic, geomechanical and petrophysical characteristics result in high treating pressure, difficulty in proppant placement, constrained fracture height and complex fracture geometry  however, successful fracturing executions have been achieved by applying technologies including, but not limited to, limited entry perforation design and hybrid fluid systems, advanced monitoring including microseismic and diagnostic fracture injection test (dfit) technique, etc  the completion parameters such as lateral length, stage spacing, number of clusters per stage, perforation shots per cluster, fluid type, fluid/proppant volume, treating rate, proppant selection have all been optimized as part of the learning curve      key fracture design parameters such as the preferred treating rate, customized fluid design and pumping schedule for the play are discussed  this paper also demonstrates the learning of the fit-for-purpose hydraulic fracturing stimulation design from the perspective of successful and repeatable delivery of the fracture treatment      introduction   the lower silurian longmaxi black shale, characterized by organic-rich calcareous-siliceous shale with higher brittleness as well as abundant natural fractures distribution, is the main target for this joint cooperation project  high quartz and toc content in conjunction with favorable porosity and permeability makes the lower section of longmaxi shale the prime interval of interest     comparing to shale gas play in north america, the tvd of joint cooperation project (jcp) wells range from 3050m to 4500m; the pore pressure gradient is greater than 0 9 psi/ft, which is also higher than most of its counterparts in north america  however, the other geological and petrophysical parameters like formation thickness, young’s modulus and poisson ratio are comparable     due to the low anisotropy of shmax and shmin (yuan et al  2013), the longmaxi shale demonstrates diverse present-day horizontal stress direction across the block, reflecting the observed structural complexity  the in-situ stress, namely shmin, overburden stress and shmax are nearly isotropic resulting in mixed stress regimes  in some areas the shmin can be close to or even higher than the overburden stress, which is confirmed by the closure gradients from dfit  this may cause the fracture geometry to be “bed parallel” or “pancake” like  meanwhile, complex fracture geometry (srv type), rather than typical “bi-wing”, are diagnosed by microseismic monitoring  the total fracture height as diagnosed by non-radioactive tracers (nrt) and temperature logging in a vertical well indicated the hydraulically created fracture covering about only one thirds of total target thickness |

1881673-ms 	 impact of petroleum-expulsion fractures on productivity of the bakken shales: a geological interpretation for pressure transient behaviors |abstract    the impact of petroleum-expulsion fractures on productivity of the bakken shales were investigated by integrating epifluorescence petrography, pressure transient analysis and analysis of petroleum-expulsion fracturing    in early exploration vertical wells, drilling breaks from ten minutes to one minute per foot with gas increases from ten units to several hundred units were considered poor shows in the source rocks of the bakken shales  drill stem tests (dst) over the bakken shales were reported with average production rates that reach several tens of barrels per day  these shales were overpressured with no matrix porosity in evidence and permeability in the micro darcy scale  production was assumed to come from fractures  speculative conclusions were drawn about these fractures to be related to source-rock maturity, petroleum expulsion and overpressuring  these conclusions were a significant promoter for exploration in the bakken formation    those speculative conclusions have encouraged to review a total of 64 drill stem tests (dst) over different intervals that include the bakken formation and/or the underlying three forks formation  resistivity logs, cores and thin sections were studied to conduct an integrated geological interpretation for pressure transient behaviors of the bakken shales  the study highlights that the bakken shales are naturally fractured and can be interpreted on resistivity curves separation  the three forks and middle bakken pressure transient behaviors imply spherical flow which indicates that there is always contribution from the bakken shales  the bakken pressure transient behavior shows dual porosity flow (naturally fractured) with low fracture system’s storativity (<u+03bb>) implying that fluid is mostly stored in the matrix  the study also suggests that the matrix gives up its fluid rapidly to the fracture system indicating high interporosity flow (<u+03c9>) and implying that petroleum-expulsion fractures contribution is present    the significance of petroleum-expulsion fractures resides in its ability to provide higher permeability pathways through the bakken shales, and explains their high deliverability  the volume expansion due to petroleum generation is invoked as a mechanism to increase pressures to levels of inducing expulsion fractures responsible for primary migration of petroleum and forming the bakken unconventional pervasive petroleum system | 
1891560-ms 	 a review of enhanced oil recovery methods applied in williston basin |summary   the conventional reserves are depleting significantly on a worldwide basis  in order to meet the demand for hydrocarbon energy, it is essential to develop unconventional resources  over the past decade, shale oil becomes an important source of oil across the north america  bakken shale oil, one of the largest shale oils in the world, is producing near 1,000,000 barrel oil per day  the main methods exploiting bakken oil shale are drilling horizontal wells with multi-fracturing technology  even with the technology evolution of shale oil exploration and well stimulation in shale plays, the recovery factors in bakken are still very low due to the nature of extremely low permeability  original oil in place in bakken ranges between 271 and 503 billion barrels  primary recovery with multi-stage fracturing in horizontal wells only can produce 5 to 10%  therefore, enhanced oil recovery (eor) methods will play a crucial role to recover the remaining hydrocarbons  with eor techniques such as gas injection, chemical injection, microbial injection, and thermal recovery, the recovery factor can be increased by 10-30%  in this study, different eor methods applied in bakken were reviewed  the mechanisms and causes that lead to the success and failure of different eor methods were analyzed and discussed  with the lessons and experiences learned from these eor applications in bakken, significant cost saving on can be achieved for future bakken oil development and production  the significances of this study are: (1) proposed screening criteria for different eor applications in bakken; (2) identified appropriate eor technique to improve the recovery of specific reservoir, especially low permeability shale reservoir; (3) provided lessons and experiences accrued in eor application in bakken during last several decades to curtail learning curve and optimize eor design in the future; (4) served as guidance in eor applications in other shale oil plays | 
1916004-ms 	 core hardness testing and data integration for unconventionals |stimulation of unconventionals often demands the characterization of fine-scale mechanical properties and correlations between several data sets, including well logs, core descriptions, and lab tests  this study presents a comparison of hardness data from a slabbed liquids-rich core with complementary well logs and core analysis  hardness refers to the measure of resistance to permanent deformation from an applied force, and depends on a range of material properties, some of which are independently measured by standard well logs and core work  leeb rebound hardness was manually measured with the portable equotip 3 by proceq  within the handheld tool, a 3 mm diameter ball indenter is launched by spring against the sample; the ratio of the rebound velocity to impact velocity determines the leeb hardness value  the equotip was originally designed for testing metals, although recent studies have employed this tool to improve geomechanical characterization of core samples and field exposures  hardness measurements, collected at two inch intervals, and high resolution whole-core dual energy computed tomography (ct) data elucidate the fine-scale mineralogical heterogeneity of unconventional reservoir rock  for example, thin laminations of softer calcareous marl cause anomalously low hardness measurements within hard, blocky, limestone or chalk  x-ray ct provides core images, as well as variations in density and effective atomic number (zeff)  in the tested core section, hardness trends with zeff more closely than with other data sets, such as density, elastic properties, total organic carbon, and shale volume  this suggests that the mineralogy may be a key factor in controlling mechanical stratigraphy  the equotip is less destructive than scratch or indentation hardness tests, is easy to use, provides instantaneous results, and has the potential to replace costly tests; however, a dependable methodology is necessary to maximize efficiency and minimize error  reliable hardness data can then be scaled up and integrated with well logs |

1922149-ms 	 horizontal lateral image analysis applied to fracture stage optimization in eastern barnett shale, tarrant and dallas counties, texas |abstract   the “core” region of the barnett shale play in eastern tarrant and western dallas counties, texas, has prime development potential  this stems from a combination of maximum target thickness of 450’ to 500’ and a thick viola limestone, affording a significant barrier to ellenberger water production  structural complexity increases approaching the ouachita thrust belt to the east, as reflected in increased variability in barnett natural fractures and rock stress properties    borehole image logs from 3 horizontal wells in the barnett reveal significant variability in natural fracturing, faults and drilling induced fracture distribution along their laterals  the presence or absence of drilling induced transverse and longitudinal fractures can be directly linked to the changes in frac gradient and proppant placement during the fracture treatments and flowback response  a geomechanical study of all 3 wells identified the geometry of critically-stressed fractures and faults  variation in differential stress along the lateral and changes in the geometry of critically-stressed fractures and faults can significantly alter the induced hydraulic fracture response (complex vs  planar fractures) in these stages, ultimately governing production response    we developed criteria to use drilling induced fracture patterns from horizontal borehole image data to optimize the fracture stage design, custom fitting the stimulation to lateral changes in stress anisotropy    from production histories, we show that stage-by-stage modification of the pump-ins, accommodating borehole image log-derived information, was able to improve frac efficiency and eur, even in highly fractured laterals | 
1922172-ms 	 flow modeling in multi-stage hydraulic fracturing patterns to optimize shale reservoir production |abstract   horizontal drilling and multi-stage hydraulic fracturing are the key technologies enabling the oil and gas industry to unlock unconventional resources  based on microseismic data, hydraulic fracturing in shale reservoirs typically creates highly complex fracture networks due to their complex geology and the activation of the pre-existing natural fractures that cannot be realistically captured when the classical planar bi-wing fracture models are implemented  coupling geomechanical modeling with microseismic data interpretation helps a better understanding of the fracture complexity that is anticipated for enhanced production performance  recently, new stimulation design patterns have been proposed for production optimization using this approach by coupling the fundamental geomechanical concepts in order to waive the stress interference constraint of the minimum fracture spacing and to produce further fracture complexity in the altered stress regions    the goal of this study was to evaluate and compare two new stimulation patterns, namely, the alternate fracturing and the zipper fracturing, to the consecutive multi-stage stimulation pattern from fluid flow perspective using a numerical dual-permeability model  the study considers anticipated fracture complexity and stimulated reservoir volume (srv) overlap of parallel lateral wells  an economic evaluation was also conducted to couple the flowbased optimization with the net present value (npv) analysis to quantify costs vs  benefits of selecting a specific stimulation pattern    results of this research demonstrate how the configuration of fracture stages, complexity of fracture network and srv overlap impact the production performance and eventually npv of the studied stimulation patterns  the comparison study highlights the governing parameters and provides insights on the significance of developing and optimizing a stimulation pattern utilizing fluid flow evaluation  a hybrid alternate-zipper pattern was also suggested in this paper to take advantage of both patterns by combining the anticipated fracture complexity and srv overlapping features | 
1922219-ms 	 simulation of multiple-stage fracturing in quasibrittle shale formations using pore pressure cohesive zone model |abstract    economic production from shale gas cannot be achieved by natural mechanisms alone; it requires technologies such as hydraulic fracturing in multiple stages along a horizontal wellbore  developing numerical models for hydraulic fracturing is essential since a successful fracturing job in a shale formation cannot be generalized to another due to different shale characteristics, and restricted access to the field data acquisition  empirical methods and linear elastic fracture mechanics (lefm)-based numerical techniques are still the prevailing design tools in most of the hydraulic fracture applications though they provide a reasonable prediction only for hard (brittle) rocks  the plastic zone and softening effects at the fracture tip have been neglected in modeling hydraulic fracturing, which results in the prediction of conservative fracture geometry and imprecise fracture pressure  these effects can be identified by the cohesive zone model (czm) but not by lefm  moreover, czm is able to model fracturing interfaces; for instance, natural fractures, which are mechanically weaker than the adjoining materials  brittle shales are more likely to contain more natural fractures while ductile shales act as good seals for the fractured layers  in this work, we modeled single and double-stage fracturing in a quasibrittle shale layer using an improved czm for porous media besides including the material softening effect and a novel boundary condition treatment, using infinite elements surrounding the solution domain of interest  we illustrated some superior aspects of czm compared to lefm in shales  we demonstrated the significance of young’s modulus, poisson’s ratio, pumping rate, viscosity, and leak-off in the pumping pressure, and fracture aperture  also, we found that the stress shadow effects on induced fractures significantly influenced the characteristics of subsequent induced fractures  moreover, we investigated various scenarios in number and sequence of fracturing stages  our fully coupled analysis provided us with a continuum-based leak-off model eliminating the requirement for an explicit leak-off model such as carter’s leak-off model | 
1922292-ms 	 improved constant rate of strain consolidation test on stiff shale |abstract    detailed discussions on the poroelastic behavior of stiff shales are provided with the aim of developing a fast reliable method to characterize stress-dependent shale permeability using the constant rate of strain (crs) consolidation test  shales usually have dense stiff matrices composed of soft grains  characterizing the hydro-mechanical properties of shales in fully-saturated condition is challenging due to their very low permeability  for reliable development of unconventional reservoirs in terms of borehole stability and hydraulic fracturing, the effect of hydromechanical interactions between shale matrix and pore fluid is an important factor  thus, fast, reliable and simple test methods to characterize the hydro-mechanical properties of saturated shales are needed    applying the crs test standardized for soft soils to shales confronts some critical technical issues  satisfying the required test condition, that is one-dimensional consolidation with satisfactory one-dimensional fluid flow in test sample, is highly difficult for shales  thus, the consolidation is carried out in isotropic stress condition  stress-dependent anisotropy of deformation of tested shale attributed to their layered structure is evaluated based on the stiffness matrix determined in a previous study  in the standard crs procedure, the permeability during crs test is related to the strain rate, sample thickness, and excess pore pressure  however, in shales, non-negligible compressibility of solid grains is considered to cause a certain loss of excess pore pressure, which is not considered in the standard procedure  in this study, the loss of excess pore pressure is compensated by assuming that the ratio of excess pore pressure for a porous medium composed of compressible solid grains to that for a porous medium having negligible solid grain compressibility is equivalent to the value of skempton's pore pressure coefficient, b, of the former medium  to extract the b-value of shale sample from that experimentally-determined in the presence of porous metal filters, the b-value of multi-layered porous media is formulated in relation to the fluid saturation, porosity, biot coefficient, and solid grain bulk modulus of each layer  the extracted b-value based on the estimated value of fluid saturation of sample, 0 94, overcompensates the loss  it is found that the crs permeability values obtained by assuming full saturation are highly consistent with the steady-state permeability values |

1922481-ms 	 integration of core, drilling, microseismic and well log data for geomechanical property determination and monitoring in the argentinian vaca muerta shale formation |abstract    the vaca muerta shale is an emerging shale play within the neuquen basin in argentina  like most unconventional shale plays, the formation exhibits geomechanical, acoustic and permeability anisotropy  therefore, advanced logging tools as well as advanced techniques for core measurements and analysis are necessary to properly characterize the geomechanical behavior of the formation  the results of an integrated core and logging analysis of the geomechanical and acoustic properties of the vaca muerta formation is presented in this paper with the use of well-known techniques for formation characterization  the geomechanical and acoustic measurements of the core samples from a well in the base of the our study area in vaca muerta formation have been used to determine the dynamic and static elastic properties of the formation and how to relate the static properties to the dynamic data  in addition, cross-dipole logging data from the same well was utilized to compare the core data with the logs  the results of the core test were used to develop an anisotropic formation model for which the logs could be calibrated with  thomsen coefficient epsilon was determined being not equal to gamma while relationships between the stiffness coefficients have been relatively consistent  this finding allowed us to develop an anisotropic model based on the vertical transverse isotropy (vti) using the core data as an input for the model  the model was then utilized with the logging data to determine the anisotropic stiffness tensor as a function of depth  based on the thomsen coefficient gamma, the degree of both vertical and horizontal transverse isotropy has been determined  the results of this analysis indicate that the formation almost exclusively exhibits vti behavior whether examined through the logs, core, drilling or microseismic data in our study area  the magnitude of the core acoustic measurements does not match well the logging measurements, and this is most likely due to preferential core sampling methods that intentionally exclude natural fractured sections in the cores  microseismic analysis has shown potential fault reactivation near one of the wells in loma jarillosa este block in addition to the conventional seismicity from the hydraulic fracturing operation that requires further attention in the future development well designs in the area    the results of the model developed in this study can be applied to better geomechanical characterization of the vaca muerta formation that will help designing suitable completion techniques and hydraulic fracturing design in optimizing production and minimizing footprint in the basin  the accuracy of the model will be anticipated to be improved as additional core measurements are completed and more well data from other wells in the area become available | 
1922563-ms 	 vaca muerta formation: an example of shale heterogeneities controlling hydrocarbon's accumulations |abstract    vaca muerta formation, a thick upper jurassic unit covering at least 25,000km2, is located in neuquen basin and represents the most important source rock in argentina  its geological and petrophysical variations are significantly linked to the geodynamic history of the basin strongly related to the transition from extensional reactivation to thermal relaxation which characterized basin<u+00b4>s evolution through time  major cyclic events related to sea oscillations provided the proper marine environment conditions to promote the development of several source rocks within the basin apart from vaca muerta formation, such as los molles and agrio formations    regional surface data suggests that vertically (time domain) and laterally (space domain) vaca muerta formation comprises a wide variety of lithologies: shales, marls, carbonates, calcareous sandstones and sandstones  subsurface data, obtained from mud logging, cores and open hole logs also demonstrate it  both sources provide sufficient sampling density for interpreting the different facies of the unit from the lower tithonian to the lower valanginian and also considering its areal extent within the basin    these variations are related to the basement fabric, post-rift subsidence interrupted by inverse reactivation, east-west basin asymmetry and climate changes from semiarid seasonally humid to warm and dry    a summary of these characteristics are: a) a prograding nw carbonatic ramp best represents depositional environment; b) formation thickness increases to the west and north; c) carbonates are better developed in proximal areas; d) organic matter content increases at the base of the formation; e) paleotopography clearly controls facies distribution; f) to the north of the basin hydrocarbons are related to organic rich argillaceous limestones, to the center of the basin are mostly pelithic sediments while to ne correspond to a mixture of the above mentioned, to the south the euxinic conditions favored hydrocarbons with increased sulfur concentration    consequently these vertical and lateral facies variations control key aspects such as: areal distribution, depth, thickness, porosity, permeability, heterogeneity, toc, mineral composition, reservoir pressure and geomechanics    in this paper a comprehensive analysis using outcrop, well, and laboratory data of the vaca muerta formation are presented summarizing the main hydrocarbon<u+00b4>s accumulations with its unconventional reservoir characteristics | 
1922580-ms 	 a hydraulic fracture network propagation model in shale gas reservoirs: parametric studies to enhance the effectiveness of stimulation |abstract    the most effective method for stimulating shale gas reservoirs is horizontal wells with successful multi-stage hydraulic fracture treatments  recent fracture diagnostic technologies such as microseismic technology have shown that complex fracture networks are commonly created in the field  however, often times, the stimulated reservoir volume (srv) obtained from the microseismic interpretation does not provide propped fracture volume and its conductivity such that, commonly, there is a difference between the srv that is open for the gas flow and srv obtained from microseismic diagnosis    in this paper, the coupled hydraulic fracturing model that is capable to simulate dynamic fracture propagation, reservoir flow simulation, the interactions between hydraulic fractures and pre-existing natural fractures, and proppant transportation will be used to conduct numerical experiments  the effects of proppant size, horizontal differential stress, fracture fluid viscosity, pumping rate, and natural fracture spacing on the propped stimulated reservoir volume (psrv) and hydraulic fracture conductivities is then compared and quantified  at last, using the knowledge gathered during parametric studies will be applied to enhance the effectiveness of stimulation    simulation results from the parametric studies show that enlarging srv does not guarantee larger psrv  our result shows that thin fluid with viscosity of 1 cp to 2 cp increases srv but it decrease psrv because proppants are not distributed further inside of network with thin fluid  fracture intensity increased in a reservoir with relatively smaller horizontal differential stress and natural fracture spacing  the conductivity of propped fracture network increased when fracture intensity is low and larger proppant size is used  these results will provide a better understanding to enhance srv, fracture intensity and fracture conductivity through proper proppant, fluid and pumping rate selection depending on the differential stress and the complexity of pre-existing natural fracture network | 
1922672-ms 	 microseismicity and geomechanics: modeling and comparisons |summary    microseismic source interpretation is often used to gauge the spatial extent of hydraulic fractures in unconventional reservoirs  it is usually difficult to interpret this data beyond a gross approximation of the maximum extent of joint activation and fracture propagation, either due to under-resolution of instrumentation, the inversion process, or possibly the interpretation of the moment tensor  together, these issues lead to a challenging environment for making more complicated operational decisions based on microseismic data    the approach taken here is to capture micro-seismicity as an emergent phenomenon from the simulation of flow and geomechanics in a fractured reservoir  this model is then applied to an at-scale stimulation operation, including natural fractures sampled from geostatistical distributions of fracture size, orientation, and constitutive parameters informed by field measurements  the results of this study are compared to field observations and are shown to capture some of the key features of microseismicity, including the spatial distribution of events with time, the frequency-magnitude relationship, and the observed source mechanism tensor distributions    additionally, such simulations offer the advantage of testing hypotheses regarding the origin of different observed phenomena  here we use the simulations to test whether we can reject the hypothesis that stress perturbations alone (due to the reorientation of the stress tensor in the vicinity of propagating hydraulically driven fractures) can explain the majority of microseismic events  it is shown that such “dry” microseismicity, i e , seismicity not connected with the arrival of a fluid front, cannot be rejected, challenging the assumption that microseismicity is indicative of connectivity between the well-bore and locations of events in the reservoir  however, it also suggests that encoded in the micro seismicity may be additional information about the composition and stress state of the reservoir | 
1922708-ms 	 matrix-fracture connectivity in eagle ford shale |summary    among natural fractures observed in core of eagle ford shale, texas, tall sub-vertical calcite-cemented fractures are the most spatially extensive  these completely cemented fractures break preferentially along one of the two cement-host rock interfaces during core handling suggesting that these fractures would be preferentially reactivated along the cement-host rock interface during well bore completion  fracture cement adhering to one of the host rock walls would thus form a fracture skin on one face of the reactivated natural fractures  we used scanning-electron microscopy (sem) on ion-milled samples of fracture cement and host rock to study pore space connectivity between the matrix and reactivated sub-vertical calcite cemented natural fractures  in the fracture calcite cement, we observed open micro-fractures suggesting that this cement layer is partially permeable to flow  the permeability of these micro-fractures was determined by lattice boltzmann methods and upscaled using an effective medium method to determine the permeability of the fracture cement  the fracture cement studied here is found to have permeabilities within the nano-darcy range | 
1922757-ms 	 mapping of organic matter distribution on the centimeter scale with nanometer resolution |abstract    organic matter may play an important role in the storage and transport of hydrocarbons in shale reservoirs  in some shales a significant amount of porosity is located in the organic matter and how well that organic matter is connected is crucial for the creation of possible flow pathways  the distribution of organic matter also affects the elastic properties and anisotropy of the shales which is important from a completions and seismic mapping standpoint  because of the heterogeneity of shales and micron to sub- micron size of the organic matter, mapping changes in organic distribution with sufficient resolution to capture all the organic matter has proven difficult  with the advent of large area ion beam milling and automated high-resolution sem imaging-stitching, the distribution of organic matter can now be mapped on centimeter-sized areas with nanometer resolution  using these methods we investigate the distribution of organic matter within a sample of the wolfcamp shale  results from the sem mapping suggest that over 50% of the organic matter in the sample consists of sub-100 nm regions  in addition, most of the organic matter is elongated in shape and locally disorganized with organization increasing somewhat with increasing organic matter size | 
1922870-ms 	 understanding tortuosity and permeability variations in naturally fractured reservoirs: niobrara formation |summary   natural fractures provide preferential pathways for fluid migration, and their effect is especially high in rocks with low matrix permeability  these fractures are usually lined or completely filled with mineral cement  the presence of cement can hinder the connectivity between residual fracture pores, thereby reducing fracture permeability    in order to better understand fluid transport in the niobrara formation, we studied the influence of cementation on flow in the fracture  we acquired the fracture geometry from x-ray microtomography (ct) scans, capturing the small-scale roughness of the mineral-lined fractures  the permeability and tortuosity of the fracture profile were determined from simulations of fluid flow through these geometries with impermeable fracture walls    we used a combination of the level-set-method-based progressive-quasistatic algorithm (lsmpqs software), and lattice boltzmann simulation to characterize the capillary-dominated displacement properties and the relative permeability of the naturally cemented fractures  finally, we numerically investigated the effect of increasing cement layer thickness on the fracture permeability as well as the tortuosity of the pore space and the capillary pressure-water saturation (pc-sw) relationship    pore space tortuosity and capillary pressure as a function of water saturation both increase with the numerically simulated increase in thickness of the fracture cement layer  even when there are no cement contact points or bridges in the original fracture volume, numerical fracture cementation creates unevenly distributed apertures and cement contact points  this in turns causes the wetting and non-wetting fluids to impede each other, with no consistent trends in relative permeability with increasing saturation |

1923793-ms 	 vaca muerta stratigraphy in central neuquen basin: impact on emergent unconventional project |summary    vaca muerta formation is a jurassic-cretaceous lithostratigraphic unit in the neuquen basin of argentina, well known as a world-class source rock and for its unconventional resource potential  vaca muerta play in the central neuquen basin position has a remarkably thick continuous organic-rich section (approximately 350m)    chevron argentina is evaluating the vaca muerta potential in the el trapial exploitation lease  data available includes 500 km2 of 3d seismic data, wire-line and mud log data from 4 exploratory vertical wells with full e-log suite and 415 meter of core, and from 5 legacy wells with basic e-logs  vaca muerta outcrops in an analog stratigraphic setting are located 40 km away from el trapial    initial results of the stratigraphic analysis were based on seismic interpretation, well log evaluations and core data analysis  correlations and comparisons between the subsurface interpretation and the outcrops of vaca muerta allowed us to tie stratigraphic sequences in el trapial to the regional framework    this study builds upon previous regional sequence stratigraphic interpretations and provides a refined stratigraphic framework for distal facies of the vaca muerta  similar to other shales worldwide, vaca muerta deposition was initiated with a marine transgression over non-marine deposits of the tordillo formation  this transgression is expressed as a condensed section with high gamma-ray and toc values in the basal section  accommodation changes and paleo-depositional trends were interpreted based on strata cyclicity, thickness variations, and seismic stacking patterns  an internal vaca muerta stratigraphic subdivision was defined based on seismic data, logs, thin sections, facies and organic geochemistry analysis    recognition of lateral and vertical heterogeneity within vaca muerta will lead to better planning and exploitation of hydrocarbons through enhanced reservoir models and improved target identification, which will ultimately reduce risks and costs  stratigraphy plays a key role in the identification of the most productive stratigraphic interval (i e , sweet spot), and most prospective region (i e , core area), to develop an unconventional project | 
1923960-ms 	 coupled geomechanics and pore confinement effects for modeling unconventional shale reservoirs |abstract    the pore sizes of shale and tight-rock formations are on the order of nanometers  the thermodynamic phase behavior of in-situ hydrocarbon mixtures in such small pores is significantly different from that of bulk fluids in the pvt cells mainly due to effect of large capillary pressure, which has been a subject of great interest for shale reservoir study  for example, it has been recognized that the critical pressure and temperature of reservoir fluids may change due to the pore spatial confinement, thus the phase envelop shifts for unconventional shale reservoirs  those shifts of phase envelop could favor the productions of shale reservoirs, especially for tight oil systems because of suppressed bubble-point pressure leading to longer single phase production    on the other hand, the pore sizes, especially the pore-throats, are subjected to change due to rock deformation induced by the fluid depletion  as the fluids are being produced from the pore space, the pore pressure will decrease; thus the effective stress on reservoir rock increase, resulting in the reduction of the pore and pore-throat sizes  this reduction on pore spaces affects again the fluid flow through impacts on the thermodynamic phase behaviors, as well as stress induced changes on porosity and permeability  thus a coupled flow-geomechanics model including pore confining effects is in general necessary to examine the unconventional shale reservoir behavior    in this paper, we present a multiphase multi-component reservoir model, fully coupling fluid flow, geomechanics and pore confining effects for shale reservoirs  this model is based on general mass conservation law for each component  the geomechanical model is derived from the elasticity theory extended to porous and non-isothermal media  the peng-robinson eos-based flash calculation is used to analyze the large capillary pressure effects on shale reservoir phase behavior  this theoretical model can be readily discretized and implemented with control volume based numerical methods, and generally applied to both dew-point and bubble-point systems  eventually it could improve the forecast accuracy for long-term production rate and recovery factors of unconventional reservoirs |

1928297-ms 	 calculation of rock compressibility by use of pressure buildup in permeability experiment |abstract    rock compressibility is one of the most important properties in petroleum exploration and production  it is an essential parameter in drilling and completion design  knowledge of geomechanical properties of target reservoirs ensures producing hydrocarbons from unconventional resources safely, environmental friendly, and economically  because the direct measurement of rock compressibility is time consuming and cost expensive  indirect measurement of rock compressibility from other readily available experimental data, such as permeability and sonic velocity tests, is highly demanded  rock compressibility from other aspects not only is a good reference for the directly measured rock compressibility, but also is an important supplement in case that no direct measurement is available or experimental data are unreliable due to lab and human errors, irregular core plug, and/or non-uniform deformation    in this study we developed a method to determine the rock compressibility using permeability experimental data  the significance of this investigation is that the new approach has a solid theoretical base  with this the core analysis can be reliable and accurate  the combination of the proposed method with direct measurement can be employed to ensure the reliability of the experiment and quantify the uncertainty resulting from lab and human errors | 
1928595-ms 	 generative models for production forecasting in unconventional oil and gas plays |summary    short and long term production forecasts are important for assessing the performance and value of unconventional oil and gas wells, setting production targets and predicting cash flows  often the best way to try to estimate future production of a new completion is by analogy with production from other nearby completions with similar treatment histories  forecasting production using type curves combines knowledge with experience using physics-based decline equations, type curve coefficients and an engineer’s judgment  modern algorithms for predictive analytics can be based on a generative model (gm) which does the same thing  a gm is a stochastic model which can be constructed to capture physics (solutions to differential fluid-flow equations) with experience (probability distributions that are calibrated using historic data)  the result is a model which is similar to a type curve in that it can be used to give a reasonable forecast of the future of a completion based on only a small amount of actual information about that particular well; the rest it draws from what it has seen before  by combining a gm with an algorithm for statistical inference, it is possible to make accurate forecasts that include quantified uncertainty bounds  the combination of a forecast and uncertainty leads to powerful new ways of looking at future production including forecast certainty maps | 
1932416-ms 	 a comprehensive methodology of evaluation of the fracability of a shale gas play |summary   this paper presents a methodology elaborated by total ep for ranking shale plays in terms of fracability using a set of geomechanical parameters obtained from different sources including lab measurements, well log data and poromechanical earth model (poromem)  a sustained productivity of gas shale is strongly dependent on geomechanical parameters such as in situ stresses, shale elastic and strength properties that control the geometry of hydraulic fractures and the connectivity and hydraulic conductivity of natural fractures networks  in the proposed methodology, the term «fracability» qualifies the shale gas in terms of propensity to develop a stimulated reservoir volume (srv) in combination with hydraulic fractures that have the desired geometry and sustainable conductivity  the geomechanical indicators characterizing the fracability include: the likelihood of reactivation of natural fracture networks, the horizontal stress contrast on one side and stress contrast in vertical plane on the other side, the ratio of unconfined compressive strength to the maximum in situ stress, the elastic stiffness matrix and its anisotropy, and the brinell hardness  the fracability is evaluated by plotting the geomechanical indicators on a radar chart graduated between low to high srv quality limits that are defined on the light of past total’s experience with shale gas | 
1933458-ms 	 application of real-time reservoir navigation and high-definition electrical imaging services for enhanced well placement and optimal completion design |abstract    the denver-julesburg basin in northern colorado is an unconventional hydrocarbon play utilizing horizontal wells to access several targets, known locally as benches, including the niobrara b-chalk  the need to navigate and optimally place completion packers in the unconventional play with complex, laminated rock structure and sub-seismic faulting is important to effectively stimulate reservoir rock for increasing production potential  while bulk gamma is primarily used to correlate the formation, more-advanced real-time logging-while-drilling (lwd) technology is proposed to navigate effectively and maintain the wellbore within the specific target chalk  high-resolution lwd electrical images are also employed to optimize the completion strategy and confirm real-time interpretation  this paper illustrates how real-time lwd information can be used to improve overall production by using this data-driven approach  an azimuthal gamma ray image was used to determine formation bed dip and stratigraphic complexity, along with two different resistivity measurements to correlate position within the reservoir  the data was transmitted in real time to a remote geo-steering center where a reservoir navigation engineer incorporated the data into the geological model and provided the operator with real-time steering recommendations for remaining within the zone of interest  in addition, the data were used to identify faults and interpret the fault-throw direction and distance  the well was drilled with 85% of the lateral section placed in a 10-ft-thick target zone, compared to fewer than 50% in offset wells navigating with gamma only  this was accomplished despite crossing over one sub-seismic fault and relative formation dips that varied from 88 to 92 degrees  the improved net-to-gross was a result of the utilization of azimuthal gamma, multiple propagation resistivity, and the real-time reservoir navigation service (rns)  the increased “in-zone” footage indicated this method provided a significant advantage over gamma-only measurements when navigating such complex and faulted formations  post-well, the high-resolution lwd electrical image logs were used to confirm the faults and determine packer placement for optimal completion efficiency  this lesson learnt can be applied to most unconventional plays around the world | 
1934195-ms 	 sequence stratigraphy, geomechanics, microseismicity, and geochemistry relationships in unconventional resource shales |abstract    cyclical sedimentation patterns are common in unconventional resources shales, whether they be carbonate- or siliciclastic-dominated  in many resource shales the cyclical patterns have been related to eustatic sea level fluctuations, even though these fluctuations may sometimes be obscured by tectonic overprint  the cyclicity is reflected in repetitive sedimentation patterns which represent alternating relatively shallow/oxic- and deeper/anoxic-water deposition  typical cyclicity might occur in the form of alternating clay/organic-rich and quartz/calcite-rich strata  in more carbonate-rich sequences, organic-rich marls might alternate with organic-poor limestones  this cyclicity can occur at a variety of stratigraphic scales and provides a sequence stratigraphic framework for mapping, correlation, and interpretations  incised valley fill may provide a localized, thicker, more organic-rich stratigraphic section (‘sweet spot’), than adjacent areas    within the context of geomechanics, these cyclical strata are termed ‘brittle-ductile couplets’  using the barnett and woodford shales as examples, clay/organic-rich intervals tend to be relatively ductile (relatively low young’s modulus and high poisson’s ratio) and cleaner quartz/calcite-rich intervals tend to be relatively brittle (relatively high young’s modulus and low poisson’s ratio  in carbonate-rich deposits such as the eagle ford formation, re-crystallized, toc-poor limestones tend to be stronger and more brittle than toc-rich marls    within the context of microseismic, microseisms may be vertically stratified or layered, with some horizons containing more events than other horizons  this stratification has been related to brittle-ductile couplets in at least one area, and placed within a sequence stratigraphic framework    within the context of geochemistry, ductile strata tend to contain more toc, and are thus better potential hc source rocks, than brittle strata, which contain less toc  biomarkers (geochemical fingerprints) are useful for interpreting sources and environments of deposition of organic matter, and ultimately used for environmental zonation of shales    using these principles and observations, it is possible to build a sequence stratigraphic framework from multiple data sets to map and correlate brittle and ductile strata, organic-/hydrocarbon-rich zones, and more fracturable stratigraphic intervals  a suggested horizontal landing zone is the brittle strata within a brittle-ductile couplet  it is hypothesized that when hydraulically fractured, both brittle and ductile strata become fractured, and hydrocarbons move from the ductile to the brittle zone, whose fractures remain open after proppant emplacement  with time, ductile strata may close around the proppant and become sealed | 
1934272-ms 	 efficient completions in anisotropic shale gas formations |summary    hydraulic fracturing is crucial to geothermal and hydrocarbon recovery  this process creates new fractures and reactivates existing natural fractures forming a highly conductive stimulated reservoir volume (srv) around the borehole  the fracturing process of anisotropic rocks such as shales is examined through this report  we divide the rock anisotropy into two groups: a) conventional and b) unconventional (shaly) anisotropy  as the first group, we study two extreme rock types: 1) lyons sandstone, a brittle, low porosity and permeability, weakly anisotropic (11%) material and 2) pyrophyllite, a strongly anisotropic (19%) metamorphic rock similar chemically and mechanically to shale with extremely low porosity and permeability  as the second group, shale samples (18% anisotropy) from wolfcamp formation are studied  the calcite filled veins are observed to be mostly subparallel to the fabric direction  brazilian tests are carried out to observe the fracture initiation and propagation under tension  strain gauges and acoustic emission (ae) sensors record the deformation leading to and during failure  sem imaging and surface profilometry are employed to study the post-failure fracture system and failed surface topology  fracture permeability is measured as a function of effective stress  the effect of anisotropy on fracturing is also investigated by rotating the fabric direction of the sample disks relative to the loading axis through increments of 15 degrees    the rock microstructure, lamination, and brittleness control the activation of the layers  lyons sandstone shows a wide brittle fracture with larger process zone with twice as much layer activation at lower stress levels  the fracturing process in shale is however a coupled function of rock fabric and calcite veins  the veins easily activate at 15 degrees orientation with respect to the loading axis at 30% of the original failure load  the resulting unpropped fracture has enhanced permeability by orders of magnitude  the findings of this research bring new insights toward an economic and efficient completion design  fracking through a deviated well reduces the breakdown pressure significantly and activates a large number of veins with enhanced conductivity without the need for proppant injection | 
1935073-ms 	 an exploration workflow to improve success rate in prospecting in unconventional emerging plays |abstract    we have developed and applied a workflow for the initial exploration of source rock potential as unconventional reservoirs utilizing pre-existing limited data sets  the method uses a multi-disciplinary work-scope in several phases allowing for a broad evaluation of the key success factors for a source rock in a selected project area  the methodology is designed to establish an initial baseline of understanding of key production drivers such as charge, maturity, reservoir quality, completion quality, structure, geomechanic properties and fluids    the baseline is achieved by integrating core, log and seismic data in an initial 3d depth model that can be utilized for calibrating a petroleum system evaluation leading to the generation of play fairway maps and an initial resource in place estimate  a further phase provides an economic viability assessment and cost expectations for exploitation of the unconventional source rock  the method provides the necessary support for key decisions including planning of pilot well locations, and an associated data acquisition strategy including core collection, logging programs and optimization of future seismic programs  by combining information from the play fairway mapping with representative petroleum engineering estimates it is possible to provide probabilistic estimates of economically recoverable resource volumes in each assessment unit and use this analysis to establish whether there is an opportunity for economically viable production within the study area    a strong emphasis is placed on rapidly integrating the available existing data in order to support the decision making process  from a number of examples around the world we have seen data quality and quantity vary tremendously and have adapted the workflow and scope for each project accordingly  the type of data commonly retrieved and utilized includes 2d seismic data, occasionally 3d conventional narrow azimuth seismic surveys, and vintage log suites for petrophysical calibration, occasionally core data, temperature gradients, organic information and literature from basin characterization studies    a number of these studies have been conducted or are in progress  however the authors will focus on the results of a study in north africa to demonstrate the value of the methodology in rapidly and positively impacting the decision making process |

2014-1305 	 modeling orthorhombic velocity perturbations around salt domes in the gulf of mexico |summary  in recent years, many efforts have been dedicated to improving the imaging of complex subsurface structures  alongside better velocity models, more accurate migration algorithms and multiple attenuation techniques, new wide-azimuth seismic acquisition schemes aim at improving our ability to image steeply dipping and overhanging salt-bodies, as well as sub-salt reflectors  these applications have converged towards the joint application of wide azimuthal ray-coverage and imaging algorithms running on anisotropic velocity models (zdraveva et al , 2012)  as the complexity of the velocity model increases, so does the task of attaining all parameters involved in describing such a model, and due to the intrinsic limitations of the imaging process, this cannot be achieved by velocity analysis of appropriate seismic gathers alone   expanding the work of sengupta, et al  (2008, 2009) and bachrach, et al  (2008), we aim at incorporating additional constraints into velocity models, which arise from the expected geomechanical conditions for subsurface sediments lying in the vicinity of salt bodies  these are not incorporated a priori, but by simulating and solving for the particular geomechanical characteristics of their natural settings and the manner in which these would imprint themselves over the velocity field  ultimately, this process should result in improved images of salt flanks and sub-salt reflectors, as well as increase the fidelity of seismic amplitudes  in this paper, we take a first step in this direction and show that geomechanically-derived orthorhombic velocity predictions are consistent with wide-azimuth anisotropic seismic data observations in the gulf of mexico |

2014-1481 	 a robust method for determining moment tensors from surface microseismic data |summary  we present a new method to determine moment tensors using surface microseismic imaging  the method involves the projection of data onto each moment tensor component, and using the amplitudes at the source origin time and location as an estimate of the seismic moment tensor  the procedure combines both precise source location and source characterization, and is known as moment tensor microseismic imaging (mtmi) (chambers et al , in press)  we compare the moment tensor results obtained using this method with those from a standard least squares inversion  we investigate the relative performance of the two approaches using synthetic data computed for two commonly observed microseismic source types, and a variety of signal to noise ratios (snrs)  mtmi proves to be significantly more robust at low snrs  moreover, we demonstrate a simple denoising technique that further increases our ability to determine the moment tensor in the presence of high noise | 
2014-1530 	 overburden geomechanical effects on 4d seismic response – influences of stiffness contrast, anisotropy and geometry |summary  petroleum production and co2 storage induce effective stress changes and deformations in the reservoir, as well as in the overburden  this may be detected by 4d seismic monitoring due to the stress-sensitivity of the seismic velocities in the rocks  here we address how stiffness contrast between the reservoir rock and the overburden, reservoir inclination, and overburden rock anisotropy may affect changes in two-way seismic travel time, based on laboratory measured stress-sensitivity of wave velocities in rock specimens and field scale geomechanical modeling   introduction  pore pressure changes caused by reservoir depletion or inflation by fluid injection lead to stress changes within the reservoir and in the surrounding rocks  resulting effective stress changes will alter the seismic properties of the rocks involved (hornby, 1998; sayers, 2002; prioul et al , 2004; ciz & shapiro, 2009)  this makes time lapse seismic an important tool to monitor subsurface alterations (e g , landro 2001) and thereby improving recovery or storage capacity by optimal placement of new wells  since seismic waves propagate twice through usually very thick overburden, overburden changes become significant and have to be understood in order to properly interpret 4d seismic data (kenter et al , 2004; hatchell & bourne, 2005; fj<u+00e6>r & kristiansen, 2009; herwanger & home, 2009)   subsurface stress alterations induced by pore pressure changes are primarily related to the geometry (shape and orientation) of the depleted / inflated volume, and to rock mechanical properties of the reservoir and its surroundings  in this work we address how elastic contrast in stiffness between the reservoir rock and the overburden, rock anisotropy, and the inclination of the reservoir influence the stress changes, and furthermore how the seismic two-way travel time (twt) is influenced  additional influence associated with rock heterogeneity and non-elastic effects (plastic deformation, faulting / fault reactivation) is not considered in this paper | 
2014-1646 	 toc and fracture characterization of the barnett shale with predicted gamma ray and density porosity volumes |summary   conventional hydrocarbons reserves in the usa have gradually been reduced, and with the rising of oil prices, the sight of energy companies is on unconventional reservoirs  the barnett shale is one of the most important unconventional reservoirs in the usa  it has been a challenge in unconventional reservoirs to find the petrophysical properties which can be used as a proxy to toc  current explorers are using gr and density porosity as a proxy in unconventional reservoirs    in barnett shale gamma ray plays a significant role  in this unconventional reservoir, when the shale has higher content of quartz the gamma ray values are low  the higher percentage of quartz makes it more brittle  whereas, when the organic content, which occur with radioactive material is high, the gamma ray values are high  in shales including woodford and eagleford, the density of the shales decreases when the toc is high in the shale  here, we have tried to estimate these properties in 3d volumes, as well as correlate it to production    we have used 19 wells with gamma ray in the neural network training which are also correlated with pre-stack simultaneous seismic inversion volumes and other seismic attributes correlatable to lithology  the same process was used with the density porosity (which was manually calculated for every well) | 
2014-1679 	 brittleness evaluation of resource plays by integrating petrophysics and seismic analysis |summary  the main considerations for well plan and hydraulic fracturing in the conventional plays include 1) the amount of total organic carbon (toc) and 2) how much hydrocarbon can be extracted  brittleness is the direct measurement of a formation about the ability to create avenues for hydrocarbons when suffering to hydraulic fracturing  usually brittleness is estimated from 1) laboratory stress-strain measurements 2) rock properties and 3) mineral contents analysis using well logs  however well log based brittleness only shows the properties near the borehole when the amount of wells or log type is limited, resulting a two dimensional result  in this paper, we proposed a workflow to estimate brittleness of shale plays in three dimension at seismic scale by integrating the rock properties from petrophysics and seismic analysis  the workflow begins by brittleness evaluation using well logs at the borehole location  then we prestack invert the fidelity preserved seismic gather to generate rock property volumes  at last we integrate brittleness estimation from seismic and petrophysics analysis where the petrophysics result serves as the bench mark  we apply our workflow to a survey acquired over fort worth basin, tx, usa where eight wells locate in this survey  the brittleness estimation from seismic analysis shows high correlation to that from petrophysics analysis at the seismic scale | 
2014-6937 	 stress change investigation during polymer-augmented waterflooding in channeled reservoirs |abstract   waterflooding is by far the most widely used method to increase oil recovery; however, it is less effective in heterogonous channelized reservoirs because injected water move easily to channels and left behind most oil unswept  polymer augmented waterflooding is a technique by which recovery is enhanced in heterogonous channelized reservoirs  injected polymer improves conformance hence recovery by diverting flooded water into unswept portion of the reservoirs  the stress change due to polymer adsorption could be significant and need to be accounted    in this study, implicit in pressure and explicit in both saturation and polymer concentration (impes), finite difference numerical simulation was formulated and implemented  the implemented approach is used to study the performance of polymer augmented waterflooding by varying relevant reservoir and well parameters  both homogenous and channel dominated heterogonous reservoir permeability cases were considered with more emphasis on channeled cases  a langmuir adsorption as a function of polymer concentration was used to account for the irreversible adsorption of polymer during flooding  the effect of polymer adsorption on mobility and permeability was accounted for by a viscosity adjustment and residual resistance factor formulae  the stress change created as a result of polymer adsorption and pore pressure change is accounted by explicitly calculating the stress after pressure is computed from the fluid flow simulator in each iteration    from the cases considered in this study, both permeability reduction due to stress change and adsorption of polymer has considerable influence on oil recovery  hence it is recommended to investigate these effects for any reservoirs (especially for more stress sensitive reservoirs) during screening and implementation of polymer flooding | 
2014-6949 	 micro-macro modeling approach for the triggering of viscous fatigue damage in halite polycrystals under cyclic loading |abstract  underground cavities in salt rock formations used for compressed air energy storage (caes) undergo cyclic loads and are subject to a fatigue phenomenon that induces a decrease of rock’s strength and stiffness  a micromechanical analysis of this phenomenon is necessary to understand its mechanisms and elaborate relevant constitutive models  the polycrystalline nature of rock salt has a crucial effect on crack propagation and rock damage and, hence, on fatigue behavior  this behavior was investigated herein on the basis of self consistent upscaling approaches for viscous heterogeneous materials  the internal stresses in the polycrystal were modeled based on experimental data available for halite single crystals, and a monotonic compression test was simulated, which allowed tracking the triggering of fatigue damage  results show that tensile stresses are developed in the polycrystal under global compressive load, the amplitude of which depends on the macroscopic load rate or frequency  these tensile stresses can exceed in some conditions the tensile strength of grains or of grains interfaces and cause cracking and damage in the polycrystal | 
2014-6952 	 action of fully grouted rock bolts with pull-and-shear loading |abstract  the shear loading performance of fully grouted rock bolts is presented  a new experimental method, two types of rock bolts (d-bolt and rebar), joint gap opening effect, and three types of host rock material were conducted  the bolts have similar loading capacity whilst the loading angle has obvious influence on the deformation capacity of the d-bolt  the maximum total failure displacement of the d-bolt decreases from 140 mm (0°) to 70 mm (40°, 60°, and 90°), whereas that of the rebar keeps a smooth increase from 29 to 53 mm  the deformation capacity of the d-bolt is 270%–50%larger than that of the rebar with increasing loading angle  the bolt has a larger deformation capacity in comparatively soft rock than in hard rock  a slight increase trend of failure load with a decrease of rock strength can be observed with 90° loading angle  the bolt subjected to 60° or 90° loading is much stiffer  the total stiffness of the bolting system is contributed mainly by shear component as the stiffness in shear direction rises significantly from 20° to 90°  the displacement capacity of the bolts increased with the joint gap | 
2014-6959 	 using microstructure descriptors to model thermo-mechanical damage and healing in salt rock |abstract|creep processes in halite (salt rock) include glide, cross-slip, diffusion and dynamic recrystallization  diffusive mass transfer (dmt) can result in crack rebonding, and mechanical stiffness recovery  on the one hand, viscoplastic laws relating creep microscopic processes to microstructure changes are empirical  on the other hand, theoretical models of damage and healing disconnect thermodynamic variables from their physical meaning  the proposed model enriches the framework of continuum damage mechanics (cdm) with fabric descriptors  in order to infer the form of fabric tensors from microstructure observation, creep tests were carried out on granular salt under constant stress and humidity conditions  a stress path comprising a tensile loading, a compressive unloading, a creep-healing stage and a reloading was simulated  macroscopic and microscopic model predictions highlight the increased efficiency of healing with time  a preliminary finite element model illustrates the impact of healing on the stress distribution in the excavation damage zone (edz)  the model presented in this paper is expected to improve the fundamental understanding of damage and healing in rocks at both macroscopic and microscopic levels, and the long-term assessment of geological storage facilities | 
2014-6962 	 impact of the loading stress variations on transport properties of granular packs |abstract  hydraulic fracturing is a well stimulation technique that makes the recoveries from the vast unconventional hydrocarbon resources in us economically feasible  proppants are granular materials that are injected into hydraulic fractures to keep them open following a fracturing treatment  hence, the proppant selection is of particular significance in petroleum industry  due to recent advances in imaging technologies and high-performance computing, estimation of the elastic and transport properties of proppant packs at different closure stresses using imaged-based simulations is a credible alternative to direct experiments  in this study, transport properties (permeability and inertial flow parameter) of a ceramic proppant pack exposed to varying loading stresses are calculated using lattice boltzmann (lb) model simulations  the images of this packing shows rearrangement of the packing structure, embedding of the grains at the rock wall, and crushing of individual proppants  lb simulation results of this packing show that the permeability and inertial flow parameter are less sensitive to stress variations before crushing of the grains occurs | 
2014-6964 	 a new method to determine pore compressibility |abstract  petroleum exploration and production from unconventional oil and gas resources have gained great momentum throughout the world to meet the ever increasing demand of energy  knowledge of geomechanical properties of target reservoirs ensures producing hydrocarbons from unconventional resources safely, environmental friendly, and economically  pore compressibility is one of key parameters in drilling and completion design  because the measurement of pore compressibility is time consuming and cost expensive, estimation of pore compressibility from other information sources is highly demanded  pore compressibility indirectly estimated from other aspects not only is a good reference for the direct measurement, but also is an important supplement in case no direct measurement is available  in this study, we developed a method to determine the pore compressibility using permeability experimental data  the comparison indicates that the pore compressibilities from the proposed method match with those from direct measurement  the combination of the proposed method with direct measurement can be employed to ensure the reliability of the direct measurement and to quantify the uncertainty resulting from instrumentation and human errors, irregular core plug, and/or non-uniform deformation | 
2014-6967 	 a micromechanical model for ductile porous composites with debonding damage |abstract  this paper is devoted to micromechanical modeling of the overall elastoplastic behavior and damage evolution in clayey rocks  the studied material is composed of a porous matrix which is embedded by linear elastic mineral inclusions  the solid phase of porous matrix is described by a pressure sensitive plastic model with a non associated flow rule  with a two-level homogenization procedure, the macroscopic plastic criterion of the heterogeneous material is deduced and takes into account effects of pores and mineral inclusions  then it is assumed that the material damage is related to progressive debonding of mineral inclusions  the weibull's statistical function is used to describe the varying probability of inclusion debonding  finally, the proposed micro-macro model is applied to describe the macroscopic behavior of a typical clayey rock  comparisons between the numerical results and experimental data show that the proposed model is able to capture the main features of the mechanical behavior of the studied material | 
2014-6968 	 experimental study on permeability of a porous limestone under compressive stress |abstract  this paper presents experimental investigations on mechanical behaviour and permeability of a porous limestone  hydrostatic and triaxial compressive tests with permeability measurement have been performed under drained condition  permeability is measured along the axial direction  the results permit to identify two basic plastic mechanisms: plastic shear and pore collapse, and to characterize the effects on permeability  under low confining pressure, permeability reduction is controlled by the deviatoric stress in elastic phase; after the onset of plastic shear, the deviatoric stress induces plastic dilatation and enhanced permeability; when the deviatoric stress reaches the peak strength, or the shear bands are formed, the permeability decreases slightly  under high confining pressure, permeability reduction is also controlled by the deviatoric stress before pore collapse; after the onset of pore collapse, the deviatoric stress induces plastic compaction and weakens permeability; when the deviatoric stress reaches the onset of plastic shear, two plastic mechanisms are competitive, the permeability decreases continuously but with a reduced rate; finally, the plastic shear dominates the plastic mechanism and the permeability may not increase due to pore collapse  generally, these works show that the evolution of mechanical behaviour and permeability is directly related to plastic mechanisms: plastic shear and pore collapse | 
2014-6972 	 new application of rebound hardness numbers to generate logging of unconfined compressive strength in laminated shale formations |abstract  this study explores the application of an equotip hardness tester (eht) to unconventional shale formations for the purpose of estimating unconfined compressive strength (ucs) and further developing the logging of ucs derived by the eht  this application of eht overcomes the limitation of intact core recovery required for preparation of test specimens with standardized geometry for traditional rock mechanics laboratory tests where laminations in shale often prevent test specimen preparation  the eht can measure the rebound hardness numbers (rhn’s) to estimate ucs on the surfaces of both intact and laminated/cracked cores  initial validation of the process was performed using aluminum specimens with six different lengths  extensive rhn’s measurements and ucs tests were conducted to develop new empirical equations for conversion of rhn’s to ucs  the ucs log estimated by rhn’s can be used to further calibrate petrophysical models and contribute to frac design by discriminating fracable zones and frac barriers | 
2014-6973 	 interpreting post-injection acoustic emission in laboratory hydraulic fracturing experiments |abstract  this paper presents data from laboratory scale hydraulic fracturing experimentation with acoustic emission (ae) monitoring  the motivation is firstly to confirm existence of the post-injection surge in the ae rate observed by other investigators  secondly, unlike previous investigations, a re-pressurization stage is included to test whether ae is driven by the interaction of the two hydraulic fracture surfaces as they contact one another during the closure period that follows an injection-shut in cycle  our results show that the ae rate indeed increases when the pressure is relieved after the first injection/propagation stage  however, re-opening the fracture through a second pressurization and allowing it to close again proved unsuccessful in causing a second increase in the ae rate  instead, the ae rate is observed to decay hyperbolically with the time from the first moment of pressure relief with no impact from the second injection/closure stage  this hyperbolic decay in ae rate is in accordance with omori’s law, that is, it is statistically similar to earthquake aftershocks  the ae in our laboratory experiments were therefore apparently not associated with closure but rather to the somewhat surprising propensity of the rock to produce ae aftershocks from the vicinity of a hydraulic fracture under zero-loading conditions during the hours to days following its creation |

2014-6977 	 a fully coupled model for caprock sealing efficiency |abstract|the sealing integrity of a suitable low permeability caprock is one of the most important issues to the safety of long-term co2 sequestration in a saline aquifer over long geological time periods  from the microscopic viewpoint, caprocks contain microcracks which make caprocks anisotropic in mechanical and hydraulic properties  additionally, the growth of microcracks could lead to permeability increasing exponentially, which extremely harms caprock sealing efficiency  to assess caprock sealing efficiency accurately, a fully coupled model should include caprock deformation, two-phase flow, co2 sorption and damage evolution of caprocks  the purpose of this paper is to present such a model for investigating caprock sealing efficiency  firstly, a conceptual model is proposed for the co2/water flow in a caprocks with microcracks  in this model co2/water flow is described by two-phase flow equation with variable porosity and permeability  this provides a solid basis to the further development of numerical simulations for the caprock sealing efficiency assessment  finally, this fully coupled mathematical model is applied to a caprock layer to investigate the combined effect of fully coupling processes on the caprock sealing efficiency  model results demonstrate that the damage effects on the caprock sealing efficiency are significant | 
2014-6978 	 stability of jointed rock slopes subjected to obliquely incident p waves |abstract  conventional stability analysis of rock slopes during earthquakes is often confined to vertically propagated ground motions  one of the main reasons for the limitation is due to the lack of a rational yet simple way to apply an input motion of a specific incident angle  in this study a method of ground motion input was implemented for this application in analyzing a jointed rock slope  in a nutshell, it involved extending a problem domain by wrapping it with an elastic region and converting the incident waves into nodal forces in addition to make a boundary non-reflecting  the approach is general, but here only the plane strain problem was tackled and thus only two dimensional p-wave was considered  a jointed rock is defined by an elastic modulus, a poisson ratio, the joint orientations and the strength of the joints  a 1:1 jointed rock slope of 30 m in height was used as the base rock slope  an el centro record of 1979 was employed as the base ground motion  three incident angles were considered in the analysis  results obtained indicated that incident angles do have a significant impact on the stability of a jointed rock slope, and the severity of the impact depended on the relative orientation of the incident wave with respect to that of the joints |

2014-6995 	 crack propagation from a surface assisted by fluid pressure and cooling |abstract  the propagation of a single fluid-filled fracture from the surface of a semi-infinite isotropic elastic solid, subjected to both a transient temperature field and a constant source fluid pressure that is less than the confining stress, is studied using a boundary element method  fluid flow in fractures is described by the lubrication equation, while the local pressure is determined by the strong coupling between elastic deformation, heat conduction and fluid pressure  numerical results show that the combination of cooling-induced tensile stress and the source pressure can enhance the propagation speed  parametric studies are carried out for identifying speed regimes and show the importance of the initial fracture aperture  three speed regimes are found to exist  if the fluid penetration into the fracture is heavily restricted, the fracture length grows exponentially at early time, and then it suddenly reaches a large speed and progressively decelerates in a finite transition time as fluid diffusion speed varies, but eventually it follows the exponential fracture growth curve at a higher index for stable fluid flow in high-permeability fractures  the time-dependent crack growth behavior does not show any signs of unstable growth, even in the high-speed transition regime  the predictions of crack growth kinetics show a good agreement with some published experimental results and highlight the stabilizing effect of fluid transport on crack growth | 
2014-6997 	 a simplified model of local fracture processes to investigate the structural stability and design of large-scale tabular mine layouts |abstract  the stable and safe mining of deep tabular excavations is an ongoing problem of considerable technical and economic interest requiring an understanding of the interactions between local rock failure processes (metre scale), the structural impact of the overall layout shape (tens to hundreds of metres in scale) and the regional mobilization of geological structures (kilometer scale)  in this paper, a limit equilibrium model is used to simulate local on-reef fracture processes that may also exhibit time-dependent failure characteristics  the traditional energy release rate design criterion (err) is re-interpreted as a metric of extraction sequence stability by including explicit energy dissipation mechanisms in the computational framework  a desirable feature of the limit equilibrium model outlined here is that it provides an explicit representation of the extent of the fracture zone near the edges of a tabular excavation that is responsive to regional stiffness variations induced by individual mining pattern configurations  the model is illustrated by considering the extraction of a raise connection through a pillar and by observing the implications of mining rate changes at one edge of a parallel-sided panel on released energy values  | 
2014-7002 	 case study of the impact of prior cavern abandonment on long-term oil storage at a strategic petroleum reserve site |abstract  this paper presents a case study of the effect of an abandoned cavern of large diameter on the long-term stability of an oil storage facility in domal salt  the u s  strategic petroleum reserve stores crude oil in solution-mined caverns in the bryan mound salt dome, located near freeport, texas  an additional 400-m diameter cavern, cavern 3, was constructed for brine production and storage in the 1940s and plugged and abandoned in 1980  surface subsidence measurements show an unexpectedly larger subsidence rate over cavern 3 than the rest of the site, possibly indicating that this cavern may be losing pressure, which would affect boreholes for nearby storage caverns  this paper evaluates the current status of cavern 3 using subsidence data from site-wide surveys and gps and tiltmeters installed over the cavern, and large-scale computational analyses including realistic cavern geometries and the effects of heterogeneous salt creep properties  next, it describes a surface subsidence evaluation plan to analyze current surface subsidence data, in addition to possibly obtaining other available information such as insar data, to monitor future subsidence on a continuous basis  finally, the paper will use the case study to discuss the formation of a strategy for abandoning decommissioned caverns in a long-term storage facility built in domal salt | 
2014-7004 	 assessing waviness from televiewer for incorporation within defect plane shear strength models |abstract  roughness at varying scales is an important component of the shear strength of discontinuities  small scale roughness can be assessed in drillcore and through laboratory testing of drillcore derived samples  large scale roughness, or waviness, also plays an important part in peak shear strength and a number of methods for its incorporation into defect plane strength models are presented    a number of methods for capturing waviness data from exposed faces are reviewed  a method is presented for deriving waviness from downhole televiewer data, which is shown to be significantly more accurate than structural data derived from core logging  the method is based on work undertaken in the highly anisotropic bedded units of the hamersley province, western australia where televiewer surveys are routinely undertaken  values of waviness are derived through a review of variation in dip resolved in the direction of the slope face  this method allows design engineers to incorporate large scale roughness in defect plane shear strengths at the design stage |

2014-7008 	 laboratory approach to the study of dynamic and static bulk anisotropy in rock under high hydrostatic pressure by simultaneous p, s sounding and sample deformation measurements on spheres |abstract  this contribution will examine the design and capabilities of a new measuring system, specifically a high-pressure vessel, which not only enables ultrasonic sounding of rock samples by means of longitudinal p waves, but also by two perpendicularly polarized shear waves on spherical samples under hydrostatic pressures up to 100 mpa  the advantage of our approach is that it allows for the simultaneous measurement of p, s1 and s2 wave velocity propagation in 132 independent directions throughout the entire sphere (except the sphere poles)  this new system was designed and constructed to enable the use of movable shear wave transducers (transmitter/receiver) in oil under confining stress  the same high-pressure measuring system enables the measurement of sample deformation in the points of p-wave ultrasonic sounding up to 400 mpa, what enables that mutual dependence between static and dynamic rock parameters to be studied  data obtained will enable the calculation of many important seismic parameters like elastic anisotropy, crack presence and orientation, crack density tensor, their directional changes and closure under pressure, elastic wave attenuation and finally, full elastic stiffness tensor at different values of hydrostatic pressure  a laboratory approach based on this new high-pressure system enables the study of rock dynamic and static bulk moduli under different values of hydrostatic pressure | 
2014-7009 	 improved lab tests for cavern design |abstract|the knowledge of the thermo-mechanical and hydraulically material behaviour of the in-situ rock salt is a main as-sumption to proof the static stability and tightness of salt caverns  the conduction of the material behaviour needed for the numeri-cal design is essentially determined by results, taken from lab tests which are performed at rock salt specimens  state of the art is to conduct temperature controlled uniaxial and triaxial short term test to analyze the strength of the rock salt, temperature controlled uniaxial and triaxial creep tests to analyze the rheological material behaviour and temperature controlled triaxial permeability tests to analyze the hydraulically material behaviour  due to the demand of an increasing economical optimization of gas storage caverns as well as the installation of high performance storage caverns and compressed air energy storage caverns advanced lab tests are needed to characterize the material behaviour under extreme loading conditions  regarding to an operation pattern with cyclic turnover, decreasing cavern inside pressure levels, increasing pressure rates and for example the “blow out” load case the aim of the present article is to explain improved lab tests, suitable to increase the performance and availability of storage caverns | 
2014-7010 	 challenges in defining fracture gradient for highly deviated wells in the presence of natural fractures in deepwater environments |abstract  the fracture gradient (fg) can differ significantly from the least principal stress (i e , shmin), estimated as fracture closure pressure from extended leak-off tests (xlots) and micro- or mini-frac tests  fg may instead be derived from fracture initiation pressure (fip), or from the pressure required for the fluid to leak off through conductive natural fractures  in this study, we present data from a deep-water gas field in australia  we modeled shmin from leak-off tests (lot), extended (x)lot, minifrac, and injectivity tests in 12 offset wells using both log-based poro-elastic and effective stress ratio models  we constrained the remaining components of the stress tensor using a range of field data  the geomechanical model was verified using field observations of borehole breakouts  we calculated the fip and its variation with borehole trajectory  this method showed that fip could be smaller than shmin for certain well trajectories  in those cases, when equivalent circulating density (ecd) is higher than fip but smaller than shmin, near-wellbore induced fractures could cause partial losses  when fip <u+2265> shmin, if ecd exceeds fip or fracture linkup pressures, total loss would occur, causing the risk of lost circulation to elevate  we additionally used the mohr-coulomb sliding criterion to identify the population of fractures in the reservoir most susceptible to shear failure  the results indicated that fractures with dips of 50-70° that strike approximately ne-sw may become critically stressed with slightly overbalanced wellbore pressure during drilling and therefore may develop into pathways for fluid loss  the results of this study led to revisions of the planned well trajectories because of the risk of fluid losses into critically stressed natural fractures, as well as the variation of the fip relative to shmin with respect to wellbore trajectory | 
2014-7012 	 micromechanics of isochoric salt deformation |abstract  a repository for heat-generating nuclear waste provides an engineering challenge far beyond general experience  long-term evolution of repository performance is precluded from direct observation or measurement  therefore, analogues and long-term predictions are necessary to establish enduring safety functions  accurate prediction of salt repository response is enhanced by a thorough understanding of the mechanistic processes and application of valid models  in the instance of a salt formation providing the host medium, the scientific community has made great strides toward formulating and using models that capture observed physical phenomena in computational mechanics applications  for example, strain rates are often cast as functions of stress difference and temperature because salt deformation under repository conditions has been shown to be very sensitive to these parameters  micromechanics help define appropriate relationships by virtue of a deformation mechanism map approach  incorporation of micromechanics helps explain history effects, normal transient response, inverse transients, and dependence of creep rate on stress difference and temperature, which are a direct consequence of existing and evolving substructures   if one understands the physical processes then predictions can be made with greater confidence  a viable constitutive model should therefore provide a reasonable approximation of laboratory results and reflect the physical processes that account for deformation  laboratory studies facilitate measurement of generic mechanical, thermal, hydrological, and chemical salt properties in a controlled environment  a large body of laboratory data has been generated on salt deformation, which describes phenomenology of salt across a range of temperatures expected in a heat-generating waste disposal system  microstructural studies described here can be used to develop and interpret input parameters for models that predict material behavior  this overview emphasizes empirical evidence of isochoric deformation processes in salt and supports engineering and long-term performance evaluation of repositories for heat-generating nuclear waste | 
2014-7014 	 3d analysis and engineering design of pulsed fracturing in shale gas reservoirs |abstract  ability to induce complex, highly connected fracture networks, that can remain open during production, is the key to unlock permeability challenged shale gas plays  within the time and pressure scale of hydraulic fracturing operations, it is difficult to create fracture complexity in ductile shales  however, when subjected to a high rate/pulse loading, rock might exhibit a brittle to ductile transition and a complex fracture network might be created  along these lines, the concept of pulsed fracturing, that customizes the pressure-time behavior of a pulse source to create multiple fractures, is introduced  in this paper, an integrated 3d model that quantifies fracture initiation, growth, and coalescence due to initial and post-peak pulse loading is presented  the simulation involves a numerical algorithm that couples tensile/shear/compactive failure algorithms with dynamic fracture propagation and pore fluid pressure  geomechanical modeling approach makes it possible to optimize pulsed fracturing for different shale plays  after constitutive model description and presentation of key aspects of the model, the model is employed to a reservoir dataset to evaluate pulsed fracturing as an alternative fracturing technique  the results show that, if designed accurately, pulsed fracturing could help trigger a ductile to brittle transition and can generate complex fracture networks | 
2014-7017 	 impact of discrete fracture network (dfn) reactivation on productive stimulated rock volume: microseismic, geomechanics and reservoir coupling |abstract|in the absence of natural fractures, hydraulic fractures can open against the minimum principal stress and propagate along continuously through the formation  however, field observations and microseismic (ms) activity suggest that, natural fractures can reactivate upon stimulation: forming complex/sheared discrete fracture networks (dfns)  current industry practice primarily utilizes ms events alone to determine the extent of reactivation within a dfn and consequently the stimulated rock volume (srv)  however, ms activity does not necessarily distinguish between dry (i e  reactivation with non-conductive fractures) vs  wet events (i e  reactivation with conductive fractures)  indeed, wet events are most likely to contribute towards a productive-srv as these conductive fractures have an increased chance to remain open during production  this paper presents a series of geomechanical sensitivity analysis that quantify the difference between fracture events within the framework of a complex discrete fracture network simulator coupled with fluid flow and fracture reactivation  our results show that the extent of productive-srv is controlled primarily by a combination of reservoir, geomechanical and stimulation parameters  these parameters include: dfn geometry (e g  patterns, spacing, density, and orientation), stress anisotropy/isotropy, frictional strength, the duration of stimulation, and the number of stages  results are further coupled with an unconventional reservoir simulator to quantify ultimate recovery/production for different scenarios  this integrated study/workflow provides guidelines in the field to optimize stimulation operations and to better interpret microseismic field data 'ep | 
2014-7021 	 modeling of stress-induced permeability change with progressive damage in intact rock using a micro-mechanical approach |abstract  permeability evolution in intact rock as a result of micro-crack propagation is fundamental in understanding fluid flow within the excavation damage zone (edz) around underground openings  a 2d grain-based discrete element method incorporating voronoi joint model is used to simulate the permeability evolution with progressive damage in intact rock when it is subjected to incremental mechanical loading  the rock response during uniaxial and triaxial loadings is simulated with and without taking into account the hydro-mechanical interactions between fluid and solid part of the rock  the numerical experiment results show that when modeling the rock behavior under compression, ignoring the coupled damage-flow processes results in an inaccurate prediction of mechanical properties of rock such as the peak strength and the post-peak response  the stress-strain response of the sample indicates that an increase in the applied confining stresses increases both the strain hardening range and the peak strength  in addition, the permeability of models during triaxial loading increases by up to 2 5 orders of magnitude prior to rupture of rock  progressive development of fractures as a result of crack accumulation leads to over 3 orders of magnitude increase in post-failure permeability compared to the permeability at the peak stress  these changes have been reported from laboratory testing results as well as in-situ permeability measurements carried out in the damaged zones in tunnel boundary  it has been demonstrated that voronoi joint model incorporated in a dem-based code has capability to simulate stress-induced permeability change in the brittle rocks as a result of processes such as initiation, propagation, and accumulation of cracks | 
2014-7022 	 a new method to determine biot coefficients of bakken samples |abstract  in recent years, the development of oil and gas from shale has proceeded quickly in the world due to the application of multi-stage fracturing technology in horizontal wells  it is imperative to study the poroelastic characteristics of the rock for modeling the performance of rock under in-situ conditions, thus ensuring the success of hydraulic fracturing  biot's coefficient is one of the key poroelastic parameters for calculating the effective stress for creating artificial fractures in the shale formations  in this study, we propose anew method to measure the biot's coefficient  our method simplified the measuring procedures to obtain the biot's coefficient by controlling the confining pressure, which isused to maintain the volume of the sample, while altering the pore pressure  shales amples recovered form bakken formation in willistion basin is tested using this method  the results of our experiments show that the biot's coefficient of bakken samples obtained from horizontal drilling and vertical drilling are significantly different from each other  this significant difference of biot's coefficient with different drilling-direction provides scientists and engineers a solid base for in-situ stress analysis during multi stage hydraulic fracturing and reservoir depletion due to production | 
2014-7027 	 comparison of evolutionary and static modeling of stresses around a salt dome: the importance of modeling the past |abstract  we compare an evolutionary to a static approach for modeling stress and deformation around a salt dome and we show that the two approaches predict different stress histories and very different strains within the adjacent wall rocks  significantly higher shear stresses develop during the evolutionary analysis near the base of a rising salt dome  in addition, the static approach is not able to capture the decrease in the minimum principal stress caused by the circumferential dome expansion  strains predicted by the evolutionary model are an order of magnitude higher than those predicted by the static model, and they show significant shearing in the horizontal plane  the evolutionary approach is performed using elfen, and the static using abaqus  overall, our results highlight that forward evolutionary modeling can capture the stress history of mudrocks close to salt domes, which can improve significantly predictions for material properties (porosity, anisotropy in velocities measurements), as well as pore pressures and shear/tensile strength | 
2014-7028 	 asymmetric hydraulic fracture mapping from tiltmeter data |abstract  hydraulic fracturing involves the initiation and propagation of fractures in rock formations by the injection of pressurized fluid to enhance oil and gas production or for mineral extraction  tiltmeters are often used in the process to monitor the generated fracture geometry by remotely measuring the fracture induced deformations  asymmetric fracture growth with respect to the borehole when not accounted for in the design of the hydraulic fractures can result in a section of rock mass being not effectively stimulated or preconditioned, depending on the purpose of the fracture treatment  the ability to predict asymmetric growth in hydraulic fracturing is therefore important  this paper focuses on a method to infer the existence of asymmetric fracture geometry from tiltmeter measurements  the forward model used in the analysis is based on the displacement discontinuity method and the bayesian inversion procedure is employed [1]  the forward model is developed from the analytical expression for computing the displacements and tilts due to a point source in an elastic half-space developed by okada [2]  the displacements and tilts due to a given fracture geometry are then obtained by numerical integration of this solution, by considering the point sources to be located at the quadrature points  to validate the method, mapping of asymmetric fractures having polygon and elliptical geometries is carried out using synthetic data sets  finally, the effect of the fracture asymmetry on the inverted results is also analysed  real data from a field site [3] where asymmetry was measured from intersections of the hydraulic fracture with offset boreholes has been analysed  preliminary results show that the procedure is able to satisfactorily predict fracture asymmetry from measured data when the fracture is relatively close to the tiltmeter array | 
2014-7029 	 numerical simulation of percussive drilling and challenges in its modification |abstract  in our research project a new numerical model of continuous percussive drilling is being examined, which is based on and more realistic than the previous okubo-nishimatsu’s model  this paper introduced the previous model and then laid out the items that need to be improved  to reproduce actual drilling phenomena, the previous simulation should be modified with adequate models of hydraulic circuits and equipment, realistic components, sleeve-type joints and a bit-rock interface  this paper focused on the modification of numerical models for elastic wave propagation and attenuation  the new models were composed of a piston, a shank rod, a rod and a joint  the acoustic impedance of the piston, shank rod and rod was set to the same values as actual products  a spring model for the joint was adopted in the calculation  the calculated waves were compared to the measured ones which did not have simple shape but had many small oscillations due to the complex shape of the piston and shank rod  to reproduce the oscillations, not only the acoustic impedance of the models but also the spring constants at the joint and collision needed to be appropriate values | 
2014-7031 	 customization of sepiolite based drilling fluids at high temperatures |abstract  selection of proper drilling fluid is recognized as a challenging process in high temperature environments  therefore, chemical and physical properties of drilling mud should be suitable at high temperatures to minimize mud and borehole instabilities  this study is aimed to characterize rheological and filtration properties of sepiolite based muds at high temperatures and to determine their plugging ability in permeable formations  mud samples were aged up to 204 °c temperature and tested with viscometer and hthp filter press  the filtration of sepiolite muds were customized through ceramic discs having various pore throat sizes using permeability plugging apparatus (ppa) that simulates more realistic borehole conditions  ppa experiments were conducted at temperatures up to 204 °c and 2070 kpa pressure differential  caco3 was used as a lost circulation pill   experimental results reveal that customized sepiolite mud is not flocculated up to 204 ° c and yields suitable filtration rates from hthp filter press  however, the fluid losses obtained from ppa were unacceptable  therefore, result from hthp filter press is not a decisive factor to select an effective mud  however, sepiolite muds with caco3 can effectively initiate the plugging phenomenon in relatively short time and give low fluid losses and extend the usage of caco3 as a loss circulation material | 
2014-7032 	 long-term behavior of salt caverns |abstract  four in-situ tests performed in salt caverns in france and germany are described  the main objective of these tests was to increase our understanding of the long-term behavior of abandoned caverns  it is proven that, in the long term, when cavern brine has reached thermal equilibrium with the rock mass, pressure evolution is governed by cavern creep closure and brine micropermeation through the cavern walls  an equilibrium pressure is reached when the closure rate exactly equals the permeation rate  in the shallow caverns described in this paper, equilibrium pressure is significantly lower than geostatic pressure, ruling out any risk of fracture onset at the cavern roof  interpretation of these tests allows salt permeability to be back-calculated | 
2014-7036 	 modeling of the mechanical and hydraulic behavior of salt rocks on a discontinuum-mechanical basis |abstract  the discontinuum-mechanical modeling of salt rocks enables us to take the microstructure of polycrystalline salt rocks into account explicitly within geomechanical simulations  on a micromechanical scale, rock salts constitute a discontinuum of intergrown salt crystals  the macroscopic behavior of this system is determined by the interaction of intra- and intercrystalline properties  essential processes like softening, fragmentation and pressure-driven percolation along grain boundaries can only be captured and explained physically by considering the microstructure of the material  constitutive models developed at the ifg, such as the visco-elasto-plastic model for the salt grains themselves and an adhesive frictional shear model for the interaction between the grains, are used to describe the mechanical behavior, while the hydraulic description of fluid percolation is realized using the cubic law for laminar flow  only after overcoming a percolation threshold the pressure-driven opening and interconnection of flow paths along grain boundaries is initiated in the salt rock and induces a directional percolation in the direction of the maximum principal stress  a consistent parameterization strategy based on macroscopically measured data has been developed, that is able to reproduce the deformation- and failure-behavior of salt rocks qualitatively and quantitatively based on the discontinuum-mechanical approach  the introduced method is successfully used and verified in numerous hydro-mechanical simulations of different boundary conditions, geometries and types of loading | 
2014-7037 	 a crushed–salt model with creep, compaction and strain softening, and application to tailings heaps |abstract|crushed salt is used as a backfill and sealing material for mines and underground waste repositories, and as a byproduct of potash mining it is usually stored in large above-ground tailing heaps  for the analysis of strength, permeability and heap stability in these applications, compaction needs to be taken into account   we present a constitutive model for crushed salt which comprises viscous compaction as well as intact salt properties such as creep and viscoplastic deformation with strain hardening and softening  the model is a generalised combination of the salt rock model of minkley and the wipp crushed salt compaction model by sjaardema and krieg   we validate the model on laboratory experiments, using both analytical estimates and numerical simulations with udec  as an application, we investigate the behaviour of tailings heaps, where the model reproduces observed compaction and related effects such as subsidence and surface cracks  furthermore, we find a natural mechanism explaining heap stability | 
2014-7038 	 probabilistic analysis of tetrahedral rock block |abstract  underground excavations in jointed rocks may result in various modes of rock block failures  prediction of mode of failure and volume of unstable rock block are essential in the design of excavations in jointed rocks  one important parameter is the rock joint orientation concerning its mean orientation and the dispersion around the mean orientation  although fisher distribution is commonly used to evaluate the mean and dispersion of rock joint orientation, the present study establishes that the more advanced kent distribution can better evaluate the scatter of rock joint orientation of actual field data  a probabilistic simulation is employed in the present study to conduct stability analysis of tetrahedral rock block based on rock joint mean orientation and dispersion obtained from kent distribution  the results from probabilistic simulation are compared with the commonly used deterministic approach employing only the mean rock joint orientations  the comparison reveals that deterministic method generally gives a conservative estimation of the largest unstable block volume  however, while only a single failure mode of rock block can be identified from the deterministic analysis, the probabilistic simulation approach shows possibilities of multiple rock block failure modes due to scatter of rock joint orientation with the respective probability of occurrence for each mode of block failure | 
2014-7039 	 cavern design based on improved lab tests as well as field measurements |abstract  underground cavities in rock salt mass for storage of crude oil and natural gas as well as compressed air and hydrogen are essential elements in energy supply management  these cavities are at the same time complex geotechnical constructions, characterized by special excavation procedure using solution mining technique and therefore no direct access for humans is existent  nevertheless these underground cavities have to fulfil manifold requirements, especially static stability, tightness, third party protection and last but not least environmental safe abandonment after decades of storage operation   this paper at first gives some basic information about geotechnical characteristics of storage cavities in rock salt mass and the related design concepts guaranteeing long term safe as well as economic efficient storage operation  essential elements of cavern design are presented such as physical modelling of rock salt behaviour based on laboratory investigations, constitutive models, numerical simulations to site-specifically validate simulation models, to identify prospective load-bearing behaviour as well as to quantify rock mass stresses and deformations related to proposed operation patterns  special attention is focused on thermomechanically coupled processes induced in rock mass due to gas withdrawal and gas injection  finally, some hints with respect to cavern abandonment and related physical modelling as well as numerical simulation of brine-filled closed cavities are given |

2014-7041 	 cumulative volumetric deformation of a hydraulic fracture using acoustic emission and micro-ct imaging |abstract  enhancing formation permeability through hydraulic fracturing (hf) has become a proven tool for hydrocarbon extraction in shale (i e , a resource rock formation) as well as geothermal heat extraction from hot, dry rock reservoirs  permeability in the nanodarcy range is possible in many such unconventional oil and gas reservoirs, thus requiring production to greatly depend on the existence of natural fractures and the additional surface area generated by hydraulic fracturing  mapping and characterizing the structure of a hydraulic fracture network can be performed using acoustic emission analysis techniques  many techniques exist to obtain an estimated stimulated reservoir volume (srv), which is used as a correlation metric for expected well performance  most of these techniques use the discrete acoustic emission events as boundary points and determine the volume of rock inside the three-dimensional cloud of data that was acquired  while some of these methods for determining rock volumes affected throughout the fracturing process are sophisticated, understanding of the cumulative fracture opening volume from acoustic emission data is not well understood  laboratory hydraulic fracturing tests were performed while monitoring acoustic emissions continuously  sample sizes were approximately 15<u+00d7>15<u+00d7>25 cm3  granite was used as the reservoir material due to the high brittleness, very low permeability, and relative homogeneity  acoustic emission data recorded throughout the fracturing process was analyzed for three-dimensional event source locations, source mechanisms, orientations and directions of crack movement, and volumetric deformations  a cumulative volumetric deformation was calculated for a specific area near the openhole wellbore where fracture initiation occurred  this volumetric deformation was then compared to micron scale ct scan data for the same region  the fracturing pattern and the geometrical properties of fracturing (e g , volume, fracture width, etc ) can be measured and analyzed from the 3d ct images  the resolution of the micro-ct images is sufficient to resolve most tiny fractures  by direct observation through micron ct imaging, the acoustic emission data is compared  the consistence of volumetric contributions of these two sets of data is investigated | 
2014-7042 	 a sequential gaussian simulation approach to modelling rock mass heterogeneity |abstract   rock masses are inherently variable in their nature owing to the complex interrelationship between discontinuities and intact rock  the simplest way to account for this uncertainty is through the explicit modelling of the spatial heterogeneity  this is commonly conducted through stochastic simulation, where multiple realizations of studied attributes are produced  within this paper a geostatistics-based approach to modelling spatial uncertainty which is new to the field of open pit mine design is presented  the method is based on the use of sequential gaussian simulation to reproduce the spatial heterogeneity observed in studied attributes  the paper presents the formal methodology used for stochastic simulation and the results obtained from the modelling process  models were constructed by stochastically varying the geological strength index and uniaxial compressive strength within a geomechanical simulation model of the ok tedi mine site in papua new guinea  simulations demonstrate the importance of understanding the scale dependent characteristics of sample variance and the effects of spatial heterogeneity on both the critical srf and projected failure size | 
2014-7044 	 logistic regression in hard rock pillar design |abstract|this paper presents the research undertaken to improve existing design methods used in pillar design in hard rock room and pillar mines  this method has been developed based on research that suggests that empirical design methods of pillar stability are best modeled based on the pillar width to height ratio and on the classic strength of rock parameters including ultimate compressive strength and in situ stress conditions  this improvement furthers this research by applying a probabilistic analysis to reduce the uncertainty of the risk exposure level associated with the dimensioning of hard rock pillars  the analysis employs a statistical method known as logistic regression which carries out a loglinear regression based on categorical empirical data  this method allows designers to dimension pillars according to chosen risk exposure levels  based on this analysis, a chart has been developed that allows for an easy application of hard rock pillar design methods and a rapid assessment of risk for any known pillar geometry and in situ stress conditions to be made |

2014-7051 	 steady state-creep of rock salt - improved approaches for lab determination and modeling to describe transient, stationary and accelerated creep, dilatancy and healing |abstract  actual problems in geotechnical design, e g  of underground openings for radioactive waste repositories or high-pressure gas storages, require sophisticated constitutive models and consistent parameters for rock salt that facilitate reliable prognosis of stress-dependent deformation and associated damage from the initial excavation to long times  fortunately in the long term the response of salt masses is governed by its steady state creep behavior  however, because in experiments the time necessary to reach true steady creep rates can last time periods of some few days to years, depending mainly on temperature, an innovative but simple creep testing approach is suggested  a series of multi-step tests with loading and un-loading cycles allow a more reliable estimate of stationary creep rates in a reasonable time schedule  in completion, the advanced strain-hardening approach of gunther/salzer is used which describes all relevant deformation properties of rock salt, e g  creep and damage induced rock failure, comprehensively within the scope of an unified creep approach  the capability of the combination of improved creep testing procedures and accompanied modelling is demonstrated by recalculating multi-step creep at different loading and temperature conditions  thus reliable extrapolations relevant to in-situ creep rates (10-9 to 10-13 s-1) become possible | 
2014-7052 	 a very slow creep test on an avery island salt sample |abstract  a very slow creep test was performed on an avery island salt sample  the testing device was set in a remote gallery of the varang&*#233;ville mine to take advantage of the very stable temperature there  this multi-step test was 30-month long  the applied load was 0 1, 0 2 and 0 3 mpa, successively  steady-state strain rates are of the order of 10-12 s-1, significantly faster than what can be extrapolated from creep tests performed under larger load, rates are an increasing function of the applied load | 
2014-7053 	 effects of fractures and faults on in situ stress magnitudes |abstract  we present in this paper two examples on two different scales (in borehole and regional), in which stress magnitudes might be influenced by the presence of fractures and faults  hydraulic fracturing in situ stress measurements conducted in a borehole showed a large fluctuation of the maximum horizontal principal stress (shmax) at an order of ~10 mpa over few tens of meter depth  numerous wide aperture fractures are abundant around depths where s sub>hmax are relatively low, whereas such fractures are scarce at depths where s sub>hmax are relatively high  such wide fractures are oriented optimally for slip under the in situ stress condition, playing a role of limiting stress magnitudes by slippage along the fractures and consequent release of excessive stress  a similar observation was made at a much larger scale  collected stress data in gyeongsang basin, korea show inhomogeneous horizontal stresses with their magnitudes varying laterally  the lateral variation of horizontal stress magnitudes appears to be related to regional scale fault density  this result also suggests that excessive stress might possibly be released by slippage along faults  this study demonstrates that stress magnitudes can be constrained by natural fractures and faults quite locally (at a scale of few tens of meters) and also quite regionally (over km scales) | 
2014-7054 	 geomechanical modeling of repositories for nuclear waste disposal in rock salt formations |abstract  the safety assessment of radioactive waste repositories in salt formations requires geomechanical model calculations to analyze the stability of the repository mine and to predict the long-term integrity of the rock salt barrier  important steps of this analysis are the geological exploration and modeling, the definition of material models and determination of related parameters, the geomechanical and numerical modeling as well as the specification of appropriate criteria to evaluate the numerical results  two stress-based criteria are considered for rock salt: the dilatancy criterion and the frac criterion  as an example, the geomechanical integrity of the salt barrier in the southern part of the morsleben repository, germany, is investigated  dilatant zones in the rock salt only occur directly around the rooms of the repository; sufficient areas of the salt barrier show no dilatancy even for long time periods  if backfilling of the repository rooms is taken into account, the frac criterion is satisfied too | 
2014-7055 	 lateral reinforcement of fully grouted roof bolts in a flac3d simulated coal mine entry |abstract|fully grouted roof bolts increase the stability of a bedded mine roof by providing resistance to both vertical and horizontal displacements  the bolts provide suspension reinforcement from axial loads and lateral reinforcement from shear resistance effects  the lateral reinforcement provided by a roof bolt is difficult to observe in the field, but is often suggested by observation of roof failure cavities  however, these observations do not indicate whether bolt shear failure precedes or is a result of collapse  this paper highlights the use of a well-calibrated flac3d numerical model to investigate the shear resistance provided by a fully grouted bolt  the study first looks at analytical solutions to determine the necessary element size to obtain appropriate deflections of thin beams within flac3d  the study then compares different models demonstrating that the shear resistance provided by a fully grouted bolt has a limited impact on the overall stability of the mine roof  the model results indicate that the axial suspension effects of fully grouted bolts are more significant than the lateral reinforcement provided | 
2014-7062 	 robustness of interference fractures that promote simultaneous growth of multiple hydraulic fractures |abstract  during horizontal well stimulation from an array multiple perforations it is difficult to ensure simultaneous growth of all hydraulic fractures (hf) in the array due to a phenomenon known as stress shadowing, which favors the growth of the less constrained outer fractures in the array  recently, using a fully coupled, parallel-planar 3d hf model it has been shown that it is possible to alleviate the localization effect of stress shadowing by appropriately breaking the symmetry of the perforation array  this procedure was termed interference fracturing due to the way in which the nearest neighbors to the outer fractures are positioned to interrupt the localization and runaway growth of the outer fractures  in this paper we will explore the robustness of the positioning of the interference fractures on a configuration designed to expose the changes to the dynamics of this complex fully-coupled system affected by perturbations to the initiation points in the array | 
2014-7063 	 computer simulation and analysis of rock breaking process by rock bit cutters |abstract  modeling of the interaction between the bits cutters and rock is crucial in the rate of penetration (rop) drilling simulators which simulate the bits performance under different conditions  this paper first analyzes the mechanism of rock failure by roller cone bit’s inserts and pdc cutters  next, the drill bit performance software based on the interaction mechanism is introduced  applying the software, series of simulation tests on the rock breaking process by the tricone inserts and the pdc cutters have been carried out  the entire process of an insert and pdc cutter interacting with rock, from initial contact to leaving the bottom rock, is simulated  the results show that the software can simulate the interaction between drill bit cutters and rock very well  the contact area on each insert is plotted, from which we can see which part of the insert is more easily worn out  this will help the bit design engineers improve insert shape designs  the simulated loads on the cutters are analyzed and compared  the software can also predict rop, which can be used to optimize and improve drilling efficiency | 
2014-7066 	 a multi-scale approach to mining tabular deposits |abstract  the challenge of scales posed by geometry of tabular excavations which have great lateral extent relative to mining height is addressed with a dual node–dual mesh finite element technique that allows for whole-mine analysis including surface subsidence and interactions between various sections of the mine at a kilometer scale, effect of joints at an excavation scale, and details of stress concentrations about a longwall panel face at the meter scale  spatial variability in strata properties and joint set effects are included for greater realism  examples demonstrate accuracy and reliability of the technique  application to an underground coal mine in central utah then illustrates usefulness of the technique for obtaining design guidance  a 10 6 million node, three-dimensional mesh is used for computations that run overnight  comparisons of measured with calculated surface subsidence including maximum subsidence of 2 4 m (8 ft) and subsidence “trough” shape confined to areas directly over four major mine sections including 13 sequentially mined longwall panels are in reasonable agreement | 
2014-7068 	 application of dem for modelling crack initiation and propagation in rock masses with open and closed flaws |abstract  a rock mass is neither a continuous medium nor a totally discrete medium, it is a kind of defect material which contains many cracks, joints and faults  the nonlinear deformation behavior of a rock mass is induced by the propagation and coalescence of cracks and joints under external loads  therefore, it is of important for rock engineering to analyze the propagation and coalescence process of cracks existed in a rock mass under external loads  the study of crack initiation and propagation is important for the understanding of rock mass behaviour which, in turn, affects rock engineering applications, such as tunnels, foundations and slopes, as well as hydrocarbon and geothermal energy extraction  cracking mechanisms can be studied experimentally in the laboratory or in the field, or numerically  in the present study, distinct element method (dem) which is capable to model various discontinuities was employed to simulate crack initiation and propagation in a rock masse specimen containing a single open and closed flaw  initially, a rock domain containing a closed flaw was considered to model crack propagation  the analysis was performed by sequential modelling  firstly, a model containing a single closed or open flaw was used to verify the types of propagation shown by park and bobet (2009)  in these analyses, both open and closed flaws were considered and analysed with different spatial distribution (i e  flaw angle)  after results verification, the effect of open flaw filling material on crack propagation was analysed numerically  this characteristic has not yet been studied in crack propagation studies  the results obtained from open and closed flaws were in good agreement with experimental ones  all cracks mentioned in experimental literatures such as wing (tensile) cracks, coplanar secondary (shear) cracks and oblique secondary cracks were modelled successfully using dem which indicates method capability to model nonlinear behaviour of rock masses subjected to external loadings  the emphasize of the study is to investigate the effects of open flaws containing filling material on crack initiation and propagation  weak material was modelled as filling material  the results showed that when flaw is filled with weak materials (as it encountered frequently in natural rock masses) the cracking pattern is quite different with open flaws  in these occasions, the crack propagation direction is different  this phenomenon could be described in terms of stress attenuation in weak filling material, as stress concentration in filling materials causes change in crack propagation directions as well as crack length | 
2014-7071 	 interaction of multiple fluid-driven fractures with pre-existing discontinuities |abstract  the mechanics of fluid-driven fracture propagation through fracture networks is of central interest in gas and oil extraction procedures  a number of computational strategies have now been developed to simulate these processes although specific understanding of the propagation mechanics in the vicinity of pre-existing discontinuities or faults is still limited  this paper investigates the problem of formulating appropriate fluid branching logic at multiple flow path junctions and the influence of sudden contractions or expansions in the flow path channel width at discontinuity intersections  a plane strain model is assumed  a question of additional interest is the possible existence of a “fluid lag” region between the flow front and the mobilized fracture front  the paper explores some examples of flow propagation and branching through simple joint networks | 
2014-7072 	 on the water retention behaviour of shales |abstract  shales are among the most considered geomaterials in current energy-related geomechanical investigations; they are involved in engineering applications such as the unconventional extraction of natural gas, co2 sequestration and nuclear waste geological storage  a deep understanding of their behaviour with regard to variations in the degree of saturation is of primary significance for such applications  this paper illustrates the advances in the experimental analysis of the water retention behaviour of shales under non-isochoric conditions which have been recently achieved by the authors  the testing methodologies involve the direct control of the water content and the subsequent measurement of the total suction at equilibrium by a psychrometer  furthermore, the volume change response of the material upon total suction variations can be investigated: a fluid displacement technique with a non-polar liquid is used in order to assess the volume changes of the shale samples and to compute the degree of saturation  the results highlight the important features of the retention behaviour of shales, such as the existence of main wetting and drying paths, the hysteresis domain and the scanning behaviour  selected results are presented for three shales from the northern region of switzerland | 
2014-7074 	 analysis of factors influencing coal mine intersection stability |abstract  in room and pillar mines, many intersections of entries are created, resulting in enlarged roof spans and modified stress distributions  a review of roof fall statistics (2002-2011) shows that the roof over an intersection is about twice as likely to fail as over an entry  numerical models are used to study the stability of the bedded roof strata in coal mines  thinly laminated roof beds are first studied as a single thin slab under gravity loading  fully three-dimensional models are created to evaluate stress redistribution and failure development around intersections  it is shown that under the relatively high horizontal stress environment encountered in coal mines, intersections are less stable than entries, in spite of reduced stress over the intersections  the strategy to rotate the direction of development so that entries favorably intersect the major horizontal stress is shown to provide little benefit to intersection stability  a case study is evaluated in which rotation of the mine layout did not improve intersection stability, and the modeling results demonstrated that failure across the diagonals of the rotated intersection produced increased damage when compared to the entries  the numerical models show further that delamination of bedded strata can occur to much greater heights above intersections than entries, which may further contribute to intersection instability | 
2014-7077 	 laboratory testing of shale rock specimens to assess thermal fracturing risk in caprock surrounding injection wells |abstract  the laboratory testing described here can be seen as the first step in investigating potential thermal effects leading to the creation of a leakage pathway at or in the vicinity of a co2 injection well  the occurrence of thermal stresses in metal casing, cement and formation can lead to either one or more of these materials developing cracks, or debonding between pairs of materials at their interface  a first investigation is thus concentrating on the rock immediately above the injection reservoir; this sealing rock is most often some variant of shale formation  here we look at the required temperature contrast between the injected co2 (or for that matter any other liquid) and the shale formation, in order to initiate tensile fracturing due to the development of tensile stresses exceeding the rock's tensile strength  finite element simulations suggest that significant fracturing may occur for a temperature contrast of 80° c  an accompanying series of laboratory tests showed that for the chosen shale specimen, fracturing should only be of concern for much higher temperature contrasts | 
2014-7080 	 source parameters of acoustic emission observed in laboratory and mine environments |abstract  in this paper, we present the results from laboratory and in situ rock fracture experiments where calibrated acoustic emission (ae) sensors were implemented  by removing sensor distortions, we were able to study the size and magnitude of ae sources in two unique environments  the laboratory experiment was conducted on a cubic sample of fontainbleau sandstone under true-triaxial stress conditions (<u+03c3>1 > <u+03c3>2 > <u+03c3>3)  the in situ experiment was conducted on a 0 7 m x 0 7 m x 1 1 m rectangular prism of lac du bonnet granite located on the side of an underground tunnel during a large-scale excavation response test  for both sets of data, corner frequency (fo) and moment magnitude (mw) were found to be inside the ranges 190 khz < fo < 750 khz and -7 2 < mw < -6 5, respectively and all source parameters appeared to obey scaling relationships derived for larger earthquakes | 
2014-7088 	 reconsolidation of crushed salt to 250° c under hydrostatic and shear stress conditions |abstract  design, analysis and performance assessment of potential salt repositories for heat-generating nuclear waste require knowledge of thermal, mechanical, and fluid transport properties of reconsolidating granular salt  to inform salt repository evaluations, we have undertaken an experimental program to determine bulk and young’s moduli and poisson’s ratio of reconsolidated granular salt as a function of porosity and temperature and to establish the deformational processes by which the salt reconsolidates  tests were conducted at 100, 175, and 250°c  in hydrostatic tests, confining pressure is increased to 20 mpa with periodic unload/reload loops to determine k  volume strain increases with increasing temperature  in shear tests at 2 5 and 5 mpa confining pressure, after confining pressure is applied, the crushed salt is subjected to a differential stress, with periodic unload/reload loops to determine e and ?  at predetermined differential stress levels the stress is held constant and the salt consolidates  displacement gages mounted on the samples show little lateral deformation until the samples reach a porosity of ~ 10%  interestingly, vapor is vented only for 250°c tests and condenses at the vent port  it is hypothesized the brine originates from fluid inclusions, which were made accessible by heating and intragranular deformational processes including decrepitation | 
2014-7089 	 investigation of rock bolts in karst |abstract  a rock bolt represents the most important element in ensuring stability of rock mass excavations  this paper presents weaknesses and strengths of methods which deal with evaluation of rock bolts  most widely used is pull-out test, conducted for capacity determination in destructive manner  to overcome ‘destructivity’, a method of acoustic emission shows that the force close to the failure point can be determined, so that the rock bolt will remain usable for strengthening purposes  another ndt system, called granit, is developed in order to determine load level inside rock bolt by analyzing its natural frequencies  when it comes to evaluation of grouting quality, efforts were made in order to find reliable solution, but existing methods still have weaknesses which limit their applicability  first developed and today still widely used is boltometer which is based on emission of energy in rock bolt and on analyzing returned energy  however, dissipation of energy, due to karstic phenomena may not yield good results  some efforts in improvement of weaknesses of boltometer have been conducted and are presented in paper  a basic concept is given for novel method for ndt evaluation of grouting quality, which is in development at faculty of civil engineering in zagreb | 
2014-7093 	 numerical investigation of rock mass behavior associated with confinement-dependent strength in brittle failing rocks |abstract  transition of a failure mechanism from extensional to shear dominated failure with increasing confinement is widely observed in the rupture of samples in the laboratory and in situ associated with underground excavation in brittle failing rocks  however, common failure criteria such as the hoek-brown criterion are not able to capture or explain the change in failure mechanism  hence, a better understanding of these confinement-dependent failure processes is key in continuing safe underground excavation in brittle failing rocks  the 3d finite difference code, flac3d, was adopted to investigate the behavior of underground excavation on a numerical model in terms of failure mode transition associated with the confinement level  it is hypothesized that extensional failure is dominant at low confinement, but shear failure mainly occurs at higher confinement  the hoek-brown constitutive model embedded in flac3d has been modified in order to simulate extensional failure associated with spalling at lower confinement by mean of ubiquitous joints installation  the results support the observation that the rock strength and its behavior may differ significantly in the direct vicinity of openings where the spalling mainly occurs | 
2014-7094 	 3d simulation of tsunami wave induced by rock slope failure using coupled dda-sph |abstract  we present a three dimensional fluid-structure coupling between sph and 3d-dda for modelling rock-fluid interactions  the navier-stokes equation is simulated using the sph method and the motions of the blocks are tracked by a lagrangian algorithm based on a newly developed, explicit, 3d-dda formulation  the coupled model is employed to investigate the water entry of a sliding block and the resulting wave(s)  the coupled sph-dda algorithm provides a promising computational tool to for modelling a variety of solid-fluid interaction problems in many potential applications in hydraulics, rock mass stability, and in coastal and offshore engineering | 
2014-7097 	 development of grouting management support system and its application to an underground structure |abstract  according to the technical guide for grouting method for dam construction in japan modified in the year 2003, one of the key issues for grouting is quality assurance and effectiveness by minimizing the amount of injected grout  hence, the grouting management support system was newly developed by combining joint density diagram and geostatistical simulations  in this system, the joint density diagram was used to determine most effective direction for the grout injection boreholes and the hydraulic conductivity fields before/after grout injection were estimated by geostatistical simulations  in this paper, the newly developed system was introduced and applied to the actual underground structure construction site | 
2014-7100 	 stochastic microcracks simulation by distinct element modeling |abstract  rock as brittle heterogeneous material exhibits inelastic deformation due to widely pre-existing microcracks in the formation from outcrops to the cores thousands miles deep underground  by the effect of the geological process, thermalmechanical loading, hydraulic fracturing, etc , the macrocracks or fractures may be developed as the collection of microcracks  however, it is difficult to obtain the geometry of microscopic natural fractures and their kinematic information by physical experimentation  in this study, the distinct element method (dem) is used because it treats the rock mass as an assembly of independent particles under certain contacts, and along with deformation and dynamic mechanism  with distinct element modeling approach, the rock mass is represented by three-dimensional bonded particles, and the pre-existing discontinuities (joints) are simulated by smooth-joint contact model  the observed existing fractures geometric properties have been identified that they are fitted to theoretical probability density functions  therefore, the stochastic microcracks (sm) system needs to be investigated with monte carlo simulation by applying distinct distribution functions into geometry variables, such as crack density, orientation, location; which addresses the probabilistic characterization of the nature of fracture system  the rock sample is sent to anisotropic stress field to observe its response after simulated hydraulic fracturing  the model is also developed with two different parallel laminations of rock types to exam the mineral phases effect  this paper combine the monte carlo simulation of stochastic microcracks with distinct element modeling using 3d particle flow code (pfc), and the presented synthetic rock mass can be applied in further study on the statistical natural fractures system coupling with microseismic event, stress distribution estimation, and thermo-hydro-mechanical behavior of the hydraulic fracturing | 
2014-7101 	 simulation of dynamic fracture in rock with discretized virtual internal bond |abstract|the discretized virtual internal bond (discretized-vib) is a newly developed lattice bond method for modeling nonlinear elasticity  different from the usual lattice model, the discretized-vib consists of unit bond cells  each unit cell has a finite number of bonds and can have any geometry  these features make the discretized-vib quite suitable for modeling rock with a meso-structure of grains  because the unit cell is directly characterized by the particle force-displacement constitutive relation derived from the micro-bond potential, the discretized-vib can directly simulate the dynamic fracture behaviors of finite deformation without any external fracture criterion  in the present paper, the heterogeneity of rock is accounted in discretized-vib by assuming that the young’s modulus of unit cell complies with the weibull distribution law  by simulating a typical dynamic fracture branching example, it is suggested the present method can simulate dynamic fracture initiation, propagation and branching process without separate fracture criterion  it can capture the main characteristics of dynamic fracture in rock  the results also show that rock heterogeneity influences the trajectory of dynamic fracture  the more heterogeneous the rock, the more tortuous the fracture trajectory becomes | 
2014-7104 	 a re-examination of the joint roughness coefficient (jrc) and its correlation with the roughness parameter z2 |abstract  the research problem of establishing a correlation between the joint roughness coefficient (jrc) and the roughness parameter z2 is re-visited in this paper  as in other comparable studies, the first step is to digitize the ten standard jrc profiles  an alternative approach of digitization based on the pixel analysis in matlab is adopted to obtain the standard jrc profiles  the z2values of the ten profiles are then calculated based on three sampling intervals (small, medium and large) and compared with the prior published ones  to investigate the effect of the finite profile thickness, a parameter called “rta”, which is the ratio of the mean profile thickness to the profile amplitude, is defined and calculated for each profile  our studies also reveal that the value of z2 does not increase monotonically with jrc  the fundamental cause of this local peak is analyzed, which deems to be related to the larger waviness, while a smaller degree of local roughness of profile 5 (jrc 8-10)  to take both the local profile roughness and the larger scale waviness into account, a new empirical correlation is developed  the numeric values of the associated fitting parameters are then determined | 
2014-7107 	 hybrid fem/dem simulation of hydraulic fracturing in naturally-fractured reservoirs |abstract  a coupled simulator based on the mdem fracturing code and the tough2 reservoir simulator was used to study propagation of hydraulic fractures in a naturally-fractured formation under isotropic and anisotropic in-situ stress conditions  offset of a propagating hydraulic fracture by a pre-existing natural fracture was observed in some of the simulations  in others, the hydraulic fracture was found to cross a natural fracture without any offset  a mesh-dependence was observed: changing the mesh geometry from regular to irregular affected the fracture pattern, even though the mesh resolution was approximately the same  the mesh dependence particularly affected the fracture pattern observed under isotropic in-situ stress field  the results of the study are of importance for practical application of hydraulic fracture simulation, in particular in gas shale reservoirs | 
2014-7108 	 experiments on stick-slip vibrations in drilling with drag bits |abstract  the paper presents preliminary results of the ongoing experimental study of stick-slip, a mode of torsional vibrations of drilling assembly using drag bits  these experimental results are in agreement with a recent theoretical paper on stickslip that concludes that the main driving mechanism of stick-slip is not the velocity weakening effect and not the self-excited axial vibrations but the cutting action of the bit, and the wearflat/rock interaction  in fact, the results illustrate that stick-slip can be mitigated through axial compliance | 
2014-7109 	 near-well integrity and thermal effects: a computational road from laboratory to field scale |abstract  integrity of the near-well area is crucial for preventing leakage between geological horizons and towards the surface during co2 storage, hydrocarbon production and well stimulation  the paper consists of two parts  in the first part, a finite-element model of earlier laboratory tests on thermal cycling of a casing/cement/rock assemblage is set up  it is demonstrated that radial tensile stresses contributing to annular cement debonding are likely to develop during cooling of such an assemblage  the results of the modeling are in agreement with the results of the earlier laboratory experiments, with regard to the temperature histories, ct data, and location of acoustic emission sources  in the second part of the paper, a computational procedure is developed for upscaling of data about rock damage obtained from ct, to a finite-element model of flow in porous media around a well  the damaged zone is shown to dominate the flow along the axis of a compound specimen (a hollow cylinder of sandstone filled with cement)  implications for leakage along an interface between cement and rock in-situ are discussed | 
2014-7110 	 simultaneous initiation of multiple transverse hydraulic fractures from a horizontal well |abstract  we present a numerical model for the simultaneous initiation and subsequent propagation of multiple transverse hydraulic fractures from a horizontal wellbore  in particular, we investigate the efficiency and robustness of the multistage hydraulic fracturing technique  we restrict the created hydraulic fractures to remain radial and planar but fully account for the stress interaction between fractures, the fluid flow in the wellbore and across the different perforation clusters which are modeled via a classical relation between the friction pressure drop and the flow rate entering a given fracture  the initiation is modeled from a radial notch of given initial length using linear elastic fracture mechanics  the solver models the complete pressurization of the wellbore, the initiation of the different fractures and their propagation and interactions  the split of the fluid between the different clusters is part of the solution at each time-step  we present some validations and a case study investigating the effect of a number of heterogeneities (in-situ stress etc ) on the robustness of the limited entry technique | 
2014-7112 	 evolution of mechanical and hydraulic properties in sandstone induced by mineral trapping |abstract  in this study, evolution of mechanical and hydraulic properties in berea sandstone with initial porosity of 20 %: is examined quantitatively by replicating mineral trapping process within pore spaces  the artificially accelerated mineral trapping is achieved by injecting a grout, resulting in calcite precipitation  the amount of calcite precipitated can be controlled by changing the concentrations of the grout and the total injection volume  the preliminary experiments indicate that the change of the mechanical and hydraulic properties is significant even if the calcite amount is relatively small – the values of young’s modulus/permeability increase/decrease with increase of the calcite amount  specifically, the permeability decreases by one order of magnitude as the initial porosity of 20 % reduces to 18 %  this intense decrease of permeability may not be able to be replicated by existing numerical models, although distribution of the calcite precipitated within rock samples should be adequately examined because uniform distribution may not be achieved | 
2014-7114 	 geomechanical assessment of the long term stability of old underground mined cavern storages |abstract  more than 70 underground mined caverns for lpg storage have been constructed in the usa from 1950 to the early 1980’s  several decades later, a revamping, or at least a review of some of those underground facilities becomes necessary regarding their long term stability and hydrogeological integrity   a specific approach has been developed for evaluating the geomechanical stability of such old underground storages  this paper presents this methodology  requirements for hydrogeological integrity are briefly presented  the article focuses on geomechanical stability  the different phases of the studies from the definition of a complementary site investigation to the realization of analytical and numerical calculations are detailed  finally, the evolution across time of the best practices for underground storage concept design is presented | 
2014-7121 	 application of numerical modelling to predicted seismic probability and mitigate associated risks during the craig pillar extraction at morrison mine, kghm international |abstract  a geomechanics study on the safe and economical extraction of the craig pillar at morrison mine was initiated in mid-2013  historical and future mining at morrison raised concerns that elevated in situ stress magnitudes would be encountered during pillar extraction  a multi stage flac3d model was developed to simulate historical mining and extraction sequence, and the model was qualitatively calibrated based on visual observations of stress induced rock mass damage  following adequate calibration, forward projections of the pillar extraction were simulated to assess the potential for mine induced seismicity so that the associated risks, related to rock bursting and production difficulties, could be predicted, managed and mitigated  areas of high risk were identified based on perceived probability of seismic activity and exposure of men and equipment to rock burst hazards  high risks areas were targeted for dynamic support installation and comprehensive post-blast monitoring using the mine micro-seismic system and strategically located borehole extensometers  an overview the numerical model calibration process is presented to demonstrate that, in the absence of extensive instrumentation or micro-seismic data, qualitative model calibration can be an effective tool and a reasonable method in assessing stress damage related risks to mine operations | 
2014-7122 	 mechanical behavior of salt rock at elevated temperature |abstract  salt rock is characterized by its very low porosity and permeability along with excellent mechanical deformability  these characteristics make it a good cap rock for many structural petroleum reservoirs, a good geological hydrocarbon storage, and a suitable host rock for poisonous and hazardous wastes  over the past few decades, different laboratory experiments have revealed the complexity and variety of mechanical behaviors of salt rocks  although the elasto-plastic mechanical properties of salt rock highly depend on its stress state and temperature, but they can also change with its composition  therefore, different salt rocks around the world show wide ranges of mechanical behaviors and it necessitates more experimental data from different geological regions  in this study 26 rock salt samples, with two different levels of impurities, from the central iranian salt rock were collected and examined  a set of rock mechanics experiments, including uniaxial compression test, triaxial compression test, and dipole ultrasonic velocity measurements at elevated temperatures, were fulfilled  it was found that the amount of impurities significantly affect the rock salt mechanical behavior  the results suggest that unconfined compressive strength increases as the temperature increases, but the triaxial compressive strength and the ultrasonic wave velocities demonstrate more complex patterns | 
2014-7126 	 integrated study on tensile fracture mechanics and subsequent flow in naturally-fractured niobrara shale |abstract   natural fractures exist in shale plays  whether these fractures contribute to flow, how they interact with hydraulic fractures, and how they are reactivated under in-situ stresses are three main questions in shale hydraulic fracturing  the objective of this paper is to integrate experimental results related to these questions  to this end, the permeability of cores with calcite-filled natural fractures and without natural fractures was measured  next, the tensile strength and tensile fracture pattern of core plugs containing natural fractures at different orientations were examined by applying the brazilian test method  subsequently, the permeability of these tensile-failed samples was measured  the results of this study on niobrara shale samples show that the calcite-filled fractures do not contribute to flow, yet they are planes of weakness for tensile failure depending on the orientation of the fracture  once calcite-filled fractures are activated, they contribute to flow quite significantly even without proppant or shear displacement  the results of this study could be beneficial in other investigations related to complex fracture network | 
2014-7128 	 effect of carbon sequestration on the state of stresses in ductile formations |abstract  this paper investigates the effects of inflating a reservoir via carbon sequestration or water flooding on the state of stresses in surrounding ductile formations  a better control is needed on the assessment of stresses in the caprock and how would they change due to the inflation process in order to avoid geomechanical problems such as seal integrity and induced seismicity  an important factor in analyzing the reservoir-caprock interaction is the compression-inflation model used to estimate reservoir behavior  a finite elements model of a simple circular disc is created to study the stress redistribution around an inflating reservoir using the commercial software abaqus  the paper analyzes the results using well known methods, namely; the ellipsoidal inclusion approach and the deformation analysis in reservoir space approach  the analysis verified the results of the finite elements simulation and gave insight to generic redistribution of stresses around an inflating reservoir  the paper also compared two different compression-inflation models; the modified cam clay model (mcc) and the mit-e3 model  the mit-e3 model utilizes a non-linear elastic inflation model and estimates larger redistribution of stresses around the inflating reservoir | 
2014-7129 	 modeling dynamic stimulation of geological resources |abstract  dynamic loading methods promise new modes for stimulating geological resources, as the fracture patterns they produce can be tailored by the shape and nature of the pressure pulse employed  however, selecting the type of load is a difficult task: too slow and the stimulatory effect is reduced; too fast and the resource may be negatively impacted by wellbore damage, fines creation or permeability reduction  moreover, modeling these systems proves challenging due to the myriad of length and timescales involved, combined with the need to accommodate both the generation of new fractures and propagation of preexisting fracture networks   geodyn-l is a massively-parallel multi-material lagrangian code that includes advanced contact models to simulate nonlinear wave propagation through heavily-jointed rock masses, along with material model libraries specifically developed to capture the dynamic response of geologic media  we present results using geodyn-l to simulate dynamic stimulation of geologic resources with pre-existing fracture networks and discuss the implications of these results for enhancing fracture networks with dynamic loading techniques | 
2014-7130 	 processing of neutron diffraction data for strain measurement in geological materials |abstract  conventional rock mechanics testing techniques typically involve the loading of samples and measurement of displacements or strains on the outer boundary of the specimen surface  neutron diffraction based strain measurement techniques represent a unique and powerful tool for measuring the strain within geological materials under load  the structural variability and non-uniform crystallinity of geological materials, however, create many complexities in the intensity patterns that must be analyzed to quantify strains within the material  the attenuating and scattering properties of the pressure cell housing the sample further add difficulties to the data analysis  this paper describes the methods and process used to process neutron scattering data for strain measurement in geological materials  it is intended to provide a primer for those in the rock mechanics community that are interested in utilizing this technique along with additional discussion of neutron diffraction experimental factors that may affect data quality | 
2014-7132 	 effect of mechanical property anisotropy in shales and fracture spacing on fracture aperture |abstract  multiple transverse hydraulic fractures are created simultaneously in each stage for economically viable production of hydrocarbons in shales  the spacing between fractures is an important component to consider when developing an optimum stimulation design  another important aspect to consider, that is often overlooked, is the anisotropy of mechanical properties inherent in shales  this study aims to provide an insight into the controlling effects of fracture spacing and different levels of rock property anisotropy on the fracture aperture during simultaneous fracture initiation and propagation  multiple fracture propagation is simulated using 3-dimensional [3d] finite element models [fem]  all simulations in this study include simultaneous propagation of four fractures in pre-defined planes using cohesive elements in a linear elastic medium  numerous fems with varying spacing between fractures and varying levels of anisotropy are generated to analyze the effect of spacing and rock anisotropy on the fracture apertures of the edge fractures and center fractures  the multi-fracture propagation model used in this study is capable of showing the isolated influence of each parameter tested  the results show that there is a significant effect on the fracture widths of center and edge fractures across the entire range of fracture spacing considered in the study  the center fractures are more sensitive to changes in fracture spacing and changes in elastic moduli | 
2014-7133 	 using field measurements to quantify the post-failure behavior of coal |abstract  strain-softening behavior has been identified as a reasonable approach to describe the post-failure behavior of coal  in this past research, the detailed post-failure behavior of the coal was primarily analyzed from specimens in the laboratory  these laboratory tests typically determined: the peak stress and strain, the residual stress and strain, and the post-failure modulus, all as a relationship of the width-to-height ratio of the specimen  in lamodel, the behavior of a strain-softening material is defined by two points on the stress strain curve: the point of peak stress and peak strain, and the point of residual stress and residual strain (followed by perfectly plastic behavior)  typically, the element’s peak stress is determined by the stress gradient implied in the mark-bieniawski coal strength formula, and the residual stress was typically determined from the published equations of karabin and evanto (1999), which interpreted the residual stress response of the coal from a couple of case studies  in this paper, the field data from 9 different stress measurement sites in u s and australian coal mines are used to analyze the post-failure behavior of the coal  this analysis results in an equation with two input parameters which describes the observed post-failure coal behavior  these two parameters not only control the difference between the peak and residual stress as a function of width-to-height ratio, but also control the point of the shift from strain-softening to strain-hardening behavior in the pillar  ultimately, the new post-failure model was implemented into lamodel and validated by back-analyzing the crandall canyon mine collapse | 
2014-7138 	 the stress ratio effect on hydraulic fracturing in the presence of natural fractures |abstract |hydraulic fracturing (hf) may lead to practical stress management possibilities by creating opportunities to control stress redistribution, or protecting locations where high stresses pose a threat to operations  these possibilities have application in petroleum engineering as well as mining  understanding naturally fractured rock (nfr) behavior leads to better predictions of rock mass response to hf treatment and induced fracture initiation and propagation  natural fractures exist in many different states, are reactivated by stress and pressure changes, and have alterable mechanical properties (e g  stiffness, shear strength), leading to complex behavior in shear, opening, and closing reactions to stress changes  this article presents some attempts to understand and address simulation of hf interacting with a nfr using the distinct element method (dem) to represent the nfr  to this end, a coupled hydro-mechanical analysis is applied via the universal distinct element code (udec™) software to model both rock and fracture behavior in the hf/nfr system  in the current study, a voronoi tessellated continuum has been generated to evaluate the effect of the stress ratio on flow into the joints by changing the differential principal compressive stresses  given the difference in in situ stresses, pore pressure distribution is monitored and the distribution of slip and opening of fractures at different stress field anisotropy is investigated during pressurized hydraulic injection  based on simulations, pore pressure decreases in a uniform pattern around the injection point in the isotropic stress state; however, the pressure distribution tends to become strongly anisotropic under a stronger differential stress  in addition, both normal and shear displacements show an increasing trend toward anisotropy under stronger stress differences  applications may ensue with better understanding, such that hf strategies for strongly differential stress fields may evolve to be substantially different than for near-isotropic stress fields, and similar conclusions may ensue for random nfr fabrics, compared to cases with strongly oriented natural fracture fabric | 
2014-7144 	 non-destructive impulse based index testing of rock core |abstract  elastic properties such as young’s modulus (e) are key controlling factors in the design of drilling and completion operations in conventional and unconventional reservoirs such as gas/oil shales and tight gas sands  due to the high cost and long time needed for rock mechanics testing on core, it is not always possible to conduct traditional tests within the time frame from well drilling to well completion operations  in addition, shale cores are often naturally fractured and it can be difficult to acquire plugs  here, we present a rapid, non-destructive, index method based on impulse for the determination of a coupled e and poisson’s ratio, v e*= e/(1v2)  a small mass (60g) with a spherical tip of radius 3 81 or 38 1 mm is dropped on a flat surface from 12-19 mm  the mass slightly deforms the core and then rebounds from the core  from a combination of hertzian contacts and impulse, the elastic properties can be determined from the force-time curve of the impact  our results are compared against a variety of materials including metals, ceramics, plastics, other synthetics, and a variety of rocks  using this method, e* can be determined at cm spacing for several meters of core in one day of testing | 
2014-7146 	 what difference does selection of failure criteria make in wellbore stability analysis? |abstract  selection of the appropriate rock failure criteria is one of the key steps in determining minimum drilling fluid density in wellbore stability analysis  numerous failure criteria have been used for rock failure analysis but there is no common agreement of which failure criterion to use  in this paper, the thirteen most common rock failure criteria were compared  the rock failure criteria were evaluated for three lithologies  a statistical analysis was performed to determine the similarities and differences among the failure criteria  according to the results, tresca, von mises, and inscribed drucker-prager estimated the higher bounds for the minimum required mud weight for all cases  although circumscribed drucker-prager usually predicts the lower bounds for the minimum required mud weight, its results are in the middle range for hard formations with low internal angle of friction  modified lade, modified wiebols-cook and mogi-coulomb provided similar results for the three cases studied, so these failure criteria may be used interchangeably without changing the results | 
2014-7147 	 numerical simulation of rock blasting |abstract  a hybrid discrete element-finite element-smooth particle model was implemented in the ca2 computer program to study the effects of shock wave and gas penetration on the rock damage  the gas flow is simulated by a smooth particle model while the rock is simulated as a bonded particle system  cylindrical rock specimens with and without lining were used for this study  the copper lining is modeled by finite elements  several numerical tests were performed  in particular, the effects of rock strength, shock wave, and gas penetration on rock damage were investigated  furthermore, the role of lining stiffness and its constitutive model on the induced cracks and delivered energy to the specimen was analyzed  the numerical results indicate that the proposed hybrid model can accurately capture many phenomena that are observed in the physical rock blasting tests | 
2014-7148 	 micro-mechanics of hydro-thermo-mechanical fracture propagation in granite |abstract  the paper presents results of a micro-mechanical discrete element method (dem) study of the hydraulic fracture initiation and propagation in enhanced geothermal system (egs) performed using the particle flow code (pfc)  hydraulic fracturing is the main means to stimulate and create flow paths to extract heat in hot dry rocks with insufficient permeability to inject and circulate fluids  hydro-thermo-mechanical coupled modeling is performed to analyze stress and strain changes on fracturing from a wellbore for improving the understanding of the role of thermal stresses on fracture propagation processes and the resulting fracture geometry  bonded particle model (bpm) that is used for modeling the mechanical response and fracturing of solids was modified for capturing mechanical effects of temperature difference between rock and fracturing fluid infiltration in the propagating fracture  heat exchange between fluid and rock and fracture is fully coupled processes  as the fracture propagates from the pressurized borehole, both fluid and rock adjacent to a newly formed fracture change temperature  the results show that thermally induced stresses can significantly change the fracture initiation and the fracture propagation pattern  thermal stresses cause shallow randomly oriented cracks  the study evaluated fracture geometry and orientation with respect to fracturing fluid temperature, viscosity, density, pressure, rock parameters and in-situ stress difference | 
2014-7152 	 numerical simulations of localized deformation in a high- porosity carbonate rock |abstract  strain localization in the form of compactive shear bands or compaction bands is often observed in high porosity rocks such as sandstones or limestones  in the present study, we theoretically investigate the possibility of strain localization in a high-porosity carbonate rock (calcarenite) by means of a continuum mechanics approach  a critical state elasto-plastic constitutive model has been employed for this purpose  we examine the constitutive and structural response by solving boundary value problems (bvps) for calcarenite specimens subjected to axisymmetric loading conditions  in order to perform the numerical simulation in the post localization regime, the model is enhanced with a rate dependent regularization scheme  the results demonstrate that material heterogeneity, kinematic constraints and boundary effects govern the formation of various modes of localized deformation in the transitional regime between brittle fracture and ductile faulting  indeed, the predicted macroscopic response is found to be in good agreement with observations available in the literature | 
2014-7154 	 experimental investigation into the mechanical behavior of gosford sandstone at different sizes |abstract  many studies have been conducted on the size effects behavior of intact rocks and the majority of them have focused on a standard ratio of length to diameter (slenderness ratio) as determined by the international society for rock mechanics (isrm)  the main aim of this research was to investigate the correlation between slenderness ratio and the mechanical properties of gosford sandstone over a much broader range of slenderness ratios  the data showed that there was a general descending trend for the uniaxial compressive strength (ucs) as slenderness ratio increased  similarly, young’s modulus displayed a descending trend with increasing slenderness ratio  no discernible correlation could be established between poisson’s ratio and slenderness ratio  also, it was revealed that single shearing and vertical splitting were the dominant failure modes for gosford sandstone samples with different diameter and slenderness ratio | 
2014-7155 	 a modeling approach in flac to predict hydro-mechanical response of subsurface storage reservoirs due to co2 injection |abstract  this paper demonstrates the ability of a 2d independent two-phase flow hydro-mechanical (h-m) simulator, flac (fast lagrangian analysis of continua), to predict h-m responses related to co2 injection in subsurface disposal reservoirs  this is the first paper to study the use of flac as a single h-m simulator for co2 injection processes  the models in flac are tested against twoexistingmodels: (1)a prototype co2injectionreservoirand(2)the insalahgas fieldinalgeria the h-m responses such as the spread of co2 plumes, the history of pore pressure increases, and surface uplifts are presented and compared with the results from the reference models  the potential for mechanical failures and leakage are also analyzed using critical pressure approach  the simulations show that flac models are able to capture typical shapes of co2 plumes in the reservoirs  the history of pore pressure increase and a typical bell-shape for surface uplifts are obtained  the potential location for mechanical failures and leakage is also well predicted  future implementation of h-m stress-dependent properties in flac will improve its capability  hence, coupling this software with other fluid flow simulator such in the literatures may no longer be necessary in the future | 
2014-7158 	 a laboratory test on rockfall impacts - coefficient of restitution and rotational motions - |abstract  when a falling rock block strikes the ground, the block does not bounce much  this energy loss can be simply represented by the coefficient of restitution for mass point motion  in this paper, dependence of the tangential component of the coefficient of restitution on the incoming angle and the surface friction angle is examined under the normal component being kept constant  a small scale laboratory test is reported to get a better understanding during/at impact  under the condition in which the normal component has set to be (roughly) constant, it has been recognized that the tangential component of the coefficient restitution ret is a roughly constant when the incoming angle is small and then increases with the increase in the slope angle  this nature of impact is explained by ‘sticking’ behavior and the transition to slippage  in the transition zone, the ratio of er/ev (rotational/translational energy) has been decreased, however, we cannot conclude that this transition behavior result in the apparent friction reduction with the momentum or sticking with some slippage during the contact | 
2014-7159 	 study on rock mass classification method based on geological investigation in natm |abstract  in order to construct mountain tunnels rationally and safely, observational construction method has been employed  the necessity for such observation relating to the behavior of tunnel and surrounding ground means that there are so many uncertainties in the tunnel construction process  uncertainties are inaccuracy in the geological survey before construction start, many assumptions in the design of tunnel supports, difference between design and constructed result and so on  especially rock mass classification is important, because a design of tunnel supports and tunneling method is carried out based on the pre-investigated result under the condition of budget and construction period  however the item in pre-investigation might be limited  and rock mass class selected in the design is often different from that of actual condition  in this paper, rock mass classification result based on the advancing boring from tunnel face is compared with actually constructed rock mass class  authors also discussed about rock mass classification process with geological engineers who have had many experiences in pre-investigation and advancing boring  as a result, it was suggested that rock mass classification table given in the standard cannot exactly provide a good result  so rock mass classification process should be examined in detail and a new scheme to have more reliable classification results should be discussed | 
2014-7161 	 a new contact model for dem analysis of rock |abstract  discrete element method (dem) has been proved to be a great tool to simulate and analyze the behavior of rock material  however, classic dem using symmetrical particles bears the intrinsic limitation of severely overestimating the tensile strength of cohesive-frictional material and causing unrealistically low unconfined compressive strength (ucs) to tensile strength (t) ratio  this paper proposes a new contact model which properly considers the contribution of moments to the contact stresses and the condition at which the contact fails  the contact model has been implemented in the three-dimensional particle flow code (pfc3d) and the detailed parametric study indicates that the moment contribution to the contact stresses is a major factor affecting the ucs/t ratio of pfc specimens  after decreasing the moment contribution parameter to be smaller than 0 5, a wide range of ucs/t ratios can be achieved by using different cohesion and tensile strength values  this new contact model has been used to simulate the behavior of lac du bonnet (ldb) granite and carrara marble and satisfactory ucs/t ratios agreeing with the measured values are obtained | 
2014-7163 	 ae monitoring of hydraulic fracturing experiments in granite blocks using supercritical co2, water and viscous oil |abstract  tri-axial hydraulic fracturing experiments using supercritical co2 (sc- co2), water and viscous oil have been conducted in order to investigate how the viscosity of fracturing fluid affects fracture propagation and fracture mode  we performed these experiments on cubic granite specimens and monitored acoustic emission (ae) with 16 sensors  ae data analysis allows us to clarify fracture propagation and its mode  the effects of fluid viscosity on the distribution of ae sources and the fracture mode are discussed  macroscopic observations of the surface fractures were consistent with located ae sources  the distribution of ae sources indicated that fracturing with low viscosity fluid such as sc- co2 can induce more widely and complexly extending fractures than those with higher viscosity fluid like water and oil  in addition, the analysis of the fracture mechanism showed that low viscosity fluid such as sc- co2 induces shear dominant fracture, while high viscosity fluid induces tensile dominant fracture  thus, since co2 has a higher affinity to shale than methane and enhances methane desorption, co2 fracturing could be an effective technique particularly for shale gas recovery | 
2014-7164 	 fracture development and mechanism in shale cores by viscous oil, water and l- co2 injection |abstract|hydraulic fracturing experiments were run on cylindrical cores from a shale stratum at a coal mine in japan  experiments were made under two uniaxial stresses 0 and 3 mpa and by using three types of fluids: viscous oil, water and liquid carbon dioxide (l- co2)  as for results, from the crack observation and ae source distribution, in the experiments used water and oil as fracturing fluid, fractures extend along the sedimentary plane if tests were run without loading, while they extend along the loading direction normal to the sedimentary plane under the uniaxial loading  these results suggest that the direction of crack extension is strongly affected by in-situ stress condition  however, the l- co2 fracturing didn’t show this tendency, this might be related to the low viscosity of l- co2  from the analysis of the ratio of polarity of p-wave initial motions, it was found that viscous oil injection tends to induce mode-i fracture while both water and l- co2 injection tend to induce mode-ii fracture | 
2014-7168 	 a new method for estimating 3d rock discontinuity roughness from a terrestrial lidar data using slope angles of triangular facets |abstract  a new methodology was developed to estimate a rock discontinuity roughness using lidar data collected from the 4850-ft level of the sanford underground research facility (surf) at the former homestake gold mine, lead, sd  maptek’s i-site studio and vulcan 3d mine modeling software packages were used for the analysis  the data was obtained using a z&f imager 5006h lidar scanner that had a maximum resolution of 0 01mm  data preparation was performed in i-site studio and the points were triangulated to create a surface  the analytical data consisted of ten rectangular point clouds of dimensions of about 1 1 m by 0 56 m  the triangulated surface was imported into vulcan where data analyses were performed  results indicated that this method yields a useful way of estimating the roughness of a 3d rock surface by considering orientation (slope) of triangular facets making up the surface  using the slope angles the surface roughness parameter z2swas readily determined and correlated with the jrc, resulting in an empirical model that indicated the robustness of the method | 
2014-7169 	 effective stresses in the hejre field, north sea |abstract  we calculate the effective vertical and horizontal stresses in the hejre field, north sea with a biot’s coefficient estimated from log data  we show that a drilling window (for a vertical well) calculated with these stresses is larger than if using a biot’s coefficient of 1  we show a method to estimate biot’s coefficient from logging data and find biot’s coefficients between 0 8 and 1 for the shetland chalk group, 0 8 to 1 for the tyne group and 0 6 to 0 8 for the heno sandstone formation  biot’s coefficient is straight forward to estimate in formations with a stiff frame, whereas in formations such as shales caution has to be taken  we discuss the consequence of assuming “shale” to be a mineral rather than assuming shale to be composed of minerals and fluid | 
2014-7171 	 shear tests on artificial joints experimental and numerical evaluation of scale effects |abstract  discontinuity sample size influences the experimental shearing parameters of rock joints  to study how peak shear strength evaluation depends on sample size several shear tests were conducted on artificial joints prepared with molds used for encapsulating rock joints  discontinuity surfaces were shaped with two different saw-tooth profiles  for each one three joint surface sizes were considered: 64, 100 and 144 cm2  the same series of shear tests with dry joint surfaces was repeated with wetted discontinuity samples  some reduction was observed in peak shear strength values  tests with dry surfaces were simulated in numerical calculations that reproduced satisfactorily experimental results  size effect seems to be more important when normal stress is high  with low normal stress imbrication cohesion is influenced by sample size  some reflection is advisable to propose a transition from one situation to the other  calibration of numerical models with more laboratory tests will validate them to be used in later developments | 
2014-7172 	 forward and inverse modeling of ground surface uplift at in salah, algeria |abstract  in this work, we present results of coupled fluid flow and geomechanical modeling associated with the co2 injection at three different wells (kb-501, kb-502, kb-503) at in salah, algeria  our recent numerical studies focused on the kb- 502 co2 injection well, where a double-lobe uplift pattern has been observed in the ground-deformation data  the observed uplift patterns at kb-501 and kb-503 are different, with no clear influence of deep fracture zone mechanical response  in this study we improved our modeling with tough-flac considering inelastic deformations in the injection zone, which responds to a mohr- coulomb failure criterion  for the case of kb-502 we introduced a fracture zone, modeled as in past considering inelastic deformations, but including a more detailed failure criterion  in addition, we modeled a stress-dependent permeability and bulk modulus, according to a dual continuum model  mechanical and hydraulic properties of the injection reservoir and those of fracture zones at the three injection wells were determined through inverse modeling with itough2 by matching the simulated spatial and temporal evolution of uplift to the corresponding insar observations as well as by matching simulated and measured pressures  we found an excellent match between simulated and observed variables, with residuals well within the limit of the observation errors  the estimated values for the parameterized mechanical and hydraulic properties are in good agreement with previous numerical results | 
2014-7177 	 comparison of lumped mass and rigid body rockfall simulation models for the mardin castle, turkey |abstract  a comprehensive understanding of rockfall trajectories is the key to effectively control rockfall hazards  an important characteristic that distinguishes different rockfall models is the presentation of the rock block in the model  lumped mass models represent rock as a dimensionless point while rigid body models can consider block geometry in rockfall simulations  the potential blocks of the mardin castle are selected to study the differences between the lumped mass and the rigid body simulations  the trajectories of the lumped mass model are exactly the same for any size of blocks while rigid body models generate different rockfall paths and bounce height and run out distance accordingly  increase in block size and non-circularity, cause large divergence between lumped mass and rigid body models  more reliable and conservative protection measures can be designed according to the rigid body simulations | 
2014-7183 	 a smart way to build geomechanical models and analyze casing collapse during the petroleum field development |abstract  during the lifetime of an oil field, well integrity should be taken into account under the geomechanical perspective  this work shows the influence of geomechanical effects resulting from reservoir development over the integrity of a well, employing partially coupled fluid-mechanical simulations  this paper also presents a practical workflow, implemented in a gocad ambient as a plug-in, to perform the mesh building considering reservoir and adjacencies besides the data preprocessing for the geomechanical simulations  the submodeling technique was adopted to analyze the rock behavior around the well in a local model, and the casing response under the geomechanical effects observed in the global simulation  the well casing collapse was evaluated in the submodel by the von mises criterion  the simulation results showed the importance of employing a rigorous fluid-mechanical methodology in well integrity analysis, once the stress states in the well region were fairly affected by the accounting of geomechanical effects, reflecting on the casing yielding onset  the developed tool for pre-processing and finite element mesh generation allowed to perform geomechanical analyses in a simple and intuitive way, allowing the employment of the coupling methodology in the routine of reservoir engineers | 
2014-7187 	 field monitoring and modeling of co2 injection into an unmineable coal seam |abstract  the objective of the research work presented in this paper was to investigate the carbon dioxide (co2) migration and ground deformations caused by injection of co2 into an unmineable coal seam  a field sequestration site located in the northern appalachian basin was selected  an array of high-precision tiltmeters was deployed at the field site along with a set of gps stations to monitor ground movements and co2 migration during co2 injection  in addition to field instrumentation, three-dimensional fluid flow modeling coupled with geomechanics was performed to investigate co2 migration and to compute ground displacements  a comparison of ground movements obtained from tiltmeter array with modeling results is presented in this paper  results from the field monitoring and geomechanical models show ground uplift along the trajectories of co2 injection wells  results also show that advanced modeling methods combined with limited field instrumentation could be used for development of monitoring strategies that can be used for evaluation of long-term co2 storage | 
2014-7190 	 numerical analysis of acoustic emissions, the radiated energy and their moment tensors in triaxial deformation tests |abstract  a better understanding of the energy budget has important implications for enhancing the efficiency of hydraulic fracturing treatments  in particular, what percentage of the input treatment energy is released as radiated energy? what characterizes the deformation of the failure?  we use a bonded-particle modeling approach to investigate both the radiated energy release and the amount of brittle failure  to test our model, we simulate triaxial compression tests on calibrated sandstone samples  our results show that much of the failure is marked by a tensile component, despite the development of one or two large shear planes crosscutting the samples  additionally, only 2 5% of the input energy is radiated as seismic waves  we propose an updated empirical energy-magnitude relation: log er = 1 9mw +8 5, where er is the radiated energy and mw is the event moment magnitude  this relation is an alternative to the commonly used kanamori relationship and more applicable for the small-magnitude acoustic emissions in triaxial tests and likely microseismic events in hydraulic fracturing experiments, which are both marked by strong tensile deformation  close examination of the source mechanisms of the induced acoustic emissions reinforce the complex nature of the micromechanics behind rock fracturing in general, due to strong deviations of the local stress field from the applied external field | 
2014-7192 	 application to intact rock of the ottosen peak strength criterion |abstract  in this paper we apply to intact rock the four-parameter polyaxial criterion originally proposed by ottosen [1] for modelling the peak strength of concrete  the ottosen criterion is fitted to strength data at both the triaxial compression and triaxial extension stress states, and we use previously published polyaxial data sets to show how this might be done for rock  additionally, a novel relation between the 2d hoek-brown (hb) criterion [2] and the ottosen criterion is presented, and we show how this permits the use of the hb parameter m in place of polyaxial test data to determine the four parameters that govern the ottosen criterion  we suggest that the ottosen criterion is capable of modelling polyaxial rock strength with reasonable accuracy, generally within ±10%  | 
2014-7194 	 characterizing uniaxial compressive strength using bayesian updating |abstract  many parameters used in rock engineering design are characterized using objectively measured data, although at early design stages there often may be insufficient data available (epistemic uncertainty) to define the parameter in question  in such instances, the design process could benefit from the use of bayesian statistics where informative priors can be constructed from expert knowledge and then updated as further test data become available  in this paper we use small sample sizes of uniaxial compressive strength as an exemplar parameter that exhibits epistemic uncertainty to show how the bayesian updating takes place  we then use the example of the analysis of rock spalling around an underground opening to show how the results of bayesian analysis can be used to improve estimates of strength, leading to improved analysis of probability of failure | 
2014-7195 	 assessing unpredictability in the absence of objective data: an example using underground rock wedge instability |abstract  in this paper, we compare methods of analysing the instability of an underground wedge that is characterised by uncertain parameters, and draw conclusions regarding the ability of the methods to propagate uncertainty through the problem  assessment of underground rock wedge instability is a common problem in tunnelling and mining operations, and particularly during the early stages of a project may need to be performed when little or no objectively measured information is available  such lack of information represents epistemic uncertainty, and although it is often analysed using an aleatory (e g  probabilistic) model, this is known to be inappropriate  here, we use the vertex method – an extension of interval mathematics – to show how epistemic uncertainty can be propagated through the analysis  we also discuss the implications of using the vertex method as a means of efficiently allocating resources to additional investigation and testing | 
2014-7197 	 an aleatory model for in-situ stress variability: application to two dimensional stress |abstract  in-situ stress magnitude and orientation have long been analyzed separately using classical statistics, despite the fact that stress is a tensor, and it should be analyzed using tensor-related methods  in this paper we investigate the applicability of a two dimensional aleatory model that can handle the stress tensor as a single entity  firstly, a multivariate normal distribution of tensor components is assumed and the marginal probability functions of the eigen-parameters (principal stresses and rotational angle) derived  using published in-situ stress data, random stress tensors are generated to compare the distributions of eigen-parameters obtained using classical and tensor statistics  we conclude that for stress magnitude, these two methods give the identical results, whereas for orientation only tensor statistics gives the correct result  additionally, it is only tensor statistics that is invariant with regard to orientation of the coordinate system  therefore, we conclude that in practical cases that deal only with stress magnitude, either method can give reliable result, but any analysis involving principal stress orientation requires tensor statistics | 
2014-7199 	 methodology for stability analysis of large room-and- pillar panels |abstract  stability of large room-and-pillar panels, which is a function of mechanical response of typically large number of pillars and deformation of the overburden on the scale of the entire panel, could be a challenging problem to analyze because it requires consideration of deformation and damage of rock mass occurring at different length scales  panel stability is a function of response of both pillars and the overburden, and when the room-and-pillar panels collapse very often it is not clear if it is a consequence of pillar or overburden failure  two-scale analysis approach is presented here  pillars are analyzed first in a pillar-scale model with necessary discretization to represent stress-strain concentrations and high-strain gradients  the derived pillar stress-strain curves then are used in the panel-scale analysis of deformation and stress redistribution over the panel, in which the pillars are represented in an average sense (on the level of tributary area)  the methodology for approximation of pillar response and calculation of pillar average properties is presented in the paper  further, the “ground-reaction curve” approach is proposed for stability assessment of room-and-pillar panels | 
2014-7201 	 effect of variability on average rock-mass permeability |abstract  fluid flow in fractured rocks has been a very difficult problem that has stymied many workers  a major cause of this problem is the disconnect between the geology of fractured rocks and the assumptions of darcy’s law  darcy’s law is based on the average permeability over a uniform mass of rock or soil, but the permeability of fractured rock is anything but uniform, and tends to be log-normally distributed with a high degree of variability  darcy’s law requires the arithmetic mean permeability but log-normal distributions are centered around the geometric mean  if the variability is low, the geometric mean will be close to the arithmetic mean so that the error is not serious  however, if the variability is high, as is typical of fractured rock, the geometric mean can be several orders of magnitude lower than the arithmetic mean, resulting in profound error and failed calculations  this paper shows how to obtain the arithmetic mean of the log-normal distribution so that permeability data from fractured rock can be used in darcy’s law | 
2014-7202 	 a novel approach to upscaling elastic moduli in unconventional reservoirs |abstract  a new approach to upscaling and modeling of geomechanical properties using clusters has been set-up for vaca muerta formation in the neuquen basin of argentina  using wells with core and cross-dipole logging tools, a core calibrated anisotropic model of the formation has been established  clusters were determined from a logging suite comprising only gamma ray, compressional slowness, and bulk density in a key exploration well, and this cluster group was applied to several more wells in the study area  using microseismic data obtained from three of the wells in the study area with two fracturing stages each, the vertical extent of microseismic events was determined, and the clusters obtained through our analysis have been upscaled over this interval using backus averaging  all four upscaled wells show similar results by cluster for elastic stiffness coefficients and young’s moduli, with a very tight range of values  poisson’s ratio is more variable and a vague trend with the clusters is noticed  when compared to the core data, similar trends are observed in the stiffness coefficients and young’s moduli  these clusters have been used as geomechanical facies to populate a 3d mem which can be used to couple the petrophysical model for the study area, regional stress model, regional structure, and natural fracture network in order to combine the fully coupled geomechanics and flow effects in hydraulic fracturing treatments  the method we have developed allows for anisotropic properties to be applied over a wide area with limited available logging data | 
2014-7203 	 simulation and analysis of wellbore stability using flac for horizontal well drilling in shale formations |abstract  wellbore stability is of critical importance in all drilling operations  wellbore instability may cause stuck pipes, lost circulation, and/or collapse of the wellbore, resulting in high drilling cost and significant time loss  in this study, computer simulations using flac (fast lagrangian analysis of continua) were conducted on the stability of horizontal wells in shale formations  laboratory-tested geomechanical properties of seven shale samples and in-situ stress conditions collected from the literature were used  computer simulations were carried out to estimate minimum downhole pressures for maintaining wellbore integrity in each type of shale formation under different states of in-situ stresses  the results showed that the minimum downhole pressure to maintain wellbore stability is positively related to stress differentiation and pore pressure, and negatively related to internal frictional angle and cohesion of the surrounding rock  the determination of the minimum downhole pressure from the regression analyses may serve as a basis for engineers to quickly select proper mud density when drilling horizontal wells in potentially problematic rock formations, particularly shale formations |

2014-7258 	 tightly coupled fluid-structure interaction computational algorithm for hydraulic fracturing simulations |abstract  fracturing stimulation technologies allow the oil and gas industry to effectively use fracturing treatments to improve the production of many shale gas and oil reservoirs  because of pre-existing natural fractures in such reservoirs and their interactions with hydraulically induced fractures, hydraulic fracturing treatments often result in complex fracture networks (cfns)  the numerical simulation of hydraulic fracturing of these cfns is necessary for efficient and productive planning and development of such reservoirs  fundamentally, hydraulic fracturing simulation is a fluid-structure interaction (fsi) that includes the deformation and movement of rock blocks, the fluid flow in opened fractures, and their interactions  a comprehensive study of the physics and engineering aspects of the fsi still present a challenge primarily because of their strong non-linearity and multi-disciplinary nature  this paper presents a tightly coupled fsi numerical model and computational algorithm for hydraulic fracturing simulations in predetermined fracture networks | 
2014-7269 	 obtaining reliable estimates of intact tensile strength |abstract  in tensile and low confinement conditions, the tensile strength plays a critical role in crack initiation and propagation  being able to accurately determine the intact tensile strength as well as develop an appropriate failure criterion across the tensile and compressive (shear failure) regions, are critical components of any rock mechanics project  this paper presents a summary of both indirect and direct testing approaches to determine the intact tensile strength  a review of the reliability of each method as well as calibration factors to refine the estimates provided by indirect testing methods is presented  in order to more accurately capture the behaviour of the intact rock in the tensile region, a modified hoek-brown criterion consisting of a tension cutoff is introduced  such an approach utilizes the griffith theory of brittle failure and the generalized equation by fairhurst to define the tensile strength, and can easily be incorporated with current curve fitting methods  finally, a method for determining the tension cutoff for data sets without reliable tensile data is provided for preliminary assessment purposes | 
2014-7286 	 true triaxial tests in two porous sandstones: experimental failure characteristics and theoretical prediction |abstract  true triaxial tests have been carried out in two quartz-rich, high porosity, sandstones, coconino (n = 17 5%) and bentheim (n = 24%) by maintaining constant but different <u+03c3>2 and <u+03c3>3 and raising <u+03c3>1 until failure occurred (<u+03c3>1, peak)  for each constant <u+03c3>3 level, <u+03c3>2 was varied from test to test between <u+03c3>2 = <u+03c3>3 and <u+03c3>2 = <u+03c3>1  <u+03c3>1,peak for a given <u+03c3>3 increased with <u+03c3>2, reached a maximum (up to 15% higher than when <u+03c3>2 = <u+03c3>3), and then declined so that when <u+03c3>2 approached <u+03c3>1, <u+03c3>1, peak was about equal to its base value when <u+03c3>2 = <u+03c3>2  a separate series of tests was carried out using a novel loading path by maintaining constant lode angle t (= 0°)  this series of tests characterized the dependence of the octahedral shear stress at failure toct,f on the octahedral normal stress at failure <u+03c3>oct,f when <u+0398> = 0°  the latter tests were used to obtain the necessary parameters employed in a three-invariant failure theory proposed by rudnicki (2013)  the theory was then applied to predicting the variation of <u+03c3>1,peak with <u+03c3>2 for a given <u+03c3>3  the prediction reasonably replicated the typical ascending-then-descending <u+03c3>1,peak vs  <u+03c3>2 trend observed experimentally in both sandstones, confirming (with some limitations) the applicability of the rudnicki’s (2013) theory | 
2014-7307 	 physical model study of rotational failure modes of rock blocks |abstract  to study the importance of rotational modes of failure, the authors constructed physical models and tested them at different orientations  the study was carried out in three steps  first, a physical model was built consisting of two different tetrahedral block assemblies that could be placed on a tilt table  by systematically varying the orientation of the assembly on the tilt table and the slope angle of the tilt table, the block was tested to see how it would behave from rest, and each test was videotaped for subsequent analysis  next, the physical model tests that exhibited rotational failure modes and tests with similar block orientations were analyzed for stability analytically assuming sliding and lifting modes only  finally, the physical model test results were compared with the analytical results  the results of the physical model tests showed that the block failed by rotation in some cases, and in some of these cases, the analytical solution predicted a stable block  the results of this study suggest that rotational modes of failure may be the critical failure mode in some cases and should not be ignored | 
2014-7316 	 laboratory measurement of critical state hydraulic fracture geometry |abstract  understanding the geometry of a hydraulic fracture is key to predicting its behavior and performance  physical measurement of field hydraulic fracture geometries beyond the borehole is difficult and typically cost prohibitive with the only published examples being mine-back studies and cores  laboratory-scale hydraulic fracturing experiments can more accurately measure the fracture geometry due to smaller specimen size and improved monitoring capabilities  this paper presents laboratory work where hydraulic fracture treatments were performed using epoxy injection such that a propagating fracture could be stabilized and preserved at near-critical state  constant backpressure was applied after hydraulic breakdown but before cessation of fracture extension to maintain near-critical state geometry  preliminary results are presented giving measurement of fracture dimensions, including aperture, at the millimeter scale for a hydraulic fractured acrylic specimen  the pressure, flow rate, material strains, acoustic emissions, and video stills associated with this fracture are also presented and analyzed  a second experiment fracturing a 300<u+00d7>300<u+00d7>300 mm3 cubic foot granite block using epoxy is also discussed  data regarding the interaction between shear and tensile dominated fractures is presented and discussed |

2014-7394 	 estimation of reservoir stress effects due to injection of cold fluids: an example from ncs |abstract  a robust understanding of the thermal stress development due to injection of cold fluids is crucial when developing the asgard field on the norwegian continental shelf (ncs) offshore norway  to get a better and more direct estimation of the stress reduction, a series of triaxial tests under uniaxial strain control were conducted with cooling on reservoir core samples  the purpose of the testing program was to find elastic properties, thermal expansion coefficients and change in confining stress due to temperature reduction  the results show that the cooling related stress effect is strongly stress path dependent  as the sample is subjected to more cooling the stress state tends to approach an elasto-plastic formulation leading to a more soft response of the material  as a consequence the measured stress effect is lower than the estimated which was based on elastic state assumptions | 
2014-7395 	 representation of large scale network geometry with realistic apertures determined by mesoscale geomechanical modelling of a natural fracture system |abstract  a novel network growth model to construct larger scale fracture systems is developed  aperture distributions determined by mesoscale geomechanical modelling are also transformed for use in larger scale networks  the precise aperture characterisation of a mesoscale outcrop sample (2 m <u+00d7> 2 m) is obtained by applying boundary stresses using the combined finite-discrete element method (femdem)  the scaling behaviour of the rock sample is examined and quantified for different properties (e g  spatial organisation, length and aperture) using methodologies that employ power law and fractal geometry assumptions  to grow networks, rather than using the conventional stochastic network model, a self-referencing growth algorithm is developed to populate the geologically obtained pattern together with its geomechanically determined apertures  a larger fracture system (~ 50 m <u+00d7> 50 m) is constructed under a recursive scheme using random walkers to nucleate and propagate fractures in larger domains  permeability of fracture networks grown to various scales is investigated based on flow modelling by the hybrid finite element-finite volume method (fefvm)  to conclude, this paper presents an approach to estimate hydraulic properties of larger scale naturally fractured rock and has implications for upscaling network properties for reservoir simulation, where no representative elementary volume (rev) can be assumed | 
2014-7397 	 effects of cementation on in situ and core compaction of soft sandstone |abstract  laboratory experiments have been performed to simulate in situ and core compaction behavior of soft reservoir sandstones  fine-grained synthetic sandstones have been manufactured under simulated in situ stress conditions with various cement contents  a systematic study shows that in situ compaction is close to elastic only under initial conditions, and that plasticity develops gradually during compaction  two mechanisms control rock alteration as a result of stress release during coring: cement bond breakage, which leads to softer and more stress sensitive core material at low stresses, and grain rearrangement into a denser packing, leading to permanently reduced porosity and hence increased stiffness compared to in situ behavior  the relative importance of these mechanisms depends on the degree of cementation, on the coring stress path, and on the stress level  ultrasonic velocities have been measured and linked to time lapse seismic response of soft reservoirs and to the feasibility of predicting it with core material  time dependent (creep) deformation has been observed, and appears related to the evolution of plastic strain | 
2014-7398 	 a creepy model for creep |abstract  time-delayed deformation in rock is a common phenomenon which complicates interpretation of laboratory tests and creates uncertainty when results from laboratory tests are applied in the field  it is therefore desirable to include such effects in constitutive models used to describe rock behavior  one such model is the formel model, which was developed to describe relationships between static and dynamic moduli of sandstones  the model has primarily been applied for prediction of stiffness and strength based on log data  in this study, we have introduced creep in the formel model by recognizing that local failure events which induce non-elastic deformation may trigger new events of local failure and subsequently more non-elastic deformation, and assuming that each cycle in this chain of events has a fixed and finite duration  the resulting model possesses all basic features of delayed deformation – transient creep and possibly steady state and accelerating creep – depending only on the stress level  this extension of the model also introduces strain rate effects | 
2014-7399 	 failure mechanics of anisotropic shale during brazilian tests |abstract  experiments have been performed with mancos shale under brazilian tensile test conditions, addressing the effect of the angle between layer or bedding planes and the loading direction  a high-speed camera with digital image correlation software is used in combination with acoustic emission recording to monitor the fracture initiation and growth processes during loading  although a clear anisotropy is observed in the variation of the p-wave velocity with the inclination angle, a significant effect on the brazilian tensile strength is not observed  the mode of failure depends however on sample orientation  for all specimens, a main diametrical central fracture is induced first  it originates in the middle of the specimen and grows as a straight line or as a zig-zag line, depending on the orientation of the sample with respect to load direction  the zig-zag fracture is then a combination of a fracture along the weak direction and in other directions  its evolution is an order of magnitude slower than that of a brittle straight diametrical central fracture | 
2014-7401 	 shale smearing at the borehole wall during drilling |abstract  when drilling through shales, the borehole wall is fully exposed to the actions of the rotating drillstring and stabilizers, which can affect the wellbore stability  in the present work, we report a scanning electron microscopy (sem) and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (edx) study of how the shale borehole wall is affected by prolonged exposure to a rotating drillstring/stabilizer and circulating mud during drilling  a for-purpose built pressurized cell was used to expose the samples to drilling conditions, and drilling-induced damages were preserved by fluorescent epoxy after the experiment  the samples were thereafter dried, and the zone closest to the hole was investigated by sem and edx  it was found that the strongly rotating drillstring/stabilizer caused shale "smearing" in the near-hole region, meaning that loosened shale fragments were re-deposited onto the borehole wall  this smear effect may have a stabilizing effect for a certain timeframe, and it is important to investigate the stability regarding further downhole operation in a well  this material may slow down migration of mud into the borehole wall, and thus contribute to stabilization of the borehole |

2014-7405 	 size effects on triaxial testing from sidewall cores for petroleum geomechanics |abstract  core samples obtained from sidewall coring hardly meet the specifications for strength or elastic property measurements as described in astm or isrm  however, strength and elastic properties obtained from sidewall core samples during triaxial testing conditions are important in drilling, completion and reservoir modeling  past percussion and advanced rotary coring wireline tools have been used to cut 25 4 mm (1 0-in) plug samples, but recent advances in technology have made it possible to obtain 38 1 mm (1 5-in) plug samples from openhole wellbores  correcting for unconfined compressive strength (ucs) obtained from core plugs with length-to-diameter ratios of less than 2 is well established using the astm correction factor (1986)  the suitable correction factor to apply for confined compressive strengths (ccs) and its associated elastic properties during triaxial loading is not well studied  this study focuses on the aforementioned challenging test consideration by investigating the effect of size during triaxial confining conditions |

2014-7413 	 particle flow modeling of roof deformation for a room-and-pillar coal mine |abstract  the occurrence of roof falls in underground mines has been reduced, largely to improvements in roof bolt technology, but continue to be a common source of mining-related injuries and fatalities  particle flow modeling is an effective tool for simulating rock processes and behaviors related to mining activities  in this study, particle flow modeling is used to simulate the deformation of a roof layer in a room-and-pillar mine  shale and sandstone models are compared, as are different roof bolt configuration scenarios  as input parameters would predict, the shale roof models deform more than the sandstone roof models  greater bolt spacing is also associated with greater maximum deformation of the roof layer  similar, more detailed studies of this nature could be used for predictive modeling to mitigate the risk of catastrophic roof falls in underground mines and to optimize the bolt configuration for unique mine factors | 
2014-7416 	 evaluation of wellbore cement integrity in contact with high temperature brine |abstract  strength retrogression occurs in cements at high temperatures when calcium silicate hydrate phase in hydrated cement converts to alpha dicalcium silicate hydrate phase  the higher the temperature, the quicker the rate of transformation of calcium silicate hydrates  this conversion changes the structure of the hydrated cement leading to increased porosity, permeability and lowered compressive strength  the real problem lies in the great increase of permeability which makes the cement conductive to corrosive formation fluids and therefore impairs the primary function of cement as hydraulic barrier material  class h cement cores (water to cement ratio: 0 38) with slurry density of 1 97 g/cc (16 40 ppg) were cured at constant temperatures of 90 °c and 100% relative humidity over a period of 28 days  in addition, cores with same slurry design were cured in water bath at ambient conditions for 28 days as control samples  higher permeability values in cement cores cured at high temperature shows the onset of strength retrogression  lower vickers hardness measured in the cement sample cured confirms the onset of strength retrogression  this is as a result of packing of large, coarse calcium silicate hydrate crystals observed using scanning electron microscopic imaging technique |

2014-7426 	 complex variables bem modeling of three-dimensional crack problems |abstract  the paper presents further developments of the boundary element technique for solving three-dimensional problems of piecewise homogeneous elastic media containing multiple cracks of arbitrary non-planar shapes (previous results were reported in [1, 2])  in the developed technique, the elastic fields are represented by integral identities  triangular elements are used to discretize the boundaries and polynomial (linear and quadratic) approximations of the unknown variables are adopted  in-plane components of the fields and geometrical parameters are arranged in various complex-valued combinations to simplify the integration  no singular integrals are involved since the limit, as the field point approaches the boundary, is taken after the integration  analytical integration over each element is reduced to that over the contour of the element via application of cauchy- pompeiu representation [3]  the collocation method is used to set up the system of linear algebraic equations to find the boundary unknowns  geoengineering applications of the method are discussed | 
2014-7433 	 a numerical study of critical parameters that affect stability of a cavity induced by borehole mining |abstract  a finite difference method (flac2d) and dimensional analysis have been applied to study a cavity developed through hydro-excavation of a mineral resource during borehole mining  the structural impact of differential internal fluid pressures on the cavity periphery has been numerically modeled  the research is focused on the effect of critical factors associated with the mining process on the largest principal stress in the rock (around the cavity roof)  the goal was to observe the effect of cavity dimension, internal pressure (cavity pressurization), k (horizontal stress/vertical stress), vacuum (negative pressure), depth and method of extraction on the induced maximum principal stress  it was concluded that increasing internal pressure, cavity length, and depth of cover will significantly increase the induced maximum principal stress around the cavity  applying negative pressure will cause stress concentration to move from roof of the cavity to the sidewalls and corners of the cavity  increasing internal fluid pressure inside the cavity will increase the induced shear stress at the cavity roof corner | 
2014-7434 	 modeling particle mobilization in unconsolidated formations due to fluid injection |abstract  high injection rates in water injectors leads to mobilization of particles in unconsolidated formations and creates preferential flow paths within the porous medium  channelization in porous medium occurs when fluid-induced stresses become locally larger than a critical threshold (rock stress); grains are then dislodged and carried away, hence porosity and permeability of the medium will be altered along the induced flow paths  additionally, rapid shut-ins result in pressure imbalance between the wellbore and formation  flowback of the particles results in sand accumulation, and consequently loss of injectivity, which is a common problem in unconsolidated formations like the ones in deep water gulf of mexico  experimental studies have confirmed the presence of dependent and independent flow patterns; however, there is no integrated model to describe flow patterns and predict probable issues for water injection at the reservoir scale  the objective of this study is to provide a model for a channel initiation/propagation during injection and flowback in injection wells  a finite volume model is developed based on multiphase fraction volume concept that decomposes porosity into mobile and immobile phases where these phases change spatially and evolve over time that leads to development of erosional channels in radial patterns depending on injection rates, viscosity, magnitude of in situ stresses and rock properties  the model accounts for both particle releasing and suspension deposition  the developed model explains injectivity change with injection rates observed in unconsolidated reservoirs | 
2014-7437 	 correlating geomechanical properties of the bakken formation rocks with lithofacies and sequence |abstract  successful production of oil and gas from shale reservoirs and other tight reservoirs largely depends on the artificially-created fractures  the quality of the artificial fractures is determined by the geomechanical properties of the formation  ductile behavior of the formation rocks presents a challenge in hydraulic fracturing, while sections with brittle behavior are the priority for fracturing operation  if the mechanical properties of the formation can be predicted without additional drilling, the hydraulic fracturing process can be better optimized economically  utilizing the example of the bakken formation, this paper investigated the regularity of the geomechanical properties and its correlation with the stratigraphic sequence  more than 160 bakken samples of different depths from 8 wells were collected and used in laboratory tests  geomechanical properties of these samples were measured  based on the test results, these samples were categorized either as ductile or brittle  then the variation of their geomechanical properties was correlated with the stratigraphic sequence  this correlation was established in order to provide an explanation to the variation of the brittle characteristic of the rocks  since the general stratigraphic sequence model of the bakken formation is already identified and mapped by previous researchers, this correlation provides an approach to predict the geomechanical properties in different intervals of the formation, and offers support in selecting, designing, and optimizing the hydraulic fracturing operation  the methodology developed in this paper can be also applied in other tight reservoirs and formations |

2014-7443 	 toward an objective method of determining in situ stress from wellbore features |abstract  generally, the features used to evaluate horizontal stresses (breakouts, difs, on-gauged sections, lots) only give one equation  this means that the methods that evaluate horizontal stresses by focusing at one depth cannot be used to determine the stress state as one equation is lacking  other methods assume relations between horizontal stresses and depth and evaluate the constants of these relations for the computed stresses to match well features  they are expert-dependent  this paper presents a new method to determine horizontal stresses that takes the best of both existing methods without having their drawbacks  it assumes relations between the horizontal stress magnitudes and depth based on geology and plots all well features into one single stability diagram  then a statistical analysis allows calculating the constants of the relations and determining which features are effectively explained by the stress state and which are not  this method can be used to determine the stress state from features observed in more than one well and its results only depend on a priori assumptions and not on a posteriori expert decisions | 
2014-7445 	 the estimation of the maximum horizontal differential stress and its depth in the local lithosphere |abstract  the horizontal differential stress (hds) in the lithosphere is mainly caused by plate motion  with depth increasing, the stress increases to the maximum and then decreases due to the fast rock creep rate at high temperatures  the maximum hds and its depth may be related to the focal depth of earthquakes  hence, studying the maximum hds and its depth is helpful to understand stress environment of the focal zone  knowing the stress gradient with increased depth in local lithosphere is one of important issues  in this study, the estimation of the maximum hds as well as its depth in a region of western china was shown  the stress gradient with depth in local lithosphere was obtained by in-situ stress measurement using hydraulic fracturing method in 18 deep boreholes  as a consequence, the maximum hds as well as its depth was determined by confining temperatures and mineral flow laws  the maximum hds in the local lithosphere was 127~690 mpa at around 23~49 km depth due to rock compositions  the depth was highly possible close to local focus depth of most earthquakes before wenchuan mw7 9 earthquake |

2014-7451 	 analytical solution for rock cutting taking into account backrake, siderake, confining pressure and cutter bluntness |abstract  rock cutting mechanics has been studied in order to better understand drilling process in cutter scale  the cutting energy is mainly dependent of cutter orientation and rock properties  it was previously reported in the literature that specific energy is strongly dependent of backrake and siderake  although there have been good attempts to develop an analytical solution to describe the cutting process, the siderake effects are not taken into account  this paper proposes an analytical solution for the rock cutting considering both backrake and siderake  the proposed model is considered for sharp and blunt cutters agrees with data described in literature  with the new model, specific energy can be predicted for any cutter orientation  focusing on a parametric study for two hypothetical rocks, the model has shown that higher backrakes and/or siderakes increase the specific energy in a exponential-like trend  the backrake effect is strongly dependent of the rock internal friction angle though  the effects depth of cut and confining pressure were also investigated  moreover, the effects of cutter bluntness are presented through the e-s diagram | 
2014-7452 	 semi-analytical model of an umbrella arch employed in hydrostatic tunnelling conditions |abstract  the mechanistic response of an umbrella arch (ua) support system that is used as a portion of the overall temporary support in poor tunneling conditions (weak/loose ground/subsidence prone zones) is not currently well understood  this paper compares existing empirical solutions to existing semi-analytical solutions related to ua support systems  the results of such a comparison illustrates the fact that most of the existing models have been designed according to conditions associated with shallow excavations  to date, there is no generally accepted empirical model has been produced in order to incorporate and capture the effects of an umbrella arch installed at depths  therefore, in order to analyze the mechanistic response of an umbrella arch system in squeezing ground conditions at depth, a three dimensional (3d) finite difference numerical model was created  a parametric analysis was conducted on the interaction parameters (stiffness parameter in the normal and shear direction of the forepole elements that constituted the ua) to find a possible range of ua element deflection profiles  these deflection profiles were then used to test and modify the pre-existing semi-analytical response  the results of this study produced a new semi-analytical model for umbrella arches installed in squeezing ground conditions | 
2014-7453 	 challenges in determination of brazilian test rock specimens surface displacements by using digital image cross correlation |abstract  the difficulties associated with applying the digital image processing techniques and in particular digital image cross correlation (dic) to determine the surface displacements of rock specimens in brazilian tests are discussed in this study  in recent years, advanced digital imaging tools and techniques have opened new horizons to capture and monitor surface and even internal displacement fields  dic is a noncontact method to determine displacements between two successive digital images taken from a loaded specimen at two different strain levels  though the fundamentals of the dic technique seem to be simple, in practice determination of small surface displacements on rock specimens could be a challenging task due to image noise, image resolution, surface texture, etc  in this research, the effect of image resolution, camera and lens types, different surface textures, and data interpolation to reach sub-pixel accuracy were studied  the results show that results are highly sensitive to the surface texture, size of the charge-coupled device (ccd) of the camera, and employing sub pixel accuracy generates smoother displacement contours  moreover, in case of rigid body motion of the specimen using zoom lenses does not show any significant effect on the obtained displacements | 
2014-7454 	 three-dimensional roughness characterization of rock joints using laser scanning and wind diagrams |abstract  this paper presents 3d desktop laser scanning as a tool for roughness characterization of rock joints, in conjunction with traditional 2d contour gauge profiles  four specimens representing four different rock types (schist, granite, slate, and sandstone) and roughness values were characterized  the 2d roughness profiles are presented along with the jrc values assigned through comparison with standard jrc profiles  the 3d laser scan data are used to generate files containing the strike, dip angle, and dip direction of thousands of individual facets  the data are presented using traditional histograms of dip angle (irrespective of direction), and as wind plots that allow effective visualization of both magnitude and direction of the dip of the facets  the wind plots are used to highlight the similarities and differences of the specimens, and also between scans of the same specimen before and after being subjected to a direct shear test | 
2014-7455 	 measurement and analysis of full-scale hydraulic fracture initiation and fracture reorientation |abstract  hydraulic fracture breakdown and reorientation data collected from two test instrumented borehole sites have been analyzed to assess the effect of the initiation type on the treating pressure  vertical boreholes were drilled and fractures were placed in a conglomerate at depths of 140 to 180 meters into a far-field stress field that favored horizontal fracture growth  axial initiation resulted in high injection pressures, as a result of near-borehole tortuosity generated as the hydraulic fracture reoriented to align with the far-field stresses  a fracture initiation analysis determined that initiation at the abrasively cut slots should occur before axial initiation  acoustic scanner logging of the boreholes after fracturing demonstrated that, in many cases, axial initiation occurred and when this was the case, treating pressures were high and consistent with near-borehole tortuous fracture paths  transverse initiation from the vertical boreholes at pre-cut slots lowered the injection pressures by up to 12 mpa for water injected at approximately 500 liters per minute | 
2014-7458 	 the effects of size, chamfer geometry, and back rake angle on frictional response of pdc cutters |abstract  single polycrystalline diamond compact (pdc) cutter tests were conducted with cutters of different diameters and chamfer sizes on carthage marble rock samples at pressurized conditions  the cutter size does not seem to affect the frictional response; however, the chamfer size has a considerable influence on the friction and aggressiveness of the cutter  unlike the normal force, the cutting force was observed to be insensitive to the chamfer size for the same cut depth, in the tested conditions  data analysis was performed and resulted in introducing an empirical relationship between the cutter back rake angle and the friction angle  this was then used to obtain the equivalent back rake angle for each chamfered cutter as a function of cut depth  the empirical relationship was also used to clarify the relation between the shear angle and back rake angle  the relationship was then combined with a recently developed analytical model for rock cutting to develop a combined model that accounts for the complex relationship between back rake angle and friction angle on the face of cutter  the combined model demonstrates decent predictability for shale    this study has significant implications in cutter design, as it provides a more robust semi-empirical basis to account for the cutter geometry  it is also useful in enhancing current pdc bit simulations | 
2014-7459 	 creep constitutive modeling applied to the stability of pre-salt wellbores through salt layers |abstract  salt rock mechanics has long been recognized as important in potash mining  currently the petroleum engineering industry in brazil is facing challenges related to this rock  discoveries of carbonate reservoirs sealed by thick salt rock layers motivated researchers to consolidate background and workflows  accessing pre-salt reservoirs means drilling through salt rock layers, hence special methodologies are required to evaluate the stability and integrity of wellbores  salt rock has a different behavior than common sedimentary rocks, requiring special attention to deformation and dissolution  from a mechanical point of view, creep is one of the most important deformation mechanisms of salt rock in mining and petroleum engineering  state variables such as stress state and temperature are determinant for creep response  a representative constitutive model for creep in salt rock is particularly important in order to predict and prevent operational problems due to excessive displacements, such as the necessity of new drillings, stuck pipe or even wellbore loss  three power-law-based creep constitutive models are investigated based on finite element simulations: norton's power law, double mechanism creep law and multi mechanism deformation creep law  the commercial finite element code abaqus® is adopted as the simulation tool, in which both double mechanism and multi mechanism creep models are coded as user subroutines  a creep analysis along an interval of pre-salt wellbore located at campos basin is carried out to compare the creep laws  numerical results are compared to caliper data  the performance of the multi mechanism deformation creep model is highlighted | 
2014-7460 	 fully coupled flow and geomechanics model for fractured porous media |abstract  : a fully implicit method for coupled fluid flow and geomechanical deformation in fractured porous media is presented  finite-volume and finite-element discretization schemes are used, respectively, for the flow and mechanics problems  the discrete flow and mechanics problems share the same conformal unstructured mesh  the network of natural fractures is represented explicitly in the mesh  the behavior of the fractured medium due to changes in the fluid pressure, stress, and strain fields is investigated  the methodology is validated using simple cases for which analytical solutions are available, and also using more complex "realistic" test cases | 
2014-7462 	 effects of formation anisotropy on borehole stress concentrations: implications to drilling induced tensile fractures |abstract  this study investigates the impacts of rock anisotropy (mainly transverse isotropy, ti) on the near-wellbore stress distribution and the consequential creation of drilling induced tensile fractures (ditf)  first, by utilizing an earlier analytical solution, a theoretical model has been successfully developed and implemented in conducting sensitivity studies  this model is applicable to any specific borehole orientation, rock anisotropy, and in-situ stress conditions  the results indicate that the ti medium can significantly influence the stress concentration around the wellbore, and consequently, affects the onset of borehole failure  second, a tensile fracture tracing program has been coded based on the stress model coupled with ong’s wellbore-stability design code  parametric studies lead to the following findings: i) en echelon tensile fractures appear in asymmetrical pairs, ii) fracture trajectories depend on the formation anisotropy  finally, this model can help constrain in-situ states of stress incorporating with the ditf observed in image logs | 
2014-7463 	 the effect of co2-related diagenesis on geomechanical failure parameters: fracture testing of co2-altered reservoir and seal rocks from a natural analog at crystal geyser, utah |abstract  fracture mechanical tests on samples collected from the crystal geyser field site, utah indicate that sandstones naturally bleached by co2-rich fluids have significantly lower fracture toughness values than adjacent, unaltered sandstones whereas altered and unaltered caprock siltstones collected from the site yield similar values  both the short rod (sr) and double torsion (dt) test methods give comparable results for multiple test specimens from the same samples  co2-related alteration at the crystal geyser field site is reflected in the bulk mineralogy of siltstone samples collected near fossil co2 seeps and primarily characterized by an increase in calcite  dissolution of fe-cements, along with the remobilization and precipitation of secondary carbonates and clays noted by petrography, are likely responsible for the geomechanical weakening effect in sandstones  subcritical crack index, another fracture parameter obtained from the dt test, is also affected by co2-related alteration  these results suggest that long-term mechanical behavior of co2 reservoir and seal rocks may be affected by interaction with co2-rich fluids requiring the consideration of coupled chemical-geomechanical processes and time-dependent geomechanical behavior in co2 reservoir simulations | 
2014-7464 	 displacement discontinuity method modelling of hydraulic fracturing with pre-existing fractures |abstract  hydraulic fracturing has been an essential technique for enhancing production in oil, gas and geothermal reservoirs for decades  constructive interactions between induced fractures by hydraulic stimulation and pre-existing ones are critical to the success of stimulation treatment and understanding this complex process remains a challenging task  a coupled hydro-mechanical (hm) process has been implemented based on the existing fracture mechanics modeling code fracod (fracture propagation code) where the displacement discontinuity method (ddm) is used to simulate rock fracturing processes  in the paper, we presented theoretical foundation of the code with the focus on the implementation of hm coupling  two verification cases were provided in which the fracod results show a very good agreement with the analytical ones from kirsch solution and the hydraulic fracturing process in intact rock has been successfully modelled  finally, two demonstration examples were conducted to simulate the hydraulic fracturing in fractured rock mass to account for the interaction between induced and natural fractures | 
2014-7465 	 influence of high velocity jet on drilling performance of pdc bit under pressurized condition |abstract  experimental study of a two cutters pdc bit-rock interaction shows that increase in the confining pressure reduces rop through two mechanisms  the negative influences of confining pressure on the bit performance in addition to the rock strengthening under elevated borehole pressure (bhp), is the accumulation of crushed cuttings material in between the face of bit cutters and rock surface in the zone of penetration  the flow of crushed cuttings material on the surface of the pdc cutter causes additional confinement of the rock surface in the zone of the penetration due to friction   on the other hand, utilizing a bit with an appropriate jet flow significantly improves rop  in order to maximize the positive effect of bottom hole cleaning on rop, the jet velocity has been raised to achieve cavitation condition by reducing the pressure with a high flow velocity ahead of the nozzles  however, the experimental results indicate that there are optimal conditions for applying a high velocity jet flow ahead of the bit, which yields maximum rop when the cutters penetrate the rock mainly under the chamfer  after the effective cuttings removal condition, further increase in jet velocity no longer assists the bit to penetrate the rock faster | 
2014-7466 	 near-surface principal stress trajectories in alpine valleys (grimsel region, switzerland) as inferred from exfoliation fracture plumose structure axes and numerical modeling |abstract  in this study we will show how fractographic (i e , fracture surface morphology) data of exfoliation fractures (i e , fractures subparallel to landscape surfaces limited to near-surface rock masses) and three-dimensional numerical modeling can be used to infer orientations of principal rock mass stresses in topographically complex alpine areas  analysis of exfoliation fracture plumose axes, i e , fractographic features that indicate main fracture propagation directions, and supposed local maximum compressive principal stress (<u+03c3>1) orientations at the time of fracture formation, suggests complex directional trends of near-surface <u+03c3>1 within trough valleys of the grimsel region (central swiss alps)  we investigated near-surface stress tensors with a threedimensional, elastic numerical model to 1  deduce evidence that plumose axes form parallel to <u+03c3>1 in an overall compressive (farfield) stress field, and to 2  increase our knowledge of near-surface stress orientations in alpine settings  model results illustrate that superposition of topographic stresses with realistic horizontal strains reveals complex near-surface s1 trajectories that widely follow the patterns of plumose axes  the model results demonstrate large variations of stress orientations, which cannot be captured by small numbers of classical stress measurements  in-situ stress measurements support exfoliation fracture formation under compression and principal stress directions as inferred from our numerical model | 
2014-7467 	 on the temporal stress field of the active fault system by boundary element method – a case study of central taiwan area for 1935~1999 |abstract  the displacement discontinuity method is particularly suitable to model crack and fault problems, as it possesses the property that the displacements at the two sides of the element are discontinuous, physically very similar to a crack or a fault  in this study, the displacement discontinuity was applied to simulate the transition of the fault system in central taiwan from 1935 to 1999  and the results properly show the transition of regional stress field and the propagation of the faulting during the 1999 chi-chi earthquake  in order to assess and mitigate the risk of active fault induced earthquake in the future, it is essential to more reasonably link the stress analysis and risk analysis  a probabilistic algorithm was coupled with the displacement discontinuity method, and the coupled method was applied to the reliability-based risk analyses, with the consideration of uncertainties of mechanical and geometrical parameters |

2014-7479 	 perturbation to borehole trajectory across an interface |abstract  the sudden change in drilling conditions taking place at an interface between two rock layers creates parasitic forces and moments at the bit, which locally perturb the borehole trajectory  this perturbation can be determined by coupling a bit/rock interaction law with a model for the bottom-hole assembly (bha)  in this paper a linear bit/rock interaction that accounts for the difference of rock properties across the interface is developed and coupled with a bha model, simplified on account that the positions of the stabilizers are assumed fixed in position when computing the influence of the interface at the length scale of the bit  the bha is then modeled by springs that prevent the bit from moving freely  the theoretical predictions for a cylindrically-shaped bit are consistent with experimental results reported in the literature  a preliminary study on the influence of the main parameters influencing the perturbation is also presented | 
2014-7482 	 study of cyclic loading effects on the creep and dilation of natural rock salt |abstract  the solution mining research institute (smri) has recently embarked on inquiries into the effect cyclic loading (both mechanical and thermal) might have on salt  some of this interest stems from the concept of using salt caverns as a storage medium for renewable energy projects (e g , compressed air energy storage [caes] with wind power) where daily pressure cycles in the cavern are conceivable as opposed to the seasonal cycles expected for typical natural gas storage projects  respec and the institut fur aufbereitung und deponietechnik (chair for waste disposal technologies and geomechanics) at clausthal university of technology (tuc) jointly executed a rock mechanics laboratory study using both facilities for performing triaxial cyclic loading creep tests on rock salt recovered from the avery island mine in louisiana, usa   the cyclic triaxial creep tests were performed under various load paths including compression, extension, and compression/extension  in addition, the tests were performed under both dilative and non-dilative stress regimes  the cyclic compression creep data was compared to static creep tests performed under similar conditions and the results indicated that the cycling of the applied stress did not have a dramatic effect on the specimen’s creep rate as long as the applied stress was not in the dilational regime  furthermore, the cyclic compression tests were compared to a numerically simulated creep test at the same stress and temperature conditions, and the comparison matched closely for the nondilational loading segment | 
2014-7484 	 a novel direct measurement of formation pore pressure |abstract  this study is to analyze pore pressure data acquired with a novel measurement system that is installed for a pilot test just outside a cased well within a sand formation in the north sea  the system uses a wireless communication through casing to transfer measured data from well outside to inside  long-term trend in the measured pore pressure is consistent with a formation-testing-based estimate  on the other hand, the measured pressure and temperature show rather high oscillation in short-period scale, especially during shut-ins  finite element (fe) modeling study is performed in order to understand this behavior  we find that the oscillation is caused mostly by thermal effects in the tubing, not by any abnormal formation pressure, during injection  the fe modeling study also shows that the thermally-induced pressure oscillation can be removed, and the formation pore pressure is recovered  finally, the fe modeling study is extended to explore potential behavior of the pressure data when the system is installed in shale formation | 
2014-7485 	 impact of reservoir properties on magnitude of seismic events induced due to co2 injection |abstract  while the supercritical co2 injection technology has been successfully employed for utilization operations such as enhanced oil recovery, there are some social and technical challenges with its large-scale implementation for storage purposes  induced seismicity due to co2 injection is one of primary concerns associated with the technology and it needs to be properly addressed  in this study, a set of 2d coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical (thm) modeling was performed to investigate the effects of the reservoir porosity and thickness on the magnitude of induced seismic events  the model included a limited-dimension pre-existing fault which cannot be easily detected by geophysical surveys  the numerical modeling was used to simulate changes in the stress distribution in the reservoir, fault and surrounding rock due to co2 injection  the fault slip obtained from the model was then correlated to the magnitude of earthquake for each case  three reservoir thicknesses and three reservoir porosities were examined in parametric studies  the results showed that thin reservoirs have higher probability of failure and will result in larger-magnitude induced seismic events  reservoirs with higher porosity were shown to have longer rupture time and larger events | 
2014-7486 	 an integrative numerical modeling framework for attacking sand production problem |abstract  this paper presents a comprehensive numerical modeling framework integrating macroscopic continuum and microscopic discontinuum numerical modeling methodologies  the continuum model is formulated on the poro-elastic-plastic theory in combination of erosion law  the discontinuum model couples discrete element method with pore-scale fluid flow model (e g , lattice boltzmann method)  the microscopic discontinuum model can capture most primary hydromechanical physics occurring in the sand production process but its computation cost is very expensive, so it is used to develop erosion laws through performing extensive parametric study in modeling small-sized problems  the developed erosion laws are integrated into the continuum model to investigate real-sized problems  the theoretical formulations of the poromechanics and erosion laws are briefly reviewed  the discrete element – lattice boltzmann coupling scheme is described with a couple of examples demonstrating its suitability in serving as a virtual laboratory for erosion law improvement or calibration | 
2014-7487 	 geophysical investigation of shear failure along cohesive-frictional rock discontinuities |abstract  cohesion debonding and friction mobilization along discontinuities are studied in the laboratory by monitoring seismic wave propagation through a discontinuity and measuring slip displacements using digital image correlation (dic)  slip was imposed on two individual blocks of gypsum through a contact surface that had both cohesion and friction  investigation of slip was carried out by acquiring transmitted and reflected compressional, p-, and shear, s-, waves prior to and during failure of the specimens  dic was used to monitor the discontinuity by measuring the surface displacement field  direct shear experiments performed on gypsum specimens with cohesion revealed that debonding (loss of cohesion) occurred before the peak shear strength was reached, and that friction mobilization and cohesion debonding do not occur simultaneously along the discontinuity  in fact, the amount of slip that is induced due to debonding is an order of magnitude smaller than the slip needed for mobilizing the full frictional strength of the discontinuity  the loss of cohesion has distinct seismic signatures and resulted in a significant decrease in transmitted amplitude, an increase in the reflected amplitude, a significant reduction in wave velocity, and a sudden reduction of the dominant frequency of the waveforms for both compressional and shear waves | 
2014-7488 	 numerical simulation of rock-loading machine interaction |abstract  the interaction of the loading machine and rock specimen is studied in this paper  the rock is modeled as a bonded particle discrete element system, while the machine is discretized using finite elements  three aspects of rock-machine interaction including the effect of machine stiffness, end platen friction coefficient, and sample aspect ratio will be investigated  it is illustrated that the machine stiffness can drastically change the post-peak stress-strain curve; a soft machine underestimates the slope of the post-peak curve  the numerical results suggest that by increasing the sample aspect ratio, the effect of end platen friction can be reduced  furthermore, it is observed that end friction is the main reason for the phenomenon of deterministic size effect and this size effect can be effectively removed if the end friction can be reduced to zero | 
2014-7489 	 quantifying rockmass behavioral uncertainty for geotechnical baseline reports |abstract  the expected ground conditions in a geotechnical baseline report (gbr) are one of the most important aspects of any tunneling project – both from the owner and the contractor perspectives  however, often the expected ground conditions are presented with either a list of intact rock parameters, rockmass classification systems, or a limited number of domains along the tunnel alignment, all of which do not adequately capture the variability in the actual rockmass behavior  this paper presents a new method of incorporating the expected rockmass behavior along a tunnel alignment, where three critical geomechanics parameters (the in-situ stress, rock strength, and rockmass structure), are used to determine the entire range of rockmass behavior  a case study is applied to quantify the likelihood of each rockmass behavior occurring per individual tunnel domain along a tunnel alignment, producing one to four rockmass behaviors in each domain  the increased qualitative and quantitative knowledge of the expected ground conditions may improve project scheduling and costing, construction planning, and reduce the possibility of a differing site condition claim | 
2014-7493 	 design of rock mass excavations ? new guidelines from the swedish transport administration |abstract  the swedish transport administration is currently updating a handbook on the design of rock excavations for road and rail infrastructure  the aim of the handbook is to provide guidelines and practical engineering tools for the planning and design of rock mass excavations  this paper describes the content of the handbook regarding (i) description of the rules and regulations, and how these affect the design work of rock mass excavations, (ii) guidelines to describe the type of design activities that should be implemented during the planning, , constructions and operational (management) stages, with respect to the design of the load-bearing structure, (iii) description of how the input data to the design can be developed and presented during various steps in the process, and (iv) description of suitable design methodology and appropriate design methods for reinforcement for rock tunnels and rock slopes | 
2014-7494 	 elastic waves that propagate along fracture intersections |abstract  fracture intersections provide connectivity among fractures and fracture sets, yet few studies have focused on methods to characterize intersections and the response of intersections to changes in stress  an experimental investigation was performed to determine if distinct elastic-wave modes exist that propagate along fracture intersections  ultrasonic waves propagated along the intersection between two orthogonal, synthetic fractures in aluminum were compared with waves that were propagated through the bulk and along single fractures as a function of stress  intersections give rise to several elastic-wave modes not observed for a single fracture that are sensitive to contact points along an intersection, i e , a linear non-welded contact  in addition, observation of the intersection waves is affected by the relationship between the applied external loading configuration and the polarization of the shear wave source  intersection waves have the potential to provide a new method for monitoring the condition of fracture intersections | 
2014-7499 	 numerical modeling of wellbore closure by the creep of rock salt caprocks |abstract  the viscous character of rock salt can cause problems during drilling and well construction operations, but can be favorable during well abandonment  the natural process of salt creep can reinstate the integrity of rock salt caprocks and create an additional well barrier  the method requires removing of a part of the casing set across a salt caprock formation  differential stresses at the wellbore wall will initiate the process of creep leading to a reduction of wellbore radius and closure of an uncased wellbore section  geomechanical numerical simulations were conducted to evaluate the creep-induced wellbore convergence in salt formations  a two-component creep constitutive material model was used, which takes into account the contributions of both the non-linear creep component, dominant under high differential stresses, and the linear creep component, dominant under low differential stresses  the calculation results expectedly show an increase in the creep strain rate with depth due to increasing temperature and differential stress  however, the creep strain rate decreases exponentially as the wellbore radius decreases  the shortest borehole closure time for a depth of 3 5 km, which is applicable to well abandonment in the k12-b co2 injection project in the netherlands, amounts to about 500 days | 
2014-7500 	 a finite element study of the factors influencing rock nail pullout resistance |abstract   nail pullout tests for the application of nail rock reinforcement were simulated using finite element analysis, and boundary conditions were representative of equivalent pullout tests  the numerical models combined a frictional nailrock contact formulation and an elastoplastic constitutive law for the rock  this approach was chosen in order to include both restricted dilation and frictional slip  key properties were varied in order to assess their impact on pullout resistance  cox's analytical shear lag model over predicted the apparent nail-rock contact stiffness due to inappropriate boundary conditions  the numerical model managed to capture the qualitative response of the nail during pullout, though absolute values of pull force were somewhat overestimated  the highest pullout forces were obtained when the strength of the rock was fully mobilized before slip occured  nail-rock friction and initial contact stress were therefore the most important determinants of maximum pullout force  radial specimen confinement and rock dilation did greatly influence maximum pullout force, but were more important in increasing nail displacement at maximum pullout force due to their effect on contact hardening | 
2014-7501 	 surface spalling and the effects of boundary conditions |abstract  spalling near a free surface in highly stressed rock is an open topic in design of underground openings  spalling is often considered as an indicator of a potential collapse mechanism such as a rock burst, and therefore, is of high importance  in this study, a hybrid discrete-finite element model is used to simulate the surface instability  the bonded particle model was calibrated to mimic the mechanical properties of a berea sandstone  numerical results are compared with experiments performed using the university of minnesota surface instability apparatus, which reproduces the state of plane strain near the free surface in a semi-infinite medium subjected to far field compressive stresses  the damage in the rock was monitored by acoustic emission  it was observed that the friction between the rock and the platens, as well as material ductility, affects the fracture pattern and the failure phenomenon  in particular, the existence of friction is important in providing lateral stress between the rock and the platen in order to assist the initiation of fracture from the free surface | 
2014-7502 	 effects of stress and intrinsic anisotropy on the development of shear fractures in shale formations |abstract  understanding the hydro-mechanical properties of shale formations is becoming increasingly important as they play important role in production of the unconventional resources as well as geological carbon sequestration where shales typically form the cap rock for reservoir sequestration  fractures can provide high permeability pathways for fluid flow and leakage in very low permeability shales  the layered microstructure of shales can result strong hydro-mechanical anisotropy along with the stress dependence in shale fracturing behavior  this paper aims at providing a better understanding of: 1) fracturing behavior of shales due to shearing in relation to stress and intrinsic anisotropy, and 2) the effects of fracturing to the changes of permeability in shales    triaxial compression tests have been performed on shale cored horizontally by simultaneously measuring the permeability and p and s wave velocities  structural anisotropy of shale is evaluated in terms of thomsen's (1986) shear wave splitting parameter  the relationship between permeability and splitting parameter suggests that brittle fractures are suddenly formed along bedding plane immediately after reaching macroscopic yield point at low confining stress, whereas shear fractures are formed gradually after yield point  it is demonstrated that the splitting parameter is a useful index for permeability of horizontal shale subjected to shearing | 
2014-7504 	 thermally induced compaction of shales |abstract  thermally-induced, non-reversible compaction with volumetric strains of up to more than 1% has been observed in laboratory compaction tests with core plugs of several different shales  while thermally-induced compaction is known to occur in unconsolidated clays, relatively large compaction of caprock shales at temperatures even below in-situ temperature was rather unexpected  the observed thermally-induced compaction follows a creep-like behavior and is accompanied by increases in ultrasonic velocities | 
2014-7505 	 step-rate injection method for fracture in-situ properties (simfip): monitoring fractures stimulation efficiency |abstract  we show an application of the step-rate injection method for fracture in-situ properties (simfip) which is dedicated to quantifying both discontinuities hydraulic and mechanical properties in situ variations using coupled pressure/deformation measurements in boreholes  the method has been applied to estimate the efficiency of fractured zone stimulation  the apparatus and operating procedure are first described together with data recording and processing  we show that simfip tests generate and allow monitoring pluri-micrometer dilatant slip on pre-existing fractures, representative of mechanisms invoked in reservoir scale stimulations  in situ fractures permeability, elastic stiffness, apparent friction, dilation, and moment can be estimated from the slip, opening, water pressure and flow rate data that are synchronously measured during the test  in the presented case study, key results are that fractures well oriented for slip display a factor-of-40 permeability increase for a relatively small 80 x 10-6 m slip associated to a high dilation rate  never the less, it also appears that the high dilation induced by the stimulation may cause a high mechanical weakening of the fractures, increasing the potential for induced seismicity | 
2014-7506 	 failure of shales under triaxial compressive stress |abstract  some rocks, such as shales, are highly anisotropic in their mechanical behavior  in such rocks, the value of the maximum principal stress that causes shear failure depends not only on the confining stress, but also on the angle <u+00df> between the maximum principal stress and the normal vector to the bedding plane  triaxial compression experiments were carried out on two types of organic-rich mudstones at different bedding angles <u+00df> and confining pressures <u+03c3>3  two triaxial compression datasets from experiments and 10 datasets from the literature were fit to the pariseau and the jaeger plane-of-weakness (jpw) models  results show that pariseau’s model is more accurate for 10 of the 12 anisotropic rocks, whereas the jpw model is more accurate for the other two rocks, which were both rocks that had a low degree of strength anisotropy  post-test examination of computerized tomography (ct) and thin-section images shows that for highly laminated organic-rich shales, there is a transition regime of angles <u+00df> lying between angles of about 10°<<u+00df><35°, wherein the failure surface follows an irregular path that may jump between the weak plane and intact rock  in this regime, the strength of the rock is lower than the strength predicted by the jpw model | 
2014-7507 	 a fundamental investigation of pillar foundation failure in a trona mine |abstract  an extensive measurement program was implemented by the authors for the former usbm during 1990’s, in full cooperation with the mining company  the intent was to develop techniques for assessing changes in roof stability in underground mines and civil facilities  initial activities utilized both static and tomographic techniques to develop a field method for assessing roof stability  these measurements identified the interaction among roof, pillar, and floor structural elements and related the deterioration in roof conditions to premature failure of the mine foundation (floor)  both static and geophysical measurements were obtained in the laboratory and in a western u s  mine to study the in situ load-deformation behavior of floor material and to identify the location, timing, and growth of damage near mine excavations  this work was supplemented with three-dimensional numerical modeling to help explain the cause of damage   it was shown that the stress field influenced the degree of damage to roof rock during excavation  roof deformation and the extent of the damage zone grew rapidly as a result of failure in the mine floor  this failure was associated with pillar unloading and pillar shifting toward the abutment block, which increased compressive stresses in the mine roof near the pillar line  laboratory and field measurements complemented each other, providing critical input for stability assessments and numerical models | 
2014-7510 	 an unload-induced direct-shear model for dynamic triggering of frictional slip on a rock fracture filled with granular materials |abstract  this study introduces an unload-induced direct-shear model to investigate the dynamic triggering of frictional slip on a rock fracture filled with granular materials  a constant shear stress and a decreasing normal stress are applied on the filled fracture, which is initially in a frictional equilibrium state  a displacement meter and two load cells synchronously measure the slip displacement and the applied normal and shear stresses, respectively  the frictional slip is triggered when the shear stress reduction is smaller than the normal stress reduction  the initial shear stress obviously affects the slip triggering under the same normal unloading condition  the advantages and limitations of this model are discussed at the end | 
2014-7511 	 vector approach to estimating fracture trace parameters |abstract  surveys aimed at obtaining estimates of key fracture trace parameters should constitute a well-conceived sampling plan rather than adhoc measurements  if sampling windows are used to obtain data for estimation of fracture trace density and mean fracture trace length, the sampling plan should address the aggregation of data from multiple windows  the paper discusses estimation of density and mean trace length from this point of view  we demonstrate use of a first-order taylor series approximation to represent the mean trace length estimator, and we show that this approach is consistent with a simple vector interpretation of data from multiple windows | 
2014-7514 	 estimating seismic energy release and surface area generation: implications for interpreting hydraulic fracture behavior |abstract  during hydraulic fracture stimulations in shale, the activation of pre-existing fractures plays an important role in the development of the discrete fracture network  understanding the behavior of the fracture network allows for the potential of incorporating the observed fracture network into reservoir models necessitating the identification of fracture behavior over a wide magnitude scale -3 < m < +3  here, we discuss seismic events that were recorded by a multi-array multi-level network consisting of high frequency geophones located near the reservoir and arrays of accelerometers and low-frequency geophones deployed near the surface  the hybrid system captures a larger bandwidth, allowing for the integrated analysis of the source signal at various scales  comparatively speaking, our observations suggest that the larger scale events identified on the near-surface network contribute upwards of 80% of the overall seismic budget or seismic energy release associated with the stimulation process  additionally, these events accounted for a further 11,870 m2 of activated fracture surface area, approximately 10,295 m2 more than would have been estimated from the downhole array alone  overall, the identification of the actual discrete fracture network over many size scales allows for a better understanding of the fracturing processes associated with stimulations | 
2014-7523 	 numerical analyses of sequential tunneling in chicago glacial clays |abstract  the key factor in successful construction of urban tunnel projects is selecting a suitable excavation procedure in soft ground  the choice of the excavation procedure strongly influences the cost and time for tunnel construction  the aim of this paper is to analyze delay in liner installation for tunnel construction using one- and two-pass lining system via three-dimensional finite element numerical modeling  the tunnel is assumed to have a circular cross section in chicago glacial clays with a diameter of about 3 8 m and a centerline at a depth of 10 5 m below the ground surface  the soil profile consists of compressible clay deposits (i e  blodgett and deerfield) and a relatively incompressible hard silty clay stratum (i e  park ridge) and the tunnel alignment is assumed within deerfield compressible clay layer  the thickness of the inner liner is assumed 12 7 cm  the constitutive model used to characterize the clays in the simulation is the modified cam clay model  the soil stratigraphy was assumed to be uniform within each layer  the one and two-pass lining systems are modeled in abaqus using model change option and load reduction method, respectively  for load reduction method, the concentrated loads in equilibrium with the initial stress field are applied along the perimeter of the tunnel  these forces were sequentially reduced after initial liner placement to evaluate the creep effect  the results of 3d finite element analyses with emphasis on ground stability, axial and radial deformations of the tunnel, and stresses transferred to the liner are presented for both analyses | 
2014-7524 	 the description of a process for numerical simulations in the casing cementing of petroleum salt wells – part i: from drilling to cementing |abstract  the main purpose of casing cementing is to assure zonal isolation and borehole integrity  the aim of this paper is to describe the elements associated with borehole integrity in salt zones  to achieve this, a numerical analysis of the contacts amongst the rock salt, cement and casing was carried out using the finite element method  the problem was divided into two parts  the first part focuses on a step-by-step procedure from drilling to cementing  the second part considers the long-term response of the wellbore after cementing  this paper focuses on the drilling of the wellbore and on the hardening of the cement  the casing was simulated as a metallic, plastic material with a von mises yield surface with associated plastic flow  the cement was simulated first as an elastic material with a step-by-step strengthening gain and then in the last step as a plastic frictional material with a linear drucker-prager yield surface  finally, the time, stress, temperature dependent behavior of rock salt was defined as a secondary or steady state double mechanism creep law  a non-linear, 3d finite element (fe) commercial program was chosen (abaqus), and some subroutines were created (fortran) to develop the creep law  the paper also discusses issues such as salt in-situ stresses, induced stresses by the drilling fluid and slurry, and cement hardening processes  developments of stresses through the different steps were analyzed and contact between these three different materials (salt, casing and cement) were also studied  the main contribution of this research is determining the effect of salt creep and contacts amongst the materials before, during and after drilling the well | 
2014-7525 	 using a fully coupled, open-source thm simulator to examine the role of thermal stresses in shear stimulation of enhanced geothermal systems |abstract  the evolution of enhanced geothermal systems (egs) entails spatially and temporally evolving permeability fields  during non-isothermal fluid injection, thermo-elastic stress and fluid pressure changes act upon partially open or hydrothermally altered fracture sets to enhance formation permeability  the physical couplings that drive this behavior are non-linearly dependent upon one another to varying degrees  to explore these interactions we are developing a simulator capable of coupling the dominant physics of shear stimulation using a variety of methods, allowing flexibility in the use of monolithic or staggered numerical schemes  the new simulator uses standard galerkin and control-volume finite elements to balance fluid mass, mechanical deformation, and thermal energy with consideration of local thermal non-equilibrium and/or dual-porosity heat exchange between fluids and solids or fractures and intact rock  similarly, changes in mechanical stress and fluid pressure can be rigorously coupled in single or multiple continua  permeability is allowed to evolve under several constitutive models tailored to both porous media and fractures, considering the influence of thermo-hydromechanical stress, creep, and elasto-plastic shear and dilation in a ubiquitously fractured medium  from this basis we explore the coupled physical processes that control the evolution of permeability during shear stimulation and long-term evolution of a geothermal reservoir | 
2014-7527 	 effect of co2 injectivity on enhanced shale gas recovery |abstract  shale gas has become an increasingly important source of natural gas (ch4) in the united states over the last decade  due to its unconventional characteristics, injecting carbondioxide (co2) to enhance shale gas recovery (esgr) is a potentially feasible method to increase gas-yield while both affording a sink for co2 and in reducing the potential for induced seismicity  this study examines co2 -esgr to better understand its feasibility and effectiveness  we explore the roles of important coupled phenomena activated during gas substitution especially vigorous feedbacks between sorptive behavior and permeability evolution  permeability and porosity evolution models developed for sorptive fractured coal are adapted to the component characteristics of gas shales  these adapted models are used to probe the optimization of co2 -esgr for injection of co2 at overpressures of 0mpa, 4mpa and 8mpa to investigate magnitudes of elevated ch4 production, co2 storage rate and capacity, and of co2 early-breakthrough and permeability evolution in the reservoir  for the injection pressures selected, ch4 production was enhanced by 2 3%, 14 3%, 28 5%, respectively, over the case where co2 is not injected  distinctly different evolutions are noted for permeability in both fractures and matrix due to different dominating mechanisms  fracture permeability increased by ~ <u+2153> for the injection scenarios due to the dominant influence of ch4 de-sorption over co2 sorption  co2 sequestration capacity was only of the order of 104 m3 when supercritical for a net recovery of co2 of 108 m3 | 
2014-7528 	 monitoring cracking process of gypsum by means of acoustic emission and high speed camera imaging |abstract  gypsum (a mix of hydrocal b-11 and diatomaceous earth) is used by the mit rock mechanics group as a model rock material  unconfined compression tests on pre-cracked specimens with high speed camera observation showed macro-cracking processes of gypsum similar to other materials; however in contrast to the other materials, no microcrack process zone could be observed  on the other hand, environmental scanning electron microscope (esem) observation of gypsum showed limited micro-cracking preceding the crack initiation  this indicates that a microcrack process zone in gypsum might exist but it is not visible in high speed camera photography because of the scale  it was therefore decided to use acoustic emission (ae) to determine if such microcracks occur  to this end, prismatic specimens containing pre-existing flaws were tested under uniaxial compression, and the cracking process was monitored with both ae and high-speed camera imaging  ae results revealed that although esem images show the occurrence of some micro-cracking before macro-cracking, so far it could not be detected by ae | 
2014-7529 	 brine permeability through reservoir rocks under geo-sequestration conditions |abstract  the geological storage of co2 and the extraction of geothermal energy from deep saline aquifers are promising methods, of mitigating global warming and obtaining a valuable source of renewable energy  in such processes the porosity and permeability of the reservoir rock are the two governing factors  porosity can be easily predicted and is conventionally used to identify permeability properties  however, such identification is inaccurate, because the presence of irregularities such as bedding and authigenic quartz significantly reduces the permeability of even highly porous rock  this paper investigates the effect of bedding and the presence of authigenic quartz on brine permeability in sandstone using two types of sandstones with similar porosities, warwick white (wws) and warwick golden (wgs), from the queensland basin, australia  permeability tests were conducted on 38mm diameter and 150mm long sandstone samples for a range of injection pressures (4 – 7mpa) under 10 mpa confining pressure at 30°c temperature, using a highly precise core flooding apparatus  the experimental data provide important data for the geological storage of co2 and the production of geothermal energy from deep saline aquifers | 
2014-7530 	 seismic event location and source mechanism accounting for complex block geology and voids |abstract  an optimized velocity model is an important step towards the goal of accurate and precise seismic results  the assumption of a single or layered velocity model is not always appropriate in examples such as rock volumes that contain complex shaped geological units or large voids  for this reason, this study presents a 3d velocity model method that can be used for source location and source mechanism analysis  examples from two case studies are presented with the first being an open stope mine, and the second being a block cave mine with 5 geological domains  using calibration blast data, a significant improvement is shown when the excavation stopes are accounted for in the location velocity model  it is also shown that accounting for the shapes of different geological domains and cave voids produce more accurate raypaths for the seismic energy than from using a single velocity model and straight raypath assumption  this improvement in accuracy is benefiting the integration of seismic results with numerical models and the overall effort to improve the safety and productivity in the rock mechanics industry | 
2014-7531 	 wave-guiding between fractures in transversely isotropic matrix |abstract  sedimentary rock in the earth’s crust is often layered and contains fractures which gives rise to two sources of seismic anisotropy, namely, textural and structural  these two sources of seismic anisotropy can have aligned or non-aligned symmetry axes depending on the orientation of the fractures relative to the layering  an acoustic wavefront imaging method was used on fractured transversely isotropic media to unravel the interaction between the fractures and the matrix layering  wave-guiding theory for parallel fractures in transversely isotropic matrix shows that the delays of guided-modes are mainly affected by the fracture stiffness, signal frequency and fracture orientation with respect to the layering  from the experimental data, the apparent anisotropy was dominated by fractures at low stress because the energy was confined between the low stiffness fractures  at high stresses, the apparent anisotropy was controlled by the matrix because the fracture stiffness was sufficient to enable wave transmission across the fractures  the interpretation of the presence of fractures in anisotropic media can be determined if seismic measurements are made as a function of stress, which eliminates many fracture-generated guided-modes | 
2014-7532 	 practical laboratory methods for pore volume compressibility characterization in different rock types |abstract  existing laboratory methodologies for characterizing the pore volume compressibility of rocks are summarized  special emphasis is placed on the two most common in the industry pore volume compressibility tests—uniaxial strain pore pressure depletion tests and uniaxial strain effective stress loading tests  we carefully overviewed a rigorous mathematical description of uniaxial deformation of porous rocks implemented in these tests, derivation of pore volume compressibility coefficients from stress-strain data, and assumptions made in these models  many industry-relevant porous rocks demonstrate nonlinear stress-strain behavior  as a practical workflow for characterization of pore volume compressibility, we propose using piecewise linear approximations of loading diagrams with constant compressibility coefficients  the linearized model provides a suitable description of nonlinear rock response within certain limited intervals of loading trajectory  for the correct use of established pore volume compressibility properties in applications, it is important to validate that predictions are made for the equivalent loading paths, stress, and pressure levels as used in the linearization intervals  several examples of mechanical rock behavior were considered, focusing on the end-member cases of high- and low-grain compressibility compared with bulk compressibility  we also discussed implications of some rock microstructures, including mudstones, on mechanical properties, to provide a reference for better interpretation of real rock behavior | 
2014-7534 	 physics-based modeling of hydraulic fracture propagation and permeability evolution of fracture network in shale gas formation |abstract  robust and reliable hydraulic fracturing models that appropriately account for random initiation of fractures, strongly nonlinear coupling among deformation, fracturing and fluid flow in fracture apertures and leakage into porous rock matrix, would be a key step toward developing a better understanding of physics associated with hydraulic fracturing process  in this paper, we present a physics-based hydraulic fracturing simulator based on coupling a quasi-static discrete element model (dem) for deformation and fracturing with conjugate lattice network flow model for fluid flow in both fractures and porous matrix  the coupled dem-network flow model reproduces a variety of realistic growth patterns of hydraulic fractures  the effects of in situ stress, fluid viscosity, heterogeneity of rock mechanical properties and injection rate on the fracture patterns will be presented and discussed  in particular, simulation results of multistage horizontal wellbore with multiple perforations clearly demonstrate that elastic interactions among multiple propagating fractures, strong coupling between fluid pressure fluctuations within fractures and fracturing, and lower length scale heterogeneities, collectively lead to complicating fracturing patterns | 
2014-7537 	 component and system deformation properties of complex rockmasses with healed structure |abstract  the overall strength of a rockmass is determined by the intact rock strength and characteristics of the rockmass structure  in complex rockmasses this structure consists of both joints and other fractures (interblock structure) and intrablock structure such as veins  as excavations go deeper, intrablock structure has been found to have a significant impact on rockmass behaviour  complex numerical modelling for modern geotechnical design requires input parameters for structure, including normal and shear stiffness, and strength, which have a critical influence on modelled rockmass behaviour  this study focusses on extending joint stiffness and strength concepts to veins by calibrating numerical finite element unconfined compressive strength (ucs) tests with explicit vein geometries that were determined by petrographic analysis of veins in thin section  in some cases, different calibrated properties were found to have equivalent stress-strain profiles in ucs tests  the behaviour of the calibrated stiffness and strength vein properties are examined at an excavation scale using a numerical example of a 10 m-diameter tunnel | 
2014-7539 	 transmissivity anisotropy in rough-walled fractures: the combined influence of shear offset and normal deformation |abstract  fractures often control subsurface fluid flow and efforts to predict near-surface fluid flow typically focus on quantifying the relative influence of aperture and surface roughness on transmissivity  at greater depths, lithostatic and tectonic stresses play an increasingly important role in controlling fracture transmissivities  for the case of well-correlated fracture surfaces, such as those expected in new tensile fractures, fracture transmissivities quickly become negligible as a normal stress is applied to the fractures  however, if these fracture surfaces are displaced in shear, the fractures remain open and conductive at much higher stresses  shear displacement of two well correlated or perfectly mated surfaces leads to anisotropy in the correlation structure of the fracture aperture field  in the presence of large normal stress, it is likely that only fractures subjected to some shear displacement will remain conductive, and thus, they are likely to exhibit some degree of anisotropy  predicting the degree of anisotropy requires quantifying the combined influence of surface roughness, shear displacement of the fracture surfaces and the applied normal stresses  we use previously tested computational models to explore the influence of shear displacements of fracture surfaces subjected to a sequence of normal displacements (increasing stress) on transmissivity both parallel and perpendicular to the shear displacement of the surfaces  results suggest that normal deformation of displaced fracture surfaces can lead to an order of magnitude increase in the anisotropy ratio from that observed in the unstressed fracture  these results suggest that the influence of normal stress on fracture anisotropy must be considered when implementing effective-continuum or discrete-fracture-network representations of fluid flow through fracture rock masses | 
2014-7540 	 evaluation of hydraulic fractures crossing natural fractures at high angles using a hybrid discrete-continuum model |abstract  in this work, a hybrid discrete-continuum numerical model was used to simulate hydraulic fracture (hf) crossing and interaction with natural fractures or weakness planes  the model provided unique capabilities for investigating effects which have usually been overlooked or not able to be modeled in many of the previous studies on the subject  multiple effects, such as the influence of stress conditions, material in-homogeneity (stiffness and strength contrast), natural fracture properties (crossing angle and friction angle), and injection parameters (injection rate and fluid viscosity) were investigated in this new work  three types of intersection between an hf and orthogonally aligned natural fractures were identified by varying the coefficient of friction of the natural fractures and the stress ratio  in addition, the intersection angle between an hf and natural fractures or weakness planes was found to significantly affect the crossing  decreasing the intersection angle with the natural fractures impeded direct crossing and favored the arrest of an hf  material in-homogeneity and injection parameters were found to also greatly affect the hf crossing of natural fractures  ultimately, the simulations showed that the geometry of an hf can be greatly affected by the interactions with adjacent natural fractures and weakness planes and that complex hf propagation patterns will occur due to complicated crossing behavior during hydraulic fracturing in naturally fractured reservoir systems | 
2014-7542 	 numerical investigation of high net pressure and isip values from multi-stage horizontal wells in unconventional plays: insights from fully-coupled discrete element geomechanical modeling |abstract  often, a key factor in the successful hydraulic fracture stimulation of unconventional reservoirs is the opening or shearing (and later extension) of natural fractures or weakness planes around a created hydraulic fracture  the behavior of natural fractures, or weakness planes, in response to hydraulic fracture stimulation can be complicated  furthermore, the stimulation of these fractures and weakness planes is dependent on several critical, in-situ conditions that can increase (or decrease) the contribution of natural fractures and weakness planes to well production  the optimal economic completion, then, requires considering these factors during both stimulation design and post-stimulation evaluations   the simplistic, and traditional, assumption that hydraulic fractures are bi-wing, planar and symmetric around the wellbore has tended to bias the interpretation of different aspects of the stimulation process  however, hydraulic fracture monitoring methods, such as microseismicity, pressure evaluations, and the coring through of hydraulic fractures, have confirmed the complex nature of fracture propagation in unconventional plays, often due to the presence of natural fractures and weakness planes  therefore, an improved consideration of natural fracture and weakness plane behavior during hydraulic fracturing will result in a better understanding of fluid treating pressures and hydraulic fracture geometry, which will help lead to more accurate estimations of production for unconventional plays    in this paper, the results of an extensive parametric study of in-situ stress conditions, in-situ pressure, natural fracture mechanical properties (cohesion and friction angle) and characteristics (joint orientation and initial aperture), and different operating conditions (single stage, simultaneous hydraulic fracture stages, and sequential hydraulic fracture stages) on injection (net) pressure behavior is presented  the results were generated using a 2-d distinct element model and capture the important role that, for example, initial natural fracture aperture and in-situ pressure play in the development of hydraulic fracture injection pressures in unconventional reservoirs |

2014-7549 	 assessment of thermal fracturing in tight hydrocarbon formation using dem |abstract  tight formations or the reservoir rocks with extremely low permeability, make vast hydrocarbon fields in the united states and worldwide  in contrast to conventional reservoirs, production from tight formations is only economic when such formations are hydraulically fractured  economic production from tight formations relies on the existence of a network of connecting fractures in the rock to create a more volumetric pattern of fracture  to achieve this goal, we have proposed a novel method for fracturing rock by thermal means, in which the rock is frozen prior to hydraulic fracturing, leading to a reduction of effective stress and creation of thermal cracks  the question is how much is the effective rock permeability improved by cooling down the hot reservoir  we use the discrete element method (dem) to obtain a network of thermal fractures as the rock is frozen  the permeability can then be calculated using a pore network model which is not the subject of this paper  here we present the discrete element method (dem) analysis for thermal fracturing and show the effect of main parameters involved in the solutions obtained from the dem, including the stiffness of rock |

2014-7572 	 simulation of unstable failure in underground coal mining using the discrete element method |abstract  in underground coal mining, failure is expected to occur at pillar edges as areas are mined out and stresses redistribute  depending on the post peak behavior of the coal and the local mine stiffness, the mode of failure can be either stable or unstable  in this study, a mechanically coupled numerical model is used to simulate a realistic mining process as experienced in underground coal mining  a discrete element model with softening contact behavior in pfc2d is used to simulate the coal seam, while an elastic continuum in flac2d is used to simulate the inner coal and mine roof and floor  in situ stresses are installed and a tabular excavation is widened to induce pillar edge failure  a series of pfc2d model behaviors, called stability indicators, are used to analyze the resulting failure  the stability indicators used here are the work performed by the damping mechanism, the kinetic energy, and the mean unbalanced force  the analysis demonstrates that the stability indicators are able to distinguish between stable and unstable failure  also, the spatial distribution of damping work and contact softening shows the co-occurrence of model instability and damage | 
2014-7589 	 numerical modeling of non-newtonian fluid injection into dense granular media |abstract  understanding how failure mechanisms and fluid flow patterns develop in response to fluid injection into a dense granular medium is critical to the design and diagnosis of engineering applications such as hydraulic fracturing and waterflooding in unconsolidated formations  in this work, the process of fluid injection with a non-newtonian fluid is investigated numerically using the distinct element code pfc2d® coupled with a pore network model  the analysis assumes the fluid rheology to be power law  effects of the injection rate and the rheological parameters on the fluid flow and grain displacement patterns are examined  the numerical results suggest that the near wellbore behaviors in the injection process are governed by the high shear rate rheology  as the injection rate increases, fluid infiltration becomes limited and localized failure characterized by the growth of fractures or fluid channels occurs  as the injection rate becomes large, the breakdown pressure becomes insensitive to the fluid rheology | 
2014-7596 	 evaluation & mitigation of icefall hazards emanating from rock slopes |abstract  the implications of ice build-up on surface rock excavations can prove to be costly over the design lifetime of a slope  in areas subject to significant precipitation and cold temperatures, ice accumulation can unknowingly wreak havoc on surface rock excavations and lead to an increase in the frequency of rock and icefall events  ice build-up can destabilize a rock slope by expansive action (ice-wedging), by surcharging portions of the slope face, and by inducing an ice-dammed condition where water-pressures are allowed to build-up on discontinuity surfaces as a result of inadequate drainage during periods of thaw  although icefall may logically be treated as a variant of the classic rockfall problem, there are some significant differences between rockfall and icefall hazard evaluations  high-energy icefall impacts can also result in a significant amount of shatter, which can result in the release of ice projectiles  ice build-up mitigation techniques can take the form of simple drainage elements and periodic cold-weather maintenance efforts, or can incorporate more advanced treatments like engineered topographic enhancements and bio-stabilization  in cases where source zone treatment is not permissible, engineered barriers may be incorporated for mitigating the risk of icefall impact to the traveling public where appropriate  through our research and project case histories, this paper and presentation will describe some of the technical challenges associated with the burgeoning practice area of icefall evaluation, the importance of long-term monitoring and maintenance programs, and mitigation strategies for dealing with the under-appreciated problem of icefall at both the source and impact zone | 
2014-7614 	 compaction: models for prediction from thin section data |abstract  in this paper we propose a model for the compressibility of unconsolidated sands along a zero lateral strain stress path which includes the effects of texture and mineralogy on the stress dependent compressibility  it is first developed quite generally to describe the evolution of a network as a function of modifying the number of bonds and nodes in a network  this network model is quite general and may be applied to a variety of physical phenomena such as permeability, resistivity etc  here the network is mapped to a simple physical model for compaction where the nodes describe a “compaction site” which activates at a specific stress and the bonds represent the structure of the grain pack  the higher the bond number the higher the threshold stress at which the site activates  the proposed model naturally includes nonlinear phenomena  in the case of compaction this would include the prediction of the onset of deformation band formation  the predictions of the model are compared to an extensive set of experimental compressibility measurements  parameters describing the effects on uniaxial compressibility for sorting, angularity, and grain size are reported for pure quartz sands  models are also developed for the inclusion of feldspar, clay and phyllite for quartz sands | 
2014-7622 	 scaling of fatigue crack kinetics of sandstone |abstract  this paper presents an experimental investigation on both monotonic strength and fatigue crack kinetics for berea sandstone  it is found that for all specimens the paris-erdogan law is applicable for a wide range of the amplitudes of the stress intensity factor  the fatigue tests also indicate that there is a small-crack growth regime at the beginning stage, where the growth rate decreases as the crack propagates  the fracture kinetics for both the small-crack growth and the paris regimes is subjected to a strong size effect  during the strength and fatigue tests, the damage process is examined by the digital image correlation method, and it is shown that the length of the fracture process zone under cyclic loading is about 60% larger than that under monotonic loading  in parallel with the experiments, a theoretical model is developed to explain the observed size effect on fatigue crack kinetics | 
2014-7623 	 coupling distributed temperature sensing (dts) based wellbore temperature models with microseismic data for enhanced characterization of hydraulic fracture stimulation |abstract  in this paper, the use of microseismic data for calibration and modification of wellbore temperature models will be introduced  moreover, fracturing fluid distribution obtained using the modified temperature numerical model is coupled with the microseismic field data for several eagle ford shale wells to improve hydraulic fracture stimulation characterization  by measuring the temperature change along the wellbore, distributed temperature sensing (dts) data may provide relative fluid distribution  this information may be used to assess the simple geometry of the hydraulic fractures, the fracture initiation points along the wellbore, wellbore integrity issues, and the effectiveness of isolation tools  with recently published wellbore temperature models, quantitative information about which zones receive the stimulation fluid can be numerically solved  however, dts measurements and fluid distributions calculated using dts data are restricted to the wellbore and near wellbore environment  for far field diagnostics of hydraulic fracturing stimulation other measurements are needed, specifically microseismic  by combining these two measurements, a new workflow is created which incorporates both the far field and wellbore measurements to characterize hydraulic fractures, both real-time and after the stimulation job  this workflow is especially useful in reservoirs that are naturally fractured or in wellbores were stress shadowing effects are significant, such as multistage fracturing multiple wells that are in close proximity to each other  in these scenarios the path that the fluid travels may be complex, even in the near wellbore environment  due to this complexity, fluid distributed calculations based on dts data may provide misleading results  using information gained from microseismic, the wellbore temperature models may be modified to increase the reliability of the numerically calculated fluid distributions  the purpose of this paper is to propose how microseismic data may be used to modify the wellbore temperature models, and how stimulation fluid placement determined from the modified models may then be coupled with the microseismic to improve hydraulic fracture stimulation characterization | 
2014-7626 	 a micromechanical analysis on permeability evolutions of a dilatant shear band |abstract  this paper presents a multi-scale lattice boltzmann/finite element scheme that quantitatively links particulate mechanics to hydraulic properties of a grain assembly obtained from a simple shear discrete element simulation  a spatial homogenization is performed to recover the macroscopic stress from the micro-mechanical force chances  the pore geometries of the shear band and host matrix are then quantitatively evaluated through morphology analysis and flow simulations  hydraulic properties estimated from multiscale flow simulations are compared with those inferred from volume averaging and geometric averaging schemes  results from the discrete element simulations imply that grain sliding and rotation occur predominately within the dilatant shear band  these granular motions lead to dilation of pore space inside the shear band and increases in local permeability  while considerable anisotropy in the contact fabric is observed within the shear band, anisotropy of the permeability is, at most, modest in the assemblies composed of spherical grains | 
2014-7629 	 rock mechanics considerations in the design of folsom auxiliary spillway approach channel |abstract  the folsom dam joint federal project is being undertaken to increase the spillway capacity of folsom reservoir in order to meet the demands imposed by an updated assessment of the probable maximum flood  the auxiliary spillway consists of an approach channel from the reservoir, a control structure, and a spillway chute and stilling basin that discharge spillway flows into the american river downstream of the existing spillway  the stability of the rock slopes upstream of the control structure and approach walls were evaluated using kinematic analyses to screen for critical geometry followed by limit equilibrium analyses of the kinematically-feasible cases to design slope reinforcement where necessary  variability in the joint orientations was accounted for using a probabilistic analysis based on the measured scatter in orientation for each joint set  a fully three-dimensional (3d) analysis of the approach channel sidewalls, taking into account both existing and planned excavation geometry, existing and planned rock slope reinforcement, and the planned reinforced concrete approach walls, was also performed | 
2014-7632 	 an analysis of the possible fault displacements associated with a retreating longwall face in illinois |abstract  longwall mining is growing rapidly in illinois  a coal company was faced with crossing a 3-m normal fault in the development entries and the longwall face while mining a 375-m wide longwall face  limited geologic and geotechnical data were available related to the fault  there were significant concerns about additional spatial displacements along the fault plane as the face approached and crossed the fault zone  these displacements could result in additional loading on the development entries on the headgate and tailgate sides as well as in the face area that could affect ground control performance in the face area  field monitoring, observational and numerical modeling studies were performed to develop data that would assist the company to plan for additional supports in the development entries and take appropriate safety measures while advancing toward the fault and crossing it  numerical modeling consisted of analyzing a 3-d structural model using the flac3d with the fault plane incorporated as ubiquitous joint  this model was used to analyze incremental displacements and stresses due to the deformations of the fault plane as the face advanced and crossed it  additional stiff supports were installed in headgate entries around the stage loader and 60-m outby of the longwall face (solid) | 
2014-7634 	 barton approach for predicting hoek-brown residual parameters |abstract  an important question which arises during numerical analysis of mining is the residual strength of the rock mass since it significantly affects the stress-carrying capability of yielded ground and the potential for stress-shedding to more competent ground  there are few guidelines for estimation of the residual strength of rock masses  in many ways a rock mass that has yielded and subsequently bulked a significant amount acts similar to rockfill  although rockfill shear strength is controlled more by fragment shape, fragment strength and porosity of the assembly than by the shear strength of discontinuities, it is possible to draw analogies between these two behaviors  for example, a bulked assembly of rock fragments and an individual rock joint have several common characteristics when subject to shear, including a transition from dilative behavior (with minimal fragment or asperity damage) at low normal stress to extensive crushing of contact points at high normal stress  these results in high instantaneous friction angles at low levels of confinement and a curved peak shear strength envelope for both rock masses and rockfills  in this paper the barton and kj?rnsli [1] model for predicting rockfill shear strength is explored as a criterion for estimating the residual strength of rock masses at both low and high strains (i e  immediately post-peak and after a significant amount of shearing)  the proposed model is tested through analysis of simple slope and pillar models | 
2014-7660 	 a 3dec model for heavily veined massive rock masses |abstract  this paper describes how 3dec can be used to model rock as an assembly of tetrahedral (tet) blocks bonded at their contacts and how this can be used to study veined rock masses at a large scale by introducing tensile strength heterogeneity at the block contacts  the 3dec approach differs from particle-based methods in its ability to represent a zero initial porosity condition, as well as highly interlocked irregular block shapes that provide resistance to moment after contact breakage and associated high uniaxial compressive strength to tensile strength ratios and friction angles  an approach to constructing these models with 3dec is outlined and the results of studies on veined rock mass strength and fragmentation associated with mining are described  in general, the results of testing to date suggest that the approach may be well-suited to studying the mining response of massive veined rock masses | 
2014-7682 	 characterizing damage evolution and yield surfaces for berea sandstone under triaxial loading as a function of effective pressure |abstract  granular porous material is idealized as an elastic-plastic material, where macroscopic failure occurs at a critical stress by localized dilatant shear at low effective pressure and compactional cataclastic flow at high effective pressure  yielding and accumulation of microscopic damage at sub-critical stress levels are also important characteristics of the failure process  here, load-reload triaxial compression tests are used to investigate damage development at low and high effective pressures, and test models of yield across the brittle-ductile transition  water saturated cylinders of berea sandstone were deformed at an axial strain rate of 10-5 s-1 and effective pressures of 20-240 mpa to investigate the dilational, transitional, and compactional regimes  results illustrate that contours of equivalent damage for sub-critical stress states between yield and macroscopic failure are sub-parallel to the failure envelope except in the highest pressure regime  damage induced at one effective pressure has a systematic, but variable effect on failure at other effective pressure conditions  the behavior across the transition from dilation to compaction is most consistent with a model based on two distinct yield envelopes, each associated with distinct damage mechanisms and a sharp transition between the low and high pressure regimes | 
2014-7722 	 bimodal depth distribution of meqs in the newberry geothermal reservoir |abstract  a bimodal depth distribution of fluid-injection-induced microearthquakes (meqs) was observed in the 2012 stimulation phase of the newberry volcano enhanced geothermal system (egs) demonstration project in oregon  during 7 weeks of hydraulic stimulation of well nwg 55-29, 90% of meqs occurred in the shallow reservoir while few occurred adjacent to the expected deep stimulation zone  this enigmatic distribution of meqs may have resulted from two alternative possible causes: (1) a segment of the casing may be damaged, the resulting leak introducing a new fluid source with the pressure triggering microseismicity in the shallow reservoir over the short term; or (2) fluid pressures may have migrated upwards from the deep injection zone to the shallow reservoir to induce local seismic events  our analysis of the failure potential of the reservoir to fluid-injection indicates that the failure potential increases with reduced depth for a given wellhead pressure  the timing of pore-pressure diffusion suggests that upward-migration of fluid pressures from the injection zone cannot generate critical overpressures in the shallow zone of seismicity sufficiently quickly  this contention, favoring the role of a ruptured casing, is further supported by a coupled thermal-hydrological-mechanical (thm) analysis and the observation (august 2013) that indeed the casing is damaged at shallow depth  despite this, still unexplained remains the presence of seismicity at great depth, but absent at intermediate depth | 
2014-7723 	 a new method for reading local deformation of granular material by using light |abstract  a new method is proposed for reading local deformation of granular material by using reflection of light  in this method, two plastic optical fibers, both having diameter of 1mm, are used to read local disturbance or deformation at a point in granular material, such as sand, soil, or broken rocks  as light is sent into the 1st fiber and reaches its end, it leaves the fiber and hits surfaces of nearby particles  part of the reflected light then gets into the 2nd fiber, which can be digitally measured by using photo diode  the paper introduces the fundamental mechanism of how the system works, shows several examples in which the proposed method is tested to interpret deformation of granular material, passage of water or air bubble, collapse of mass of granular materials, and so on  the results shows interesting relation between local deformation of granular material red by light and overall behavior of the mass made of those particles | 
2014-7724 	 finite element-based numerical modeling of fracture propagation due to the plunge of a spherical indenter |abstract  numerical simulations have been conducted to model the deformation, damage, and fracture growth caused by the plunge of a spherical drill bit insert into a brittle rock  the deformation of the rock, which is initially homogeneous and isotropic, is modeled using the finite element method  fracture geometry evolves as a function of fracture growth, and the rock domain is continuously re-meshed to capture this geometric change  contact forces are applied radially over the contact area as a function of the depth of the plunge  a series of simulations is presented, having varying initial flaw distributions, and which capture the fracture pattern formation during the progressive indentation of the insert into the rock  the ensuing patterns depict the formation of horizontal and hertzian fractures  a large fracture density is created around the contact area  the complexity of the internal fracture structure is less apparent at the surface of the deformed rock, as compared to the internal fracture pattern  fracturing leads to the formation of surface chips in the form of tilted elliptical domains parallel to the rock surface  early stages of chipping are not always apparent from the fracture pattern at the surface of the rock  results are in good agreement with experimental observations | 
2014-7727 	 the effect of bedding plane orientation on crack propagation and coalescence in shale |abstract  hydrocarbon extraction from unconventional oil and gas reservoirs requires more accurate ways to describe fracture processes in shale  fracture initiation, propagation and coalescence has been studied in many rock-like materials [1,2] and natural rocks [1,2,3]   however, shale is typically heterogeneous and anisotropic with naturally formed bedding planes  natural bedding planes can be weak zones where fractures can initiate and propagate along [1, 2, 3]  a series of unconfined compression tests were conducted on opalinus clay shale with two pre-existing flaws and various bedding plane orientations (0, 30, 60, and 90 degrees with respect to the horizontal)  high speed and high resolution imagery were use to capture fracture initiation, propagation and coalescence between the flaw pairs  distinct coalescence and cracking patterns were observed when compared to previously tested rocks  as the bedding angle increased, fractures initiating at the flaw tips tended to propagate more frequently along the bedding planes  coalescence of cracks between flaws trended from direct-combined (tensile and shear cracks) to indirect as the bedding plane angle increased  tensile crack initiation and coalescence stresses showed a characteristic u-shape profile with a minimum at 60 degree bedding plane orientation and a maximum at 0 degree bedding plane orientation | 
2014-7731 	 scale effects on deformability of rock mass by different methods in himalayas |abstract  this paper deals with the scale effects on deformability of rock mass in himalayas by conducting in-situ tests with different methods  the deformability tests conducted by using plate jacking test, plate loading test, goodman jack test and laboratory test show the comparison among different measurements and scale effects on deformability of rock mass  plate load test, flat jack test and goodman jack test give values of modulus of deformation which are 2-3 times lower than large size plate jacking test  hence, large size plate jacking test must be utilized to evaluate the modulus of deformation of rock mass, particularly due to jointing in himalayan rock mass  the modulus of rock tested in the laboratory is 3 to 20 times higher than insitu value of rock mass  the difference is mainly dependent on jointing in the rock mass | 
2014-7739 	 the effects of moisture transport on wellbore stability |abstract  understanding the interaction of drilling fluid with shale formation is critical to properly describe pore pressure propagation which directly affects the wellbore stability  in the case of reactive shale formations, it has been shown that clay minerals within shale matrix have a tendency to adsorb water from drilling fluid  using a concentrated drilling fluid, available models which are based on the ideal solution assumption fail to properly address the true shale-drilling fluid interaction  it is shown that the moisture content of shale is correlated with water activity using the multilayer adsorption theory  it is found that the gab model fairly well describes the adsorption process for the selected shale types  the adsorption parameter signifies the characteristic of specific shale to interact with aqueous fluids  the constitutive equations are generalized to consider the case of non-ideal solutions  the coupled transport equations are solved using a finite difference method and numerical computations are conducted to predict the stability of the wellbore  having developed a transient model which predicts the instantaneous moisture content around the wellbore, it is possible to update the compressive strength of shale as a function of its moisture content using the empirical correlations already proposed in the literature  the proposed model predicts that due to the moisture transport, the range of safe mud weight reduces substantially  the results of this investigation assist in drilling fluid design and address wellbore stability issues in troublesome shale formations | 
2014-7741 	 thermo-hydro-mechanical numerical modeling of stimulation and heat production of egs reservoirs |abstract  a two-dimensional numerical model is used to study the response of enhanced geothermal reservoirs to stimulation and production  in the model, the discrete fracture network is explicitly represented, and the solution is thermo-hydro-mechanically coupled  a series of metrics including shear- stimulated area, injectivity, produced water temperature and produced energy are evaluated for each case  comparison of these metrics provides insight into the effect and range of importance of these parameters | 
2014-7746 	 pillar mountain landslide; failure mechanism update |abstract  the pillar mountain landslide occurred in 1971 near the city of kodiak, alaska  the slide comprised 6 million cubic yards of material that failed from above the main highway to town and covered the roadway  since the failure was progressive in nature it was not a catastrophic event, and it did cut off the city from the airport and shipping port for long  the roadway was rehabilitated with little other damaged noted  of concern to the resident of kodiak is the presence of ongoing rockfall that is occurring from the same slide area  it is not known with certainty if the rockfall is a precursor of further sliding activity and / or larger deep seated failure  it is also of concern that a large slide could result in a tsunami that could cause substantial damage to kodiak beyond just closing the highway into town  many studies of the slide have been undertaken but none of them adequately explain the mechanism responsible for the 1971 failure   this paper proposes an alternate failure mechanism for the 1971 failure and uses this to predict the potential for future failures  in general the structural geology in the vicinity of the 1971 pillar mountain slide is favorable with bedding dipping into the slope and some sub-vertical joint sets dissecting the blocky rock mass  it is postulated that the 1971 failure was initiated by oversteepening and loss of confinement at the toe of the slope as a result of quarrying activity  this may have resulted in dilation at the toe of the slope followed by flexural toppling failure  as a consequence of flexure of continuous columns of rock (separated by bedding) the tensile strength of the rock may have been exceeded  once the tensile fractures started to coalesce at the base of the topping beds (failure perpendicular to bedding) it is postulated that slippage started on the rough but coalesced surface that dipped out of the slope in the oversteeped section of the slope  this mechanism and modeling undertaken to visualize and validate the mechanism are described in this paper  the results of modeling this mechanism are also described in the paper | 
2014-7747 	 modeling induced seismicity in 4d |abstract  a new technique has been developed to estimate how seismicity evolves through the mine, making the technique an interesting addition to defining areas with high, medium, and low damage potential due to their embedded seismic history  the use of solid triangulations in representing the areas of interest makes the developed methodology a simple and powerful addition to the study of seismicity in mines  the research illustrates a new technique to model seismic events and combine them into block models, providing the user with the ability to analyze these data as a function of time (4-d) model, with the possibility of combining different analysis criteria to display the data, create sections of the information in any direction needed, cut the data at any elevation to see what has happened through the life and development of the mine  the seismic history of the mine can be displayed and analyzed using the developed technique, defining areas of progressive deterioration associated to the energy levels released by the seismic events | 
2014-7751 	 investigation of enhancing drill cuttings cleaning and penetration rate using cavitating pressure pulses |abstract  this laboratory investigation involved evaluating the potential to enhance drilling rate of penetration (rop) and drilling efficiency by applying axial vibrations on the bit using a pulse cavitation drilling tool in combination with varying levels of axial compliance  the pulse cavitation tool generates cavitation bubbles in the drilling fluid by flowing through a venturi  when the cavitation bubbles produced within the tool are collapsed, pressure pulses are generated which produce pressure pulsations and oscillatory forces on the bit  drilling results were evaluated on the basis of rop, mechanical specific energy (mse), bit loads and bit displacements  the tool was tested both with and without compliance to evaluate the effects of the compliant element  experimental results show that the pulse cavitation tool starts to cavitate and produce vibrations when a critical flow rate is reached  when the drilling system was rigid (i e  no compliance was used), the vibration produced did not have any significant effect on the rop  however, when the drilling system was compliant the vibrations produced by the tool intensified the natural displacement vibration of the compliant element and the rop was increased and mse was decreased | 
2014-7753 	 gas release mechanisms from energy wellbores |abstract  because of autogenous shrinkage of cement and the subsequent reduction in radial contact stress between the borehole wall and the cement, a micro-annulus may develop that creates a pathway by which natural gas may rise outside the casing  this gas may become evident as sustained casing pressure (scp) in the us, or in canada as surface casing vent flow (scvf) or as gas migration (gm), i e , that which occurs outside the casing strings  gm may emit at ground surface as a greenhouse gas or penetrate shallow aquifers causing groundwater contamination  several observers have noted that gas emissions recorded as surface casing vent releases display a pulsing or periodic nature, which is of consequence if such emissions are to be monitored  we hypothesize that these pulses are due to the formation of taylor bubbles, i e , gas slugs, which are created by the coalescence of small bubbles  their displacement pressure is sufficient to overcome the capillary entry pressure posed by shallow aquifers and thus cause groundwater contamination | 
2014-7756 	 comparison of triaxial strength tests of ‘clean halite’ and ‘argillaceous halite’ from the wipp |abstract  in order to deepen the comprehension of the stress-strain behavior of 'clean halite' and 'argillaceous halite' from the wipp, 20 core samples were left to the institute of soil mechanics and foundation engineering of the technische universitat braunschweig  the experimental data is obtained to derive material parameters for high-quality material models which describe the stress- and time-deformation behavior of the two salt facies  rock salt shows a brittle fracture behavior at the used strain rate of 1 0 10-5 s-1  with a low confining pressure the specimens reach the ultimate strength followed by the typical post failure behavior of rock salt  a volume expansion is already observable below the ultimate stress state, i e  to a loosening of the specimen by dilatancy and micro-cracking  the volumetric strain rate will be at its maximum when the fracture stress is reached  the visual impression shows a clear difference between the two types of salt  therefore, the salt facies are likely to show a different stressstrain behavior, because in each case different fracture mechanisms should dominate  but this impression cannot be confirmed by the conducted experiments | 
2014-7757 	 the direct and brazilian tensile strength of rock in the light of size effect and bimodularity |abstract  the direct and brazilian tension tests are the most popular methods for measuring the tensile strength of rocks  while the values of tensile strength obtained from these test are theoretically expected to be identical, the accumulated experimental data show that the direct tensile strength is different from the brazilian tensile strength in most cases  in an attempt to explore the potential reasons for such discrepancy, the direct and brazilian tension tests are compared in the light of size effect and bimodularity  the problem of size effect is investigated using the two approaches of statistical theory of strength and linear elastic fracture mechanics  the effect of bimodularity of the material on the induced stresses in the tension tests is also examined  based on the effect of size and bimodularity, equations have been derived to relate the direct and brazilian tensile strength  the results of the direct, brazilian and fracture toughness tests on lac de bonnet granite were used to validate the equations | 
2014-7758 	 flow rate dependent skin in water disposal injection well: case study |abstract  re-injection is one of the most important methods to dispose fluid associated with oil and natural gas production  disposed fluids include produced water, hydraulic fracture flow back fluids, and drilling mud fluids  several formation damage mechanisms are associated with the injection including damage due to filter cake formed at the formation face, bacteria activity, fluid incompatibility, free gas content, and clay activation   fractured injection is typically preferred over matrix injection because a hydraulic fracture will enhance the well injectivity and extend the well life  in a given formation, the fracture dimensions change with different injection flow rates due to the change in injection pressures  also, for a given flow rate, the skin factor varies with time due to the fracture propagation  in this study, well test and injection history data of a class ii disposal well in south texas were used to develop an equation that correlates the skin factor to the injection flow rate and injection time  the results show that with time, the skin factor decreases until such a point at which the fracture dimensions are sufficient without further propagation to handle the injected water volume (stationary fracture)  a constant skin factor is noted after this point  at higher injection flow rates, the constant skin factor achieved is lower because of the larger fracture dimensions developed at higher injection flow rates | 
2014-7759 	 a novel technique for assessment of fracture geometry and injection domain from falloff tests after fractured injection of slurry: case study |abstract  this paper presents a novel technique for assessment of fracture and injection domain geometry from fall off tests  using type curve analysis techniques established in part for long term water injection, algorithms were developed for assessment of geomechanical and fracture properties of injectors  these properties include the stress contrast between the injection and containment layers, the rate of fracture shrinkage (height and/or length) during fall off, the extent of the inner relative permeability domain and outer domain, and others   a software tool was developed to incorporate these algorithms  the tool was used to analyze fall-off test results obtained from a large-scale slurry injection operation used for disposal of drilling wastes in alaska’s north slope  the software tool’s predicted fracture height showed very good agreement to the height interpreted from temperature logs conducted by the operator in the well | 
2014-7761 	 an advanced, integrated simulator for management of produced water re-injection in multilayer vertical or horizontal wells |abstract  produced water re-injection (pwri) is often the safest and most economical method for disposal of produced water in the oil industry  two key issues that affect the management of pwri are the formation damage and the constrained pumping pressure at the wellhead  a simulator was developed to handle the design of single-zone or multi-zone water injection in multilayered reservoirs  the simulator can accommodate both vertical and horizontal wells operated under matrix and/or fractured regimes  it is also able to account for the impact of formation damage and user-defined wellhead pressure constraints  results obtained from the simulator showed good agreement with known injection behaviors  for vertical wells, injection conformance depends on kh (permeability-thickness) and the minimum horizontal stress; in the case of multi-fractured horizontal wells, the outermost fractures (those near the tip and the heel of the horizontal well) are longer than the fractures in the middle  lastly, by constraining the maximum allowable surface pressure, frictional pressure drops in both the wellbore and fracture cause the injection rate to decline, which in turn affects both the fracture geometry and the maximum disposal volumes | 
2014-7763 	 numerical investigation of a hydraulic fracture driven in weak poroplastic formation |abstract  we investigate the main pumping parameters that influence a fluid driven fracture in cohesive poroelastoplastic weak formation  these parameters include the fluid viscosity and the injection rate  the first parameter dominates in the mapping of the propagation regimes from toughness to viscosity while the second parameter controls the storage to leak-off dominated regime through diffusion   the fracture is driven in weak permeable formation by injecting an incompressible viscous fluid at the fracture inlet assuming plane strain conditions  fluid flow in the fracture is modeled by lubrication theory  irreversible rock deformation is modeled with the mohr-coulomb yield criterion assuming associative flow rule  fracture propagation criterion is based on the cohesive zone approach  leak-off is also considered  we perform numerical calculations with the finite element method to obtain the fracture opening, length and propagation pressure versus time   we demonstrate that pumping parameters influence the fracture geometry and fluid pressures in weak formations through the diffusion process that create back stresses and large plastic zones as the fracture propagates  we also show that the product of propagation velocity and fluid viscosity, (<u+03bc>v) that appears in the scaling controls the magnitude of the plastic zones and influences the net pressure and fracture geometry | 
2014-7767 	 the evolution of polygonal fault systems: insights from geomechanical forward modeling |abstract  polygonal fault systems (pfs) are increasingly observed in seismic data of the subsurface  these unusual networks of normal faults are known to develop over vast areas in fine-grained sequences which in many cases may form the regional caprock  consequently, there is the potential for pfs to compromise the integrity of these sequences with obvious implications for subsurface fluid migration  the processes leading to the formation of pfs remain poorly understood, although their confinement to particular sediment packages and spatial extent are powerful arguments for a constitutive control  the work presented here attempts to progress recent efforts examining a diagenetic trigger for polygonal fault genesis  more specifically, investigations of diagenetically sourced structure development in mudstones have been undertaken in order to formulate a geomechanical argument to explain their formation  this argument is tested in finite strain computational models using the geomechanical code elfen, so that the formation over geological time can be studied  prediction of pfs in both two and three dimensions are presented that demonstrate that this modelling approach can predict realistic pfs geometries including the observed transition from random to preferential fault alignment with increasing degree of stress anisotropy | 
2014-7771 	 applications of rock scratching tests in borehole instability |abstract  the mechanical properties of rocks are essential for analysis of different problems during oil and gas drilling and production and future development  these properties are required for borehole stability, sand production, and select optimum flow rate during the completion stage and many other problems related with the short and long term mechanical stability of the well and the reservoir  the correct predictions may help in saving millions of dollars in drilling and completions costs, and may allow preventing long term and costly consequences  a common problem in oil and gas industry is the unavailability of the real core samples  to overcome this problem the engineers struggle to develop alternative sources of data via correlations, log measurements, etc  in this study, a simple scratching cell was developed and data produced was used to develop a correlation for predicting the unconfined compressive strength (ucs) for saudi arabian rocks    the output of this paper is a great addition to the rock mechanics and petroleum engineering disciplines especially in borehole instability problems during drilling of oil and gas wells | 
2014-7772 	 numerical simulation of strength and deformation behavior of inherently anisotropic rocks |abstract  rock anisotropy is one of the most distinctive features that must be considered in rock mechanics  in this study, two-dimensional discrete element simulations are conducted to investigate the strength and deformation behavior of inherently anisotropic rocks which display different behaviors in response to load with respect to the different orientations of the plane of weakness  in the numerical model, intact rock is represented by bonding rigid particles at their contacts together  the inherent anisotropy is modeled by artificially removing any parallel bonds dipping around a certain angle to the loading direction and replacing them with smooth joint contacts  the numerical model is validated by comparing the strength and elastic modulus with previous experimental results  the failure patterns can be classified into: split cross weak layers, shear along weak layers and split along weak layers, which also agree with that observed in laboratory  the angle range plays an important role on the response of numerical model which can be used to represent the degree of anisotropy  the numerical model proposed in this study provides a new way to investigate the mechanical behavior of anisotropic rock  future studies can be carried out to investigate the strength criterion of anisotropic rock based on this approach | 
2014-7774 	 a review of hydraulic-fracture induced microseismicity |abstract  microseismic monitoring of hydraulic fracturing has provided great value for understanding hydraulic fracturing in unconventional reservoirs, including measurement of fracture geometry and optimization of stimulations, completions, and field development  nevertheless, microseismic monitoring is a complex endeavor and many issues of fielding, analysis, uncertainty, and geophysics should be carefully assessed  the geomechanics of the generation of microseismicity are still being investigated, as well as the source mechanisms and how it all relates to the fracturing process  besides the value for field development and resource recovery, microseismic monitoring has also proved useful for evaluating environmental and safety issues  data from thousands of fractures show that the levels of induced seismicity in typical relaxed sedimentary basins are well below any levels that would be of concern for safety or damage  similarly, data from thousands of fractures show that hydraulic fractures in shale reservoirs do not propagate into aquifers | 
2014-7775 	 acoustic emission monitoring of heterogeneous rock hydraulic fracturing |abstract  in this paper, the results of laboratory studies of hydraulic fracture in homogeneous sandstone blocks with man-made interfaces and heterogeneous shale blocks with weak natural interfaces are reported  tests were conducted under similar stress conditions, with fluids of different viscosity and at different injection rates  the measurements and analysis allows the identification of fracture initiation and behavior  fracturing with high viscosity fluids resulted in stable fracture propagation initiated before breakdown, while fracturing with low viscosity fluids resulted in unstable fracture propagation initiated almost simultaneously with breakdown  analysis also allows us to measure the fluid volume entering the fracture and the fracture volume  monitoring of acoustic emission (ae) hypocenter localizations, indicates the development of created fractured area including the intersection with interfaces, fluid propagation along interfaces, crossing interfaces, and approaching the boundaries of the block  we observe strong differences in hydraulic fracture behavior, fracture geometry and fracture propagation speed, when fracturing with water and high viscosity fluids  we also observed distinct differences between sandstone blocks and shale blocks, when a certain p-wave velocity ray path is intersected by the hydraulic fracture  the velocity increases in sandstones and decreases in shale | 
2014-7777 	 the effect of proppant size on hydraulic fracturing by a slurry |abstract  proppant additives play an essential role in hydraulic fracturing as they provide support, which retains the fracture opening after the pumping is shut off  from a production point of view, a larger proppant size provides better permeability, while, at the same time, gravitational settling may cause significant distortion of the particle distribution inside the fracture for heavier particles  this study uses a recently developed model for proppant transport, that has been implemented for khristianovich-zheltov- geertsma-de klerk (kgd) and pseudo-3d (p3d) fracture geometries, to quantify the effect of particle settling  the proppant transport model is based on an empirical constitutive relation for the slurry that accounts for: i) a non-uniform particle distribution across the fracture width due to shear-induced migration, which distorts the parabolic velocity profile, ii) slip velocity in the direction of flow, which, in the limit of a jammed state, leads to darcy’s law, and iii) gravitational settling  while the gravitational settling is the biggest concern when dealing with larger particle sizes, other effects may include earlier jamming due to proppant stalling in between the walls and higher permeability of the proppant plug, which promotes the fracture propagation in front of the jammed region | 
2014-aaa 	 resistance temperature detectors and distributed temperature system accurately characterize thermal conditions of deepwater methane hydrate reservoir |abstract  a methane hydrate deposit offshore japan to be developed needed confirmation of its producibility  this required creating an advanced monitoring system that could be deployed in observation wells  these wells would allow tracking of the thermal disassociation front as the methane was produced  in those wells, the heat released by cement curing could cause unwanted gas hydrate dissociation, which could affect the integrity of the well and surrounding formations  before putting any wells on production, it was important to validate the advanced monitoring system and confirm the integrity of the observation wells   three test wells — one production and two monitoring — were drilled, and the monitoring wells were completed with a unique sandface system combining array-type resistance temperature detector (rtd) sensors and optical distributed temperature sensing (dts)  the dts system required an optical system to be marinized for the seabed and was configured with acoustic telemetry  the temperature measurement started immediately after the wells were drilled  this allowed temperature changes to be monitored during cement pumping and curing so that the heat effect on the gas hydrate formation could be detected  the rtd sensors recorded the exact temperature at each measurement point during cementing through direct connection to an acquisition system on the surface and were disconnected afterward  temperature changes were monitored with dts sensors connected to a subsea acquisition system and controller  the dts measurements were continued until the flow test, with the acquisition parameters adjustable by the acoustic telemetry   the rtd and dts sensors were designed to be accurate to 0 1 0c, with the rtd sensors with resolution on the order of 0 001 0c  this accuracy and resolution were validated via real-time data  the temperature in the well began rising as soon as the cement was injected behind the casing  this increase was relatively high in several zones where large washouts had occurred because of the amount of cement-released heat  the temperature dropped rapidly 2 days after the cementing operation and finally stabilized after several months, demonstrating that the effect of the monitoring wells on gas hydrate formation was minimal  the high-resolution rtd sensors were reactivated before the production test and continued to agree closely with the dts data   a quality control data check confirmed that the sandface monitoring systems were operating reliably and the dissociation of the gas hydrate was minimal  the system will enable the operator to validate not just the possibility of real-time sandface monitoring, but also the method and economics of producing gas from the methane hydrate reservoirs  this new method of thermal monitoring may prove useful for targeting previously untapped deepwater resources where doing so was previously impossible | 
2014-b 	 integrated rock classification in carbonate formations based on elastic and petrophysical properties estimated from conventional well logs |abstract  a reliable rock classification in carbonate reservoirs should take into account petrophysical, compositional, and elastic properties of the formation  however depth-by-depth assessment of these properties is challenging, as the result of complex pore geometry and significant heterogeneity caused by diagenesis  common rock classification methods in carbonate formations are typically based on core measurements and require an extensive core database, whereas core data are usually not available at all desired depths  furthermore, elastic properties, which control fracture propagation and the conductivity of fracture under closure stress, are often not taken into account in conventional rock classification techniques  in this paper, we apply an integrated rock classification technique based on both depositional and diagenesis effects to significantly enhance (a) assessment of petrophysical properties, (b) selection of candidates for fracture treatment, and (c) production in carbonate reservoirs   we jointly apply conductive and elastic effective medium theories to estimate depth-by-depth volumetric concentration of interparticle (e g , interconnected pore space) and intraparticle (e g , vugs) pores, as well as elastic bulk and shear moduli, in the formation  this process takes into account the impact of shape and volumetric concentrations of rock components on electrical conductivity and elastic properties   we document a successful application of the introduced technique in the upper leonardian carbonate interval of the veterans field, in west texas  the identified rock types were verified using thin-sections, core samples, and high-resolution borehole image logs, where available  we estimated elastic moduli as well as interparticle porosity with average relative errors of approximately 8% and 14% compared to the core measurements, respectively  furthermore, the well-log-based estimates of permeability and water saturation were improved by approximately 50% and 20%, respectively | 
2014-cc 	 petrophysics for rock physics: what really matters at seismic scale? |abstract  rock physics analysis is a key stage in seismic based reservoir characterization studies, which attempt to determine the most plausible 3d distribution of the reservoir and the fluids they contain  rock physics uses the results of a petrophysical evaluation as input, together with the results of laboratory measurements, where available, and combines these using both theoretical and empirical relations to understand how the seismic signal responds to changes in the reservoir properties  the input petrophysical properties are often used as if they were implicit and not derived properties and are rarely questioned or reviewed  in reality, these properties are estimated empirically or semi-empirically and, therefore, carry intrinsic uncertainty  a common misunderstanding, among geophysicists, is that the small scale changes in mineral and fluid fractions have little or no impact at seismic scale  as a result they often accept a petrophysical evaluation that is over-simplified for use in seismic applications  furthermore, when a mismatch is found between the observed data and the rock physics predictions, the usual conclusion is that this is due to uncertainties in the theories or the seismic data rather than a problem with the input petrophysical evaluation | 
2014-d 	 wireline spectral porosity analysis of the arab limestone—from rosetta stone to cipher |abstract |the arab formation limestone contains a very large portion of the world’s oil  proper characterization of the reservoir’s dynamic properties is important for maximizing the ultimate oil recovery, produced by peripheral waterflood  geological characterization of the arab limestone is mature, with many hundreds of cores described within a depositional model  detailed petrographic studies describe the ubiquitous presence of both macropores and micropores  fifty years of wettability studies indicate an overall neutral to slightly water-wet state  |the "rosetta stone" project added an extensive arab limestone pore system database and classification of prevalent multimodal pore systems  the multimodal pore systems are nested, embedded, and connected  the pore systems can be treated as mixtures of instances from four basic maximum pore-throat populations (porositons)  the most common class is the bimodal macroporosity–type 1 microporosity (m_1) system  the multimodal pore system properties have a profound impact on the reservoir dynamics affecting ultimate waterflood oil recovery  these are the subject of active laboratory displacement studies and field recovery monitoring  |the petrophysical technology for the simultaneous presence of macroporosity and microporosity is mature when the microporosity is associated with clay  for carbonates, the technology is immature  the impetus for an arab limestone pore system solution based on well logs is multifold  the rosetta stone data indicate four distinct maximum pore-throat modes  arab limestone nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) well logs exhibit multimodal pore-body distributions similar to the four pore throat modes  core samples exhibiting bimodal pore-throat distributions also display bimodal nmr pore-body distributions  the micro-porositons are stable fieldwide and present in every vertical section, hence, despite potential well-to-well global signal variations, consistent pore system analyses result by using the stable recurring signals as downhole calibrators  these are extracted using depth-selective pore body spectral stacks  the low-resolution time-decay data from wireline nmr supports analysis using only a few gaussian lineshapes  finally, the complete pore system range is not covered by a single porosimetry device, so the technology must include a facility for spectral porosity signal splicing and merging  a strong driver for the carbonate wireline technology is the accelerated accumulation of large volumes of pore system data compared to the costly and time-consuming core and core-plug analysis process | 
2014-h 	 nmr permeability estimators under different relaxation time selections: a laboratory study of cretaceous diagenetic chalks |abstract  in this paper, a comparative study was performed of nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) permeability estimators under different relaxation time selections  we evaluated a set of laboratorial nmr transverse relaxation time (t2) measurements of fully brine-saturated cretaceous diagenetic chalks  classical pythagorean means (harmonic, geometric and arithmetic) of relaxation time distributions and critical relaxation times at arbitrary cumulative saturations cutoffs (from 5 to 85% in increments of 5%) were associated with nmr porosity and correlated with absolute gas permeability  additionally, to mitigate the low sensitivity of nmr relaxation time to pore size that is typically present in carbonates, mercury injection capillary pressure (micp) curves were used to size scale the respective relaxation time distributions |although the relaxation geometric mean is widely employed by the industry, this study suggests that in some cases, it may not be the best selection for nmr permeability estimations  among the relaxation time averages, the arithmetic mean performed better before and after the micp size scaling  the best estimations were achieved for relaxation time selections in cumulative saturation cutoffs and performance increased when size-scaled distributions were used  these results have a direct impact on core-log permeability workflows and reinforce the importance of nmr-micp integration | 
2014-i 	 waterflood surveillance in lower quality carbonate reservoir: history matching of fluid front beyond wellbore using deeplook electromagnetic time-lapse surveys |abstract  waterflood is the most commonly field development scheme used for hydrocarbon recovery in carbonate reservoirs  successfully managing water injection scheme greatly depends on the reservoir characterization, in both structure and fluids distribution, that in turn requires a variety of subsurface measurements coupled with the ability to integrate them into a coherent subsurface models   electrical resistivity is an important tool in formation evaluation of oil and gas reservoirs, and frequently used in logging programs to evaluate near-well reservoir rocks, fluids saturations and to help design well completions  with the extended use and added complexity of reservoir modelling it has become imperative to extend this knowledge away from the wellbores and into the reservoir, thereby enhancing the understanding of fluids distribution inside the reservoirs, thus improving overall field management  this can be accomplished by applying tools that are sensitive to the interwell environment  one of these tools is inductive deeplook electromagnetics or crosswell electromagnetics (em)  crosswell em is an induction based tomography technology, which inductively measures the interwell resistivity between wells  this technology, particularly useful for tracking water and steam floods or mapping residual saturation, is also used to optimize sweep efficiency, identify bypassed pay, and predict fluid-related issues such as water breakthrough   integration of crosswell em interpreted results to reservoir characterization process may offer new wide range applications to deep reading measurements  the current crosswell em interpretations are the results of inverted resistivity and hence the water saturation in pseudo 3-d format between wells  until now there are no methods, workflows or tools available to integrate crosswell em data into the reservoir characterization process through history matching   this paper presents the methodology and investigation of integration of complex crosswell em results to history matching process in order to improve the reservoir characterization during dynamic modelling  the use of this data in reservoir characterization has not been yet considered by the industry  our attempt is to lead the oil industry to utilize crosswell em data in the history matching process of the legacy data  the proposed workflow helps reduce and/or quantify uncertainties in the reservoir model  therefore, the inclusion of time lapse crosswell em data into history matching will improve the understanding of the flow paths, barriers, as well as lateral and vertical transmissibility | 
2014-ll 	 inversion-based workflow for quantitative interpretation of the new-generation oil-based mud resistivity imager |abstract  the new high-definition oil-based mud (obm) imager is a pad-based microelectrical imager operating at high frequency to establish capacitive contact with the formation in wellbores filled with nonconductive mud  from multiple modes of operation, formation resistivity-like images are generated using an efficient composite data-processing scheme that approximates formation resistivity either by filtering or applying a correction to minimize the contribution of the obm to the measured signal  data from the different modes are ?blended? based on estimated formation parameters to generate an optimized image  this approach requires some knowledge of mud electrical properties   in addition to the composite processing scheme, we also developed a model-based parametric inversion for quantitative interpretation  the gauss-newton algorithm matches the measurements to an accurate computationally efficient approximate forward model built by multidimensional fitting of the data generated using a finite-element simulation  the workflow overcomes the underdetermined inversion problem and calibration limitations of the measurements  the inversion allows flexible model definition and parameterization, including refinement of the calibration, and can process intervals of logging data and measurements from multiple buttons simultaneously  the workflow stabilizes the inversion and improves the consistency of the processed results  to overcome the underdetermined nature of the problem and speed up the inversion, we use a sequence of inversion runs to first iteratively estimate the mud properties for a small depth section of the log; this estimate is then used to invert for the button standoff and the formation resistivity and permittivity for longer data sections | 
2014-lll 	 application and quality control of core data for the development and validation of elemental spectroscopy log interpretation |abstract  core or cuttings samples are often analyzed for chemical and mineral composition to provide ground truth for developing petrophysical or geological applications or for validating log interpretations of elemental concentrations, mineralogy, and matrix properties  unfortunately, some core data are inaccurate, but they are rarely subjected to quality control measures and can therefore lead to erroneous conclusions regarding the validity of the log data   for core data, elemental concentrations are generally measured by x-ray fluorescence (xrf) or inductively coupled plasma (icp) techniques  the best way to validate results from these techniques is to test certified reference materials that are composed of sedimentary minerals similar in composition to samples of interest  core mineralogy is most commonly analyzed by x-ray diffraction (xrd) or fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ftir)  laboratory results can be evaluated by analyzing known mixtures of certified minerals   once it has been established that sources of accurate core elemental concentrations and mineralogy are available, it is advisable to implement routine quality control monitoring  an example of a quality control measure is a technique that requires independent analyses for elemental and mineral concentrations  the technique assumes that the minerals have fixed elemental compositions  measured mineralogy is used to compute elemental concentrations of the major elements, including si, al, k, fe, s, ca, mg, and na  derived elemental concentrations are compared with the measured elemental concentrations  deviations between the derived and measured concentrations are used to evaluate the quality of the input data  examples of both good and poor inputs for elemental and mineral data are shown  once the quality of the data is proved to be good, it is possible to use the data to validate the accuracy of interpretations developed for elemental spectroscopy logs, such as the closure model to convert concentrations to yields and models to interpret mineralogy | 
2014-tttt 	 case studies of dielectric logging in a highly fractured carbonate reservoir in the gulf of mexico |abstract  after almost 30 years, dielectric logging is going through a recent revival  this is mostly due to the improved logging tools that minimize the effect of the environment  dielectric measurements offer an alternative method for water fraction estimation in the flushed zone fairly independent of salinity  this independent water volume can be used to determine the remaining oil saturation free of the use of resistivity logs or doped-mud nmr techniques  however, important obstacles that restrict the use of this technology are still found in the field, particularly in highly fractured carbonate reservoirs  rock heterogeneity with massive drilling fluid losses exist in this difficult environment  some considerations in running the dielectric tool are: 1) signal attenuation in highly resistive muds, 2) rock texture and 3) calculation of an accurate matrix permittivity   this paper presents four case studies in which dielectric logs, in combination with other logging measurements, were used to determine ros in a highly fractured cretaceous carbonate reservoir in the gulf of mexico  the cretaceous reservoir in this area has a wide range of petrophysical properties  the results from two different dielectric tools, one with single frequency and the other with multiple frequencies, are shown as part of our analysis to determine the impact of dielectric dispersion caused by texture effects  in addition the use of mineralogy-type logs to improve dielectric calculations is discussed as a means to get better measurements in the calculation of accurate matrix permittivity  finally the results of using dielectric tools in both oil and water based mud are presented to find solutions that can expand the use of this technology   the purpose of this paper is to provide best practices that can be implemented during the pre and post data acquisition of dielectric logs to facilitate petrophysical interpretations | 
2014-v55n2a5 	 formation-evaluation challenges and opportunities in deepwater |abstract |formation evaluation plays multiple critical roles in deepwater exploration and development  from the point of view of safety, real-time formation evaluation helps mitigate drilling-associated risks and optimize drilling parameters  the practices of pore-pressure prediction and wellbore stability estimates are based on real-time logs, including acoustic and gamma measurements and formation-pressure tests, as well as surface-data logs  by continually monitoring and interpreting the measurements, formation-evaluation specialists help the drillers stay within safe limits, while optimizing the rate of penetration  in more recent applications, real-time borehole-geometry logs help recognize potentially unstable zones  from the point of view of well positioning, real-time information helps the geophysicist and the geologist recognize the strata and locate the well more accurately on the structure  some of the same sensors used for drilling safety and for drilling optimization are also instrumental in locating the well on the geological section  |because the economics for deepwater require significantly more rigor and better risk assessment and reduction than for land or for near-shore prospects, formation evaluation is generally comprehensive and thorough  operators will deploy the most advanced technology in order to obtain a more complete view of the reservoir  in addition to the traditional triple-combo logging sensors, advanced 3d resistivity sensors and magnetic-resonance logs are routinely utilized in deepwater  there are striking examples of fluid typing with the latter, while the former helps evaluate turbidite reservoirs, and in some cases determine the structural dip  fluid-sampling analyzers continue to improve in sensitivity and accuracy  a new integrated optical spectrometer provides direct compositional fluid analysis based on analog optical computation methods  |formation evaluation in deepwater is performed with either wireline or lwd or a combination of both  wireline has been traditionally considered as more accurate and with a more complete offering  the quality gap however is narrowing with the introduction of the latest technology in lwd  formation fluid sampling and high-resolution borehole imaging are now possible in lwd, although with less flexibility, at this writing  logs acquired while drilling encounter significantly less invasion and fewer borehole irregularities than with wireline  they are often as accurate as their wireline counterparts, but remain limited in accommodating the large range of borehole sizes seen in deepwater  lwd logs are sent via telemetry to the surface as “insurance logging”, should the well be lost  lwd logs do provide actionable information for real-time decisions, including geopressure information, identification of geological events and their characteristics, and the precise location of oil-water contact, gas-oil contact, formation tops, fractures and faults | 
2014-v55n2a6 	 quantifying the effect of kerogen on resistivity measurements in organic-rich mudrocks |abstract |interpretation of resistivity logs in organic-rich mudrocks has been challenging for petrophysicists  conventional resistivity-porosity-saturation models (e g , archie, dual-water, and waxman-smits) assume that the pore water is the only conductive part of the formation  however, this assumption is not reliable in the presence of the thermally mature organic matter, clay, and pyrite found in many source rocks  previous experimental studies indicate that as the aromaticity of kerogen increases with increasing thermal maturity, the conductive behavior of kerogen is also affected  in this paper, we investigated the effect of conductive kerogen on the resistivity of mature source rocks  |we investigated the reliability of conventional resistivity-porosity-saturation models for estimating fluid saturation in organic-rich mudrocks, using well logs and core measurements from the haynesville shale  we then numerically simulated the electric field, electric currents, and effective resistivity of synthetic pore-scale rock images  finally, we used numerical simulation to quantify the effects of the (a) volumetric concentration of kerogen, (b) kerogen conductivity, and (c) spatial connectivity of the kerogen-water network on the resistivity of organic-rich mudrocks  |well-log interpretation of the haynesville shale showed that conventional resistivity-porosity-saturation models underestimate hydrocarbon saturation in zones with high concentrations of kerogen  in this paper, we show that errors in the estimation of of hydrocarbon saturation could be due to the effect of kerogen on resistivity measurements  our pore-scale numerical simulations show that there is a 10 to 23% improvement in hydrocarbon-saturation estimates, when the impact of conductive kerogen is taken into account  results of this work can be used as a first step towards improving conventional resistivity-porositysaturation models for the assessment of fluid saturations in organic-rich mudrocks | 
2014-v55n4a2 	 direct hydrodynamic simulation of multiphase flow in porous rock |abstract |we present various numerical studies conducted with a novel pore-scale simulation technology called direct hydrodynamic (dhd) simulation that can be used to study multiphase flow at various scales ranging from individual pore-scale events to complex scenarios like capillary desaturation and relative permeability of digitized rock samples  dhd uses a diffuse interface description for fluid-fluid interfaces that is implemented via the density-functional approach applied to the hydrodynamics of complex systems  in addition to mass and momentum balance, a full thermodynamic energy balance is considered  hence the simulator inherently takes into consideration multiphase and multicomponent behavior and is suited for nonisothermal cases which allows the handling of many physical phenomena including multiphase compositional flows with phase transitions, different types of fluid-rock and fluid-fluid interactions (e g  wettability and adsorption), and various types of fluid rheology  |the dhd simulator is a research prototype optimized for high-performance computing (hpc) and applied to porous media systems  we demonstrate the utility of dhd to simulate two-phase flow displacement ranging from the classical “lenormand” pore-scale displacement events and roof’s snap-off criteria to more complex cooperative phenomena like capillary desaturation and relative permeability  the simulation results are benchmarked against experimental data in coreflooding, a 2d micromodel, and synchrotron-based x-ray microtomography experiments and provide good agreement | 
2014-v55n4a3 	 multiphase flow in porous rock imaged under dynamic flow conditions with fast x-ray computed microtomography |abstract |pore-scale events in multiphase flow in porous rock have been directly imaged in real time by using fast (15 to 60 seconds) synchrotron-based x-ray computed microtomography  in the past, pore-scale fluid displacements in porous media could only be imaged under quasistatic conditions where at scanning times of several minutes to hours, fluid distributions were subject to capillary redistribution  here, pore-scale displacement events in porous rock were imaged in situ in real time in natural rock under dynamic flow conditions, where the pressure gradient and the viscocapillary balance were maintained during scanning  two elementary processes, haines jumps in drainage and snap-off in imbibition, were studied in detail for sintered glass, sandstone, and carbonate rock  we found that most haines jump events do not displace the wetting phase pore-by-pore, but typically involve 10 to 20 individual pores and that filling events are cooperative  we also found that in sandstone rock 64% of the externally applied work is actually dissipated during these jumps and approximately 36% is converted into interfacial energy | 
2014-v55n5a2 	 application and quality control of core data for the development and validation of elemental spectroscopy log interpretation |abstract |core or cuttings samples are often analyzed for chemical and mineral composition to provide ground truth for developing petrophysical or geological applications or for validating log interpretations of elemental concentrations, mineralogy, and matrix properties  unfortunately, some core data are inaccurate, but they are rarely subjected to quality-control measures and can therefore lead to erroneous conclusions regarding the validity of the log data  |for core data, elemental concentrations are generally measured by x-ray fluorescence (xrf) or inductively coupled plasma (icp) techniques  the best way to validate results from these techniques is to test certified reference materials that are composed of sedimentary minerals similar in composition to samples of interest  core mineralogy is most commonly analyzed by x-ray diffraction (xrd) or fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (ftir)  laboratory results can be evaluated by analyzing known mixtures of certified minerals  |once it has been established that sources of accurate core elemental concentrations and mineralogy are available, it is advisable to implement routine quality-control monitoring  an example of a quality-control measure is a technique that requires independent analyses for elemental and mineral concentrations  the technique assumes that the minerals have fixed elemental compositions  measured mineralogy is used to compute elemental concentrations of the major elements, including si, al, k, fe, s, ca, mg, and na  derived elemental concentrations are compared with the measured elemental concentrations  deviations between the derived and measured concentrations are used to evaluate the quality of the input data  examples of both good and poor inputs for elemental and mineral data are shown  once the quality of the data is proved to be good, it is possible to use the data to validate the accuracy of interpretations developed for elemental spectroscopy logs, such as the closure model to convert concentrations to yields and models to interpret mineralogy | 
2014-v55n6a2 	 buckling of buoyancy-assisted tubulars |use of buoyancy provides multiple solutions to overcome the drag problem for wells with shallow and high step-out profiles  although both full- and partial-flotation methodologies have been used successfully to extend the reach in many field cases, the influence of buoyancy on tubular instability has not been investigated yet  this paper presents an extensive experimental and analytical study, focusing on static tubular instability inside horizontal wellbores with emphasis on buoyancy  in terms of the experimental research, running tubulars into horizontal wellbores was simulated with four different pipes, varying buoyancy, and varying loading speed  throughout the tests, axial loads both applied to the pipe and transmitted through the pipe were recorded simultaneously, with respect to pipe displacement  experiments reveal that currently existing models give reasonable approximations as long as buoyancy is not included in the tests  the major interpretation from the experiments is contrary to what currently existing expressions imply (i e , tubular buckles immediately as effective weight approaches zero; even for naturally buoyant conditions, considerable amount of axial load is still required for both buckling initiation and helix formation)  as buoyancy increases further, results and predictions diverge from each other considerably  to eliminate the discrepancies between results and predictions,theoretical study was conducted  empirical correlations that also consider the influence of buoyancy on critical buckling loads are presented  finally, another pipe was also tested within different buoyancy conditions to validate the equations developed  experimental results of this pipe closely match the new analytical findings  this experimental and analytical study provides useful results for future applications with buoyancy-assisted tubulars, in terms of practical engineering and design calculations | 
2014-ww 	 the scratch test: a high resolution log of rock strength with application to geomechanic and petrophysic |abstract  the papers presents the scratch test, a novel technique born in the late 90’s at the university of minnesota that provides a direct measure of the rock strength (uniaxial compressive strength)  it is a simple, non-destructive, fast and robust test that bears the unique advantage of producing a log of strength with a high spatial resolution (centimetric) along the core sample   the high resolution nature of the test provides a unique insight on the scales and distribution of heterogeneities along the core samples, thereby offering new perspectives for routine and special core analysis   in the paper we first show (i) how the mismatch between the resolution scale of plug and well log measurements added to the discrete nature of plugging can lead to large errors in the establishment of correlation between petrophysical properties, and (ii) how early knowledge of small heterogeneity length scales can help avoid these errors and thereby reduce the uncertainty in the integration of core and wireline data for the characterization of reservoir rock units   we then illustrate with some examples how rock strength profiles averaged to the relevant length scale can be correlated with other petro-physical properties measured both on core plugs or inferred from well logs   finally, we discuss how standard and special core analysis could benefit most from all the features of the scratch test when introduced at a very early stage of the workflows | 
2014-www 	 inversion-based workflow to image faults crossed by the wellbore using deep directional resistivity provides new way of understanding complex formations |abstract  in the last decade, since its introduction, the successful use of deep directional electromagnetic measurements for well placement has been based on the application of a real-time automatic multilayer inversion  the basic assumption behind the inversion-based interpretation is that a 1d layered medium can be used to fit the data locally  however, the technology is increasingly used to place the wells in more complex scenarios, where that assumption does not hold  faulted formations are a common type of scenario encountered in most horizontal drilling projects, whether the wells are geosteered or not  since a fault is generally seen as a discontinuity in a layered formation, it does not fit the 1d assumption and cannot be accurately imaged with a 1d inversion  when long-spacing deep reading tools are used, the presence of faults badly distorts the 1d inversion results within several tens of feet around the fault event   this paper proposes a semi-automatic imaging workflow for faulted scenarios based on a series of inversions and processing steps taking advantage of the available directional measurement sensitivities to extract specific features such as the formation layering, resistivities, the remote boundaries, and the position and dip of the crossed fault plane itself  no user inputs are required at the start: the model complexity is increased from 1d to 2d as the workflow progresses, addressing challenges in integration of data of different scales  the inversions provide quality control to ensure that the intermediate results are geologically likely   the workflow was tested on a large number of synthetic cases at different scales and of increasing complexities to ensure stability  field data examples include single and multiple fault interpretation where deep measurements were used to evaluate change in formation dip due to drag near the fault  model consistency, positive match, and good reconstruction of directional data are all indicators of interpretation quality, and that the resulting fault model constitutes an adequate representation of the reservoir geometry at hand  this proves that more information can be obtained from deep directional electromagnetic datasets when specific workflows are designed from knowledge of the measurement physics to address specific complex scenarios with non-1d layered geometries | 
21-1122 	 global expansion of shale developments |abstract |shale development has been highly successful in north america  this has been accomplished by driving changes in every aspect of field development engineering and execution processes  in order for a shale development to succeed in countries outside the u s  and canada, change management must occur in many areas  three major challenges will be discussed in this paper: 1) national, regional, and local governments must establish tax and energy policies that encourage development while protecting health, safety, and the environment as well as providing a regulatory framework; 2) the shale resource meeting minimum criteria to meet economic development standards quickly; and 3) a sustained production delivering long-term economic viability  |the first challenge includes the following |• establishing simplified government regulations – to generate the energy company desire to develop and to satisfy people’s health, safety, environment and jobs requirements  how to generate goodwill among the parties through • ownership – surface/subsurface mineral rights and development taxes • public education on hydraulic fracturing – so the public will understand that use of hydraulic fracturing will not result in contamination of drinking water aquifers nor will water be waste  an incorrect perception and understanding of hydraulic fracturing has resulted in opposition to shale development  • environmental and human safety are delivered through advanced automation • infrastructure requirements for development  |the second challenge applies new advancements made in the last three years related to shale developments for the determination of quantitative asset economics • gathering the resource data needed to develop a comprehensive holistic engineering model that can successfully deliver production from an individual well perspective to a total optimized asset using the answers to the following questions  ? where to drill ? how to drill ? where to frac ? how to frac ? determine the economic viability of the resource play  |the third challenge involves responses to the following questions regarding sustaining the production for longterm economic viability with highlights of lessons learned in the last three years: • understanding the heterogeneity of the reservoir using geophysics, geomechanics, mineralogy, and petrophysics in a systematic, accurate, and rapid manner  • multidisciplinary collaboration to understand and identify the “sweetspots” within the reservoir and define a development plan  • deliver drilling operations with minimal npt and drill using optimized geosteering to land the lateral in the “sweetspot” to maximize the recovery potential  • precision fracturing with real-time monitoring to maximize hydraulic fracture area and fracture conductivity for strong initial and sustained production  • an optimized stimulation design and proppant delivery method, using custom chemistry and proppants that prevent formation damage and ensure all perforation clusters receive effective stimulation for sustained production  • innovations involving water recycling, reduced use of biocide, and adoption of dual-fuel equipment have improved shale economics and reduced the environmental impact  |this paper focuses on examples of new innovations introduced over the past few years that are yielding the “best in class” rates of return through efficient execution and sustained production | 
21-2101 	 hydraulic fracturing best practices |introduction |despite increasing efficiency measures in many parts of the world, the demographic increase, dynamic work environment, and diversity in work type, particularly in asia and the middle east, are contributing to increased energy consumption  although there are different sources of energy, in-depth assessment and analyses suggest that the world will rely heavily on fossil fuels for many decades to come, fig  1  a key resource in this energy equation is the natural gas  after the development and exploitation of the conventional gas resources, the more challenging unconventional resources have become a major target for future energy supply and are critically assessed and exploited to supplement in meeting the world energy demand  the primary mechanism to produce unconventional gas is the novel multistage hydraulic fracturing conducted in long horizontal wells  |the petroleum industry has been using hydraulic fracturing to commercially produce low to moderate permeability gas reservoirs  a successful fracturing treatment to achieve improved and sustained well productivity requires strategic planning from the very onset of the field development that includes geological and seismic study, well placement and trajectory, wellbore configuration, and optimal completion placement  the entire multidisciplinary team, from geoscience to petroleum engineering, needs to be fully involved for a successful completion of a tight gas field development project, fig  2  |depending on the reservoir characteristics, wells are drilled so that multiple fractures can initiate independently and high contact area is achieved creating easy flow path for the hydrocarbon from the reservoir to the wellbore  the influx of hydrocarbon is directly proportional to the surface area open to the wellbore, fig  3  the surface area is increased when fractures propagate perpendicular to the wellbore and multiple independent fractures can be created without overlaps, fig  4  |the selection of appropriate completion techniques, such as open hole or plug & perf, is also critical and depends on reservoir and completion characteristics as well as operational logistics  |the selection of fracturing fluids, additives, and proppant types are major components when designing and implementing a hydraulic fracturing treatment  a viscous, unbroken fracture fluid that may remain after the treatment compounds the effects of fracture face skin and causes severe deterioration to proppant conductivity thereby shadowing fracturing benefits  the fracture fluid footprint must be reduced while not negatively impacting its proppant carrying characteristics | 
21-2105 	 best practice in hydraulic fracturing: reducing the environmental footprint |introduction |hydraulic fracturing dates back to the middle of the last century  originally, the use of the process was restricted to relatively high permeability sandstones to which the hydrocarbons would flow to and become trapped  most of the early treatments on the last part of the 1900s were relatively small treatment that bypassed drilling damage and stimulated the target formation a few hundred feet the wellbore  |evolution of hydraulic fracturing |in the early 1990’s, advances in modeling contributed to the successful hydraulic fracturing of lower permeability, tight gas environments  new hydraulic fracturing fluid systems enabled a reduction in gel concentrations and improved well productivity  |as tight gas development, in largely sandstone formations, continued into the mid-2000’s, multi-zone pays become of interest to the operators  a key enabler to stimulating discreet intervals over a large gross interval was the introduction of more efficient staging technologies  during this era, it was not uncommon for an operator to stimulate 5 to 10 small sands over a +200 ft of gross interval in a single fracturing event  to make these wells economic, the operator had to perform this operation a dozen or more times on each well  in this period, we also saw the introduction of pad drilling where an offshore mentality was used to drill multiple land wells from a single surface location  in turn, this enabled us to work more efficiently  |towards the end of the last decade, we saw the emergence of unconventional shale resources  in the beginning, shale gas was the main target  but, as the process of combining horizontal wells with multistage fracturing was further refined, the technique was also applied to tight oil reservoirs  the key to success in the shale resources is maximizing reservoir contact  the difference between gas and oil in this environment is that gas wells utilized slickwater fluids to introduce “fracturing complexities” while oil required higher conductivity and utilized primarily conventional crosslinked fluid systems  additionally, job sizes in unconventional oil wells are typically smaller in size than their gas well counterparts and injection rates are lower | 
24590-ms 	 spectral fluorescence/reflectance optical sensor systems for arctic oil spill detection and mapping |abstract |in the rapidly expanding field of oil exploration and production, there is an emerging requirement to reliably detect, characterize and geospatially map oil spills in ice-covered waters during both summer and winter months in the arctic  this paper postulates two possible platform-based sensor architectures and examines predicted performance for the following: (1) an airborne, high-search-rate spectral fluorescence/reflectance lidar (sf/rl) that has the potential to detect and geolocate oil beneath the arctic ice as well as accurately measures ice thickness and (2) an autonomous underwater vehicle (auv)-borne sensor that can operate between the seafloor and the base of the ice utilizing an active optical spectral detection and discrimination sensor for oil trapped under the ice, settling on the seafloor and drifting in the water column  search rates for an aircraft at 2,000 ft and 125 kts through 4 inches of snow and 8 feet of ice with nominal lidar system parameters is predicted to be 336 km2/hr (1 5 km swath width and 20 m spatial sampling)  the auv-borne sensor would be composed of a compact sf/rl payload that conically scans ± 50° from nadir at a nominal oil detection depth of 75 ft |

25286-ms 	 pipeline lateral buckling: realistic modelling of geotechnical variability and uncertainty |abstract   this paper describes and explores the effects of geotechnical variability and uncertainty on the design of pipelines for thermal buckling and axial walking  geotechnical input parameters – ‘friction factors’ – are often assigned extremely wide ranges between low estimates (le) and high estimates (he), and these are assumed to apply uniformly along the pipeline in some design steps, or handled probabilistically in others  this paper clarifies the causes of geotechnical variability and uncertainty, identifying effects that are aleatory and epistemic  it proves useful to distinguish these effects on the basis of local and global influences that relate to short parts of the pipeline and the entire pipeline respectively    field data from a case study pipeline is used to demonstrate these sources of psi parameter variability and uncertainty  the aleatory (local) variability generally relates to the lay process and the resulting influence on the local soil strength and pipe embedment, and can also arise from in situ geotechnical heterogeneity  epistemic (global) uncertainty relates to potential systematic errors in the assessment of soil strength and the average influence of the lay process  the epistemic (global) uncertainty budget also includes uncertainty related to the calculation models used to determine psi parameters from soil properties, including their applicability for the site in question    pipeline buckling design generally involves two types of analysis: (1) probabilistic analysis of buckle initiation (and tolerability), usually using a monte carlo approach, e g  using the buckfast software; (2) deterministic analysis of buckling, usually using finite element analysis  in the probabilistic analysis the full psi le-he range is considered in each monte carlo realization, meaning the range is implicitly treated as aleatory (local)  in the deterministic (fe) analysis a single set of psi parameters are applied uniformly along the pipe meaning that the range is implicitly treated as epistemic (global)    this study compares the calculated and observed as-laid embedment of the case study pipeline and shows the resulting range of lateral breakout and residual resistance  these parameters are calculated by a monte carlo method that yields the covariation of these parameters and forms a useful tool for design  buckles tend to form at locations of low embedment and therefore low lateral breakout resistance which also have low residual lateral resistance, and can therefore tolerate higher feed-in  conventional design practice treats initiation and tolerability as independent calculations, which is unnecessarily onerous    the influence of aleatory (local) variability is then explored using the lateral psi parameters derived for the case study pipeline  fe analyses are firstly performed using le, be and he lateral resistance applied uniformly along the pipe (mirroring conventional design practice)  an additional analysis then uses the ‘real’ spatial variation in lateral resistance calculated directly from the embedment survey data  it is shown that the ‘real’ pipeline buckles at short (~20–40 m long) regions of local low lateral resistance  as these buckles lengthen, they experience a higher average lateral resistance  however, the resulting strains are significantly lower than calculated from the uniform he friction case that is conventionally considered in design    these observations provide impetus for a more sophisticated treatment of geotechnical uncertainty and variability in pipeline buckling design  current methods appear too onerous in some (but not all) respects  this paper provides techniques to reduce unnecessary conservatism, and to allow better definition and handling of geotechnical uncertainty and variability | 
25286-pt 	 video:                  pipeline lateral buckling: realistic modelling of geotechnical variability and uncertainty |description of the material: this paper provides an improved basis to include geotechnical variability in assessment of pipeline buckling, walking and hydrodynamic stability  geotechnical input parameters - ‘friction factors’ - for pipeline design are handled probabilistically to suit modern reliability-based design analyses  however, they are often assigned unnecessarily wide ranges between high and low estimates (or bounds), and these are assumed to apply uniformly along the pipeline in some design steps  this paper clarifies the causes of geotechnical variability and provides consistent approaches for capturing these realistically  we use field data from real pipelines to demonstrate benefits arising from: (a) spatial ‘averaging’ over the length scale of the relevant design check, (b) input parameter covariance, meaning that unrealistic combinations of inputs are ignored, and (c) quantification of natural soil spatial variability  application: geotechnical variability is often handled in an unrealistic and ultra-onerous manner in subsea pipeline design  this paper presents data and analyses that show the benefit of more realistic modelling of geotechnical variability, using input parameter covariance and appropriate smoothing of pipe-soil interaction parameters  these methods have immediate practical application leading to improved subsea pipeline design  results, observations, and conclusions: field data of soil conditions and pipeline embedment from projects in shallow and deep water are presented and interpreted to illustrate the length scales over which soil properties, pipe embedment and axial and lateral pipe-soil resistance typically vary  these observations show the over-conservatism of typical design practice, in which extreme values of embedment and soil resistance are assumed to apply over the entire pipeline length  instead, the data are used to quantify the beneficial ‘smearing’ effects that result from variability in soil properties and lay conditions  we show that these improvement in the geotechnical inputs lead to a less onerous structural response  significance of subject matter: this subject matter provides a basis to remove unnecessary conservatism in the handling of geotechnical variability in subsea pipeline design  put simply, variability has both a magnitude and a length scale  current design practice often assumes the most onerous length scale - infinite - and our paper provides methodologies to improve on this | 
25287-ms 	 sediment mobility effects on seabed resistance for unburied pipelines |abstract   in order to design unburied pipelines, pipeline engineers require information about lateral and axial seabed resistances (normally known as ‘friction factors’) prior to and during operation  geotechnical engineers must provide this information based on knowledge of pipeline properties, seabed conditions and metocean conditions  accurate prediction of the seabed resistances requires accurate prediction of pipeline embedments  this paper discusses how pipeline embedments and geometries can change from the as-laid state as the result of sediment mobility around pipelines and demonstrates how these embedment changes will change the pipe-soil friction factors using a series of numerical analyses  sediment mobility tends to cause a general trend of increasing pipe embedment, which is beneficial for hydrodynamic stability but can be onerous for thermal buckling  recommendations are provided to accommodate these effects in design, without unnecessary levels of over-conservatism |

eurock-2014-110 	 comparison of change of creep properties of chromite ore under varying stress and time factor to find their interdependence |abstract  mining activities have a great impact on the health and wealth of any nation  though technology has reduced the adverse effects to a great extent, it is still experiencing unpredictable behaviour of rocks  the physical and mechanical properties of rocks are important for design of any excavation process  time dependence must be considered essential for the study of deformation and fracturing processes of rock material, especially for those subjected to strong compressive and tensile stresses  in this study creep test is conducted in chromite ore under uniaxial compressive stresses  rock behaviour is investigated as well as strength of rock  creep behaviour of rocks has been evaluated at varying stress and temperature rate  the relationship between compressive stress and time under uniaxial compression has also been developed  finally nonlinear creep model is used to describe the creep behaviours of rocks under uniaxial compressive strength  this non linear creep model well depicts the dependence of creep properties of the ore and its influence by temperature and stress variation   1  introduction  creep refers to the time-dependent deformation of soil or rock resulting from internal rearrangement of particles in response to the application of a sustained stress difference (<u+03c3>1 -<u+03c3> 3) generally smaller than the stress difference of the soil at failure=(<u+03c3> 1 -<u+03c3> 3), where <u+03c3> 1, <u+03c3> 3 are the major and minor compressive principal stresses, respectively  deformation during undrained creep results from shape distortion as the soil mobilizes a constant shearing resistance in response to the shear stresses applied upon loading or unloading  creep models have been applied toward the solution of a variety of engineering problems, such as the closure of and loads on tunnels, chambers, and pillars in creep-sensitive materials, such as salt, shale, and fault zones   undrained creep behaviour is closely related to the drained creep phenomenon associated with secondary consolidation and swelling in as much as the mechanisms that cause volume change  studies (especially on potash mine pillars) have indicated that deformation of pillars do not occur instantaneously but increase with time  pillars, which appear stable after mining may deteriorate with time and subsequently fail due to the development of limiting vertical deformation  pillar failure takes place at a range of vertical stresses; failure at high stresses taking place earlier than at low stresses | 
eurock-2014-111 	 the interaction between the scale effect and the shape effect in the mine pillar design |abstract  in the main studies and theories that normally support the design of pillars in underground mines, two effects to be considered have been proposed in the more technically developed methods: the scale effect and the shape effect  both of great importance and both, although apparently simple, are difficult to be interpreted as a whole and due to the complexity of their determinations, being their applications often neglected  in this paper, which is the product of a post-doctoral program in progress, one discusses the validity of their simultaneous application  such doubt is due to the manner of their determination, because it can include or not the scale effect when determining the shape effect, depending on the employed method  thus it is presented a discussion of the possible methodologies for their application and the involved principles and parameters  finally one can conclude that, depending on the method considered in equating these effects, its application may make use of both simultaneously or just one of them, on the risk of oversizing the structure considered   1  introduction  the shape effect as proposed by obert and duvall (1967) and bieniawski (1969, 1984a, 1984b) has the following form:  cp = co [a + bll/h} (mpa) (1)  when the test is on intact rock, c0 is its strength    in the case of rock mass strength, the value of c0 should be replaced by the value cm, which corresponds to the rock mass compressive strength, obtained for the rock mass representative elemental volume    it was discussed by the authors in a paper presented last year (ayres da silva, l a ;ayres da silva, a l m ; sansone, 2013), in which they propose that the dimension l of the expression above corresponds to more critical dimension, in structural terms, of the pillar section, instead of adopting simply the dimension of its smaller side, as occurs in determining the slenderness of pillars in the construction of concrete structures, in civil construction   the resulting tests used to discuss the shape effect were presented in the paper cited above | 
eurock-2014-121 	 continuum and discontinuum modelling of gravity dams on jointed rock foundations |abstract  there are many types of commercial software packages available that can be used to model a dam structure and its underlying jointed rock foundation  in this paper, results are compared between a continuum model (flac) and a discontinuum model (udec), in order to evaluate which code gives the most realistic prediction  the results of this research are compared with the existing conventional analytical methodology which is based on limit equilibrium theory  it is concluded that both codes give similar results to the conventional theoretical approach as long as the rock foundation blocks are not rotated by the stress regime created by the dam and reservoir  however, this similarity was found to depend on the joint strength  as the joint strength is reduced, udec was found to provide a better representation of the behaviour of a jointed system and arguably a more realistic prediction of the stress distribution under the dam   1  introduction  the construction of a safe and economic dam requires a detailed understanding of the geotechnical environment in the area surrounding the dam location  most historical dam failures are related to deficiencies in the dam foundation due to the presence of jointing in the bed rock    there are various publications relating to dam incidents, such as icold (1974, 1983, 1995) and douglas (2002)  according to these, about thirty percent of incidents occurred due to some deficiency of the rock foundations  for example the austain dam (also known as byless dam) failed because of sliding between sandstone and shale layers (martt et al , 2005) and the malpasset dam failure was a result of open joints upstream of the dam and an inactive fault downstream (jansen, 1988)    continuum software packages have been extensively used to analyse and design dams on rock mass, although the rock mass is discrete and its behaviour depends on the joints and the intact rock  one of these packages is flac (fast lagrangian analysis of continua) (itasca, 2008), which is a 2d explicit finite difference program  recently the discontinuum approach has gained popularity in geomechanics, especially in mining, tunnelling, and slope stability problems  udec (universal distinct element code) (itasca, 2011) is a discontinuum software code available for analysing geotechnical problems (cundall, 1980)  udec is a 2d distinct element, explicit finite difference program that treats a medium as a collection of discontinuous shapes that interact with each other in space  it is argued that the most powerful tool available to study the rock mass under a dam is the distinct element method because it is capable of modelling the stresses between rock blocks and flow through discontinuities (joints and faults) within the rock mass (gimenes and fernandez, 2006; bretas et al , 2013)  it should be noted, however, that flac can also model discontinuities using interfaces, but this takes up considerable computational time so its use is limited to a few joints within the rock mass  also, the flow cannot be modelled through the joint | 
eurock-2014-123 	 comparison of predicted and actual conditions of the rock mass in the tunnel strazina |abstract  the aim of this paper is to examine and compare the results of engineering geological exploration works in the design phase and during the construction of tunnel strazina  tunel strazina is located near the city of omis on zagreb-split-dubrovnik highway in croatia  the interactive design method was applied in the tunnel design  this methodology integrates the empirical, rational and observational approaches in the geotechnical design of the tunnel  it allows for the thorough and comprehensive overview and problem solving during the construction  in addition, it minimizes the errors that may occur due to the limitations of each individual approach  predicted underground excavation support solutions were done based on site investigation activities and other bases using the empirical and rational approaches  geomechanical and q classification were performed as a part of the empirical approach  engineering-geological tunnel mapping was done during the excavation activities as a part of the geotechnical monitoring  verification of the tunnel support system during the construction phase was done using the actual data obtained from the engineering-geological mapping and the monitoring  thus, the actual rock mass quality along the tunnel was determined and the tunnel underground excavation support measures were optimized  due to the complex conditions present in the rock mass, the discrepancy between estimated and actual rock mass conditions can hardly be avoided, and likewise, a certain amount of discrepancy between the predicted and actual support systems is also to be expected  the interaction of site investigation, design and construction, in addition to introducing the risk analysis, is essential for a more rational, safer and more economical construction  development of methods and procedures for the preparation and control for each of the phases is important for a successful operation of each participant performing a completion of a particular phase, as well as for the project investor | 
eurock-2014-124 	 advances, current limitations and future requirements for a numerical shear box for rock joints using pfc2d |abstract|rock mechanical problems are often governed by the shear strength of joints, but assessing it theoretically is difficult because of the many underlying factors  consequently, expensive and time-consuming shear tests must be performed either in laboratory or in situ  artificial shear tests based on numerical models would therefore be a valuable complement  in this paper, results from an initial study on real shear tests are compared with numerically simulated shear tests performed with the computer software pfc2d  the results from the analyses are good from a qualitative view, but also revealed the need for further research  in this paper, the results from the performed analyses are presented and the current limitations and requirements of further development are discussed   1  introduction  rock mechanical problems such as sliding stability of rock slopes, the stability of caverns located in rock, or foundations on rock are in many cases governed by the joints that run through the rock mass  therefore, it is necessary to gain knowledge about the shear strength of these joints  the shear strength of rock joints is influenced by several factors such as the surface roughness, the compressive strength of the joint surface, the normal stress, the degree of weathering, the matedness, the infilling material, and the scale  this makes it difficult to theoretically determine the shear strength of the joints  therefore, shear tests are often performed, both in laboratory and in situ  these tests are often expensive and also time consuming  thus, it would be valuable if artificial shear tests could be performed using numerical models    the shearing of rock joints involves both sliding on asperities as well as crushing, shearing and tensile failure  to successfully model this complex behavior, the numerical model must be able to reproduce these failure modes  according to cundall (2000), using a micro-mechanical model to numerically represent rough rock joints could lead to simulated behavior that is similar to that observed in real joints  similar observations were also made by asadi & rasouli (2010, 2011), who presented an application of the contact bond model for rock joints with symmetric triangular profiles and with irregular rough profiles  they showed pfc2d (particle flow code) is able to numerically reproduce the progressive shear behavior of rough fractures  park & song (2009) performed a study in pfc3d using the contact bond model on the relationship between the macro-response of a joint and the micro-parameters  they analyzed the influence on the macro-response by changing the following micro-parameters; the particle size, the joint friction coefficient, the joint roughness and the joint contact bond strength  according to their observations, both the shear behavior and the failure process were successively modelled and corresponded well to those observed in shear tests | 
eurock-2014-125 	 on the interpretation of numerical results in the study of rapid landslide run-out phase |abstract  in the present paper, the continuum-mechanics based code rash3d is used to evidence the influence that three factors can have on results of a numerical analysis  these are 1) the digital elevation model (dem) resolution; 2) the morphology and substrate influence on the rheology selection; and 3) the role of the entrainment process  the baio dora debris flow is back-analysed to this aim  obtained results have evidenced that a bad quality dem can make fail all the attempts of selecting the more appropriate rheology and calibrating its parameters  on the other side, the selection of a wrong rheology can give a unrealistic runout path, that is the moving mass can go as far taking a completely incorrect flowing directions  finally, it is observed that the entrainment of channel path material can change significantly the mobility of a flow, through rapid changes of both the flow volume and rheology   introduction  rapid landslide run-out analysis, that is the prediction of landslide motion and impact on affected areas, is an essential component of landslide risk assessment  numerical simulation can provide a useful tool for investigating the propagation phase of phenomena involving granular material, like debris flows, debrisand rock-avalanches  in the attempt of modelling landslide dynamics, methods based on discontinuum mechanics (e g  will and konietzky, 1998; richefeu et al , 2012) and continuum mechanics (e g , savage and hutter, 1989; pastor et al , 2009) have nowadays emerged as promising approaches    discontinuum methods model the moving mass as an assembly of particles moving down a surface  each particle is followed as it moves and interacts with the stationary bedrock and with its neighbouring particles (poisel et al , 2008)    continuum methods resort to an “equivalent fluid” (hungr 1995), that is a hypothetical material, whose properties do not correspond to those of any of the slide components but are intended to be able to simulate the bulk behaviour of the moving mass    the use of these two approaches have advanced incrementally over the past three decades to the point where, when used in combination with careful engineering and geological judgement, first-order run-out prediction appears to be possible  |

eurock-2014-135 	 finite element simulation of crack initiation and propagation in rocks |abstract  rock under natural conditions experiences different stress environment and it fails when it crosses its threshold value  understanding their failure will not lead to determine the strength and deformational characteristics but also will be useful for safe and economic design of structures which are built in rock  to know their mechanism of failure many failure theories have been developed and some of them most commonly used were mohr-coulomb and griffith theories which are found to be applicable for rock  based on these theories many researchers have done experiments to verify those failure mechanisms when it is been subjected to different stress condition and later extended with some other conditions which influence their behavior in failure  but even though some researchers have found these theories and experiments does not fully capture the complete mechanism of failure and they have their advantages and limitations especially when rock having discontinuities like cracks, joints, flaws, plane of weakness etc present in it  and by considering their limitations recent decades researchers have adopted numerical tool like finite element, finite difference methods to overcome these limitations  the present study focuses on the numerical verification of recently developed failure criterion and implementing it finite element software abaqus to understand their failure mechanism when subjected to uniaxial loading conditions how their existing crack will gets initiated and propagated further ends with failure   1  introduction  the nature of the rock is said to be inhomogeneous, anisotropic and inelastic because of the presence of discontinuities such as plane of weakness, cracks, flaws, joints etc  rock under natural conditions experiences different stress environment  based on the type of external load configuration and discontinuities present in it, the rock will have different failure modes  when the rock is subjected to higher stresses it fails at a certain point when it crosses the threshold value  understanding the complete mode of failure will provide useful information for safe and economic design of structures and foundations involving rock  in order to understand the complete failure mechanism of rocks, many researchers have developed theoretical criteria based on experimental observations in accordance with the field  most of experimental studies have considered rocks as isotropic and intact (unjointed) which is rarely found in nature  some of the researchers have considered rock as a transversely isotropic and anisotropic material by implementing the numerical tools like finite element method (fem), finite difference method (fdm), etc  they have verified those failure modes obtained from numerical analysis with the failure modes found from experiments  the present paper is an attempt to understand the different failure modes of brittle natured rock when subjected to compressive stress | 
eurock-2014-138 	 efficient numerical integration of perzyna viscoplasticity, with application to rock slope stability using zero-thickness interface elements |abstract  in this paper, perzyna-type viscoplastic rate equations are integrated for a time step by considering the step as stress-driven  depending on how the increment is imposed (constant, linear etc ), different strategies arise  the secant compliance is obtained by truncated expansion of the yield function  the viscoplastic model can be applied to materials exhibiting rate-dependent behavior, but it can also be used to recover an inviscid elastoplasticity solution when stationary conditions are reached  within this framework, a viscoplastic relaxation iterative strategy is developed, relating the iterations with the fictitious time steps  some examples of application are presented in the context of the finite element method with zero-thickness interface elements for slope and stability problems with discontinuities   1  introduction  viscoplasticity has been widely used for engineering materials with (physical) time-dependent behaviour over a treshold stress level (cormeau, 1975, zienkiewicz and cormeau, 1974), or in the context of viscoplastic relaxation strategies to obtain the stationary solution of an inviscid problem via a fictitious (non-physical) pseudo-time (underwood, 1983, zhang and yu, 1989)  in either case, the rate-type infinitesimal viscoplastic formulation requires a time integration strategy to a) discretize time in increments b) evaluate a linearized relation between stress and strain increments for each time step and, possibly, some residual force calculation and iterative strategy  typically, the algorithms are based on the initial stress scheme used in fes, in which the strain increments are prescribed to the constitutive equations  a variety of such algorithms has been proposed since the original constant stiffness and constant stress procedures (hughes and taylor, 1978, peirce et al , 1984, peric, 1993, simo, 1991) to more recent and sophisticated contributions (alfano et al , 2001, betegon et al , 2006, lorefice et al , 2008, ponthot, 2002)  in contrast, stress driven schemes are not that common (caballero et al , 2009, zienkiewicz and cormeau, 1974)  their implementation can be numerically advantageous (explicit integration of the constitutive equations and simple coding) but their stability is strongly related to the size of the time step and, as a consequence, if a small time step is required an enormous amount of iterations are required | 
eurock-2014-139 	 a strain-dependent strength and dilation model of rock to study pre-peak behaviour in confined tests |abstract  some of the main features of the behaviour of strain softening rocks are associated precisely to the strain softening phase of the constitutive law, which can be modelled using data extracted from a (confined) compression test  nevertheless, some other important aspects are connected to the pre-peak behaviour  for instance, localization phenomena are associated to the pre-peak hardening phase for many rocks  in this paper, using data from a series of confined compression tests, the derivation of a strain-hardening model for the pre-peak stage of a (otherwise) strain-softening rock is considered and the ability of this model to predict localization phenomena is examined   1  introduction  constitutive law modelling of rock masses is usually performed using (servo-controlled) compression test data like those shown in figure 1 (corresponding to a granite described in section 2)  as it is well known, for a rock exhibiting a strain-softening behaviour such curves contain several components  apart from a first inelastic stretch 00<u+02ca> (associated to the closure of cracks and pores in the sample), the inelastic part of the axial stress-strain curve contains a hardening stretch 0<u+02ba>a, a softening phase ab and, eventually, a residual one bc    experimental and theoretical studies (rice 1976, vermeer & de borst 1984, vardoulakis et al  1978, vardoulakis 1980) show that localization phenomena (such as shear bands) can appear already in the hardening phase (stretch 0<u+02ba>a)  from this point on, deformation homogeneity will be lost and stress-strain curve must be critically analyzed   in this paper, the derivation of a model able to describe the hardening phase using data from a compression tests is considered  the quality of this model will be assessed by comparing its numerical prediction of the stress-strain curves and the localization phenomena with those obtained in compression tests  in particular, the orientation of shear bands given by this model will be compared with those experimentally measured  the remainder of this paper is organized as follows  in section 2 both the analyzed rock and the experimental set-up corresponding to the data set considered in this paper are described  the methodology used in the derivation of the constitutive law from experimental data is presented in section 3  the results obtained for the data previously described are presented and discussed in section 4  finally, some conclusions are included in section 5 | 
eurock-2014-140 	 the reduction of surface settlement by employing umbrella arch systems for different excavation methods |abstract  it has been empirically proven that the correct installation of an umbrella arch (ua) temporary support system reduces the surface settlement in shallow tunnel operations  the ua is a tunnel pre-support system that provides reinforcement through the interaction of support elements of the ua and the ground  it is installed during the excavation process at the face of the tunnel, above and around the crown  this paper summarizes the results of numerical analyses regarding the effect on surface settlement in which ua support was employed utilizing various tunnel excavation methods  the analyses employed the ua and included variances in terms of geometry (horseshoe and circular geometries) as well as variations in terms of staged excavation, i e  partial and full face excavation techniques  additionally investigated was the effect of the overlap of successive ua support regimes  all of these variations were carried out in an effort to further understand the impact of the ua on surface settlement   introduction  whendesigning a tunnel in shallow ground conditions, it can be difficult to create and analyze an economical and optimized support scheme  historically, due to computational limitations, analyses have required two-dimensional simplification  however, such simplification cannot mechanistically capture the effect of the umbrella arch (ua) systems (oke et al  2012a)  an ua is a pre-support method (or auxiliary method, (kimura et al  2005)) that is installed horizontally (3–8° off the tunnel axis) during the first pass of excavation from within the tunnel, above and around the crown of the tunnel face (oke et al  2014)  therefore, three-dimensional (3d) analysis is required to capture the mechanistic response of the longitudinal redistribution of the radial displacement acting on the ua  3d analysis, however, requires extensive calibration of the interaction parameters (oke et al  2013)    in order to gain confidence in a numerical model created to simulate/analyze an ua, the designer can conduct a parametric analysis of the relevant interaction parameters  once a design is chosen (i e  overlap of the ua, spacing between ua elements, and stiffness of ua etc  have been determined) it can be compared to the results to the umbrella arch selection chart (oke et al  2014) subsidence management plot (fig  1) in order to provide the designer with further confidence of the support design or numerical analysis  figure 1 was empirically and numerically driven, from a large body of publications and can provide an expected amount of surface reduction based on the employment of different ua systems  for this paper, the authors have created a numerical model that is based on one of the empirical case studies, a section of the istanbul metro, one of many studies used to create the subsidence management plot (oke et al  2013) | 
eurock-2014-144 	 comparison between continuous and discontinuous approaches to tunnel models: flac vs  udec |abstract  one of the most relevant problems when modeling rock masses derives from the fact that rock masses are natural materials, so their physical and mechanical features have to be assessed with the help of non-straight- forward experimental procedures and cannot be a priori accurately defined as it can be the case for other construction materials  rock masses are discontinuous, heterogeneous, anisotropic, non-elastic, scale-affected, complex materials  in the 80s hoek & brown proposed and later refined a procedure to homogenize rock mass behavior and derive equivalent continua properties of rock masses, but this approach is not suitable in all cases  the choice to model a rock mass as continuous or discontinuous is usually made in the light of the jointing of the rock mass, for instance comparing the average joint spacing or blocksize in the rock mass to the span of the underground excavation  to further study the appropriateness of the approach in this work we have carried out a comparison of continuous and discontinuous models of tunnels in 6 types of rock masses of growing geotechnical quality by means of standard codes flac and udec, following the development by ferrero et al  (2004)  in these models stresses and displacement distribution have been compared to analyses the representativeness of the derived stress-strain behavior around excavations by means of continuous and discontinuous approaches   1  introduction  rock masses can be often considered as a discrete medium due to the pervasive occurrence of joints and other of discontinuities of different nature and origin  discontinuities usually control the mechanical behavior of rock masses, particularly in comparison to most other engineering materials; so they could largely influence the choice of modelling scheme to be adopted for any design approach  discontinuities can be considered in an explicit way by adopting a discontinuous approach or in an implicit way by using an equivalent continuous approach (jing 2003)    among the methods involving a continuous medium scheme, and with specific reference to domain methods, mostly finite element method (fem) and finite difference methods (fdm) are applied  within these methods, the discontinuity presence is considered in an implicit way (equivalent continuum) |

eurock-2014-160 	 analysis of the performance of an evolutionary computation algorithm in the identification of geomechanical parameters in underground works |abstract  this paper addresses the performance analysis of an optimization algorithm from the field of evolutionary computation, namely an evolution strategy, in back analysis to evaluate the geomechanical parameters of the formation surrounding an underground structure  the algorithm is first tested using a synthetic case of a tunnel excavation  in this case, different scenarios are considered through a parametric study  then the algorithm is tested using real data from the excavation of an underground structure built in the north of portugal using a 3d model  the results show that the evolution strategy algorithm is robust in the identification of geomechanical parameters related to underground engineering   1  introduction  in back analysis, field measurements are used together with models to calibrate input parameters (geomechanical, stress state, etc…) matching, under a defined tolerance, predicted with observed measures  normally, an iterative procedure is needed to find the best set of parameters through the minimization of an error function that measures the difference between real and computed quantities  for the minimization task optimization algorithms are used and this is a main issue to obtain the best set of parameters    in geotechnics, two main types of algorithms have been used in back analysis: algorithms from the field of classical optimization theory such as the simplex, the newton-raphson or gradient methods; and evolutionary optimization algorithms like genetic algorithms (ga), evolution strategies (es), simulated annealing, etc  (moreira et al , 2013)    classical algorithms present a satisfactory performance in smooth-shaped error functions, with a clearly defined and unique minimum (miranda, 2007)  however, the error function topology is normally complex and the uniqueness of the solution cannot be guaranteed since many local minima may occur  hence, this kind of algorithms are most of the times limited to simpler models and a reduced number of parameters to identify (moreira et al , 2013) | 
eurock-2014-164 	 analytic stress solutions for a circular pressure tunnel at great depth including support delay and pure slip boundary condition |abstract  based on the plane elastic complex function method, theoretical analysis on the stress field around a circular tunnel with ring lining subjected to in situ stresses and inner hydrostatic pressure is carried out  the results of two extreme boundary conditions cases, pure slip and pure bond, are compared with each other  the displacement release coefficient is considered  the calculation results show that the magnitude of the deformation completed before lining installation has great effects on the stress distribution in the lining  if the lining is installed at a proper moment, the degree of stress concentration in the lining can be minimized  when the young’s modulus of the lining is much lower than that of the rock, stress solutions for two extreme boundary condition cases are roughly the same  the smaller the lateral pressure coefficient <u+03bb>, the larger the differences between the corresponding stress solutions for two extreme boundary condition cases   1  introduction  underground tunnels are widely used in hydropower, traffic, mining and military engineering to ensure the tunnel safety, lining is applied in the tunnel  the closed-form solutions for unsupported tunnel at great depth have been proposed for single circular tunnel (kirsch 1898, hefny 1999) and tunnels with complex geometry, such as elliptic tunnel, rectangular tunnel, semi-circular tunnel, inverted u-shaped tunnel and notched circular openings (lu & zhang 2007)  the complex function method developed by muskhelishvili (1963) is especially suitable for solving underground tunnel problems  the complex function method can be applied to find the stress solutions not only for single tunnel in arbitrary shape, but also for multiple tunnels with arbitrary shape (lu & zhang 1997, zhang et al  2001)    as for elastic solutions for deep supported tunnels, the plane strain problem associated with a single circular tunnel with ring lining in an infinite domain has been studied in depth (bulychev 1982, lu et al  2011)  theoretically, the solutions based on plane strain can only be applicable to the situation that lining is applied immediately after excavation and no deformation occurs in the surrounding rock mass before that  in fact, after the tunnel is excavated by a certain length and before the lining is applied, some deformation has occurred in the surrounding rock mass  after lining installation, as the working face is advanced, the surrounding rock mass experiences further deformation and leads to forces on the lining  although the support delay process was considered by bulychev (1982) and wang & li (2009), some limitations still exist (lu et al  2011) | 
eurock-2014-171 	 the load transfer mechanics of fully grouted cable bolts: a theoretical analysis |abstract  fully grouted cable bolts are widely used in underground excavations as a means of reinforcement to the surrounding rock mass and are regarded as one of the primary supporting tendons especially in deep and highly stressed rock conditions  despite improvements in design over the past 40 years of cable bolting systems, slippage along the cable/grout interface is still a significant issue as it has an adverse impact on the load transfer between rock mass and cable bolts  in order to better understand this issue, a review was undertaken of previous theoretical analysis models of the load transfer mechanics  the results of this study are outlined in this paper highlighting the deficiencies as well as the range of application for each model  based on those constitutive models, the influence of relevant factors on the bearing capacity and stiffness of cables such as grout quality and borehole diameter are described  furthermore, since theories in rock joints are always adopted by researchers to study the behaviour of cable/grout interface, the similarities and differences between them are discussed  according to these analytical models, reasons for different performances of standard and modified cable bolts together with two different bond failure modes are concluded  finally, the authors indicate the gap in knowledge that needs to be focused in the future   introduction  fully grouted cable bolts have been used in the mining and underground construction industries for more than forty years  with long tendon length compared to rock bolts they are effective in anchoring deep into rock mass and reinforcing large rock blocks by increasing the rock internal strength and preventing bed separation from occurring  although there has been a dramatic increase in the use of cable bolts in underground mines, some incidents near the cable bolting area still happen; for instance, the falling of large rock blocks, which is led by the failure of cable bolt supports, especially the relative movement along the cable/grout interface (hutchinson & diederichs, 1996)  this is related to the generic area of a load transfer issue and demanding modifications on the design of cables    the engineering design of cable reinforcing is primarily dependent on load-displacement curves of strands, which are obtained from pull-out experiments on grouted cables  since cables were introduced into mining, numerous laboratory and field tests have been conducted  cox & fuller (1977) conducted “splitpipe pull” tests on cables, suggesting that light rust on the strand could improve the bearing capacity of cables  stillborg (1984) performed long embedment length pull tests, discovering that an increased embedded length resulted in a larger pull force  beyond that, maloney et al  (1992) undertook field tests and concluded that stress change evoked by mining resulted in bad performance of traditional strands  according to satola & aromaa (2003), who carried out double embedment length pull tests, the corrosion coating on the strand increased the bearing capacity  this was followed by thomas (2012), who accomplished laboratory short encapsulation pull tests on nutcaged cables with results that the nutcage geometry improved the stiffness of cables up to two orders of magnitudes  these tests are successful in understanding the behavior of grouted cable bolts and helping engineers to modify relevant parameters in practice to improve the load transfer efficiency of strands | 
eurock-2014-174 	 a review of ground support systems performance subjected to dynamic loading |abstract  rockbursts are associated with a sudden release of strain energy within a rock mass that can usually result in damage to an underground excavation  often these are violent events that occur unexpectedly, causing disruption to mining operations and can have fatal consequences  the probability of a rockbursts incident increases with mining depth and increasing in situ stress conditions  as mining operations venture to greater depths, engineers will be faced with the challenge of designing effective ground support systems that are able to withstand these dynamic loading conditions  this paper reviews studies related to ground support schemes with a particular emphasis on dynamic loading testing techniques, including rockbolts, mesh, shotcrete and thin spray-on liners  the majority of research was found to have focused on single support element under axial loading conditions  in reality there is usually an element of shear failure with sliding along discontinuities in a rock mass  moreover traditional design of ground support is often based on the axial capacity of elements such as rock bolts that neglect their shear capacity  this paper concludes that there is a gap in the knowledge on understanding the dynamic shear capacity of support systems, and the contribution of shear resistance of rock support systems in energy absorption   1  introduction  rockburst is defined as  ‘damage to an excavation that occurs in a sudden or violent manner and is associated with a seismic event’ (kaiser, 1995)  deep hard rock mining is confronted with a higher risk of rockburst and mining-induced seismicity due to high stress and developed rock structure  for some time, mining in south africa has occurred at depths in excess of 3 km below surface, while some canadian mines are operating at depths exceeding 2 km  in other countries such as india, sweden and china, mining commonly occurs at depths in excess of 1 km, while in australia the deepest hard rock mine is at 1 8 km at mount isa (li et al  2001)  as a result of mining at these ever increasing depths, rockbursts will become an increasing challenge that needs to be overcome in order to ensure the stability and safety of mining operations    dynamic loading is often associated with mining induced seismicity, and usually consists of repeated discrete events of different magnitude and location (potvin et al  2010)  this creates challenges in quantifying the demand placed on complete support systems and single support elements  the uncertainty and randomness of seismic events increases the difficulty of designing effective ground support systems |

eurock-2014-178 	 face stability in tunnels excavated by the drill and blast method |abstract  we study the face stability of rock tunnels excavated by the drill and blast method, using an advanced failure mechanism in the framework of limit analysis  first, we study the influence of the geometry of the section and of the excavation process on the stability of the face, comparing a horseshoe section carried out in several stages with its equivalent circular section  second, we investigate the influence on the collapse pressure of the damage induced in the rock mass during blasting, characterized by the blast damage factor d  results show that, as expected, multi-stage excavation sequences increase the stability of the face and that decreasing the height of the top-heading reduces the collapse pressure  moreover, there is evident influence of the disturbance factor “d” on the collapse pressure, so that poor quality blasting can facilitate the collapse of the face   1  introduction  tunnel face stability is a big concern in tunneling excavated in soils or soft rock masses, because it is the source of many collapses  for tunneling in soils, it is common to employ epb or slurry tbm, whereas excavation methods without face support and with great cross sections are often used in rock masses, increasing the risk of face collapse    one method to study tunnel face stability is to assess the collapse pressure (or critical collapse)  it is the minimum pressure that needs to be applied at the tunnel face to avoid its instability  many authors have studied this problem through laboratory test (e g  chen et al  (2013)), theoretical analysis (e g  leca & dormieux (1990)) or numerical models (e g  vermeer et al  (2002))    limit analysis is another methodology to obtain the collapse pressure  research on limit analysis has focused on improving failure geometries so that they become more similar to reality (e g  oberle (1996) or soubra (2000))  recent works (e g  mollon et al  (2011a)) proposed collapse mechanisms generated point-to-point that affect the whole excavation front, providing good results when they are compared to numerical solutions and laboratory tests    senent et al  (2013) generalized such failure mechanism, in the framework of limit analysis, for tunnels excavated in ‘low quality’ rock masses that follow the non-linear hoek–brown failure criterion  but this previous work was focused on tbm excavated tunnels, characterized by a circular section bored by a full face machine  for that reason, they did not consider the disturbance in the rock mass around the tunnel due to the excavation process | 
eurock-2014-180 	 the development of a distributed optical sensing technique to monitor forepole temporary support elements employed within an umbrella arch system |abstract  temporary support for a tunnel excavated in weak rock can involve (but is not limited to) the utilization of a combination of steel-sets, rock bolts, shotcrete, spiles/forepoles and/or face stabilization technologies  the purpose of such tunnel support is to maintain confinement for the rock mass in order to help the rock mass support itself  this research is concerned with the forepoles as components of this system  within this context, this paper describes a novel application of a distributed optical sensing technique specifically for monitoring the continuous strain profile along forepole elements  the procedure employs a distributed optical sensing technique using optical fiber that is based on rayleigh backscattering which has been previously employed with grouted rock bolts  the paper outlines the technology, describes how it has been adapted for monitoring of forepoles, and assesses its potential and limitations based on initial laboratory experiments   1  introduction  classical tunnel designs have been based on the rock mass ratio (rmr) (designing with respect to deformations) and terzaghi based designs (designing primarily to support all loads including overburden pressure by the final lining)  a newer tunneling method, such as the new austrian tunneling method (natm), incorporates an observational approach that is deformation based  this method integrates the surrounding rock into the overall support structure (i e  the supporting formations will themselves be a part of the supporting structure as the rock is able to support itself to a certain degree) (romeo, 2002)  using the natm, a controlled deformation of the rock mass is permitted (a limited strain of approximately 1%) and this gives the stresses an opportunity to be partly released and less stiff and thus a less-expensive support system can be used (kondogianni and stiros, 2002)    optimizations of tunnel support design (to include individual support elements, forepoles, shotcrete, rockbolts etc ) can therefore be achieved within the framework of this observational (well instrumented) approach whereby the behaviour of rock/soil, support elements, geomaterial-support interactions, and behaviours can be explicitly determined  through back-calculations, material properties can be clearly derived  however, there exists a gap in knowledge in terms of the distinct performance of each support element in isolation and its performance as part of a multi component support system  this investigation, then, suggests a strategy in order to determine the continuous behaviour and performance of a forepole temporary support elements as part of the overall temporary support scheme |

eurock-2014-193 	 a new approach for modeling heat transfer between a freeze pipe and the surrounding ground |abstract  the artificial ground freezing method (agf) has been widely used for both civil engineering and mining applications for ground stabilization and water control  in agf models, the thermal boundary conditions at the freeze pipe wall strongly depend on the cooling conditions and on the heat transfer between the pipe and the ground  these boundary conditions are generally determined based on in situ measurements, which are not readily available  this paper presents a new approach where coupling between the thermal problem in the pipe and in the surrounding ground is numerically modeled  parametric studies highlight the influence of the operating conditions  finally, the interest of the proposed new approach is twofold: (i) it implicitly determines the boundary conditions of the agf model and (ii) it enables an optimization of the cooling conditions for freeze pipes   1  introduction  the artificial ground freezing technique (agf) appeared 150 years ago in south wales for shaft sinking in coal mines  nowadays, it is particularly widespread in civil engineering (tunneling, landslide stabilization, underpinning), mining engineering (shaft sinking) and environmental engineering (containment of hazardous waste) (andersland 2004)  the advantages of this technique are to reduce the ground permeability, which mitigates water seepage and in flow into underground workings, and to improve the mechanical properties (strength and stiffness) of the ground and thus to increase the stability of future excavations    the principle of agf is to circulate a fluid coolant through a pipe network in the ground to be frozen  as it flows in the pipes, the refrigerant extracts heat from the surrounding ground and pore liquid water gradually turns into ice  the quantity of extracted heat depends on the cooling conditions  therefore, an estimation of the temperature distribution in the ground would require an understanding of the thermal processes which occur inside the freeze pipes  in common agf numerical models, the thermal boundary conditions at the freeze pipe wall are based on external data defined from in situ measurements  however these data, whether they be expressed in temperature or flux, are not readily available |

eurock-2014-210 	 analysis of a deep-seated slope movement in a marly-arenaceous formation |abstract  the slow moving slope considered in this study is formed by a long ridge of marly-arenaceous rock mass  the overall displacement is parallel to the ridge direction, which is almost perpendicular to the main river valley  the paper summarizes the results of 20 years monitoring (deformation, rainfall, pore pressure)  there is enough evidence to support the interpretation of this slow movement as a continuing shear deformation along clay-rich interbeds  most of the sliding surface can be considered in residual strength conditions  in the second part of the paper, some hydro-mechanical analyses of the slope are presented  the slope is close to limit equilibrium conditions  the quasi-stationary displacement velocity can be simulated by the maxwell creep model  recurrent acceleration phases can be related to rainfall and temporary increases in water level at the toe of the slope   1  introduction  the site considered in this study is located in the chiascio river valley, in the central section of apennines range (italy), characterized by large outcrops of the “marnoso-arenacea” formation    the estimated volume of the sliding mass is about 18mm<u+00b3>  the kinematic characters of the movement are essentially those of a planar-sliding, with ongoing creep deformations presumably localized along tectonized clay interbeds    weak interbeds and laminated layers can hardly be detected inside structurally complex formations (d’elia et al  1998), such as flysch deposits and layered limestone formations (alonso et al  1993, hatzor & levin 1997, graziani et al  2009)  their occurrence usually represents a key factor for stability analysis in dam and slope engineering and often has required special investigations (oberti et al  1986, graziani et al  2012)    this paper illustrates the field evidence and measurements collected during a 20 years period of geotechnical monitoring of the slope    in the second part of the paper, some hydromechanical analyses of the slope are presented  the actual conditions of the slope are compared to plausible limit equilibrium conditions and the influence of pore pressure regime (rainfall and reservoir level) is analyzed  to this aim, elasto-plastic and maxwell-type creep models in plane strain conditions will be applied |

eurock-2014-213 	 prediction of rock strength with matrix acidizing stimulation and induced wormhole by computational simulation methods |abstract  in low-permeability and low-porosity reservoirs, oil is trapped in the rock and cannot be extracted by conventional recovery  in this case, well stimulation techniques such as fracturing can be used to increase the permeability of the rock  one way of well stimulation is matrix acidizing  in matrix acidizing, acid is injected into the rock and reacts with it, etching the wall of its pores, and creating channels called “wormholes”  wormholes increase surface area and allow more fluid to drain to the well-bore, enhancing oil recovery  while acidizing increases oil production and recovery, it also increases the risk of rock collapse, especially wormhole walls   it is therefore important to predict the contrasting effects of increased production rate and decreased rock strength due to wormhole formation  for this reason an integrated model adapted for computer simulation is developed to investigate the multi-physical effect of acid injection in chalk reservoirs  the geometry for the numerical simulation is based on a previously published experimental work  numerical simulation is based on control volume methods for fluid flow in porous media using a darcy model, and stress analysis is based on the finite element method using a constitutive model of chalk  for computational simulation of this multiphysics simulation an in-house cfd-fem (computational fluid dynamics-finite element methods) software, “brilliant”, is used  in this work, the mechanical stability of wormholes and chalk sample under uniaxial compaction load are investigated and are compared with an intact chalk  in presence of wormholes, wormhole walls are subject to shear failure, while the same places on the intact rock will fail by pore collapse at higher stresses   1  introduction  oil consumption in the world is going to increase dramatically while oil supply is rapidly declining; as the “easy oil” reservoirs deplete, oil prices are bound to increase    in low-permeability and low-porosity reservoirs, oil is trapped in the rock and cannot be extracted by primary recovery  in this case, well stimulation techniques such as fracturing are used to increase the permeability of the rock  two ways of well stimulation are fracturing and matrix acidizing    in fracturing stimulation, fluid is injected at higher pressure than the reservoir pressure  the high pressure in the reservoir generates new channels  in matrix acidizing, acid is injected into and reacts with the rock, dissolving portions of the rock and opening up existing spaces, resulting in an easier pattern for oil to flow  this allows more fluid to drain to the well-bore and enhances oil recovery  | 
eurock-2014-214 	 application of transient methods to the assessment of permeability of well cements |abstract  interactions between well cements and co<u+2082>-bearing water may trigger changes on the permeability of the well-wall, which would affect the safe of the storage in geo-sequestration contexts  in this work we present experimental results associated with the assessment of the permeability of cylindrical mortar plugs made with ordinary portland cement (opc) and siliceous aggregate fabricated with different water/cement (w/c) ratios  tests were performed in a triaxial (hassler-type) cell under hydrostatic conditions and constant temperature and effective pressure  because the intrinsic permeability of mortar is low (<5µd or <5 · 10-14 cm<u+00b2>), steady state methods imply long experimental determinations  transient-state techniques provide with a workable alternative allowing faster determinations  here we evaluate three transient state methods: the pulse decay (pdm), the pore-pressure transmission (pptm) and the pore-pressure oscillation (ppom) methods which are compared with the conventional steady state method (ssm)  this allows the assessment of their comparative performance both in terms of reproducibility and speed   1  introduction  the safe long-term storage of co<u+2082> in geological formations requires the assessment of different engineering elements including, among them, well cements  this is a key element that prevents the leakage of the injected co<u+2082> and the efficient sealing of injection or abandoned wells  co<u+2082>, in the presence of water and under repository conditions is an acidic reactive fluid that may consume the alkaline reserve of cementitious materials promoting damages potentially leading to problems of leakage, casing corrosion and wellbore stability  different researchers have suggested that the interaction between well cement and co2- bearing water may result in either an increase or a decrease in its permeability (kutchko et al , 2009; newell and carey, 2013)  therefore, the assessment of permeability of well cements constitutes a relevant research topic especially when considering the induced reactivity associated to certain fluids    because the intrinsic permeability of mortar is low, steady state methods for permeability determination is not of practical application due to the long duration of the determinations  for these low permeability materials, a number of alternative transient-state techniques there exists: pulse decay (pdm); pore-pressure transmission (pptm); and pore pressure oscillation (ppom) methods have been explored and compared with the steady state method (ssm) in order to assess their comparative performance both in terms of reproducibility and speed | 
eurock-2014-216 	 geomechanical simulation of the injection of co<u+2082> into saline aquifers with respect to risk assessment |abstract  the injection of co<u+2082> into a reservoir can influence the initial stress state significantly due to changes in pore pressures  as a result, the integrity of the cap rock can be affected and existing faults may be reactivated  to predict and prevent such negative impacts a risk assessment is needed  this paper deals exclusively with the geomechanical module of the co<u+2082> rina project  the aim of this project is to develop a general integrative risk assessment approach for the storage of co<u+2082> in geological formation  first numerical geomechanical simulations of 25 scenarios show the influence of the flowing liquid’s density, its dynamic viscosity and the intrinsic permeabilities of the reservoir and the fault on the hydraulic aperture of a fault  the maximum hydraulic aperture has been determined between 1 4 and 3 4 mm   1  introduction  carbon capture and storage (ccs) is a promising option to reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere  with this technology co<u+2082> is separated from the exhaust of power plants and deposited in deep geological formations  apart from the storage in exploited gas and petroleum reservoirs, one option is the usage of saline aquifers  the reservoir formation has to consist of rock material with a high permeability and a high porosity to ensure a high storage capacity  to seal the reservoir and to prevent a discharge of co<u+2082>, the reservoir has to be overlaid with a cap rock of low permeability    the injection of co<u+2082> into a reservoir influences the initial stress state significantly  due to this change, the integrity of the cap rock can be influenced negatively and existing faults may be reactivated  beside these geomechanical processes a multitude of processesmay occur, e g  advective or diffusive migration of co<u+2082> through porous media    to predict and prevent such negative effects, a risk assessment is needed, which up to now is mainly based on expert knowledge  features, events and processes (feps),which may have an impact on the safety of ccs, are investigated only for single scenarios in detail  for example oldenburg (2007) suggests a spreadsheet analysis in which relevant parameters are multiplied by factors of significance and reliability  oladyshkin et al  (2009) conducted a monte-carlo simulation for single scenarios based on a reduction of his model  due to subjectivity and/or time-consuming and complex fully coupled analyses of single scenarios, a generally accepted risk assessment analysis does currently not exist | 
eurock-2014-218 	 coupled hydro-mechanical simulations demonstrate system integrity at the ketzin pilot site for co<u+2082> storage, germany |abstract  an integrated hydro-mechanical assessment of the ketzin pilot site for co<u+2082> storage, germany, has been carried out in the present study  for that purpose, history matched reservoir simulation models were coupled with regional-scale hydro-mechanical simulation models  simulation results reveal maximum vertical displacements of about 6mm at the reservoir top and 4mm at the ground surface  neither shear nor tensile failure is observed in the hydro-mechanical model at the end of the simulation time  consequently, reservoir, caprock and fault integrity are maintained during the entire co<u+2082> storage operation   1  introduction  the ketzin pilot site is located about 40 km west of berlin in the state of brandenburg (germany) settled in a double-anticline system (ketzin-roskow) with a graben zone dominating the double-anticline top  co<u+2082> injection at the ketzin pilot site into the stuttgart formation (keuper) is being carried out since june 2008, whereas about 67,270 t co<u+2082> were injected until site abandonment started in september 2013 (martens et al  2013, 2012, wurdemann et al  2010)  the maximum pore pressure increase during five years of storage operation was about 1 6mpa, while the initial pore pressure at reservoir depth (about 640 m) in the injection well was 6 2mpa (moller et al  2012)    a verification of mechanical caprock and fault integrity was undertaken in the scope of a risk assessment prior to the injection start  at that time, data on site behaviour resulting from co<u+2082> injection was not available  new data from site operation, geological modelling (norden & frykman 2013, kempka et al  2013a) and history matched multi-phase flow simulations (kempka &0 kuhn 2013, kempka et al  2010) were integrated into our 3d hydro-mechanical simulations based on a 40 km<u+00d7>40 km 3d structural geological model taking into account all 24 known major faults in that area  the main aim of the present study was to determine, if reservoir rock, caprock or fault integrity may be compromised by the co<u+2082> storage operation in addition to a verification of vertical displacements at the ground surface for a later model validation against satellite-based interferometric synthetic aperture radar (insar) monitoring results | 
eurock-2014-219 	 qa/qc on physical and mechanical rock properties relevant for geomechanical analysis |abstract  appropriate rock characterization is vital to many oil and gas exploration and exploitation processes  robust sub-surface models require input data that represent the rocks involved  this paper describes a method for qualifying and integrating physical and mechanical rock property data to assure they provide reliable inputs to geomechanical models    rock property data necessarily come from different sources  physical samples for laboratory testing are usually limited to a few depths  lab tests are often costly, replicating in-situ conditions can be difficult or impossible, and results frequently show wide scatter reflecting the rock’s inherent depth variability and lateral heterogeneity  electric logs provide near-continuous data, but rarely direct measurements of rock strength properties  all too often data from different sources are inconsistent, leading to uncertainty in models using those data    eight mechanical, microstructural and physical properties are shown together to give a good characterization of rock strength behavior in ambient and in-situ conditions  these properties are readily accessible but are individually subject to the above uncertainties  appropriate data quality assurance and quality control qa/qc review of these properties’ values is an essential step in building a representative description of the rock  this paper presents a process for doing this qa/qc review    pairs of property values are cross-plotted and compared with correlations from the literature or previously established with qualified data from related formations  conformance with those correlations gives confidence in the data, whereas outliers are flagged as questionable  repeating this process with questionable data crossplotted against other parameters for the same depth highlights the property with the greatest uncertainty  the determination of its value is investigated to locate the source of the inconsistency and hopefully to establish a more reliable value  where this is not possible, the user has a rational basis for rejecting that property value  | 
eurock-2014-222 	 numerical modeling of composite bilaminate materials as an analog for strength variation in anisotropic shale formations |abstract  quantifying shale strength anisotropy associated with the presence of relatively weak sedimentary laminations is particularly important for extended reach drilling as interaction between borehole stresses and anisotropic formation strength can ultimately lead to catastrophic wellbore instability  to increase fundamental understanding of this failure mechanism, we investigate the potential for treating shales as composite bilaminate materials and use finite element models with variably inclined layers to simulate direct laboratory testing  resultant strength anisotropy exhibits many of the features observed from laboratory testing of orientated shale samples and suggests that strength reduction due to the activation of weak bedding laminations should be predictable from knowledge of the bulk trans-laminar strength without recourse to costly and time-consuming laboratory testing, which has significant implications for the successful drilling of high-angle/horizontal wells   1  introduction  shales constitute over 75% of drilled formations worldwide and the majority of drilling problems encountered in the subsurface leading to nonproductive time can be directly attributed to some form of shale instability (azar & robello samuel, 2007)  it is well-established in the industry that a common chemical mechanism responsible for instability results when smectite-rich shales swell and weaken on exposure to water-based muds (lal, 1999)  a second mechanical failure mechanism particular to shales that has been largely overlooked by the industry relates to the presence of weak bedding laminations which can impart significant strength anisotropy to shale formations    this effect is particularly pronounced for extended reach drilling (erd) wells in which the borehole trajectory can achieve near-parallelism with bedding such that interaction between the borehole hoop stress and the anisotropic formation can result in oblique loading of these weak bedding laminations leading to premature shear failure (fig  1)  depending on the relative magnitudes of anisotropic rock strength and borehole stress concentration, breakouts may occur at “unexpected” positions around the borehole different from those conventionally found in isotropic rock (willson et al, 2007) leading ultimately to catastrophic failure |

eurock-2014-226 	 hydraulic fracture propagation under steady state fluid flow |abstract  the stress intensity factor at a fracture tip in a porous medium subjected to a fluid injection is studied  this factor evolves during the transient flow phase and tends to a limit value for the steady state  for simple fracture geometries, the finite element simulations show that for constant injection pressures this factor reaches its maximum value in the steady state regime  this result allows simplifying significantly the study and modeling of hydraulic fracture propagation because the determination of the steady flow solution is much easier and faster than the transient flow  in addition, some couplings between hydraulic and mechanical problems disappear under steady state flow and make it possible to establish some closed-form approximate expressions  these can be useful especially in the context of co<u+2082> sequestration projects where the fluid injection is pressure-controlled   1  introduction  hydraulic fracture propagation attracts a lot of attention for its applications to important problems including oil production, shale gas production, geothermal energy and co<u+2082> sequestration  predictive modeling of this process meets many difficulties in experimental as well as numerical approaches and even on some theoretical issues  this article focuses on numerical aspects  indeed, even when the reservoir rock has been well characterized for its permeability and mechanical parameters, numerical modeling of fracture propagation presents real difficulties, mainly because numerous phenomena are implied in this process: fluid diffusion in the fracture and in the matrix, fracture-matrix mass exchanges, plasticity and damage in the fracture tip because of high stress concentrations in this zone and finally the fracture propagation itself  this latter phenomenon changes the continuous material to discontinuous and is not easy to handle in numerical codes  for this reason, hydraulic fracture models have always included necessarily different simplification assumptions  a basic simplification model for the fracture-matrix mass exchange was proposed by carter (1957) considering it as a one-dimensional, pressure-independent diffusion  on the basis of this model, and within the framework of linear elastic fracture mechanics and lubrication theory for fluid diffusion in the fracture adachi & detournay (2008) analyzed the general solution of a plane strain hydraulic fracture in terms of dimensionless parameters for hydraulic or mechanical, conservative or dissipative phenomena  these authors determined different regimes in which one or several of these phenomena could be neglected and so the whole model could be simplified  |

eurock-2014-230 	 effects of reservoir development on the well casing behavior |abstract  the depletion of oil reservoirs causes significant effects on its surroundings  during the lifetime of an oil field, well integrity should be taken into account under the geomechanical perspective  the aim of this work is to show the influence of geomechanical effects over the integrity of an oil well, employing partially coupled fluid-mechanical simulations  the namorado field (campos basin, brazil) was adopted in this study as a black-oil model  since the geomechanical effects were obtained in the reservoir scale, a special workflow had to be followed in order to obtain the stress field at the well scale  the submodeling technique was used to analyze the casing response under the effects observed in the global simulation  the well casing collapse was evaluated in the submodel by the von mises criterion  the simulation results showed the importance of employing a rigorous fluid-mechanical methodology in well integrity analysis    1  introduction  from the geomechanical point of view, the problematic of wells and reservoirs is often distinctly addressed, mainly because the scale difference  although the system behaves in an integrated way, the association of the phenomena involved in the analysis of wells and reservoirs is frequently neglected  the wells are linear constructions whose geomechanical behavior is closely related to the stress state of the rock which is going through, to the fluid employed during drilling, to the drilling direction and to the casing type  by the activities performed through the well, the reservoir undergoes significant changes in its equilibrium configuration, once the production (or injection) of fluid in the porous medium causes significant variations in their pore pressure and therefore in its stress state  nevertheless, the reservoir effects spread through the adjacent rocks, many of which are crossed by wells that propel the geomechanical changes    one of the major difficulties of conducting an overall well-reservoir analysis lies on the difference of scales between the mentioned problems  a multiscale analysis, a priori, requires the construction of more complex models, which may be limited depending on the numerical methods that are used  the difference between scales is a problem addressed in the petroleum engineering literature, especially in terms of scale adaptation of the properties distribution to feed numerical simulation models  however, little has been found in the literature on joint consideration of wells and reservoir under a geomechanical point of view, employing multiscale numerical simulations that take into account the fluid-mechanical phenomena in a coupled way  | 
eurock-2014-231 	 geomechanical study with outcrop samples to improve drilling performance for an exploration well in northwest africa |abstract  a geomechanical survey of selected rock samples from outcrops and shallow stratigraphic wells taken from the vicinity of the prospect area has been conducted in order to obtain data and parameters useful for the selection of optimum drill bits prior to the drilling of a wildcat well in a frontier basin located in nw africa  the available geological and drilling information suggests that the basin rocks are hard to very hard and abrasive, what will significantly increase the costs of the planned wildcat  thus, this work is aimed at reducing drilling costs and to improve rops at the time of drilling by assessing realistic working properties from the drill bit selection point of view  the geomechanical survey included ucs, ccs, schmidt hammer rebound and point load indexes, vp< sub> & vs wave propagation data (including high pressure hydrostatic determinations) and slake durability tests  a summary of the main results is presented here    1  introduction|it is a well-known fact that drilling operations carry associated significant costs for the oil and gas industry so that if we are able to enhance drilling performance by increasing the rate of penetration (rop) of drill bits, the expected outcome will be a direct impact over the economics of exploration/exploitation projects    choosing the adequate drill bits combined with the appropriate drilling parameters can substantially reduce drilling costs  however, the development of criteria for the optimum drill bit selection has to take into account a number of rock-dependent properties, most of them varying along the corresponding lithological section  the assessment of the relevant rock mechanics properties is based on different approaches, including testing in the laboratory rocks analog to the ones expected during drilling operations combined with wireline log derived parameters    taking into account the previous approach, in this work we present a summary of the results obtained in an exploration project located in a frontier basin, with very limited geological information  so far, the single drilled well in the basin has faced strong to very strong rock sequences (brown, 1981), with an extremely low rop  however, a future wild cat well will require improved rop so that it was decided to conduct an in-advance assessment of the geomechanical properties of the materials of interest by obtaining representative cores of the target formations located in the vicinity of the prospect area  from these cores, a number of representative plugs were selected to conduct a comprehensive study that includes mineralogy, petrology, geochemistry, rock mechanics as well as some borehole stability simulations  such an approach, that entails a significant challenge in terms of the uncertainties derived from the representativeness of tested samples, may reduce the drilling expenses by providing key information for drill bit selection and better constrained well design  |

eurock-2014-233 	 shale geomechanics: optimal multi-stage hydraulic fracturing design for shale and tight reservoirs |abstract  developing resource shale and/or tight plays can be extensive and demanding, particularly when determining an optimal multi-stage fracture stimulation design  a common approach has been to duplicate the so-called barnett design, such as using a slick water fracturing fluid with a low concentration of proppant  however, it has been proven that the barnett design was inefficient in many other fields, such as the haynesville, bakken, and eagle ford  a recent trend for developing resource shale and tight plays has been to attain an analog field, duplicate the design optimized in the analog field, and further optimize its design by trial and error  however, even this approach requires a considerable learning curve and associated costs to determine the optimal multi-stage fracturing design  shale geomechanics can help minimize this learning curve and provide optimal fracture design recommendations based on geomechanical analysis combined with geological, geophysical, and petrophysical knowledge    1  introduction  after successful development of the barnett shale, other resource shale and tight plays have been commercialized all over north america, and now extending to central/south america, europe, china, australia, and russia  the success of resource shale and tight plays has mainly derived from technological advancements during the past 10 years, including large volume multistage hydraulic fracturing in horizontal completions, passive microsiesmic monitoring, and expanded use of 3d seismic of the fields    these recent technological advancements in resource shale and tight plays present unique engineering challenges with respect to geomechanics, such as long, horizontal well drilling and completion methods that allowcomplex multi-stage hydraulic fracture stimulation design  exceptionally long horizontal drilling can create significant wellbore stability issues, which are stress-induced and time-dependent, from fluid-formation interaction  complex multistage hydraulic fracture designs require extensive geomechanical information for optimization, such as selection of well placement, horizontal well direction, stage isolation method, stage interval selection, perforation locations, and fracturing fluid system/proppant selection    such demanding challenges can be addressed, fully or partially, by integrating all geomechanical information obtained from geological, geophysical, petrophysical, and laboratory data  geophysical and petrophysical analyses of natural fractures and faults can also be used during the final multi-stage hydraulic fracture design | 
eurock-2014-235 	 drilling optimization based on a geomechanical analysis using probabilistic risk assessment, a case study from offshore iran |abstract  in offshore iran, wellbore instability is quite common and the main cause for most of problems during drilling operations  in this study, the existing relevant logs, drilling and other data from offset well were analyzed and integrated to construct a precise mechanical earth model (mem) describing pore pressure, stress magnitudes and orientation, and formation mechanical properties of the south pars gas field  then, the constructed mem was refined and calibrated using the existing caliper, image logs, rock mechanical core test and drilling data and through history matching to constrain and reduce the uncertainties associated with limitations and availability of the existing data  using the validated mem built for offset well, a sensitivity analysis by formation was performed to evaluate optimum drilling parameters and to evaluate the stability of future deviated or horizontal wells in the field  finally, a quantitative risk study was conducted to assess the sensitivity of breakout and fracturing mud weights to various input parameters  results indicate that the stable mud weight window decreases as the borehole deviation increases in the most of formations except reservoir section  it was shown that well azimuth has very little impact on the breakout mud weight, while the breakdown mud weight is significantly higher in wells drilled in the minimum horizontal stress direction  moreover, it would be better to keep the well deviation as low as possible and not more than 45 and 60 degrees in the kazhdumi and fahlyan-surmeh formations, respectively   1  introduction  wellbore stability maintenance is a crucial step during drilling a well for oil and gas production  wellbore instability problems may cause increasing wellbore’s drilling costs, delay in drilling of the wellbore and in severe conditions wellbore abandonment  it is estimated that at least 10% of the average well budget is used on unplanned operations resulting from wellbore instability  these costs may approach one billion dollars per year worldwide (aadnoy 2003)  the simplest constitutive model for describing the behavior of rocks is linear elastic, which is the foundation for all aspects of rock mechanics  this theory is based on the concepts of stress and strain, which are related according to simple hooke’s law two parameters are required for describing the elastic response of a material: young’s modulus and poisson’s ratio  the solution of a given problem considering the elasticity theory consists on the determination of the stress, strain, and displacement components  bradley (1979a) and fjaer et al  (1992) among others presented analytical equations to compute stresses around boreholes  they assumed a state of plane strain  the derivation of the stress solution is in the study presented by jaeger and cook (1979), and the final equations are given by bradley (1979a) and fjaer et al  (1992) | 
eurock-2014-236 	 dependency of deformability, strength and failure characteristics of clay shales on total suction |abstract  a series of clay shale specimens in equilibrium with various applied suction pressures were used to study the influence of total suction on rock mechanical properties such as young’s modulus, poisson’s ratio, onset of dilatancy, unconfined compressive strength and brazilian tensile strength  an almost linear increase in unconfined compressive strength, brazilian tensile strength, stress at the onset of dilatancy and young’s modulus with increasing suction was observed to a total suction of 56 6mpa  for total suction >56 6mpa, a relatively constant strength and stiffness was observed  the increase in strength and stiffness is associated with the net contribution of total suction, which decreases non-linearly with decreasing volumetric water content  the rate of increase in tensile strength and unconfined compressive strength with increasing total suction is different depending on the rock anisotropy  thus, the anisotropy in strength is state-dependent    1  introduction  characterizing the behaviour, and quantifying geomechanical properties of clay shales can be challenging  its often very low permeability combined with its pervasive bedding and geological history, and the sensitivity of strength and stiffness to little changes in saturation complicates the interpretation of even the simplest laboratory strength tests  the strength dependency on saturation is primarily related to an increase in total suction (<u+03c8>) associated with the pore size distribution of the clay shale  controlled laboratory tests were utilized to quantify changes in tensile and compressive strength, elastic properties, and brittle failure characteristics of a brittle clay shale with changing total suction  opalinus clay, a clay shale considered as host rock for the disposal of nuclear waste in switzerland was utilized    2  methods  2 1 controlled drying  water retention characteristics were established from specimens imposed to various relative humidity (rh) in desiccators under stress free conditions  constant predefined relative humidity were achieved and maintained by utilizing supersaturated salt solutions (table 1)  during exposing the specimens to these different environments, the air temperature in the laboratory was held constant at 21±0 5°c, and the rh in the desiccators was monitored  samples were dried to constant weight | 
eurock-2014-237 	 a preliminary evaluation of an enhanced fdem code as a tool to simulate hydraulic fracturing in jointed rock masses |abstract|experimental evidence based on microseismic data clearly show that fluid-pressure-driven fractures interact with preexisting discontinuities, thus highlighting the strong influence of rock mass structures on hydraulic fracture development  however, these mechanisms are not well accounted for by analytical models and conventional continuum-based numerical approaches  the purpose of this paper is to assess the use of an alternative hybrid finite-discrete element (fdem) code, enhanced with hydraulic fracturing capabilities, to model pressure-driven fracturing in jointed rock masses  the proposed approach is first validated by comparing the emergent pressure response and fracture patterns simulated under homogeneous isotropic conditions with available analytical solutions  then, the effect of rock mass discontinuities on the hydraulic fracturing process is investigated for several joint geometries   1  introduction  in rock engineering, the termhydraulic fracturing (hf) refers to the injection of fluid into a sealed-off borehole interval to induce and propagate fractures into the surrounding rock mass  typical applications of this technique include the estimation of the stress state at depth as well as the stimulation of unconventional reservoirs  conventional analyses of hf operations are based upon the solution of the stress distribution around a circular borehole in a homogeneous, isotropic, elastic material subjected to far-field compressive stresses (e g , hubbert and willis (1957))  considering these simple and idealistic assumptions, the accuracy of analyses carried out by this approach may be debatable  in particular, the rock mass is often characterized by the presence of preexisting discontinuities (e g , fractures, faults) or layering (e g , bedding planes) having variable orientations with respect to the principal stress directions  in this case, the fundamental assumptions of the analytical approaches, namely continuity, homogeneity and isotropy, are clearly not satisfied    in this context, the scope of this study was to evaluate a hybrid finite-discrete element (fdem) code enhanced with hf capabilities as a tool to simulate fluid-pressure-driven fracturing in jointed rock masses  fdem is a numerical technique which combines the advantages of the finite element method (fem) in describing the continuum behaviour of the intact material, with the ability of the discrete element method (dem) to capture the interaction between fractured discrete blocks  furthermore, fdem captures the transition from continuum to discontinuum by explicitly considering fracture and fragmentation processes  in this work, homogeneous isotropic models were first considered in order to validate the numerical results with respect to analytical solutions  then, the numerical simulations investigated if and how a preexisting fracture may influence the fracture trajectory and the injection pressure response  input data and stress conditions from the in-situ stress measurement campaigns in the geothermal borehole schlattingen-1 (switzerland) (klee, 2012) and the borehole bds-5 (derriere, mont terri, switzerland) (klee, 2011) were used as reference | 
eurock-2014-238 	 towards an improved observational method |abstract  the observational method is today an accepted method in eurocode 7 for design of geotechnical structures  however, case studies with formal application of its principles are still rare  one reason could be that the method to some extent is considered complex and associated with low safety margins  in fact, the eurocode does not give any reference to how the safety of the completed structure can be assured  this paper strives to open up a discussion on how the observational method can be improved by including a requirement for a safety margin of the completed structure  a methodology is outlined and illustrated with a simple calculation example analysing the safety of a square rock pillar  lastly, the compatibility with the observational method is discussed   1  introduction|when designing underground excavations in rock, the engineer must inevitably consider the uncertainties related to the properties of the rock in one way or another  a common approach is to be conservative in the design, but this is not always economically sound or possible in practice  for situations when it is difficult to predict the geotechnical behaviour, eurocode 7 (cen 2004) suggests applying the observational method  this method was first outlined by terzaghi and later defined by peck (1969)    when applying the observational method, a preliminary design is first prepared based on any available knowledge about the conditions and properties at the site  during the construction phase, the behaviour of the structure is observed  the essence of the observational method is to establish plans in advance, which infallibly put necessary contingency actions into operation if the behaviour is unacceptable  these measures accommodate the structure to the actual conditions at the site  the crucial challenge is to relate a measurable parameter to the structural behaviour and define the acceptable range of the parameter, so that the structure still meets all requirements even after the design has been altered by contingency actions  to facilitate an economically sound construction, the preliminary design must in addition be made so that contingency actions are sufficiently unlikely to be needed    case studies describing and discussing the formal application of the observational method as defined in the eurocode are still rare (spross & larsson, in press), even though the method at a glance can seem straightforward  it can however be argued that less strictly defined “observational approaches” sometimes are used in practice  even so, concerns regarding low safety margins have been put forward, as reported by powderham (2002)  the concerns are not surprising; the benefit of the observational method is to permit less conservative designs than other approaches, leaving to the designing engineer to interpret how to make the best use of the method  however, this benefit is also one of the major drawbacks, as the available guidelines (frank et al  2004) give virtually no guidance at all regarding suitable safety requirements for the structure  this implies that the safety margin of the completed structure is at best arbitrary, but possibly totally unknown  |

jfes-2014-t 	 discovering overlooked pay in complex sand reservoirs: lwd-based petrophysical analysis -an alaskan example |abstract   in several locations in the world the petrophysical analysis of hydrocarbon reservoirs is complicated by the presence of sands derived from volcanic sources   the interpretation of the fluids present in such rock is problematic in many ways as is the identification of potential reservoirs themselves   one particular example is the cook inlet in alaska   this is a fluvial depositional system with sands, shales and silt, rich in minerals with a volcanic origin   there are also many coal layers present and these are the source rock for these mainly gas reservoirs   several fields have clearly identifiable gas and oil-bearing zones and these have been well produced   operators are now actively searching for those more complex hydrocarbon zones that may have been overlooked in the past and also for information to help to update the reservoir models based on which zones still have gas present and to identify fault barriers in currently producing zones    the presence of sand reservoirs containing a high percentage of volcanic minerals and lithoclasts causes problems with standard gamma ray interpretation  also, low and variable salinity result in rw variation that are not predictable and wet zones that may have anomalously high resistivity  there are additional problems with the interpretation of density/neutron information to identify gas pay as the presence of volcanic minerals will tend to inhibit the occurrence of the neutron-density cross-over   the use of compressional and shear sonic data in combination with standard log interpretation is key to understanding these zones   in the studied well the presence of the coal layers and the associated poor wellbore and logging conditions, along with the wellbore deviation, meant that running wireline-conveyed sonic logging tools was not the preferred option   instead the full logging suite was acquired using logging-while drilling (lwd) technology   recently developed multi-pole lwd sonic tools are now able to deliver consistent shear data across a wide range of formation travel times, along with high-quality compressional data  the examples shown demonstrate the problems with interpreting fluid content without the sonic data and the conclusions that would be drawn in this case  the addition of compressional and shear data is shown to improve the interpretation and to identify potential reservoirs that would otherwise have been overlooked   the sonic data are also shown to provide information on previous production zones that are now depleted and swept by water, thus helping in understanding regional connectivity developing reservoir production strategies |

sbmr-2014-014 	 experimental correlations to obtain elastic properties of shale rocks using the indentation test |summary  important research has been developed in recent decades with the objective of the elastic characterization of shale formations, for their usefulness to optimize designs of hydraulic fracturing, seismic exploration, and estimates of horizontal stress and decreased wellbore stability problems  however, the investigation of shale is hampered by its mechanical and chemical instability, hindering the recovery of cores (cm scale) used in conventional mechanical testing  thus, the development and implementation of experimental correlations to obtain the elastic modulus or young’s modulus by indentation technique, exhibits a great potential for the elastic characterization of these formations  currently there is an important advance in the technique of indentation allowing the use of small samples as drill cuttings obtained during drilling and forces significantly lower than required in laboratory tests such as the uniaxial test  the correlations obtained between dynamic young’s modulus and the results of the indentation test are presented in this article  for this end, cylindrical samples of shale were considered that had both ultrasonic measurements (centimeter scale deformations) for obtaining dynamic young’s modulus and force-displacements curves obtained with the indentation technique, which allow detection of displacements as small as 0 001 mm |
