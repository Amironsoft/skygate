0416-0010-jpt 	 improving people’s lives: sustainability and the role of petroleum engineers |president's column |there are many definitions of sustainability, but the 1987 united nations brundtland commission’s remains a standard  |“meeting the needs of today without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs ” (wced 1987) |some think oil and gas have little role in a sustainable future; global realities suggest otherwise  how is it that a finite energy resource and a source of greenhouse gas emissions can be part of a sustainable future? oil and gas are essential to meeting the “needs of today;” their prudent use is the safest way to ensure we do not compromise the “ability of future generations to meet their own needs ” |the society of petroleum engineers board of directors adopted the following definition of sustainability in 2014: |“exploration, development and production of oil and gas resources provide affordable energy that contributes significantly to well-being and prosperity  |spe encourages the responsible management of these oil and gas resources and operations including the appropriate management of social and environmental impacts and their related risks  |spe demonstrates this commitment by offering its members opportunities to train, share knowledge and advance practices for doing business in ways that balance economic growth, social development, and environmental protection to meet societal needs today and in the future ” (spe 2014) |petrowiki also has an excellent discussion of sustainability at http://petrowiki org/sustainability, including references to noteworthy papers from www onepetro org  |safe, affordable energy is central to quality of life  it is essential for farmers to be able to produce sufficient food; for the transportation of this food to consumers; and for housing, heating and cooling, clothing, and all other necessities of life  quality of life is strongly correlated to energy use  |supplying energy for the world is a monumental task  there continue to be improvements in renewable energy sources; however, reasonable forecasts of growth in renewables suggest fossil fuels will remain the primary source of the world’s energy for decades to come  only radical growth in nuclear power could seriously diminish this result  the realities reflecting public concerns over nuclear safety and proliferation of radioactive materials make such growth unlikely  |while coal resources are abundant, concerns over greenhouse gas emissions and the possibilities of pricing carbon through taxes, caps, exchanges or other mechanisms, and the relatively low cost of natural gas, continue to make natural gas a more attractive fuel  this is true whether you expect it to be a relatively near-term “bridge fuel” to a renewable future or (as i do) part of our longer-term energy solutions  if oil and gas are to be part of a sustainable solution to our energy needs, there are some things we can and should do better as petroleum engineers | 
0516-0030-jpt 	 unconventional measures for shale reservoirs |unconventional measures for shale reservoirs |stephen rassenfoss, jpt emerging technology senior editor |one of the biggest ways to lower the cost of production from shale would be to identify zones that are productive, or not, before fracturing them  |there is a growing group of companies selling new ways of cutting the cost and time required to gather data while drilling, which will allow completion engineers to reduce the number of stages producing little or nothing  |“i think better placement is where the money is,” said vikram rao, executive director of the research triangle energy consortium  |while the methods and data points vary, these new ventures are all seeking to gather data or samples during normal operations that can be quickly turned into a report on a limited number of data points, which can be used to improve fracturing productivity  |customers “want it cheap, want it fast, and want to see a return quickly,” said chuck matula, a board adviser for drill- 2frac, a startup company created by vorpal energy solutions, that uses data recorded while drilling to compare rock hardness along a wellbore  |it is competing with another newcomer, fracture id, whose website describes what it does as “drill bit geomechanics ” both are selling rock property analysis methods that are lower-cost alternatives to accepted methods, such as well logs, whose price limits their use in unconventional plays  but the cost, data-gathering method, and output of these two methods differ significantly  |others are relying on readily available, alternative sources of data: cuttings, fluids, or well pressure readings  they are hitting the market at a time when low oil prices have created an appetite for new ideas  |“definitely we are exploring lots of technology options right now  anything to drive down our dollar per foot completion cost,” said kevin wutherich, director of completions for rice energy  “we are even looking at stuff that could save usd 20,000 a well  we have a program that might yield 70 wells a year, so that is about usd 1 5 million  that might not have been too big a deal (when oil was at usd 100/bbl) but these days we will chase that down ” |getting a feel for the rock |stephen rassenfoss, jpt emerging technology senior editor |the force required to drill through a rock is a direct test of its strength and stiffness  anyone who has ever used a power drill to drill through plaster and then hit a wooden beam can feel the difference  |turning those feelings into a reliable measure of the properties of rock based on the force required to drill a long lateral is a large challenge  |two startups, drill2frac and fracture id, are selling services that do that, though their methods vary based on the sources of the inputs and the outputs offered to customers  both are offering an option that can become a routinely used diagnostic method by those designing fractures by providing information comparable to that from a sonic log, but at a significantly lower price  |rock property information was also often a missing piece for those doing microseismic testing, which images the impact of fracturing based on the sound produced during certain types of fracturing  users wanted better rock property information to improve the interpretation of the changes in microseismic data gathered around a well, said chris neale, president of fracture id, which uses downhole drilling data for imaging  |“when i was deep in the microseismic world i was very frustrated  i could not tell them what microseismic was telling them  there was no in-well data to correlate the microseismic,” said neale, who was a cofounder of microseismic inc  “we needed an inexpensive data stream that could give us high-resolution rock properties for every well drilled ” |data gathered while drilling offer a measure that avoids the time and logistical challenges of running a sonic logging tool into a horizontal wellbore or setting up surface receivers for microseismic  |these companies are building on work going back decades on formulas to quantify rock properties based on data gathered while drilling and rock property analysis  |in a recent paper (spe 178842), bp described a formula that it developed to estimate pore pressures using drilling data  the work improved on formulas dating back to the late 1960s and early 1970s  |dna sequencing: a new diagnostic tool for shale wells |trent jacobs, jpt senior technology writer |for the past 2 decades, the use of dna sequencing technology has largely been relegated to the domains of criminal forensics and the healthcare industry  the company betting that the shale industry soon will join that list is biota technology, a california-based startup  |founded in 2013, biota says dna sequencing technology can help maximize production in horizontal shale wells by directing operators where to place the wells, and how they should be completed  |“we are addressing questions that our customers can’t answer today across multiple scales: where are the sweet spots and producing intervals for each stage, what is the fracture height for each well, and what is the connectivity between multiple wells?” said ajay kshatriya, chief executive officer of biota  |biota so far has used its technology on 60 wells operated by six different us producers  its novel approach involves analyzing the dna of tiny microbes that coexist with the oil, water, and rock in the subsurface  there are hundreds of thousands of different microbes living inside a formation but certain species are associated with hydrocarbons tend to stand out  |their unique signatures and locations along the wellbore allow biota to generate a production profile which can then be used to design engineered completions in subsequent wells, or to identify refracturing opportunities  |“think of the dna as a tracking device,” said kshatriya  “it is a high-resolution data source that provides 4d analysis across the production life cycle, which doesn’t introduce environmental risk or require downhole tools ” |during a drilling operation, as many as 600 samples may be taken from a single well  these samples come from drilling mud and cuttings and provide baseline data needed to characterize the well as production begins and comingles all of the microbial dna  |grinding out big data from tiny samples |stephen rassenfoss, jpt emerging technology senior editor |when describing what ingrain does for oilfield clients, the rock-testing company’s director of unconventional technology, joel walls, points out that it is “not just for science ” |he brings it up repeatedly because the company, known for being a pioneer in methods built on imaging ultratight rock at the core level, has built a business testing drilling cuttings to help identify productive, fracturable rock to help operators design better completions  |the pricing and turnaround time is designed to fit into the industry’s need to sharply increase the productivity of wells using better diagnostic testing at a time when drilling has greatly slowed  |“the asset teams and technology that remain in these (operating) companies are some of the best in the industry,” walls said  with the slowdown there is time to consider what they need to do, plan, and do more testing  the testing is guided by the realization that production performance varies widely from well to well, and from stage to stage due to unpredictable variations in the rock  |before the oil price crash, companies commonly would “optimize” a drilling program by doing a few heavily monitored science wells to establish a standard design for the many wells that followed  |wide performance variations made a case for the value of adding individual well data  but there is a limit on the time and money available to do so  |“the objective is to do it relatively inexpensively on every well drilled,” he said  to deliver on that ingrain had to develop a system to scale up that process to deliver results in time to be used to adjust completion designs based on field-scale data  |“the trend is doing it quickly and doing it in a repeatable fashion on a commercial scale” using current technology, walls said  |the turnaround time can be days, but it is normally about a week, for a price that he said is in the same range with other new testing methods costing less than usd 100,000 per well  |the cutting testing program uses mineral and elemental tests to measure brittleness, which can highlight if sections can be effectively broken using hydraulic pressure, and a look at pore-scale imaging to quantify the hydrocarbon-filled pores, which provides a good estimate of permeability  |mapping fracturing with pressure change |stephen rassenfoss, jpt emerging technology senior editor |a service using pressure data from a few nearby unconventional wells to map fracturing will soon be for sale  |statoil developed the method, and has used it to improve how it completes wells in three us unconventional plays, said matt dawson, investment manager at statoil ventures, which created a company to market the method, called reveal energy services  |the approach assumes that in formations where most of the hydrocarbons are trapped in a dense, nearly impermeable matrix with a limited number of fractures, the pressure of the flow through those pathways can be measured in nearby wells  |the signals—a poroelastic pressure response—can be 10–100 psi, said dawson, who also helped create the method  |the extremely limited flow in the formation, and the fact the monitoring wells are pressurized with water to protect them from the fractures growing from the well to be stimulated, ensures that the measurements are of “the pressure profile in the stimulated fracture,” he said  |with multiple surface measurements of pressure changes during fracturing— data from at least two wells are required, and more is better—dawson said it is possible to measure the largest fracture’s length, height, and angle  |the method developed to track fluid flows through fractures has been used to evaluate statoil wells in the bakken, eagle ford, and marcellus shales, and dawson said “we are confident it will work in those three ” |more than one-third of the company’s wells in the bakken were tested over a 12-month period, he said  within a year he said they hope to be able to gather and interpret the data quickly enough for it to be used by crews as they are fracturing the well  |when statoil researchers asked engineers in the field if they could try the test during fracturing in the bakken, there were questions about how much it could complicate fracturing  |“it really turned out to be not very difficult to accommodate into normal operations,” said darren schmidt, a principal engineer in statoil’s shale oil and gas research and technology group  the method requires setting plugs at certain times while fracturing, but if “you are zipper fracturing a well, you can fit this in normally on a multiwell pad and then get some good information,” said schmidt, who was then doing completions |

147622-pa 	 comprehensive optimization methodology for stimulation design of low-permeability unconventional gas reservoirs |summary |over the past decade, multiple-fracture horizontal wells (mfhws) have proved successful in recovering oil and particularly gas from very-low-permeability reservoirs  for mfhw planning and design, it is important to be able to make decisions on several variables, such as number of wells, number of fractures per well, amount and type of proppant per fracture, fracture dimensions (length, width, and height), and possibly others  standard practice for making such decisions is mostly empirical  however, empiricism may not be as successful for new cases that are significantly different from old ones  in such cases, what-if analysis is used by combining intuition with numerical simulators to assess the outcomes of possible decisions  even though this approach may produce feasible results, it is unlikely that it leads to optimal decisions because of the complexity of the problem  therefore, a systematic methodology is needed for mfhw planning and design that produces optimal solutions efficiently and effectively  |in this work, we develop such a methodology that optimizes net present value (npv)  the methodology poses the design problem as nested optimization in which the outer-optimization shell involves decisions on the number of wells, number of fractures per well, and amount of proppant, whereas the inner optimization maximizes the productivity index (pi) by selecting optimal fracture dimensions  the proposed methodology integrates in a systematic way a fracture-design module, a production-estimation module, and an economics module  because the methodology is automated and numerically efficient, one can use it effectively for field development  |a case study is used to illustrate the applicability of the proposed methodology, and suggestions are made for further improvements |

16-26-4-378 	 toward enhancement of mps method for ocean engineering: effect of time-integration schemes |abstract |the moving particle semi-implicit (mps) method is a lagrangian meshless method to simulate incompressible fluid flows  since its development, the mps method has almost always been applied with a simple explicit euler scheme, and the effect of higher-order time-integration schemes on the accuracy of this method has not yet been examined in detail  in this paper, the effect of higher-order time-integration schemes is investigated by considering a set of appropriate ocean engineering-related benchmark tests  it will be shown that the accuracy of the mps method is not noticeably sensitive to the applied time-integration scheme  hence, for further enhancement of the mps method, especially for the simulation of the violent fluid flows often encountered in ocean engineering, the main focus should be given to the accuracy, consistency and convergence properties of differential operator models and an applied projection scheme  |introduction |the moving particle semi-implicit (mps) method was originally developed by koshizuka and oka (1996) as a lagrangian meshless method for the simulation of viscous incompressible fluid flows  in general, particle methods, including the mps method, have a distinct advantage in reproducing the complicated violent flows with free surface often encountered in offshore and ocean engineering, due to their lagrangian tracking scheme without the advection term  however, particle methods, including the mps method, have an inevitable shortcoming regarding unphysical pressure fluctuations that usually leads to computational inaccuracy  |a set of enhanced schemes for suppressing pressure fluctuations was developed until now (khayyer and gotoh, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011; tsuruta et al , 2013; wendland, 1995), so this method can be reliably applied to ocean engineering applications  by applying the enhanced schemes to particle-based simulations, various challenging engineering problems such as breaking waves (khayyer and gotoh, 2008) or wave impact (khayyer and gotoh, 2009) have been widely studied  however, up to now and to our best knowledge, the effect of a time-integration scheme on the accuracy of the mps method has not been studied rigorously and comprehensively  on the other hand, a number of studies have applied different time-integration schemes in the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph) framework (molteni and colagrossi, 2009; blanc and pastor, 2012)  this is because sph has a simple explicit algorithm, whereas the mps method is founded on a semi-implicit solution process; thus, application of different time-integration schemes would not be straightforward in comparison to explicit sph  jeong et al  (2013) applied the runge– kutta scheme to the mps method and obtained slightly improved results  however, their study did not mainly target the effect of time-integration schemes, and other higher-order time-integration schemes that may be superior to the runge–kutta scheme in terms of applicability or calculation time were not examined | 
166144-pa 	 3d geomechanical modeling of salt-creep behavior on wellbore casing for presalt reservoirs |summary |exploration drilling is venturing into deeper regions of water  during the exploration of these deeper water depths, large hydrocarbon deposits have been found below salt formations  these reservoirs are called “presalts,” which are below the salt formations  presalt reservoirs have been found in offshore brazil, the gulf of mexico (gom), west africa, and the north sea  completions in salt formations can be difficult because of the creep behavior that the salt formations exhibit  creep behavior results from the instability of the salt formation, which causes a slow flow and permanent deformations  creep deformation occurs over time and begins once the salt formation has been penetrated  completion of the wellbore does not stop formation creep  the constant creep of the salt formation causes excess stress on the wellbore casing, which may eventually cause the casing to collapse  in this study, a 3d geomechanical model is developed, by use of data such as wellbore pressure and temperature; formation stress and temperature; rock, cement, and casing properties, to predict the effects of salt-creep behavior on stress loading in the wellbore casing, which helps to assess the life expectancy of wells in presalt reservoirs  the simulation results of this model can provide quantitative results of casing stress and deformation as a function of time under various temperature, in-situ-stress, and operation conditions, which can be used as useful information for subsequent wellbore-casing design and wellbore-integrity analysis  in addition, possible methods that can mitigate the severity of salt mobility and reduce the risks of casing collapse are discussed | 
166306-pa 	 nanopore compositional modeling in unconventional shale reservoirs |summary |understanding the mechanism of multicomponent mass transport in the nanopores of unconventional reservoirs, such as eagle ford, niobrara, woodford, and bakken, is of great interest because it influences long-term economic development of such reservoirs  thus, we began to examine the phase behavior and flow characteristics of multicomponent flow in primary production in nanoporous reservoirs  besides primary recovery, our long-term objectives included enhanced oil production from such reservoirs  the first step was to evaluate the phase behavior in nanopores on the basis of pore-size distribution  this was motivated because the physical properties of hydrocarbon components are affected by wall proximity in nanopores as a result of van der waals molecular interactions with the pore walls  for instance, critical pressure and temperature of hydrocarbon components shift to lower values as the nanopore walls become closer  in our research, we applied this kind of critical property shift to the hydrocarbon components of two eagle ford fluid samples  then, we used the shifted phase characteristics in dual-porosity compositional modeling to determine the pore-to-pore flow characteristics, and, eventually, the flow behavior of hydrocarbons to the wells  in the simulation, we assigned three levels of phase behavior in the matrix and fracture pore spaces  in addition, the flow hierarchy included flow from matrix (nano-, meso-, and macropores) to macrofractures, from macrofractures to a hydraulic fracture (hf), and through the hf to the production well  from the simulation study, we determined why hydrocarbon fluids flow so effectively in ultralow-permeability shale reservoirs  the simulation also gave credence to the intuitive notion that favorable phase behavior (phase split) in the nanopores is one of the major reasons for production of commercial quantities of light oil and gas from shale reservoirs  it was determined that the implementation of confined-pore and midconfined-pore phase behavior lowers the bubblepoint pressure, and this, in turn, leads to a slightly higher oil recovery and lesser gas recovery  also it was determined that the implementation of midconfined-pore and confined-pore phase-behavior shift reduces the retrograde liquid condensation region, which in turn, leads to lower liquid yield while maintaining the same gas-production quantity  finally, the important reason that we are able to produce shale reservoirs economically is “rubblizing” the reservoir matrix near hfs, which creates favorable permeability pathways to improve reservoir drainage  this is why multistage hydraulic fracturing is so critical for successful development of shale reservoirs | 
167183-pa 	 effective flow properties for cells containing fractures of arbitrary geometry |summary |hydrocarbon production from unconventional resources such as shale usually entails stimulation by hydraulic fracturing, which results in nonplanar (curved) fractures  however, most reservoir models assume that the induced fractures are planar for the sake of simplicity  considering the growing interest of the petroleum industry in better understanding production from these resources, we develop a fracture-cell model to capture the effects of fracture nonplanarity on transport properties  |to build a realistic reservoir model for a fractured formation, we must account for three types of interactions: matrix-matrix (m-m), matrix-fracture (m-f), and fracture-fracture (f-f)  the transport properties of the m-m interaction are based on laboratory measurements  in this study, we analytically determine the transport properties of the two other types of interactions (m-f and f-f)  for this purpose, we account for the aperture size and spatial location of the fracture  as a result, we provide effective porosity and effective anisotropic permeabilities for a reservoir cell that contains a fracture inside it  the reservoir cell with transport properties that are modified is a fracture cell  |we implement the fracture-cell model in a reservoir simulator and perform analyses for a single fracture and for multiple intersecting fractures; these fractures are nonplanar  the analyses include both single- and multiphase flow models and show that the hydrocarbon pressure inside the reservoir is strongly dependent on the fracture geometry when the matrix permeability is smaller than 1 µd  thus, it is crucial to model the fracture geometry more accurately in unconventional reservoirs with ultralow permeabilities such as shale  |one can easily implement the developed fracture-cell model in reservoir simulators, and there is no local refinement around the fracture  the main advantage of the proposed model is its simplicity, conjoined with its ability to capture the nonplanarity of the fracture  the developed model has major applications for understanding production from formations that are heavily fractured |

170746-pa 	 detecting fracture growth out of zone by use of temperature analysis |summary |hydraulic fracturing is a widely applied well-stimulation technique  recently, the application of multiple hydraulic fractures along horizontal wells has made possible the exploitation of unconventional reservoirs, such as shale gas and shale oil  however, the process of horizontal-well fracturing is uncertain and it is not fully understood yet  there exist many questions about the number and position of created fractures and whether the fracture stays contained within the main reservoir thickness  |this work presents the modeling and analysis of temperature data during and after the creation of multiple fractures along a horizontal well  our model accounts for fracture growth and closure, the well effects, and interaction between multiple fractures  |the interference between multiple fractures growing simultaneously and the presence of reservoir-permeability heterogeneity were investigated  capabilities and limitations of information carried by temperature data are presented through different geometry analyses  |a special consideration of fracture growth out of zone was addressed  for this case, it was considered that one of the hydraulic fractures activates a pre-existing fault and interconnects the reservoir with other zones hundreds of feet away  |our work shows the advantage of the use of continuous-distributed-temperature data in comparison with the traditional single-point-pressure analysis  the local characteristic of temperature allows us to identify not only which of the created hydraulic fractures has interconnected the main reservoir with a different zone, but also the location of this zone  we also account for the effect of the interconnection on the growth of the other hydraulic fractures along the horizontal wellbore  |the simultaneous multiple fracture growth shows that falloff-distributed-temperature data can predict the number of created fractures  more than that, in the presence of heterogeneity, the interaction between the contained fractures can be captured by the temperature analysis  different from the pressure analysis, distributed-temperature data can differentiate between heterogeneity locations along the wellbore  |throughout this study, we present a series of examples in which the temperature can provide information that would not be obtained from the traditional pressure analysis | 
170801-pa 	 modeling gas adsorption in marcellus shale with langmuir and bet isotherms |summary |production from shale-gas reservoirs plays an important role in natural-gas supply in the united states  horizontal drilling and multistage hydraulic fracturing are the two key enabling technologies for the economic development of these shale-gas reservoirs  it is believed that gas in shale reservoirs is mainly composed of free gas within fractures and pores and adsorbed gas in organic matter (kerogen)  it is generally assumed in the literature that the monolayer langmuir isotherm describes gas-adsorption behavior in shale-gas reservoirs  however, in this work, we analyzed four experimental measurements of methane adsorption from the marcellus shale core samples that deviate from the langmuir isotherm, but obey the brunauer-emmett-teller (bet) isotherm  to the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to find that methane adsorption in a shale-gas reservoir behaves similar to multilayer adsorption  consequently, investigation of this specific gas-desorption effect is important for accurate evaluation of well performance and completion effectiveness in shale-gas reservoirs on the basis of the bet isotherm  the difference in calculating original gas in place (ogip) on the basis of both isotherms is discussed  we also performed history matching with one production well from the marcellus shale and evaluated the contribution of gas desorption to the well’s performance  history matching shows that gas adsorption obeying the bet isotherm contributes more to overall gas recovery than gas adsorption obeying the langmuir isotherm, especially at early time in production  this work provides better understanding of gas desorption in shale-gas reservoirs and updates our current analytical and numerical models for simulation of shale-gas production | 
171417-pa 	 a novel work flow of density-log normalization for coalbed-methane wells: an example from the surat basin in australia |summary |in coalbed-methane (cbm) projects, conventional logs, such as density were used heavily for coal identification, coal-property derivation, and also potentially for coal ranking  this paper presents a novel work flow of density-log normalization for cbm wells  it addresses two major challenges to current normalization methods: absence of a pervasive reference layer and removal of geological effects after normalization  to overcome these disadvantages, the proposed work flow undertakes six steps, which are data quality control (qc), geological- area segmentation, subarea type-well selection, density-control points, variable linear transformation and normalized-log result qc with box plots, matrix crossplots, and several histograms  this work flow removes the systematic errors caused by acquiring logs at different times with different logging instruments provided by different vendors  furthermore, it possesses the advantages of the automated qc work flow, type-well control, and reference-layer methods without incurring their respective disadvantages  it was applied successfully to approximately 600 wells covering a large area in the surat basin of australia  proper log normalization will reduce the uncertainties involved in 3d geological modeling and will increase the accuracy of reservoir evaluation  this paper should therefore be of interest to petrophysicists and geologists involved in cbm-field characterization | 
171607-pa 	 integrated reservoir characterization and 3d modeling of the monteith formation: a case study of tight gas sandstones in the western canada sedimentary basin, alberta, canada |summary |the monteith formation is an important tight gas reservoir in the deep basin, alberta, and consists of a progradational succession of shallow marine sediments, nonmarine carbonaceous and coaly, coastal plain facies, and coarse-grained fluvial deposits, from base to top, respectively  this study is based on multiscale description and characterization techniques with cores and drill cuttings, including multimethods laboratory measurements of key reservoir parameters such as porosity and permeability  a second stage of the study involves the use of laboratory measurements obtained from cores and drill cuttings and their integration with well logs to construct a numerical 3d model of the study area  the 3d model is used to history match gas production, and forecast performance of new wells in those areas where the geologic model indicates potential for gas production  the ultimate goal is to provide a better understanding of the distribution of reservoir properties in the study area for developing drilling prospects and their production potential in areas where reliable data are scarce  the reservoir-modeling stage is carried out by implementing a recently developed methodology that integrates a variable shape distribution (vsd) model, capable of capturing different reservoir properties throughout the whole scale spectrum without any data truncation  truncation is the excuse generally used for eliminating information that does not fit a given distribution  the claim is that the data are of poor quality, something that is not true in many cases  this new methodology eliminates the need for truncation, and introduces an extension of the vsd approach for reservoir-simulation purposes that reduces uncertainty in the generation of drilling prospects  core analysis shows that the monteith a member is composed of complex fluvial-dominated deposits with better rock quality than the shallow marine sandstones of the monteith c member  this is most likely because of larger pore-throat apertures that range between 0 5 and 1 µm, and a relatively higher proportion of preserved intergranular pore space within these coarser-grained framework grains  furthermore, the best production performance is from wells that are producing from the monteith a  variability of production rates also seems to be controlled by the presence of natural fractures  it is anticipated that the resulting 3d reservoir model will allow improving field-development strategies for this and other similar unconventional gas reservoirs in the deep basin of alberta and elsewhere | 
171648-pa 	 optimum fracture conductivity for naturally fractured shale and tight reservoirs |summary |with the development of unconventional shale and tight reservoirs, stimulation treatments that place multiple transverse fractures have received greater attention in recent years  the post-fracture productivity of such low-permeability reservoirs is largely determined by the matrix/fracture contact area with appropriate fracture conductivity  although it is often anticipated that the fractures are infinitely conductive, the general belief is that production increases with the proppant amount injected  |this paper presents an approach to assess the proppant amount injected by determining the optimum post-fracture conductivity  first, through use of 3d finite-difference reservoir simulations in a naturally fractured reservoir, which has both the hydraulic fracture and natural fractures modeled explicitly as discrete gridblocks, we find cumulative production as a function of fracture conductivity  for a fixed propped length and production time, we observe a critical conductivity beyond which the production is insensitive to the conductivity  the critical conductivity is then obtained as a function of the propped length and production time  the numerical results show that the critical conductivity increases with propped length and decreases with production time  the effect of stimulated natural-fracture properties (spacing and permeability) on the critical conductivity is then investigated  for reservoirs with matrix permeability in the range of 20 to 1,000 nd, natural fractures increase the short-term critical conductivity, but decrease the medium- to long-term conductivity  the paper also evaluates the influence of water production, cluster spacing, and flowing bottomhole pressure (bhp) on the critical conductivity  |this study demonstrates that fracture designs that are based on pseudosteady-state solutions are not appropriate for naturally fractured shale reservoirs and can lead to significantly lower initial production  considering conductivity degradation over time, fracture designs that target achieving 1-year critical conductivity are recommended  a simple, yet robust workflow that is based on knowledge of 1-year critical conductivity is also presented for systematically selecting the type and amount of proppant for stimulation treatment  such a workflow can mitigate trial-and-error-based and data-driven approaches in the industry  an example is demonstrated for the marcellus play | 
172010-pa 	 potential of low-salinity waterflood to improve oil recovery in carbonates: demonstrating the effect by qualitative coreflood |summary |low-salinity waterflood (lsf) is a promising improved-oil-recovery (ior) technology  although, it was demonstrated that lsf is an efficient ior method for many sandstone reservoirs, the potential of lsf in carbonate reservoirs is still not well-established because only a limited number of successful coreflood experiments are available in the literature  therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the oil-recovery improvement by lsf in carbonate reservoirs by performing coreflood experiments  |this paper proposes an experimental approach to qualitatively evaluate the potential of lsf to improve oil recovery and alter the rock wettability during coreflood experiments  the corefloods were conducted on core plugs from two middle eastern carbonate reservoirs with a wide variation of rock properties and reservoir conditions  seawater (sw) and several dilutions of formation brine and sw were flooded in the tertiary mode to evaluate their impacts on oil recovery compared with formation-brine injection  in addition, a geochemical study was performed with phreeqc software (parkhurst and appelo 1999) to assess the potential of calcite dissolution by lsf  |the experimental results confirmed that lowering the water salinity can alter the rock wettability toward more water-wet, causing improvement of oil recovery in tertiary waterflood in plugs from the two reservoirs  furthermore, sw is more-favorable for improved oil recovery than formation brine because injection of sw after formation brine resulted in extra oil production  this demonstrates that the brine composition plays an important role during waterflooding in carbonate reservoirs, and not only the brine salinity  it was also observed that oil recovery can be improved by injection of brines that cannot dissolve calcite on the basis of the geochemical modeling study  this implies that calcite dissolution is not the dominant mechanism of ior by lsf  |to conclude, this paper demonstrates that lsf has a good potential as an ior technology in carbonate reservoirs  in addition, the proposed experimental approach ensures the verification of lsf effect, either it is positive or negative  however, further research is required to explore the optimum salinity and composition and the most-influential parameters affecting lsf response |

173156-pa 	 spiraled boreholes: an expression of 3d directional instability of drilling systems |summary |borehole spiraling is predicted by analyzing the delay differential equations (ddes) governing the propagation of a borehole  these evolution equations, expressed in terms of the borehole inclination and azimuth, are obtained from considerations involving a bit/rock-interaction law that relates the force and moment acting on the bit to its penetration into the rock; kinematic relationships that describe the local borehole geometry in relation to the bit penetration; and a beam model for the bottomhole assembly (bha) that expresses the force and moment at the bit as functions of the external loads applied on the bha and the geometrical constraints arising from the stabilizers conforming to the borehole geometry  |the analytical nature of the propagation equations makes it possible to conduct a systematic stability analysis in terms of a key dimensionless group that controls the directional stability of the drilling system  this group depends on the downhole weight on bit (wob), on properties of the bha, on the bit bluntness, and on parameters characterizing the steering response of the bit  the directional stability of a particular system then is assessed by comparing the magnitude of this group with a critical value, representing a bifurcation of stability, which depends only on the bha configuration and on the bit walk  if this group is less than the critical value, the system is deemed to be directionally unstable, and borehole spiraling is likely  stability curves for an idealized bha with two stabilizers show that the bit walk tends to make drilling systems more prone to spiraling  applications to field cases are discussed  simulations conducted by integrating the equations of borehole propagation also are presented  they illustrate that, for unstable systems, the model predicts spiraled boreholes with a pitch comparable with what generally is observed in the field | 
173210-pa 	 simulation of coupled thermal/hydrological/mechanical phenomena in porous media |summary |for processes such as production from low-permeability reservoirs and storage in subsurface formations, reservoir flow and the reservoir stress field are coupled and affect one another  this paper presents a thermal/hydrological/mechanical (thm) reservoir simulator that is applicable to modeling such processes  the fluid- and heat-flow portion of our simulator is for general multiphase, multicomponent, multiporosity systems  the geomechanical portion consists of an equation for mean stress, derived from linear elastic theory for a thermo-poroelastic system, and equations for stress-tensor components that depend on mean stress and other variables  the integral finite-difference method is used to solve these equations  the mean-stress and reservoir-flow variables are solved implicitly, and the remaining stress-tensor components are solved explicitly  our simulator is verified by use of analytical solutions for stress- and strain-tensor components and is compared with published results | 
173213-pa 	 a physics-based data-driven numerical model for reservoir history matching and prediction with a field application (associated discussion available as supporting information) |summary |we derive and implement an interwell-numerical-simulation model (insim), which can be used as a calculation tool to approximate the performance of a reservoir under waterflooding  in insim, the reservoir is characterized as a coarse model consisting of a number of interwell control units, where each unit has two specific parameters: transmissibility and control pore volume (pv)  by solving the mass-material-balance and front-tracking equations for the control units, the interwell fluid rates and saturations are obtained so that phase-producing rates can be predicted  the ability of insim to predict water cut and phase rates is the most important innovation included in insim  insim is applied to perform history matching and to infer the interwell connectivity and geological characteristics  insim has a number of advantages  first, the model parameters estimated from history matching provide a relative characterization of interwell-formation properties  the model can handle changes in the flow directions caused by changing well rates, including shutting in wells or converting producers to injectors, whereas with the common correlation-based interwell-connectivity method, the well interactions are assumed to be fixed  second, the previous methods, which have similar computational complexity to insim, can only provide the total liquid-production rate, whereas with our procedure, we can calculate the oil- and water-flow rates and hence history match water-cut data  third, because we can calculate the oil- and water-flow rates, our method can be used for waterflooding optimization but with far-less computational effort than with the traditional method by use of a reservoir simulator  |*discussion available  see supporting information below  | 
173248-pa 	 a dual-grid method for the upscaling of solid-based thermal reactive flow, with application to the in-situ conversion process |summary |thermal-reactive compositional-flow simulation in porous media is essential to model thermal-oil-recovery processes for extraheavy-hydrocarbon resources, and an example is the in-situ conversion process (icp) developed by shell for oil-shale production  computational costs can be very high for such a complex system, which makes direct fine-scale simulations prohibitively time-consuming for large field-scale applications  this motivates the use of coarse grids for thermal-reactive compositional-flow simulation  however, significant errors are introduced by use of coarse-scale models without carefully computing the appropriate coarse parameters  in this paper, we develop an innovative dual-grid method to effectively capture the fine-scale reaction rates in coarse-scale icp-simulation models  in our dual-grid method, coupled thermal-reactive compositional-flow equations are solved only on the coarse scale, with the kinetic parameters (frequency factors) calculated on the basis of fine-scale computations, such as temperature downscaling and fine-scale reaction-rate calculation  a dual-grid treatment for the heater-well model is also developed with coarse-scale heater-well indices calculated on the basis of fine-scale well results  the dual-grid heater-well treatment is able to provide accurate heater temperatures  the newly developed dual-grid method is applied to realistic cross-sectional icp-pattern models with a vertical production well and multiple horizontal heater wells operated subject to fixed and time-varying heater powers  it is shown that the dual-grid model delivers results that are in close agreement with the fine-scale reference results for all quantities of interest  despite the fact that the dual-grid method is implemented at the simulation-deck level, by use of the flexible scripting and monitor functionalities of our proprietary simulation package, significant computational improvements are achieved for all cases considered | 
173271-pa 	 fast multiscale reservoir simulations with pod-deim model reduction |summary |we present a global/local model reduction for fast multiscale reservoir simulations in highly heterogeneous porous media  our approach identifies a low-dimensional structure in the solution space  we introduce an auxiliary variable (the velocity field) in our model reduction that achieves a high compression of the model  this compression is achieved because the velocity field is conservative for any low-order reduced model in our framework, whereas a typical global model reduction that is based on proper-orthogonal-decomposition (pod) galerkin projection cannot guarantee local mass conservation  the lack of mass conservation can be observed in numerical simulations that use finite-volume-based approaches  the discrete empirical interpolation method (deim) approximates fine-grid nonlinear functions in newton iterations  this approach delivers an online computational cost that is independent of the fine-grid dimension  pod snapshots are inexpensively computed with local model-reduction techniques that are based on the generalized multiscale finite-element method (gmsfem) that provides (1) a hierarchical approximation of the snapshot vectors, (2) adaptive computations with coarse grids, and (3) inexpensive global pod operations in small dimensional spaces on a coarse grid  by balancing the errors of the global and local reduced-order models, our new methodology provides an error bound in simulations  our numerical results, by use of a two-phase immiscible flow, show a substantial speedup, and we compare our results with the standard pod-deim in a finite-volume setup | 
173326-pa 	 numerical investigation of complex hydraulic-fracture development in naturally fractured reservoirs |summary |complex fracture networks have become more evident in shale reservoirs as a result of the interaction between pre-existing natural fractures (nfs) and hydraulic fractures (hfs)  accurate characterization of fracture complexity plays an important role in optimizing fracturing design, especially for shale reservoirs with high-density nfs  |in this study, we simulated simultaneous multiple-fracture propagation within a single fracturing stage by use of a complex hf-development model  the model was developed to simulate complex fracture propagation by coupling rock mechanics and fluid mechanics  a simplified 3d displacement-discontinuity method (ddm) was implemented to more accurately calculate fracture displacements and fracture-induced dynamic-stress changes than our previously developed pseudo-3d model  the effects of perforation-cluster spacing, differential stress (shmax–shmin), and the geometry of various nf patterns on injection pressure and fracture complexity were investigated  |the single-stage simulation results show that (1) higher differential stress suppresses fracture length and increases injection pressure; (2) there is an optimal choice for the number of fractures per stage to maximize effective fracture-surface contact area, beyond which increasing the number of fractures actually decreases effective fracture area; and (3) fracture complexity is a function of nf patterns (various regular-pattern geometries were investigated)  nfs with small relative angle to hfs are more likely to control the fracture-propagation path  also, nf patterns with more long fractures tend to increase the likelihood to dominate the preferential fracture trend of fracture trajectory  our numerical model can provide a physics-based complex fracture network that can be imported into reservoir-simulation models for production analysis  the overall sensitivity results presented should serve as guidelines for fracture-complexity analysis | 
173354-pa 	 fully coupled hydromechanical simulation of hydraulic fracturing in 3d discrete-fracture networks |summary |we developed a hydraulic-fracturing simulator that implicitly couples fluid flow with the stresses induced by fracture deformation in large, complex, 3d discrete-fracture networks (dfns)  the code is efficient enough to perform field-scale simulations of hydraulic fracturing in dfns containing thousands of fractures, without relying on distributed-memory parallelization  the simulator can describe propagation of hydraulic fractures and opening and shear stimulation of natural fractures  fracture elements can open or slide, depending on their stress state, fluid pressure, and mechanical properties  fracture sliding occurs in the direction of maximum resolved shear stress  nonlinear empirical equations are used to relate normal stress, fracture opening, and fracture sliding to fracture aperture and transmissivity  fluid leakoff is treated with a semianalytical 1d leakoff model that accounts for changing pressure in the fracture over time  fracture propagation is modeled with linear-elastic fracture mechanics  the forchheimer equation (forchheimer 1901) is used to simulate non-darcy pressure drop in the fractures because of high flow rate  a crossing criterion is implemented that predicts whether propagating hydraulic fractures will cross natural fractures or terminate against them, depending on orientation and stress anisotropy  height containment of propagating hydraulic fractures between bedding layers can be modeled with a vertically heterogeneous stress field or by explicitly imposing hydraulic-fracture-height containment as a model assumption  limitations of the model are that all fractures must be vertical; the mechanical calculations assume a linearly elastic and homogeneous medium; proppant transport is not included; and the locations of potentially forming hydraulic fractures must be specified in advance  simulations were performed of a single propagating hydraulic fracture with and without leakoff to validate the code against classical analytical solutions  field-scale simulations were performed of hydraulic fracturing in a densely naturally fractured formation  the simulations demonstrate how interaction with natural fractures in the formation can help explain the high net pressures, relatively short fracture lengths, and broad regions of microseismicity that are often observed in the field during stimulation in low-permeability formations, and that are not predicted by classical hydraulic-fracturing models  depending on input parameters, our simulations predicted a variety of stimulation behaviors, from long hydraulic fractures with minimal leakoff into surrounding fractures to broad regions of dense fracturing with a branching network of many natural and newly formed fractures |

174949-pa 	 the effect of bit type on reactive torque and consequent tool-face-control anomalies |summary |the oil-and-gas drilling industry has developed a large body of knowledge about methods for drilling directional wells with steerable motors  experience indicates that more-aggressive drill bits are harder to steer  this is commonly attributed to the fact that bits with higher aggressivity produce larger torque changes for a given change in bit weight  the actual mechanics, however, of tool-face disorientation during slide events is poorly understood  this paper reports on tests conducted on a full-size drill rig aimed at understanding the mechanics of tool-face control  tool-face orientation and other data were measured downhole at 100 hz  nine different bits ranging from polycrystalline diamond compact (pdc) to hybrid to roller-cone bits were tested on an adjustable kick- off (ako) motor bottomhole assembly (bha) in slide mode  these tests confirm the common industry notions about the effect of aggressivity on tool-face control  they also show that angular motion of the bha while sliding is overdamped  toolface orientation consequently follows the average of the torque signal generated by the bit  furthermore, the tool-face orientation is more easily disoriented by a torque signal at a frequency near to or less than the torsional natural frequency of the drillstring  pdc bits excite this more readily than bits with rolling cones  we also identify a tool-face disorientation anomaly that we call a fast torque anomaly (fta)  ftas occur because the bent motor/ako has a preferred angular orientation in the borehole  ftas have not been previously recognized, probably because they are not identifiable in mud-pulse signals  a bha suffering ftas would simply appear as a chaotic and profound loss of tool-face control in mudpulse data  hybrid and roller-cone bits caused fewer ftas than pdc bits |

175143-pa 	 flowback fracture closure: a key factor for estimating effective pore volume |summary |the importance of evaluating well productivity after hydraulic fracturing cannot be overemphasized  this has necessitated the improvement in the quality of rate and pressure measurements during flowback of multistage-fractured wells  similarly, there have been corresponding improvements in the ability of existing transient models to interpret multiphase flowback data  however, the complexity of these models introduces high uncertainty in the estimates of resulting parameters, such as fracture pore volume (pv), half-length, and permeability  this paper proposes a two-phase tank model for reducing parameter uncertainty and estimating fracture pv independent of fracture geometry  this study starts by use of rate-normalized-pressure (rnp) plots to observe changes in fluid-flow mechanisms from multistage- fractured wells  the fracture “pressure-supercharge” observations form the basis for developing the proposed two-phase tank model  this model is a linear relationship between rnp and time, useful for interpreting flowback data in wells that show pseudosteady-state behavior (unit slope on log-log rnp plots)  the linear relationship is implemented on a simple monte carlo spreadsheet  this is then used to estimate and conduct uncertainty analysis on effective fracture pv by use of probabilistic distributions of average fracture compressibility and gas/water saturations  also, the proposed model investigates the contributions of various drive mechanisms during flowback (fracture closure, gas expansion, and water depletion) by use of quantitative drive indices similar to those used in conventional reservoir engineering  application of the proposed tank model to flowback data from 15 shale-gas and tight-oil wells estimates the effective fracture pv and initial average gas saturation in the active fracture network  the results show that fracture-pv estimation is most sensitive to fracture closure compared with gas expansion and water depletion, making fracture closure the primary drive mechanism during early-flowback periods  also, the initial average gas saturation for all wells is less than 20%  the parameters estimated from the proposed model could be used as input guides for more-complex studies (such as discrete-fracture-network modeling and transient-flowback simulation)  this reduces the number of unknown parameters and uncertainty in output results from complex models | 
176028-pa 	 multiscale imaging of fixed-cutter-drill-bit-generated shale cuttings |summary |shales account for more than 75% of the formations drilled worldwide, and fixed-cutter bits are used to drill most of the footage  cutter/rock interactions after the initial failure of rock are shown to be a major source of drilling inefficiency  analytical and numerical modeling was implemented to understand these interactions and their controlling factors, but a comprehensive model does not exist  this is mainly because of the complex nature of the problem that depends on several factors that include rock characteristics, pressure-and-temperature environment, bit design, and drilling-fluid properties  having such a large range of factors requires a cross-disciplinary approach to tackle the problem  this paper is focused on fabric analysis of the rock cuttings  recent developments in fabric-analysis techniques allow the study of the size, shape, composition, and spatial arrangement of particles and matrix constituents in finegrained rocks  this has led to an increased understanding of compaction phenomena, shear strength, porosity, permeability, fracturing, electrical propagation, and seismic properties of the rock  despite this, the changes in rock fabric during interaction with the drill bit are not well-understood  this work takes advantage of those techniques by analyzing the shale cuttings at the macro-, micro-, and nanolevels to understand how shales break and deform under confining pressure to better understand drill-bit/rock interactions  cuttings recovered from a well in tuscaloosa, louisiana, drilled with fixed-cutter bits were analyzed in multiple scales: macro, micro, and nano  shallower and deeper sections were drilled with water-based mud and oil-based mud (obm), respectively  samples were gathered from seven depth intervals ranging from 13,500 to 21,320 ft  the microscale analysis was performed with a x-ray computed-tomography scanning technique, whereas nanoscale analysis was performed with a scanning electron microscope (sem)  shale-cuttings fabric was characterized by images produced by energy-x-ray-descriptive spectroscopy (eds) and backscattered-electron microscopy of ion-milled samples  cuttings were generally formed in the shape of layered ribbons in which the mud-facing side is uneven and serrated whereas the cutter side is smooth and has a darkened clay film  the size of the ribbons and thickness of the layers were larger in areas drilled with obm  cuttings accumulation in the form of a ball attached to some of the ribbons from drilling in obm provided evidence that cutter balling can occur during field drilling operations  sem-eds analysis of cuttings showed significant accumulation of barite, a component in the drilling fluid, on the external surface of the serrated sides of the ribbons  in addition, scattered barite zones were found inside the cuttings  x-ray diffraction analyses indicated a mixed mineral assemblage dominated by quartz and smectite with minor illite, kaolinite, chlorite, mixed-layered materials, and traces of calcite and pyrite  it was hypothesized that the absence or scattered appearance of barite in some zones of produced cuttings, particularly the cutter side of the ribbon and the cutter ball, may relate to higher deformation of cuttings at those zones  in addition, the mechanism of cutter balling was explained with an analogy with metal-cutting theories  this was supported by comparison between the geometry of shale cuttings from this field and copper cuttings from single-cutter experiments  structural analysis of cuttings from actual field drilling reinforced the relevance of the observations made during laboratory experiments  it also provided unique insights, observations, and incentives for additional investigation of how cuttings are formed and what influences dysfunctions or inefficiencies  this is a significant step in understanding shale/cutter interactions that severely affect the bit penetration rate, especially under high confining pressure |

179455-ms 	 mapping of oil and gas companies' policy commitment to respect human rights |oil and gas companies are recommended to develop a policy commitment to respect human rights and to communicate their commitment publicly  this recommendation is based on the un guiding principles on business and human rights  this study assesses, based on accessible information on the internet, if the 35 largest oil and gas companies in term of revenues from asia, europe, north and south america, the middle east and australia in fact are implementing the recommendation  the study also attempts to assess, if the implementation of the recommendation varies depending on a company's origin and nature of ownership  the study shows that the majority of companies state – explicitly or implicitly – that they are committed to respecting human rights and often with a reference to un global compact  the exception is companies headquartered in middle east countries  all companies in the study recognize the importance of corporate social responsibility  the majority understands human rights as what is referenced in the un universal declaration on human rights, and there are indications that this is regarded as the minimum standard for conducting business with legitimacy  if the company has an explicit policy commitment, it is approved at the most senior level  the policies assessed do not generally indicate that companies have undertaken a systematic assessment of their potential areas of impact, and the policies apply mostly internally or to business relations but rarely other parties directly linked to its operations, products and services in their application to other than internal of the companies | 
179617-ms 	 characterization of wormhole growth and its applications for chops wells using history matching |abstract   a wormhole dynamic growth model has been developed and incorporated with a commercial reservoir simulator, i e , cmg, to characterize wormhole growth for cold heavy oil production with sand (chops) processes and extends its application to a field well  more specifically, geomechanics analysis associated with a collapsed pore and its throat structure has been performed to quantify the sand production  then, a sand failure criterion and a four-direction pressure difference analysis are respectively proposed to determine the sand production rate and the potential direction of wormhole generation and growth  by considering the uncertainties associated with the parameters involved in the wormhole growth model, history matching is respectively conducted to estimate the critical breakdown pressure, superficial area of the collapsed throats, and coefficients of the permeability-porosity correlation for a field chops well  subsequently, the dynamic wormhole growth model has been validated with a synthetic model and then extended to a chops well for determining its wormhole network  it is found from both the synthetic case and field application that the newly proposed technique can be used to determine the corresponding wormhole network as a function of time by history matching the production profile  furthermore, the history matched models can also be utilized to optimize the following enhanced oil recovery processes such as cyclic solvent injection | 
179634-ms 	 experimental and numerical studies of co2 eor in unconventional liquid reservoirs with complex fracture networks |abstract   with the synergy of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing techniques, commercial production of unconventional liquid reservoirs (ulr) has been successfully demonstrated  due to the low recovery factor of these reservoirs, it is inevitable that enhanced oil recovery (eor) will ensue  experimental results have shown promising oil recovery potential using co2  this study investigates oil production mechanisms from the matrix into the fracture by simulating two laboratory experiments as well as several field-scale studies, and evaluates the potential of using co2 huff-n-puff process to enhance the oil recovery in ulr with nano-darcy range matrix permeability in complex natural fracture networks    this study fully explores mechanisms contributing to the oil recovery with numerical modeling of experimental work, and provides a systematic investigation of the effects of various parameters on oil recovery  the core scale modeling utilizes two methods of determining properties that are used to construct 3d heterogeneous models  the findings are then upscaled to the field scale where both simple and complex fractures in a single stage are modeled  the effects of reservoir properties and operational parameters on oil recovery are then investigated  in addition, this study is the first to present simulation results of co2 huff-n-puff using complex fracture networks which are generated from microseismic-constraint stochastic models    diffusion is proven to be the dominant oil recovery mechanism at the laboratory scale  however, the field-scale reservoir simulation indicates diffusion is negligible compared to the well-known mechanisms accompanying multi-contact miscibility  this includes swelling, viscosity reduction, and gas expansion in the matrix  overall, the co2 huff-n-puff process was found to be beneficial in both models in terms of enhancing the ultimate oil recovery in ulr | 
179725-pa 	 the fracture-compliance method for picking closure pressure from diagnostic fracture-injection tests (see associated supplementary discussion/reply) |summary |in this paper, we present the fracture-compliance method, a technique for estimating the closure pressure from diagnostic fracture-injection tests (dfits)  the method is based on the observation that fractures retain a finite aperture after asperities come into contact (mechanical closure)  an empirical, nonlinear joint-closure law is used to relate the after-closure fracture aperture and stiffness (the reciprocal of compliance) to effective normal stress  fracture closure increases fracture stiffness, which, in low-permeability formations, causes an increase in the pressure derivative  on the basis of these insights, we propose the fracture-compliance method, which consists of picking closure at the first point of deviation from linearity on a plot of pressure or g<u+00d7>dp/dg vs  g-time (after the end of the very-early-time transient associated with wellbore and near-wellbore friction and fracture tip-extension)  the contribution of this paper is to provide theoretical justification for why closure is best picked with the fracture-compliance method, and not with other widely used methods  we provide a series of numerical dfit simulations to demonstrate the sensitivity of the pressure transient to input parameters  governing equations are derived and used to demonstrate the effect of changing fracture aperture after closure  a field dfit data set is analyzed with the new method  finally, a field example is presented in which downhole tiltmeter measurements provide an independent estimate of the minimum principal stress | 
179728-pa 	 parallel-simulator framework for multipermeability modeling with discrete fractures for unconventional and tight gas reservoirs |summary |economic gas rate from ultralow-permeability shale reservoirs requires the creation of a complex fracture network in a large volume known as the stimulated reservoir volume (srv)  the fracture network connects a large surface area of the reservoir to the well  it is created by injecting low-viscosity fracturing fluid (slickwater) at very high rates in multiple stages along the horizontal wellbore  numerical simulation is used to evaluate the stimulation designs and completion strategy  microseismic (ms) -survey fracture mapping can provide a measurement of the overall srv and an estimate of the fracture patterns  special core analyses provide estimates of shale-matrix permeability  the extent of the fracture network indicates that there is insufficient proppant volume, and many stimulated fractures may be only partially propped or may be unpropped  thus, fracture conductivity will vary spatially caused by uneven proppant distribution and temporally caused by stress sensitivity upon pressure decline during production  because of the vast contrast in conductivity between stimulated/hydraulic fractures (darcy-ft) and shale matrix (nd-ft), the transient response in matrix/fracture flow cannot be captured accurately if the stimulated fractures are approximated with large dual-continuum (dc) gridblocks  the gridding requirement to achieve an accurate solution in fractured shale reservoirs is investigated and discussed  in this work, the stimulated and hydraulic fractures are discretized explicitly to form a discrete fracture network (dfn)  |this paper discusses the mathematical framework and parallel numerical methods for simulating unconventional reservoirs  the simulation methods incorporate known mechanisms and processes for shale, which include gas sorption in organic matter; combined knudsen diffusion and viscous flow in nanopores; stress-sensitive fracture permeability; and velocity-dependent flow in the high-conductivity hydraulic fractures  the simulation system is based on a general finite-volume method that includes a multiconnected multicontinuum (mc) representation of the pore system with either a compositional or a black-oil fluid description  the mc model is used to represent the storage and intercommunication among the various porosities in shale (organic matter, inorganic matter, fine unstimulated natural fractures)  unconventional simulation involves many more nonlinearities, and the extreme contrast in permeabilities will make the problems harder to solve  we discuss numerical implementation of the methods for modeling the mechanisms and processes in fractured shale  in addition, we discuss the mc formulation, the discretization method, the unstructured parallel domain-decomposition method, and the solution method for the simulation system  finally, we explain our efforts in numerical validation of the system with fine-grid single-porosity simulation  we show numerical examples to demonstrate the applications of the simulator and to study the transient flow behavior in shale reservoirs  the effects of the various mechanisms for gas production are also evaluated | 
179731-pa 	 effect of capillary condensation on gas transport in shale: a pore-scale model study |summary |the condensation of the gas inside nanopores at pressures lower than the dewpoint pressure, or capillary condensation, is an important physical phenomenon affecting the gas flow/transport process in shale  this work investigates the underlying transport mechanism and governing factors for the gas transport at a pore scale associated with capillary condensation  we numerically simulate and compare the gas-transport process within pores for two cases, with and without capillary condensation, while knudsen diffusion, wall slippage, and phase transition are included in the numerical model  in each case, the simulations are performed for two pore geometries corresponding to a single pore and two parallel-connected pores  the main objective is to determine whether capillary condensation blocks or enhances gas transport during production  the results show that the presence of the liquid phase in the pore throat initially enhances the gas flow rate to the outlet of the pore, but significantly reduces it later  this blockage depends on pore geometry and the properties of the oil and gas phases  the relatively low mobility of the condensed liquid in the pore throat is the main factor that reduces the mass transport along the pore  the reduction of overall mass transport in a single pore is more significant than that for the parallel pore geometry  implications of this work for predicting large-scale gas transport in shale are also discussed | 
179733-pa 	 optimization of lattice boltzmann simulation with graphics-processing-unit parallel computing and the application in reservoir characterization |summary |shale permeability is sufficiently low to require an unconventional scale of stimulation treatments, such as very-large-volume, high-rate, multistage hydraulic-fracturing applications  upscaling of hydrocarbon transport processes in shales is challenging because of the low permeability and strong heterogeneity  rock characterization with high-resolution imaging [x-ray tomography and scanning electron microscope (sem)] is usually highly localized and contains significant uncertainties because of the small field of view  therefore, an effective high-performance computing method is required to collect information over a larger scale to meet the ergodicity requirement in upscaling  the lattice boltzmann (lb) method has received significant attention in computational fluid dynamics because of its capability in coping with complicated boundary conditions  a combination of high-resolution imaging and lb simulation is a powerful approach for evaluating the transport properties of a porous medium in a timely manner, on the basis of the numerical solution of the navier-stokes equations and darcy’s law  in this work, a graphics-processing-unit (gpu) -enhanced lattice boltzmann simulator (gelbs) was developed, which was optimized by gpu parallel computing on the basis of the inherent parallelism of the lb method  specifically, the lb method was used to implement the computational kernel; a sparse data structure was applied to optimize memory allocation; the occa (medina et al  2014) portability library was used, which enables the gelbs codes to use different application-programming interfaces (apis) including open computing language (opencl), compute unified device architecture (cuda), and open multiprocessing (openmp)  opencl is an open standard for cross-platform parallel computing, cuda is supported only by nvidia devices, and openmp is primarily used on central processing units (cpus)  it was found that the gpu-accelerated code was approximately 1,000 times faster than the unoptimized serial code and 10 times faster than the parallel code run on a standalone cpu  the cuda code was slightly faster than opencl code on the nvida gpu because of the extra cost of opencl used to adapt to a heterogeneous platform  the gelbs was validated by comparing it with analytical solutions, laboratory measurements, and other independent numerical simulators in previous studies, and it was proved to have a second-order global accuracy  the gelbs was then used to analyze thin cuttings extracted from a sandstone reservoir and a shale-gas reservoir  the sandstone permeabilities were found relatively isotropic, whereas the shale permeabilities were strongly anisotropic because of the horizontal lamination structure  in shale cuttings, the average permeability in the horizontal direction was higher than that in the vertical direction by approximately two orders of magnitude  correlations between porosity and permeability were observed in both rocks  the combination of gelbs and high-resolution imaging methods makes for a powerful tool for permeability evaluation when conventional laboratory measurement is impossible because of small cuttings sizes  the constitutive correlations between geometry and transport properties can be used for upscaling in different rock types  the gpu-optimized code significantly accelerates the computing speed; thus, many more samples can be analyzed given the same processing time  consequently, the ergodicity requirement is met, which leads to a better reservoir characterization | 
179735-pa 	 a model for evaluating the commerciality of an unconventional factory development outside of north america |summary |the north american shale oil and gas “revolution” relies on four pillars not guaranteed elsewhere: knowledge of the subsurface, a strong oil- and gas-services industry in an open and competitive market, favorable mining rights, and a long oil and gas culture backed by political support  these pillars enabled massive “factory development” on the basis of drilling and fracturing a large number of inexpensive wells  |to evaluate the commerciality of a play outside north america and identify its most influential factors, a fit-for-purpose model was developed  it simulates the development of a core area and takes into account technical and economic parameters  an algorithm calculates the drilling and completion (i e , fracturing) schedule required to reach and maintain a constrained production plateau determined by the capacity of the export pipe  the initial number of drilling rigs and the time required to mobilize them are important factors differentiating the us from other parts of the world where rig availability can be less evident  wells are drilled in pads, and production is treated at the pad level by use of average decline curves  the model also includes drilling and completion learning curves  |pretax net present value (npv) and internal rate of return (irr) are calculated on the basis of oil and gas prices, development capital expenditures (capex), which are a fine breakdown between drilling, completion, and tie-in costs, and operating expenditures (opex), which are fixed and variable  the appraisal phase and central-processing facilities (cpf) are also included  curves of irr vs  integrated well cost are computed for several values of well estimated ultimate recovery (eur) and indicate for a given oil or gas price the maximum well cost compatible with a desired level of profitability  |a number of interesting conclusions can be drawn from the model  one is the resilience of the production of a field against investment slowdown  a large portfolio of wells does not behave like a single well  instead, it acts as a “shock absorber” limiting global decline even with reduced drilling and fracturing activities  another source of resilience is the fact that once the capex are paid, the opex are comparatively small, allowing for lower break-even costs  the model also highlights the key role of all consumable costs (casings, mud and cement, completion costs, fracturing fluids, and proppant), which suggests a simplification of the well design, a standardization of equipment, and the negotiation of large supply contracts to obtain wholesale prices  by contrast, drilling time appears as a secondary parameter, a consequence of the relatively low daily rates of the rigs used to develop unconventional plays  finally, a comparison is made between the development of a derisked sweet area with an expensive appraisal phase and the development of the entire area  economically speaking, focusing development on a sweet area appears as a high-risk/high-reward approach very similar to a conventional strategy | 
179867-ms 	 time-resolved fluorescence for real-time monitoring of both scale and corrosion inhibitors: a game-changing technique |abstract   inhibitor products have been widely used to reduce both steel corrosion and scale deposition on pipelines, tubings and safety valves in critical offshore sites  their simultaneous injection with brine has gradually increased the lifetime of production wells with incontestable benefits for the oil and gas industry  however, the large use of such additives has not been followed by the development of any efficient technique of dosage that considers the strict requirements of an offshore platform    in this paper, we describe a novel method of chemical dosage that takes into account all the on-site technical and practical parameters, such as the quantification thresholds or molecule specificity, the real-time monitoring, the resistance and compactness of measurement device and a user-friendly interface of measurement  current techniques of inhibitor monitoring that use elemental analysis (icp, ms, …) for sub-ppm quantifications appear too complex for a successful long-term on-site industrial exploitation due to the bulky dimensions of apparatus and the delay and complexity of analysis    a long-term collaboration between university of lyon and total ep has defined a simple and accurate method for inhibitor monitoring based on the use of lanthanide tracers and the time-resolved fluorescence (trf) technique  we exploited the fact that inhibitor chemicals (i) are good chelators for lanthanide ions and (ii) amplify the luminescence signal of rare-earths  in this way we are able to collect the photon emission signal by trf apparatus and dosing the inhibitors  the portability of the trf device as well as the sensitivity of detection have been engineered in order to obtain a sub-ppm quantification threshold via 1-click task  several carboxylates, phosphonates and sulphonates additives diluted in brine solutions has been easily measured out even in presence of residual oil  more than 20 commercial inhibitor solution samples were quickly prepared and dosed with an impressive linearity of response (r2 test > 0 996) in the 10 – 100 ppm range  any further extension of range has been possible  in addition, we were able to quantify two inhibitors (scale – scale, scale – corrosion) in the same brine water  this technique certainly opens a new conception of smart chemicals management in oil and gas production for (i) a dramatic minimization of the injected compounds (ii) a reducing delay in pipelines monitoring, and (iii) a shut down of expenses of pipeline maintenance | 
179952-ms 	 geologic and dynamic indicators offering a reliable technology paradigm to reserve and resource estimation in unconventional oil plays |reserve and resource estimates and classification are meant to provide reasoned production expectations considering uncertainties and development risks  in conventional fields several estimation methods (volumetric, material balance, analogy, and production trends) can work in tandem in order to provide these reasoned estimates which relate to static and dynamic characterization  despite intensive efforts to utilize all available data, these estimates could be still inaccurate, but have served our industry well in making business decisions  |with the introduction of the unconventional resources, this process requires re-examination and realignment to development priorities, risks, uncertainties and of course production drive mechanics  the early approach in recoverable volume estimation was based heavily on production trends and a statistical appraisal of observed variations with limited relation to production mechanisms and reservoir characteristics  key work in many disciplines has shown that although production performance does not follow the same static and dynamic trends as in conventional reservoirs, it relates to certain static and dynamic subsurface characteristics particularly to natural fractures  faults, fairway and background fractures become more important in liquid rich and oil plays (as fluids segregate) and invariably affect the process of hydraulic fracturing and the development of drainage patterns  since natural fracture network characteristics may change rapidly even across the length of a horizontal well, it is difficult to expect a homogenous performance without the understanding of the natural fracture trends, reservoir characteristics and the change in the respective drive mechanisms  most commonly used reserve and resource classification methods rely on proximity to existing production  due to these effects, the expectation of similar performance in infill locations could be diminished  apart from being an inaccurate prediction, this misconception may lead to the wrong development path in which wells classified as highest ranking may exhibit low performance  in the context of these observations it would be rational to draw fairway maps in relation to key geologic characteristics and dynamic effects utilizing all available information within and around the project area and to provide a basis for analogy which conforms better to the actual production drive mechanisms  in other words, using a physics based reliable technology (fairway maps) we are able to establish undeveloped areas with similar producibility at greater distances than production offset locations with reasonable certainty  testing the validity of fairway maps with continuous development provides more confidence in predicting offset locations; classifying reserves and resources appropriately and guiding development towards better results  this process provides close alignment between development priorities and certainty levels in reserve and resource estimates which fulfills the basic requirements for rational project management  subsequent application of fairway maps in other areas and similar plays may someday become a more general reliable technology paradigm for addressing unconventional resource assessment | 
179967-ms 	 what factors control shale gas production decline trend: a comprehensive analysis and investigation |one of the biggest practical problems with the optimization of shale gas stimulation design is estimating post-fracture production rate, production decline, and ultimate recovery  without a realistic prediction of the production decline trend resulting from a given completion and reservoir properties, it is impossible to evaluate the economic viability of producing natural gas from shale plays  |traditionally, decline curve analysis (dca) is commonly used to predict gas production and its decline trend to determine the estimated ultimate recovery (eur), but its analysis cannot be used to analyze what factors influence the production decline trend due to lack of underlying support of physics, which make it difficult to guide completion designs or optimize field development  |in this article, we presented a unified shale gas reservoir model, which incorporates real gas transport, nano-flow mechanisms and geomechanics into fractured shale system  this model is used to predict shale gas production under different reservoir scenarios and investigate what factors control its decline trend  the results and analysis presented in the article provide us a better understanding of gas production and decline mechanisms in a shale gas well with certain conditions of the reservoir characteristics  more in-depth knowledge regarding the effects of factors controlling the behavior of the gas production can help us develop more reliable models to forecast shale gas decline trend and ultimate recovery  this article also reveals that some commonly hold beliefs may sound reasonable to infer production decline trend, but may not be true in a coupled reservoir system in reality |

180017-ms 	 innovative concepts in wireline continuous coring |abstract   coring in unconventional reservoirs with typical unconsolidated formations has introduced additional challenges requiring more innovative concepts to be developed  these requirements, economic issues of unconventional reservoirs, and also issues of conventional coring particularly in regard to excessive trip times incurred have recently led to widespread attention to wireline continuous coring (wcc) modified from mining industry to petroleum industry applications  this coring method has contributed to coring deep formations, long core sections, multiple zones, jam prone formations, exploration zones or areas with unknown core points  currently, wcc is suffering from several drawbacks while some recent attempts have been made to remove them  in this accordance, this work is missioned to remove some existing defects by adding some innovative concepts to be applied to the ordinary wcc  therefore, a more efficient continuous coring method is aimed which includes enhanced coring key performance indicators    therefore, several identified challenges of wcc are considered to be removed or alleviated by innovative concepts to be added  the challenges consist of un-flushed inner tube while run in hole, limited retrievable core size, in-situ/pressure coring hazards (i e  safety issues, complex sealing, etc ), slick line issues (rig time, torque, rupture, etc ), untimely and inefficient decision making while coring/drilling, non-optimized coring/drilling and tripping induced core damage in wcc    in order to address these issues, as novelty measures, first an inner tube flushing system is proposed for flushing inner tubes prior to commencing coring  second, casing drilling coring is recommended in order to obtain larger core sizes contributing to improved core analysis  third, in-situ downhole measurement and sampling systems are proposed to measure properties of in-situ fluids in order to complete or replace pressure/in-situ coring systems and ensure safety  fourth, an innovative mode conversion system is proposed to mitigate slick line issues  fifth, a less complex logging while coring system has also been proposed in special cases to enhance and expedite real time decision making process in regard to proceeding to core cutting or not  sixth, an innovative mode conversion system contributing to partial elimination of wireline jobs will also be proposed to substitute slick line/ wireline retrievals  seventh, optimum tripping schedules have been characterized as crucial to match formation rock and fluid properties and type of wcc applied and also to prevent coring induced damage | 
180041-ms 	 innovation of annular sealants during the past decades and their direct relationship with on/offshore wellbore economics |abstract   annular sealants are used as static barriers to avoid fluid communication in-between zones and provide proper isolation of the different formations as well as support and protection to the casing  therefore, the sealant can have a direct relationship to wellbore integrity  data suggest more than 4 million hydrocarbon wells have been drilled globally; interestingly, some datasets indicate well integrity failure is highly variable (1 9 to 75%)    historically, sealants have been characterized for short-term placement properties up to the point at which the sealant is pressure tested and a log is performed to establish if the annulus is properly sealed  however, as hydrocarbon resources are becoming gradually depleted in easy-to-recover environments, harsher conditions are more common  additionally, stimulation and enhanced oil recovery (eor) techniques involving high-pressure and high-temperature (hp/ht) cycles during the entire well life pose significant challenges to the sealant's integrity    sealant integrity issues can result in very high remediation costs, reduction of hydrocarbon production, and in some cases, loss of the well  all of these can lead to an increased cost per barrel of oil equivalent (boe)  during the last few decades, in view of the drastic changes in drilling conditions toward more challenging environments, the industry has opted for a sealant design approach, which considers all of the events that occur throughout the entire life of the well and their effects on integrity of the sealant and wellbore  this approach can be successful by employing analytical tools, which allow for synchronizing all of the different events and/or operations occurring during wellbore construction (from drilling to abandonment) with the different elements that encompass the wellbore architecture (geometry, formations, casing, and sealant)  the use of these tools' forecasting capabilities can result in data-led decisions that allow operators to construct wellbores more efficiently and with more confidence, which should ultimately help reduce production costs    this study focuses on illustrating an analytical tool for predicting the sealant's performance in both onshore and offshore cases throughout the life of the well and determining how this affects wellbore economics in the long term  moreover, this paper discusses how sealants have evolved from conventional portland cements to elastic-, foamed-, glass-bead-extended cements, and epoxy-resins based on wellbore integrity predictions performed by analytical tools  the impact of nanomaterials in converting cement/sealant systems into multifunctional and/or smart materials capable of self-sensing specific stimuli (i e  stress, strain, etc ) is also shown |

180067-ms 	 adopting seismic methodologies to acoustic logging applications |abstract   if we are to continue to use acoustic logging as a viable method for characterizing near-wellbore formation characteristics and as a valid method of tying depth-to-time, then logging techniques should be updated and adapted for use with today's tools and in today's unconventional and directional drilling applications  unlike seismic processes, which have undergone research and changes to adapt to the more complex characterization needs of today's formations, acoustic logging techniques have stayed relatively stagnant  in order to stay relevant, acoustic logging processes must demonstrate that they are adapatable to the current environment of lower margins and complex formations  the following discussion focuses on four seismic techniques adapted for acoustic logging processes, the process for choosing these particular techniques to adapt, and the results achieved    the two questions which set us on this journey were: 1) how do we make better use of the acoustic data currently collected? and 2) how do we provide more robust formation characteristic information from that data? in order to answer these questions, we developed new acoustic logging algorithms and routines inspired by the following four seismic techniques and adapted the research into proprietary software for processing raw, acoustic waveform data  first, we have adapted the use of compressional waves to map drops in energy across natural fractures which allows industry to move away from many of the limitations imposed by more widely used techniques  second, as part of the workflow presented in the compressional fracture identification methodology, we have adapted stacking to improve results and amplify anomalies  third, in order to provide a broad available toolsets and usable data, we have incorporated advanced filtering routines based on predictive deconvolution, which can be used to process acoustic data from alternative tools or to enhance data collected using measurement-while- drilling or logging-while-drilling tools  fourth and last, applicable to both shear and compressional waveform processing, we have chosen to move away from alford-based azimuth computations, or at least correct for assumptions in alford-based azimuth computations that are not relevant in unconventionals, so that borehole deviation does not adversely affect the processing    the use of compressional waves to map natural fracture patterns has found great success in both vertical and lateral wells and has been used in the field in the permian, eagle ford, the bakken, and in various international fields  comparisons against image and core results demonstrate an 80-85% correlation rate  the following discussion will go over two case studies, the evaluation method used to study the correlation, briefly discuss the workflow used, and also provide an example of how theadvanced filtering produces much cleaner waveforms for processing than relying solely on frequency filtered waveforms    these new processes allow acoustic processing to enter the modern age of exploration and create a new, more direct process for finding the fracture density in the well bore  furthermore, they may be incorporated in to new and old processing techniques, making the most of the modern tools available | 
180071-ms 	 experimental investigation of cryogenic fracturing of rock specimens under true triaxial confining stresses |abstract   we have performed a laboratory study of cryogenic fracturing for improving oil/gas recovery from low-permeability shale and tight reservoirs  our objective is to develop well stimulation techniques using cryogenic fluids, e g  liquid nitrogen (ln) to increase permeability in a large reservoir volume surrounding wells  the new technology has the potential to reduce formation damage created by current stimulation methods as well as minimize or eliminate water usage and groundwater contamination    the concept of cryogenic fracturing is that sharp thermal gradient (thermal shock) created at the rock surface by applying cryogenic fluid can cause strong local tensile stress and initiate fractures  we developed a laboratory system for cryogenic fracturing under true triaxial loading, with a liquid nitrogen delivery/control and measurement system  the loading system simulates confining stresses by independently loading each axis up to about 5000 psi on 8"<u+00d7>8"<u+00d7>8" cubes  both temperature in boreholes and block surfaces and fluid pressure in boreholes were continuously monitored  acoustic and pressure-decay measurements are obtained before and at various stages of stimulations  cubic blocks (8"<u+00d7>8"<u+00d7>8") of niobrara shale, concrete, and sandstones have been tested, and stress levels and anisotropies are varied  three schemes are considered: gas fracturing without cryo-stimulation, gas fracturing after low-pressure cryogen flow-through, gas fracturing after high-pressure flow-through    pressure decay results show that liquid nitrogen stimulation clearly increases permeability, and repeated stimulations further increase the permeability  acoustic velocities and amplitudes decreased significantly following cryo-stimulation indicating fracture creation  in the gas fracturing without the stimulation, breakdown (complete fracturing) occurs suddenly without any initial leaking, and major fracture planes form along the plane containing principal stress and intermediate stress directions as expected theoretically  however, in the gas fracturing after cryogenic stimulations, breakdown occurred gradually and with massive leaking due to thermal fractures created during stimulation  in addition, the major fracture direction does not necessarily follow the plane containing principal stress direction, esp  at low confining stress levels  in tests, we have observed that cryogenic stimulation seems to disrupt the internal stress field  the increase of borehole temperature after stimulation affects the permeability of the specimen  while a stimulated specimen is still cold, it keeps high permeability because fractures remain open and local thermal tension is maintained near the borehole  when the rock becomes warm again, fractures close and permeability decreases  in these tests, we have not used proppants  overall, fractures are clearly generated by low and high-pressure thermal shocks  the added pressure of the high-pressure thermal shocks helps to further propagate cryogenic fractures generated by thermal shock  breakdown pressure is significantly lowered by ln stimulation with breakdown pressure reductions up to about 40% observed | 
180072-ms 	 a new non-darcy flow model for low velocity multiphase flow in tight reservoirs |abstract   this paper is to present a new non-linear flow model for low-velocity multiphase flow in tight petroleum reservoirs as well as its analytical and numerical solutions  the pore and pore-throat sizes of shale and tight-rock formations are on the order of tens of nanometers  the fluid flow in such small pores is significantly affected by walls of pores and pore-throats  this boundary-layer effect on fluid flow in tight rocks has been investigated through laboratory work  in analogue to flow through capillary tubes, it is found that the ratio of the thickness of boundary layer over the size of capillary tube is a function of pressure gradient; and the non-linear relationship between flow rate and pressure gradient is pronounced under the drive of small pressure gradient or low flow velocity  it is also observed that low permeability is associated with large boundary layer effect on fluid flow  based on the studies of single-phase and multiphase flow though capillary tubes, the new non-darcy flow model is proposed for describing multiphase flow in tight rock    the experimental results from a single capillary tube are extended to a bundle of tubes and finally to porous media of tight formations  a physics-based, non-darcy low-velocity flow equation is derived to account for the boundary layer effect of tight reservoirs by adding a non-darcy coefficient term, which is function of dimensionless thickness of boundary layer and pressure gradient  this non-darcy equation describes the fluid flow more accurately for tight oil reservoir with low production rate and low pressure gradient as compared to laboratory observation    both analytical and numerical solutions are obtained for the new non-darcy flow model  first, a buckley-leverett type analytical solution is derived including gravity effect with this non-darcy flow equation  then, a numerical model has been developed for implementing this non-darcy flow model for accurate simulation of multi-dimensional porous and fractured tight oil reservoirs  the sensitivity studies based on numerical simulations demonstrate the non-negligible effect of boundary layer on fluid flow in tight formations using an actual field example  eventually, the experiment-based non-darcy flow model could improve the forecast accuracy for long-term production rate and recovery factors of tight oil reservoirs    a new, physics-based low-velocity non-darcy flow model is developed for description of single-phase and multiphase flow in tight reservoirs  in addition, both analytical and numerical solutions are provided for application of the new non-darcy flow model for field studies  the results and knowledge obtained in this study may be applicable to both oil and gas flow in unconventional reservoirs | 
180073-ms 	 well integrity estimation of salt cements with application to long term underground storage systems |abstract   the new quest for unconventional resources as well as underground storage sector (co2, air and natural gas) is the achievement of well integrity which is highlighted by the inadequacy of conventional cementing procedures to provide zonal isolation  knowledge of the mechanism of fatigue in cement and factors that affect it such as the magnitude of the load, strength and composition of the cement, mechanical properties of the cement and pattern of load cycles are important to achieve a realistic design of a cement system subjected to fatigue loading  finite element investigations help engineers to assess the stress magnitude and evolution for a given well configuration, but when structural calculations for casing-cement system are required, missing input parameters reduce the quality of the results    in order to obtain reliable data, extensive experimental work using class g cement with and without salt addition has been performed in order to measure the principal parameters for mechanical structural calculations: compressive and tensile strength, young modulus, poison ratio  the data was measured under room conditions and elevated temperature and pressure  the results were also extrapolated for a time period beyond 60 days  the obtained data is also compared with published values  several spe papers showed that excellent data inventory for well cement is needed when mechanical studies on cement, like finite element studies, are required    this paper will focus on various cement properties required to succsesfull cement an underground storage well by showing the effects of salt concentration on class g cements used as a reference  the results will help fill gaps in the knowledge about the behavior and reliability of nacl salt cement slurry in cementing jobs by providing extensive data to perform mechanical and rheological calculations  it will similarly aid in the optimization of cement design and represents a source of input data for numerical simulations of well cement performance    we were able to establish/prove a relationship between salt content and permeability and, moreover, to show that fresh water in contact with set cement may massively change the porosity of the cement  for the first time, public reliable cement properties are systematically collated and compared | 
180075-ms 	 unconventional plays, various lithologies - constant stress gradients |abstract   three onshore basins (called henceforth a, b, and c) in eastern australia are discussed in this paper with the focus on geomechanics  basin a is a coal seam gas play with a few thousand wells already drilled, and reservoir layers in the depth range of 300 to 1000 m, inter-bedded with impermeable clastics  stress determination has been a key challenge as initial minifrac interpretations showed significant scatter in stress and pore pressure results  but with more consistent processing and interpretation constant effective stress ratios could be defined over large areas and depth sections  this helped also in interpreting microseismic data related to hydraulic fracturing – essential for economic production in areas of lower coal permeability - as reactivation of existing natural fractures seems to take place during injection  basins b and c with tight formations as reservoir targets, in depths of about 4000 to 4600 m show overpressures that are difficult to directly measure and could only be constrained to lower values than mini frac test interpretations, after iteratively calibrating the geomechanical model and considering drilling data  this allowed a better understanding of thermal effects on progressing shear failure in openhole sections, due to increasing drilling mud fluids temperature with time; an effect that has to be considered in defining safe mud windows for drilling and operations phases  although gradually a better understanding has been achieved, above unconventional fields still pose challenges, and current results will have to be considered as work in progress and not final  the key outcome of the geomechanics studies to date is: that a strike-slip stress regime applies, regionally and vertically; several depth intervals show constant effective stress ratios for both horizontal stresses, with some changes depending on location, and probably due to the structural differences | 
180076-ms 	 volume effects on methane-shale adsorption under reservoir conditions |abstract   due to the low porosity of a shale reservoir, the amount of stored free gas is limited  the pore volume of shale is majorly composed of micropores and mesopores, which are perfect storage spaces for sorbed gas  as a result, a shale gas reservoir contains a significant amount of sorbed gas through physical adsorption  the adsorption behavior of shale is usually analogue to coal, although the average diameters of nanopores and compositions of shale are different from those of coal  many adsorption models of shale and coal have been proposed in previous studies  no matter which model is chosen to describe an isothermal adsorption, the absolute adsorption is derived from the measured excess adsorption data  the basic calculation theory of absolute adsorption assumes that volume changes are only caused by adsorption  however, volume changes are also caused by adsorbent swelling or shrinkage, gas absorption into organic matter, and helium adsorption  in this work, a modified adsorption model is introduced to account for the unexpected volume effects and accurately calculate absolute adsorption    the proposed model is based on the dubinin-astakhov (da) model (pore-filling theory), since it is more suitable to describe the gas adsorption behavior in nanopores than the langmuir model that mainly describes the monolayer adsorption on homogeneous surfaces  methane is a supercritical fluid under a high pressure and temperate reservoir condition  as a result, the pressure terms in the da model are replaced by the density to overcome the problem of the determination of saturation pressure  the volume change term is additionally added to the adsorption equation to account for the effect of volume changes  six groups of shale adsorption data are applied to validate the proposed model and analyze the volume effects    the proposed model shows better fitting results than the traditional da model  especially, the proposed model captures abnormal adsorption behavior under the extreme high pressure and high temperature conditions  the previous reported adsorbent swelling or shrinkage and gas absorption into organic matter are illustrated and explained by the calculated volume change terms  the adsorption capacity and other fitted parameters estimated by the proposed model are more reasonable and accurate than those predicted by the da model  this study highlights the effect of volume changes on absolute adsorption calculation, and provides an extensive insight on shale gas adsorption behaviors under reservoir conditions | 
180112-ms 	 coupling of darcy's equation with molecular transport and its application to upscaling kerogen permeability |abstract   quantification of gas transport in organic rich shale is important in determining natural gas production rates  however, laboratory measurements are challenging due to very tight nature of the rock, and have large uncertainties due to presence of multiple mechanisms of gas transport at multiple pore scales  in this paper, the emphasis is on the understanding of transport inside organic material known as kerogen and prediction of its permeability    we performed nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations of steady-state methane flow in single-wall carbon nanotube based on a moving piston model (riewchotisakul and akkutlu, 2015)  the piston model allows us to observe transition from convection to molecular (pore) diffusion under the reservoir conditions and to understand the effects of adsorbed methane molecules on the overall transport in the tube  the results show that the adsorbed molecules are not only mobile but also contribute a significant portion to the total mass flux  simulations with different sizes of capillaries show that the contribution is profound in capillaries with diameter less than 10nm  the adsorbed-phase transport velocity is independent of capillary size, but strongly dependent on pressure drop across the capillary  this allowed us to formulate the transport as an additional diffusion mechanism by the capillary walls using a modified hagen-poiseuille equation and predict the transport enhancement    in the second part of the paper, we considered steady-state transport across a pore-network of inter-connected nano-capillaries  the preliminary simulation results show that the modified hagen-poiseuille equation leads to representative elementary volume of a model kerogen  the estimated permeability of the volume is sensitive to surface properties of the nanocapillary walls indicating that fluid-wall interactions driven by molecular forces could be significant during the large-scale transport within kerogen  a modified kozeny-carmen correlation is proposed | 
180113-ms 	 the impact of rock properties on acid jetting in carbonate rocks: an experimental study |abstract   acid jetting, as a well stimulation method for carbonate reservoirs, has shown optimistic results in the production enhancement of some extended reach horizontal wells  it was used initially to promote damage removal along a wellbore via multiple strategically-located injection nozzles  it has the potential to place the injecting fluid at the locations that need stimulation  jetting may also enhance wormhole propagation compared with conventional matrix acidizing  these hypotheses are currently being investigated to improve the design for more efficient stimulation treatments    we have conducted an experimental study to investigate the effect of jetting on wormhole efficiency  the jetting experiments are conducted at a constant pressure with linear core-flood tests, where a stand-off distance is maintained between the injection nozzle tip and the core  at low-velocity acid injection, jetting effectively removes mud filter-cake by mechanical actions  jetting also creates wormholes in carbonate cores  the combination of mechanical and chemical reactions stimulates carbonate rocks better than matrix acidizing without the jetting nozzle  when the jetting velocity increases, the dissolution pattern changes  an isolated locally compact dissolution results in a cavity at the entries of core samples by jetting, followed by a wormhole structure  with the known dissolution pattern, sensitivity studies are carried out to investigate the effect of various parameters on the experimental outcome    we used indiana and winterset limestone rocks in the experiments  15% hcl (by weight) at ambient temperature was used and the core dimensions were 4 inches in diameter and 16 inches in length  various combinations of acid jetting velocities and acid fluxes were considered  the winterset limestone cores are more heterogeneous, with higher porosity and lower permeability than the indiana limestone cores  from the experimental results, the results of acid jetting from the two different rock samples are compared    the experimental results indicate that acid jetting follows the same trend as matrix acidizing regarding wormhole propagation once cavities are created  jetting velocity and acid flux are the critical parameters in jetting design for optimal stimulation results  acid jetting tends to create different dissolution patterns for indiana limestone and winterset limestone cores  the observations from this work highlight the importance of understanding the dynamic chemical process of jetting in the design of successful acid stimulation jobs | 
180126-ms 	 gas flow transport in shale matrix: simultaneous effects of stress and slippage on matrix permeability |abstract   gas flow modelling in shale and tight gas reservoirs is still challenging mainly due to different pore-scale flow regimes present in micro- and nano-pores of these reservoirs  the effect of geomechanical stress also significantly affect the measurement and prediction of apparent matrix permeability  in this study, series of experiments were designed and performed on three shale samples to study the simultaneous effects of slippage and stress at five different pore pressures and four net stresses  the experimental data were used to obtain a general slip plot, which quantifies the effect of slippage on matrix permeability  then, the stress effect was taken into account by modifying the average pore size and non-slip permeability at each net stress based on the experimental observations  it is found that the matrix non-slip permeability and average pore size follow an exponential behaviour when changing the net stress  these two relationships are then proposed to be incorporated into the corresponding slip flow model in order to capture the effects of slippage and stress at the same time  the validity of the proposed model was also investigated (using published data in the literature), which shows that the proposed technique is able to capture the intensity of permeability reduction and enhancement due to stress and slippage, respectively  the outcomes of this study increase our knowledge of rarefied flow dynamic inside micro- and nano-pores under confining stress, which is necessary for accurate predictions of the apparent matrix permeability in unconventional reservoirs | 
180132-ms 	 impact of thermal effect on the fracture plane and formation integrity during cold water injection |abstract   the extraction of petroleum and natural gas is an operation which results in the alteration of the subsurface stress distribution in geological formations  during cold water injection in these hot formations, the initial in situ stress magnitude and orientation is affected  these thermal effects have lead to a great deal, in both conventional and unconventional reservoir development    in this study fully coupled 3d mechanical earth model (mem) simulation employing finite element and finite difference analysis was conducted to:    study the poroelastic and thermal effects on fracture propagation and formation integrity    examine principle rock mechanics properties and its relation with thermal induced fracturing (tif)  |the analysis considers thermal flow, poroelasticity and thermoelasticity constitutive equations under isothermal and non-isothermal water flooding scenarios at different bottom hole injection pressures for a given time    the research focusing on mechanical responses at two different reservoir rocks types for two different stress regimes based on e  m  anderson's classification scheme  the widely used linear mohr-coulomb failure criterion is expressed in terms of principal effective stresses assuming non-zero cohesion, for the determination of potential fracture plane  we conduct a detailed sensitivity analysis and the results indicate that the thermal effect becomes clearly obvious in cases of stiff reservoir rocks    the reservoir rock was subjected initially in ideally triaxial conditions where normal stress regime was taking place  at late times of injection, the initial stress regime has been totally reversed (rf)  pore pressure increase causes pore extraction and tensile stress while the temperature (t) decrease create tensile load and thermal contraction to pore space  hence, thermal tensile stress is added to tensile load during pore pressure increase causing inadvertent thermal induced fracturing    comparing the sandstone and limestone geomechanical response with respect to maximum (s1)-minimum (s3) effective stresses (psi) during thermoelastic loading, it is clear that in stiff reservoir rocks (limestone) where young's modulus is large, cold water injection will lead to tensile or shear failure  this rock property combined with the thermal effect reflects to higher fracture deviation (fxz) from mohr-coulomb theoretical plane    we can conclude that thermally induced fracturing is typically observed when there is a wide differential between the reservoir temperature and the injected fluid  thermal induced fracturing during cold water injection differs from hydraulic fracturing for well stimulation  in tif, the propagation of the fracture is strongly dependent on the area of the cooled zone while in hydraulic fracturing the thermal effect is neglected  moreover, the principal mechanism for tif factures is the effect of thermally induced stress on fracture initiation pressure  thermal induced fracture is the result of superimposed poroelastic and thermoelastic stresses in space and time | 
180139-ms 	 analytical methods for single-phase oil flow: accounting for changing liquid and rock properties |abstract   many analytical methods are available and widely used in the industry to analyse single-phase flow in the reservoir  analytical modeling, flowing material balance, type curve analysis and various straight-line diagnostic plots are some of the examples    all these methods are based on the diffusivity equation  analytical solutions for the diffusivity equation with various boundary conditions are readily available only for the cases when the coefficients in this equation are constant    coefficients of the diffusivity equation are functions of fluid and rock properties (such as density, total compressibility, viscosity and permeability)  traditionally the approach was:    for single-phase liquid flow (oil or water): variation of liquid and rock properties with pressure is assumed to be negligible  under this assumption the diffusivity equation has constant coefficients and can be solved analytically    for singe-phase gas flow: use pseudo-pressure and pseudo-time formulations to account for the variations of gas and rock properties with pressure and to convert the diffusivity equation to a form that has constant coefficients  |this approach has worked well for conventional oil plays  however these days we are producing oils with higher gas content; on top of that, there are reservoirs with higher pressure drawdowns and geomechanical effects (rock compressibility and permeability vary with pressure)    the objective of this study is to demonstrate that the assumption of liquid and rock properties being ‘almost constant’ is no longer valid for the cases we face these days and to discuss possible ways to account for change in liquid and rock properties    for this study we used synthetic datasets (oil rates and flowing pressure), generated using a numerical multi-frac model based on realistic oil and rock properties for volatile oil in an unconventional reservoir  first, we used the traditional approach to analyse this dataset using linear straight-line analysis, flowing material balance analysis and analytical modeling  analysis results were significantly different from the correct ones (correct results are known since we used synthetic cases)    next, we modified all three analyses, to account for the fact that oil and rock properties vary with pressure  the modification is similar to what is traditionally done for gas cases (using pseudo-pressure and pseudo-time formulations)  we also applied an additional modification to account for changes in fluid properties when pressure drops below the bubble point (two-phase oil pseudo-pressure)    we observed that the traditional approach may give significantly wrong results (in a particular example the ooip estimated using flowing material balance was about 2 times larger than the actual ooip, and the estimated linear flow parameter xfvk was 30% higher than the actual xfvk)    for the cases where pressure remains above the bubble point, we observed that the suggested modification (using oil pseudo-pressure and pseudo-time) brings answers obtained from analyses very close to the actual ones    for the cases where the pressure drops below the bubble point, we observed that the suggested modification (using two-phase oil pseudo-pressure and pseudo-time) results in answers that are still not completely accurate  however, results obtained using the suggested modification are much closer to the actual answers, as compared to the traditional approach    using the suggested modifications generates more reliable results when applying analytical methods to the case of single-phase oil flow and significantly improves estimates when applying analytical methods to the case of two-phase flow (oil below the bubble point) | 
180140-ms 	 shale reserve forecasting - model consistency and uncertainty |abstract   three general categories of modeling are traditionally used to provide shale reserve forecasting – (1) decline curve analysis (dca), (2) rate-time analysis (rta), and (3) numerical model history matching (hm)  the focus of this paper is aligning each of the three modeling approaches to ensure maximum consistency in terms of fundamental reservoir description, including (but not limited to) initial fluid in place, reservoir rock properties, pvt, well completion factors, fracture area and conductivity, well controls, and definition of infinite-acting and boundary-dominated flow regimes  the hm model approach, though more rigorous, is time consuming and cannot be used for the hundreds of wells in a typical shale field  we recommend, as have others, that history-matched numerical models be used to help calibrate rta and dca models in a consistent manner for all wells    once a consistent model framework is achieved, reserve forecasting can be better understood by regulators, engineering and reserve teams within the operating company and their partners  furthermore, a consistent modeling framework can provide more reliable uncertainty analysis to establish probabilistic reserves estimates in terms of p90-p50-p10 values (1p-2p-3p)    modeling methods used in forecasting shale reserves are based on production data that includes rates and pressures  dca applies the boundary-dominated methods such as arps, where multiple time regions are used to capture infinite-acting and boundary-dominated flow  rta uses dimensionless pressure and rate solutions applicable to horizontal wells with multiple fractures, including superposition, pseudopressure and pseudotime  numerical models solve the complex set of differential equations describing multiphase fluid flow using a properly-selected grid refinement (e g  near fractures) and, in some cases, a dual porosity/dual permeability treatment of fracture-matrix interaction |

180197-ms 	 3d geomechanical modeling and fault reactivation risk analysis for a well at brage oilfield, norway |abstract   the objective is to investigate potential fault reactivation caused by high-volume injection into a north sea well to assess the risks associated with converting a production well into a water injection well  the well is located within the brage field less than 100 meters from a major fault and there is concern for fault reactivation due to high volume water injection near this fault    an integrated 3d geologic, fluid flow and geomechanical model was developed for the area of interest to evaluate fault reactivation risks  the 3d integrated models were constructed based on seismic horizon data and well logs  the 3d fluid flow model was calibrated and history matched using the pressure and temperature data from the current well and other adjacent wells  the developed 3d fluid and heat flow model was used to estimate pressure and temperature distributions adjacent to the fault after water injection in the target well  the results of the 3d fluid flow model were then imported into the 3d geomechanical model to predict the induced stresses and displacements near the injection zone and on the face of the fault    the results of the integrated geologic, fluid flow and geomechanical models indicate that the poro-elastic stresses induced by high volume injection into the proposed well are not sufficient to induce major slip on the nearby main fault, considering a wide range of reasonable physical and material property assumptions for the fault    the results of this study are used in specifying the maximum daily water injection rates in the proposed well without the fault reactivation concerns  with the proposed water injection rate, the sealing capacity of the major fault will be guaranteed and the injected water will be directed into the reservoir for pressurization and water flooding purposes | 
180207-ms 	 effects of hydraulic fractures on the treatment of condensate by huff-n-puff gas injection in eagle ford shale |abstract   with the production of a gas condensate tight reservoir, condensate in fracture can significantly decrease the productivity of gas condensate wells  previous work shows that the negative effect of condensate bank on gas production is more seriously in tighter reservoir  the implement of hydraulic fracture and multi-stages fracturing can mitigate the negative effects on the formation of condensate bank, but the effects cannot be completely removed  a huff-n-puff methane injection has been proven to be an effective method to reduce the effect of condensate by maintaining the reservoir pressure above the dew-point pressure and revaporizing the formed condensate  however, the previous work neglects the effect of hydraulic fractures on the treatment of condensate by gas injection    non-aqueous components are lumped into fourteen pseudo components  dual permeability, logarithmically spaced, locally refined grids are implemented to model natural and hydraulic fractures in a simulation model  the laboratory measured relative permeability taking account of condensate bank is used to accurately represent two-phase flow in a shale reservoir  furthermore, two different settings of cyclic schedule are implemented to test their advantages and disadvantages    the results show that the huff-n-puff dry gas injection can effectively improve gas and condensate recovery  a fracture conductivity has significant influences on well production during the injection, while during the primary recovery its impact is not that obvious  in addition, the huff-n-puff schedules also plays a crucial role in both gas and condensate recovery  our study highlights gas injection mitigates the effect of condensate bank on gas production in a shale reservoir, and provides an extensive insight on optimal design of huff-n-puff gas injection | 
180208-ms 	 effects of multicomponent adsorption on enhanced shale reservoir recovery by co2 injection coupled with reservoir geomechanics |abstract   shale gas reservoirs have a high total organic content (toc) and are composed of a lot of microspores, which result in a high content of adsorbed gas  laboratory and theoretical calculations show that the adsorption potential of co2 in shale is higher than that of ch4  in other words, the shales prefer adsorbing co2 to ch4  therefore, during co2 injection, the adsorbed ch4 is released by co2 adsorption, even in a high reservoir pressure  several models have been studied to describe the pure and multicomponent adsorption on shale  the langmuir and extended langmuir models are usually applied in reservoir simulators, because other models are more complex and not applicable to be coupled into a simulator  in this work, a simulation study is carried out to investigate the effects of gas adsorption on primary recovery and co2 enhanced recovery processes    dual permeability, logarithmically spaced, locally refined grids are implemented to model natural and hydraulic fractures and to capture the sensitive changes of multicomponent adsorption  reservoir pressure variation is coupled with a geomechanical module that updates porosity, permeability and fracture conductivity simultaneously at each time step  a multicomponent mixture on the basis of lab measured adsorption properties of the eagle ford shale are implemented into a reservoir simulator  both primary recovery and co2 huff-n-puff processes are investigated    the simulation results show multicomponent adsorption behaviors of extended langmuir model can slightly increase the well performance in the primary recovery  however, the adsorption behavior is more complex during co2 injection processes  this study highlights the effect of multicomponent adsorption on gas production during co2 cycling, and provides an optimal enhanced recovery strategy for shale gas reservoir | 
180209-ms 	 comparison of numerical vs analytical models for eur calculation and optimization in unconventional reservoirs |analytical models available in rate-transient-analysis (rta) packages are widely used as tools for history matching and forecasting production in unconventional resources  there has also been an increasing interest in the use of numerical simulation of unconventional reservoirs  in this study, we use both methods to history match the production of hydraulically fractured unconventional wells, followed by forecasting future production to establish a well's eur (estimated ultimate recovery) for reserves determination purposes  this study's goal is to quantify the differences one might expect to encounter in a well's eur when using analytical model-based rta vs numerical simulation-based workflows in unconventional reservoirs  |first, we consider an undersaturated shale oil reservoir as a base model for this study  the base case also satisfies all assumptions inherent to analytical solution-based methods such as homogenous reservoir properties and fully-penetrating planar fractures  an excellent match between results of both methods for the base model validates the numerical simulation approach  we then impose a series of real-world deviations from rta assumptions and investigate reliability of eur predictions made by both approaches  in all cases, historical data and reference eurs are derived from finely-gridded numerical simulations  |example results show that, in the presence of real-world deviations from rta assumptions, analytical models can still match the historical production data; however, key reservoir and fracture parameters need to be modified drastically to compensate for the lack of sufficient physics in the analytical models  results show that the analytical solution-based history-matched models are not predictive for future production, and somewhat surprisingly provide pessimistic eurs in all real-world scenarios investigated in this work  for the cases presented in this study, analytical models under-predict eurs by 6-17% when two years of production history is available for matching  the underestimation of eur increases drastically (up to 60%) as the length of available historical data decreases from 2 years to 3 months  |for all cases, we also apply an efficient numerical simulation-based workflow for probabilistic forecasting of eurs  this workflow provides multiple history-matched models that are constrained by historical production data  the probabilistic forecast method employed in this work provides p90 (conservative), p50 (most likely), and p10 (optimistic) values for eur  in all examples, the range of p90 to p10 eur values includes the reference eur, and the p50 values are within 2 2% of the reference eur | 
180213-ms 	 coupled geomechanics and fluid flow modeling in naturally fractured reservoirs |abstract   a parallel geomechanics model for describing naturally fractured rock deformation is developed and tightly coupled with a dual porosity/dual permeability black oil model  the geomechanics model is developed with capabilities of modeling both rock matrix and the fracture deformations, as well as their effects on reservoir properties  an advanced constitutive law with the fracture deformation mechanism is proposed  the multiphase flow model is modified by introducing geomechanical variables  the matrix porosity and fracture permeability are chosen as coupling parameters between geomechanics and fluid flow models  an iteratively coupling method is employed in order to fully capture interactions between solid and flow  moreover, parallel computing is employed to handle large scale problems by benefiting from its features of distributed memory storage and efficient runtime reduction  geomechanical effects on the reservoir pressure distribution are illustrated by a numerical experiment  in addition, for testing the scalability behavior, a large scale problem with millions of grid blocks is performed on multiple processors  the result shows an encouraging speedup which indicates the integrated model can be an efficient and useful tool for predicting and analyzing oil/gas production of naturally fractured reservoirs | 
180226-ms 	 experimental investigation on permeability and porosity hysteresis in low-permeability formations |summary   permeability and porosity decrease with increasing net stress in consolidated and unconsolidated porous media is a well-known phenomenon to petroleum and geomechanics engineers  conversely, permeability and porosity are observed to increase when net stress decreases, however typically follow a different path, this discrepancy is known as hysteresis  the trend of permeability and porosity hysteresis is a signature of porous medium that depends on several physical and mechanical properties    understanding permeability and porosity hysteresis plays a significant role in production strategies of hydrocarbon reservoirs  hysteresis effect on production strategies can be even more important in very low permeability reservoirs such as tight sandstone, tight carbonate, and shale formations  the reason is that the stress change associated with permeability and porosity hysteresis can affect adsorption/desorption and diffusion transport mechanisms which are among the main driving mechanisms in low or ultra-low permeability reservoirs    in this study, permeability and porosity hysteresis of nano, micro, and milli-darcy core samples are measured for a wide range of net stress and the results are correlated with pore structures observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (fe-sem) images  the nano and micro-darcy core samples are from the niobrara, bakken, three forks, and eagle ford formations  the milli-darcy core samples are from middle east carbonate, indiana limestone, and torrey buff sandstone formations  bakken, three forks, and middle east carbonate are core samples from oil producing reservoirs, whereas others are from outcrop  our experimental observations show that: (a) compared to steady state method, the unsteady state permeability measurement used here can shorten the time required to measure permeability of nano and micro-darcy cores without significant measurement error; (b) stress dependency of permeability and porosity and their hysteresis during loading and unloading of outcrop cores were observed to be very small compared to those of reservoir cores; (c) generally, the stress dependency and hysteresis of permeability and porosity was observed to be inversely related permeability and porosity at initial stress conditions; hence, these characteristics are more pronounced and important in organic rich shale reservoirs; (d) porosity decrease with stress and its hysteresis were observed to be much smaller than that of permeability; (e) our results generally follow the experimental and theoretical relationship between cubic root of permeability and logarithmic of net stress reported by many researchers; and (f) an increase in permeability with temperature (and decrease in permeability with hysteresis during temperature unloading) is observed in organic rich mudrocks  this is due to dilation, diffusion, and adsorption effects of organic rich pores  hence, a temperature correction factor is required to estimate the exact in-situ permeability of organic rich mudrocks    finally, we would like to comment that understanding of permeability and porosity dependency on stress and their hysteresis information values could be used to optimize production of low-permeability formations such that the irreversible permeability loss (formation damage) could be minimized by early fluid injection (pressure maintenance) to minimize rapid stress increase due to fluid withdrawal from stimulated reservoir volume  also, these permeability and porosity hysteresis information could be used in proper designing of multi-stage hydraulic fracture and re-fracturing design of organic-rich low-permeability formations | 
180230-ms 	 rate-transient analysis of liquid-rich tight/shale reservoirs using the dynamic drainage area concept: examples from north american reservoirs |abstract   the early-time performance of multi-fractured horizontal wells is mainly controlled by fracture geometry, total effective area of the fractures, and conductivity of the primary fracture system  rate-transient analysis (rta) methods have historically been used to characterize mfhws at different stages of well life, including this early-time performance  in particular, linear flow analysis is used to estimate the total effective fracture area from online production data, provided that reservoir and fluid properties are known  however, a primary complication in linear flow analysis is the incorporation of nonlinearities such as multi-phase flow and pressure-dependent rock/fluid properties into the calculations    a new linear flow analysis technique is presented in the current study, which can be applied to tight/shale systems with multi-phase flow and pressure-dependent rock/fluid properties  the method combines three important reservoir engineering concepts for linear flow analysis: dynamic drainage area (dda), material balance, and decoupling of saturation and pressure (which is analogous to the decoupling of geomechanics and fluid flow)  the dda concept, which uses a time-dependent well productivity index equation for the transient flow period, facilitates the incorporation of any sort of nonlinearity (including decoupled saturation functions) and operational constraints in modeling and rta of linear flow in mfhws    the method is validated against numerical simulation and applied to various sets of field production data from tight/shale gas and oil wells with different levels of condensate- (oil-) gas ratio  for all the field cases, total effective fracture area obtained from the new analytical rta method is in reasonable agreement with numerical modeling results    regarding accuracy and practicality, the new method represents an improvement in rta of liquid-rich tight/shale reservoirs, particularly for cases with multi-phase flow and pressure-dependent rock/fluid properties  further, the concepts used in the new model development are easy to understand and implement | 
180231-ms 	 engineered drilling system approach unlocks gas potential of shallow, low-permeability development in yamal region |abstract   major gas fields in west siberia have been depleted by 50-80%, and field operators are actively searching for ways to reverse declining production and access new gas deposits previously ignored given their complexity  one such hard-to-recover deposit is the turonian play  with total gas reserves reaching approximately 3 trillion cubic meters, turonian gas is encountered in nearly the entire northern part of west siberia    developing the turonian deposits presents the following challenges:    poor reservoir properties and low well productivity;   significant reservoir heterogeneity and facial variability along the section and area-wise, which complicates well placement operations for an optimal gas extraction;   low formation temperature and abnormally high pressure, which may require well operations in a near-hydrated regime;   high clay content, which leads to formation damage when water-based fluids are being used in reservoir drill-in operations  |drilling of turonian horizontal wells is complicated by a narrow safe mud weight window, geology uncertainties, and high sensitivity of borehole stability to well trajectory    analysis of turonian well construction experience has identified technological solutions in two main areas:    provide high-quality hole in all sections of horizontal well, including lateral sections, with length more than 800 m (to run safely casing to planned depths with followed multi stage hydraulic fracturing in horizontal section)    minimize formation damage, thereby preserving potential well productivity in a formation with a high clay content in wide range of temperature and pressure conditions  |core samples from the turonian formations were tested to determine mechanical, elastic, and other rock properties  from these results different mud types were evaluated for formation damage and impact on the mechanical and elastic rock properties    the integration and collaboration of drilling and petro-technical experts was the key to developing a fit-for-purpose drilling system that combined drilling technologies and engineering solutions  the main outcome from the planning stage was joint development of the engineered drilling system (eds), where each component (rig, surface and downhole equipment, drilling fluids, wellbore stability, trajectory, and engineering practices) was considered equally important and influenced the entire system and results of the well  implementation of the eds approach resulted in successful well drilling and completion operations    a time-dependent wellbore stability model was developed and successfully tested in field operations  implementation of the eds approach helped to determine the importance of time on the stable operation window for mud weights  additionally, the eds approach helped achieve production rates significantly higher in offset wells and justified the project's economics    the key lessons learned can be applied in other fields in the region to develop shallow low permeability formations  the major of them are:    geomechanics is a vital part for productive drilling;   optimal selection of dril-in and fracturing fluid played a critical part in achieving the project objectives;   integrated approach to drilling system design and close cooperation between all team participants are the key success factors in delivering technically complex projects;   the combination of fit for purpose technologies into an effective drilling system can provide cost effective solutions for field development with region specific challenges and traditional technology limiters  | 
180237-ms 	 phase behavior of multicomponent hydrocarbons in organic nanopores under the effects of capillary pressure and adsorption film |abstract   the presence of nanopores in tight rocks and shales have been confirmed by numerous studies  these pores are also the primary storage space of oil and gas in shales  due to the effect of nanoscale confinement, the phase behavior of fluids confined in such extra-low permeability formation (nanodarcy scale) differs significantly from those observed in the conventional formation    in this paper, the cubic pr eor is coupled with the capillary-pressure equation and adsorption theory to investigate and represent the phase equilibria of pure components and their mixtures in cylindrical nanopores  the pore confinement effects of interaction between fluid molecule and pore wall and the shift of critical properties are all considered  also due to the effect of adsorption film, an improved young-laplace equation is adopted to simulate the capillarity instead of the conventional equation  for the adsorption behavior, the experimental data on the adsorbent of silicalite are used to represent the adsorption behavior of hydrocarbons in nanopores  then, a prediction process for the behavior of methane, n-butane, n-pentane, n-hexane and their mixtures are performed  and the results are compared against the available experimental data to confirm the accuracy of this scheme  the actual eagle ford oil is also used to examine the performance of our scheme    results indicate that the presence of adsorption film could further increase the vapor-liquid equilibrium constant (k-value) and capillary pressure of the confined pure-component fluid, especially for the nanopores with few nanometers  the smaller the nanopore radius, the higher the deviation between the actual k-value and bulk value  for methane, when the pore radius is higher than about 20 nm, the k-value is approaching the bulk fluids and the effect of capillary pressure and adsorption film can be neglected  for n-pentane, it is about 18 nm  for binary mixture, it is found the higher the difference between the two components, the stronger the nanopore confinement effects  the capillary pressure will present a bilinear relation with the pore radius in the log-log plot  for multicomponent mixture, as the pore radius decreases, the bubble-point pressure is depressed, the dew-point pressure is increased, and the phase envelop of confined fluids is also shrinked  when the adsorption film is neglected, the bubble-point pressure will be overestimated, and the dew-point pressure is underestimated  for eagle ford oil, when the nanopore radius is higher than about 100 nm, the behavior will approach the bulk value and the influence of nanopore confinement can be neglected  this study will shed some important insights for the phase behavior of tight oil and gas condensate in nanopores | 
180238-ms 	 simulation of coupled fracture propagation and well performance under different refracturing designs in shale reservoirs |the successful development of unconventional reservoir relies on the massive hydraulic fractures which provide high conductive paths and large contact area between matrix and wellbore  since well production always shows a steep decline after the early high flow rate, refracturing can be an economically promising option to compensate for the loss of production and improve the well delivery  although extensive field cases have been published on refracturing practice, there is a lack of guidelines on how to select and optimize refracturing design  |in this paper, a series of synthetic cases are used to evaluate the well performance under different refracturing designs  the key characteristics for refracturing simulation is accurate quantification of the depletion-induced stress and pressure field change  thus, finite element method is used to solve the coupled reservoir flow and geomechanics model while a cohesive zone model is adopted to simulate the fracture propagation  a viscoelastic model is used to simulate the time-dependent fracture conductivity change due to proppant embedment  the synthetic cases are grouped into two categories: refracturing in existing perforations and in newly created perforations  a systematic sensitivity study is performed on the effects of fracturing spacing, matrix permeability and refracturing time  |numerical results show different fracture configurations for refracturing in depleted and virgin reservoirs and thus demonstrate the importance of accounting for stress and pressure changes during initial production  refracturing the existing perforation is likely to create a wider but shorter fracture compared to the virgin case because the fracturing fluid in these fractures encounter less resistance for enlarging fracture width rather than fracture length because of reduced pressure and total stress  refracturing new perforations appears to give better short-term performance than refracturing existing perforations but worse long-term performance  simulation results indicate that for relatively low permeability reservoir it is favorable to add more fracture area; however, the advantage is diminished while for relatively high permeability reservoir where the srv might already be depleted  when proppant degradation is severe, and fracture conductivity is the limiting factor for production, refracturing existing perforations becomes more attractive  moreover, simulation results seem to indicate an optimum time window exists for refracturing in this scenario | 
180244-ms 	 numerical investigation of stress-dependent fracture apertures and their spatial variations on production from unconventional gas reservoirs with complex fracture geometries |abstract   uniform distribution of fracture apertures is widely used in reservoir simulation of production from hydraulically fractured unconventional reservoirs  laboratory experiments, however, reveal that changes in effective stress create uneven distribution of fracture apertures, and this phenomenon has been neglected in most numerical models  this work investigates the impact of pressure dependent fracture apertures during the production process; fracture aperture is explicitly represented and the effect of closure stress is incorporated in a numerical simulation model    a discrete fracture model (dfm) is implemented using an unstructured voronoi mesh that captures complex fracture geometries  the effect of fracture aperture with respect to fracture grid size is examined via a case study that includes a vertical well intersecting a single stage hydraulic fracture  the effect of dynamic behavior of fracture aperture due to changes in stress, resulting from rock stiffness and uneven distribution of proppants within primary and induced fractures, is investigated  fractures are divided into three types, each with its own dynamic response to changes in stress  the impact of matrix permeability on aperture closure is also studied in a reservoir model with multi-stage hydraulic fractures intersecting with induced fractures    the developed numerical simulator is validated against commercial software  sensitivity analysis reveals that representation of fractures with exact apertures in numerical simulation produces more accurate results compared with an effective permeability approach, and the difference becomes more pronounced as the matrix permeability decreases  therefore, it is critical to modify, in the connection list, the length of the interface between each two grids embedding the fracture in accordance with the actual fracture aperture  the dynamic behavior of fracture apertures with respect to closure stress is processed by the numerical simulator as input information  simulation results indicate that reduction of fracture aperture translates into a decrease of its conductivity, which results in lower production rates  it is observed that fracture closure caused by uneven proppant distribution also plays a significant role in gas production  in addition, formations with lower matrix permeability experience a smaller reduction of gas production caused by stress-dependent fracture apertures    this work presents a new approach to representing complex fracture geometries with stress-dependent apertures and simulating the process of aperture closure due to changes in stress dynamically  the results provide a better understanding of stress dependence of fracture apertures and their spatial variations on well performance for hydraulically fractured wells | 
180252-ms 	 hydraulic fracturing placement issues on horizontal wells in the mancos shale, san juan basin: case study of possible causes, solutions, and results |abstract   the mancos shale in the san juan basin can present challenging conditions when hydraulic fracturing treatments are performed in horizontal wells  some of the issues while completing a well in the mancos can be caused by overall geomechanics and reservoir properties; for example, high horizontal stress anisotropy and the presence of discontinuities, such as microfractures and lamination  this paper presents three case studies in which hydraulic fracturing placement issues were explored    normally, the interactions of geomechanics and reservoir properties cause high treating pressures or premature screenouts, as presented in previous publications  ramurthy et al  (2009a, 2009b) and potocki (2012) explain how and why properties, such as process zone stress (pzs), pressure-dependent leakoff (pdl), and geomechanics, can affect the hydraulic fracturing conditions and production results  depending on how the well is completed, these challenging conditions can be either enhanced or minimized  when the reservoir and geomechanics are not taken into consideration in the completion design of the well, issues can occur during the hydraulic fracturing of the formation    issues including screenouts, pressure outs, and high pressure while trying to initiate the fracture can lead to the formation not allowing the placement of the designed treatment, improper stimulation of the reservoir, excessive completion costs, and more commonly than not, poor production  this paper presents three case studies  in all three studies, similar reservoir characteristics and geomechanical conditions occur, which pose challenging obstacles for both completion and production  the challenges were each addressed in different ways, resulting in different outcomes  in one case, no action was taken to mitigate these obstacles  in the second case, the area was studied using analysis service data, treatment data, and public information  this knowledge was applied to assist in the completion of the treatment without issues  in a more recent case, in a well with similar conditions as the two previous studies, only a portion of the recommendations were applied, with mixed results    this paper presents the knowledge gained from the three case studies conducted in the mancos shale, san juan basin  general suggestions are presented when similar conditions are encountered while completing a well | 
180257-ms 	 experimental study of permeability decline in tight formations during long-term depletion |abstract   hydrocarbon production decline behaviors in low permeability reservoirs and conventional reservoirs are significantly different; in such a way that high initial rate is usually observed for a short period in tight formation wells, then the well productivity drops dramatically  the rapid production decline in shale wells has a strong relationship with the loss of rock matrix permeability and reservoir conductivity, resulting from the dissipation of pore pressure during reservoir depletion  this paper presents experimental studies of stress-dependent compaction in tight reservoirs and its impact on long-term recovery    the magnitude of rock permeability change depends on the in-situ effective stress, which is a combined effect of reservoir pore pressure and confining stress  in this research, permeabilities of a series of shale and sandstone core plugs are measured in the laboratory using pressure transimission test technique  the samples are tested under multiple confining stress and pore pressure combinations  several confining stress are pre-set to represent different reservoir stress conditions  different pore pressures are then applied to mimic reservoir depletion process under specific confining stress conditions  the permeability is calculated for all scenarios and pressure dependent permeability behaviors are analyzed for each type of sample    the interpretations of effective stress dependent permeability show that different types of rocks have different permeability decline signatures responding to the depletion effect  in addition, tight rocks with different dominant porous media (i e , matrix and fractures) are found to have different permeability behaviors  characteristics of permeability decline at different pore pressure intervals are analyzed and the critical reservoir pressure and depletion index (i e , ratio of pore pressure to overburden stress) are identified for different types of rocks where significant permeability change occurs  based on the stress dependent permeability measurements, the biot coefficient is also determined for different tight samples    recognizing permeability decline signatures of tight reservoirs provides significant insights into long-term dynamic reservoir conductivity monitoring and contributes to the field management practices  it is indicated from the study that the permeability decline in tight reservoir wells can be significant with continuous depletion while maintaining reservoir pressure above the critical level has the potential to mitigate the sharp production decline in tight formations and therefore enhance ultimate hydrocarbon recovery | 
180260-ms 	 effect of methane adsorption on stress-dependent porosity and permeability in shale gas reservoirs |abstract   although stress-dependent porosity and permeability have been applied to majority of models to calculate effective porosity and permeability, effect of adsorbed gas specified as pore volume occupied by adsorbate is not properly accounted  however, nanoscale porosity and permeability of shale rocks would be significantly reduced, since the pore volume is occupied by layers of adsorbed gas molecules    in this paper, we combine stress and adsorption effects to establish a new correlation of shale porosity and permeability  we calculate the stress-dependent pore volume with a constant pore compressibility and obtain the volume of adsorbate from doing regression analysis for density of adsorbed gas by dubinin-astakhov (d-a) equation under the supercritical condition  lab experiments for methane adsorption in shale are measured by five real core samples  the data of gibbs adsorption obtained by experiments is converted to absolute adsorption so that it could be used to generate the correlation of stress-dependent porosity and permeability including consideration of adsorption effect    the new generated correlation illustrates that the trend of changes in porosity and permeability with pore pressure is quite similar to the trend calculated by shi-durucan (s-d) model in application to coalbed methane, which indicates that porosity and permeability decrease with the increase of pore pressure  this tendency is the inverse of changes in stress-dependent porosity and permeability in relation to pore pressure, which demonstrates that adsorption has a larger influence on pore volume than stress, because more gas attempts to adsorb on surface area of matrix as pore pressure increases  the new correlation is added into a numerical model in field-scale, which successfully matches production data from a horizontal well with multistage hydraulic fractures in barnett shale reservoir  the simulation results point out that without considering the impact of pore volume occupied by adsorbed gas, cumulative gas production would be greatly overestimated during economical producing period in shale gas reservoirs    thus, overestimation of porosity and permeability in shale might be avoided by applying the new correlation considering both stress and adsorption effects  the correlation incorporated into numerical simulators could provide accurate estimation and evaluation of gas production | 
180262-ms 	 pressure dependent permeability of tight rocks |abstract   according to terzaghi's principle, the effective stress s' is related to the total stress s and the pore pressure pp by the relationship s' = s - pp  in a typical reservoir depletion scenario, the pore pressure decreases under constant total stress, and as a result, the effective stress increases  the increase of the effective stress has a negative impact on permeability due to rock compaction, while the decrease in pore pressure enhances the apparent permeability because of the gas slippage effect  in tight gas reservoirs, since the slippage effect is no longer negligible, the pressure dependency of the permeability is very complicated    in this paper, we used three samples from the montney tight gas siltstone reservoir in western canada, whose absolute permeabilities range from in the order of 10-4 md to 10-3 md  permeability measurements under different pressure conditions using both the unsteady state pressure decay and the pressure pulse decay methods were carried out    based on the measured data, permeability was modeled as a function of reservoir pressure  using this function, we carried out reservoir simulations and examined the impact of pressure dependence of permeability on the gas recovery process from a tight gas reservoir | 
180266-ms 	 simultaneous estimation of intrinsic permeability, effective porosity, porevolume compressibility, and klinkenberg-slip factor of ultra-tight rock samples based on laboratory pressure-step-decay metho… |abstract   conventional laboratory characterization of ultra-tight reservoir rock samples involves separate laboratory measurements on different core plugs or on crushed rock samples  heterogeneity and anisotropy of ultra-tight reservoir samples adversely influence the laboratory correlation among various measured and estimated petrophysical properties    we apply an inversion algorithm to simultaneously estimate the intrinsic permeability, effective porosity at ambient condition, pore-volume compressibility, and klinkenberg-slip factor of an ultra-tight pyrophyllite sample from a single laboratory-based pressure-step-decay measurement  in doing so, we circumvent the effects of heterogeneity and account for the pore-pressure dependency of apparent permeability and effective porosity  moreover, the time and resource requirements are drastically reduced in comparison to those required when performing multiple experiments that separately estimate the aforementioned petrophysical properties    the inversion algorithm is valid for nitrogen injection pressure in the range of 50 to 500 psi  the algorithm assumes ideal-gas behavior of the injected nitrogen, 1d isothermal laminar gas flow, homogeneity of the core, pressure-independent gas viscosity, inverse-pressure dependence of the apparent permeability, pressure-independent klinkenberg-slip factor, non-negligible pore-volume compressibility, pressure-dependent effective porosity, negligible inertial effects, negligibly small pressure gradients, and time-invariant confining pressure    estimated apparent permeability and effective porosity of the pyrophyllite samples exhibit strong pore- pressure dependence; consequently, both the properties vary substantially along the sample length during the pressure-step-decay measurement  on an average, the effective porosity of the pyrophyllite samples increased by 100% and the apparent permeability decreased by 75% when the pore pressure increased from 50 psi to 500 psi during the measurement  the average values ki, ?0, cp, and b of the nine pyrophyllite samples were estimated to be 40 nd, 0 03, 2<u+00d7>10-3 psi-1, and 100 psi, respectively | 
180296-ms 	 a semi-analytical solution for estimating the fracture width in wellbore strengthening applications |lost circulation is a major challenge in well construction operations, especially where drilling margins are narrow or in pressure-depleted reservoirs  wellbore strengthening techniques (e g , stresscage) have successfully been used to increase formation fracture resistance and reduce mud losses during drilling operations  the increase of fracture resistance in sands has been used to improve wellbore stability (through the use of higher mud weights), reduce casing requirements, and access resources that may have been undrillable using conventional drilling methods  |the stresscage technique requires the estimation of the width of an induced fracture at a target fracture length for a given wellbore pressure  this estimation involves either a finite element calculation or a closed form line crack analytical solution  populating and running the finite element solution requires specialized software and expertise, which has limited its use to larger operators and service companies that are staffed with geomechanics experts  the closed form line crack analytical solution is both simple to implement and easy to use, but it assumes transverse isotropic in-situ stress conditions relative to the borehole axis, which is almost never the case in the presence of a deviated well  this assumption results in either the underestimation of the calculation of the fracture width in the presence of deviation or abnormal in-situ stresses, which can result in a failed implementation of a stresscage formulation  |we have developed a new semi-analytical line crack solution that accounts for stress anisotropy from either borehole inclination or abnormal in-situ stresses  this new solution is simple to implement  the calculation of the fracture width has been verified against finite element calculations through a range of stress anisotropies, borehole sizes, young’s moduli, poisson’s ratios, and target increases in wellbore strength | 
180307-ms 	 real-time wellbore stability evaluation for deepwater drilling during tripping |abstract   this paper identifies wellbore stability concerns caused by transient surge and swab pressures during deepwater drilling tripping and reaming operations  wellbore stability analysis is presented that couples transient surge and swab wellbore pressure oscillations and in-situ stress field oscillations in the near wellbore (nwb) zone in deepwater drilling    deepwater drilling is usually subjected to narrow drilling windows and significant wellbore pressure oscillations during tripping/reaming because of well depth  however, integration of transient surge and swab pressure analysis, and its effects on in-situ stress analysis around the wellbore, is rarely industry studied    a transient surge and swab model is developed by considering drillstring components, wellbore structure, formation elasticity, pipe elasticity, fluid compressibility, fluid rheology, etc  real-time pressure oscillations during tripping/reaming are obtained  based on geomechanical principles, in-situ stress around the wellbore is calculated by coupling transient wellbore pressure with surge and swab pressure, pore pressure, and original formation stress status to perform wellbore stability analysis    by applying the breakout failure and wellbore fracture failure in the analysis, a workflow is proposed to obtain the safe operating window for tripping and reaming processes  based on this study, it is determined that the safe drilling operation window for wellbore stability consists of more than just fluid density  the oscillation magnitude of transient wellbore pressure can be larger than the friction pressure loss during normal circulation process  with the effect of surge and swab pressure, the safe operating window can become narrower than expected  although it is stable and not a concern during a normal penetration process, the wellbore stability can become problematic  by using the methodology described, unnecessary breakouts and borehole failures during tripping and reaming can be avoided  this work can also be used in the next generation of drilling automation    this study provides insight into the integration of wellbore stability analysis and transient surge and swab pressure analysis, which is rarely discussed in the literature  it indicates that, when surge and swab pressure analysis is not carefully performed, the actual safe operating window can become narrower than originally predicted |

180366-ms 	 measuring marcellus shale petrophysical properties |abstract   the advances in hydraulic fracturing and horizontal well technology have unlocked considerable reserves of hydrocarbon contained in shale formations  however, quantification of the key shale petrophysical properties remain challenging  it is not practical to measure the permeability of the unconventional formations such as shales by standard steady state techniques because shales typically have permeability values in nano-darcy range  therefore, unsteady state methods have been extensively used to estimate permeability of the shale samples  however, the measured permeability values by these techniques suffer from large margin of uncertainty and reproducibility problems  these problems are attributed to the lack of consistent experimental protocols and the interpretations of the transient data  another limitation of the unsteady-state measurements is that the experiments cannot be performed under the reservoir stress and temperature conditions    this paper provides the results of the porosity and permeability measurements on marcellus shale core plugs which were performed using a fully automated laboratory set-up for evaluation of the ultra-low permeability petrophysical properties under the confining pressure  the permeability of the core plug were first measured under different gas pressures at constant net stress  the absolute permeability was then determined by applying the gas double-slippage correction  the porosity and the permeability of the core plug were then measured under a wide range of net stress  the measured porosity and permeability values were found to be sensitive to stress  two distinctive behaviors with net stress, for both porosity and permeability, were observed that can be related to the natural fracture and matrix properties  the experimental results were then utilized to determine the natural fracture closure pressure  the permeability measurements with carbon dioxide revealed that permeability is impacted by adsorption  the results of the measurements with were carbon dioxide also provided information for determination of the sorption characteristics that were found to be in agreement with the published values |

180461-ms 	 the effects of faults on induced seismicity potential during water disposal and hydraulic fracturing |abstract   a predictive geomechanical model of induced seismic events across many oklahoma counties is presented—the potential of this validated workflow to address numerous concerns with recent earthquakes is demonstrated  a network of large scale faults can greatly alter the stress field, and consequently the potential of induced seismic events resulting from water injection  these effects are quantified using a geomechanical workflow that leads to the estimation of induced seismicity potential (isp)  it appears that most of the recent earthquakes are clustered in high isp areas which could be found near but also away from critically stressed faults that were the focus of most recent investigations  when considering the volumes of water injected, the low isp areas seems to accept large volumes without causing any major earthquakes  in contrast, high isp areas near oklahoma city, seem to have many earthquakes despite the low volumes of injected water  in other words, the location of the water injection wells seems to be a critical factor impacting the inducement of earthquakes and reduction of water volumes alone may not reduce induced seismicity  the lack of earthquakes near very large injectors located in low isp areas seems to point to the need to restrict water injection only to low isp areas which may reduce the number and magnitude of earthquakes  this predictive tool could assist regulators, oil and gas companies, and insurance companies in selecting areas with the lowest risk of induced seismicity while bolstering the social license to operate unconventional reservoirs |

180464-ms 	 possible misinterpretations in well test analysis due to unfiltered tidal signal |abstract   this paper presents the most common misinterpretations in pressure transient analysis owing to unfiltered tidal signal in well test data  pressure transient analysis gives reservoir engineers an idea about permeability, different components of skin, reservoir model, as well as reservoir geometry  while collecting downhole pressure data, the reservoir engineer is mainly concerned about pressure changes due to fluid flow in porous media  however, the downhole pressure data is affected by a few unavoidable natural phenomena  one of such natural phenomena is the tidal effect in offshore wells and on-land wells near to the shore  most of the times tidal signals are filtered with the help of pressure recorded by sub-sea pressure gauges and maritime tide tables  however, when those data are not available, or in case of sro (surface read-out) without provision for filtering tidal signal, build-up data is analyzed without filtering tidal signals    this paper discusses how tides with different time and amplitudes effect the interpretation of build-up tests having various  values  [gr1] tidal signals that have different amplitudes and time periods were superimposed on pure build-up pressure of infinite acting radial model data, and an interpretation of results were compared    our results suggest that the early time region of the pressure build-up is not significantly affected by the tidal signal because of the steep increase in pressure  if the build-up test is continued for a significantly long time, even after pressure stabilization (not practical), tidal signals could be identified on a log-log plot by inverted u shape patterns  however, in the case of build-up studies, which are not sufficiently continued, it is likely that geneous infinite acting reservoirs are interpteted as parallel fault, u shaped fault or closed boundary models    several possible misinterpretations owing to the presence of diurnal and semi diurnal tidal signals in build-up data are listed in this paper  it has to be ensured that pressure transient data is free of tidal signal before concluding any boundary presence  unfilterd tidal signals in the pressure transient data may lead to interpretation of unrealastic boundaries  the outcome of this research will help reservoir engineers avoid misinterpreting pressure transient data | 
180467-ms 	 optimization of wellbore strengthening treatment in permeable formations |abstract   wellbore strengthening (wbs) is an enabling technology to simplify casing designs, prevent costly lost circulation events, and complete wells with a narrow drilling margin  given its effectiveness to help drill today's challenging wells economically, wbs has become a routine part of the drilling fluid design and the well construction process in general  however, the drilling industry still lacks a general model to optimally exploit wbs for various formation types and fluid systems    in this paper, we have conducted a systematic investigation of the major parameters which affect wbs treatment in permeable formations  large-scale fracturing experiments were conducted on two rock types with significantly different permeability and stiffness: berea sandstone (stiff - moderately permeable) and castlegate sandstone (weak - highly permeable)  several fluid injection cycles were carried out on each rock sample to characterize the fracture initiation pressure (fip) and fracture propagation pressure (fpp)  further, we investigated the effect of lost circulation material (lcm) - which are used for wbs purposes - on the fip and the fpp  also, we studied the effects of the concentration and the particle size distribution (psd) of lcm blends, the confining pressure, the stiffness and the permeability of rock samples    the experimental results confirmed that the fip is mainly a function of rock tensile strength and stress concentration around the borehole, and not affected by the presence of lcm  the fpp, however, can be significantly enhanced by adding lcm to drilling fluids  further, fpp enhancement is largely independent of the rock stiffness  we also found that a minimum concentration of lcm is necessary for effective wbs  however, no significant additional enhancement in the strengthening benefits was observed for concentrations above a certain upper threshold  in addition, our results showed that a higher lcm concentration is required for effective wbs in formations with a lower permeability (i e  tighter formations)  psd dominates the strengthening benefits of an lcm blend and, for both tested rock types, lcm blends with a broad bimodal psd provide superior strengthening benefits compared to those with a unimodal psd    in this paper, we introduce design guidelines to maximize the attainable strengthening benefits of lcm blends  the findings of this paper are relevant to improve the construction of (ultra-) deep-water wells with a narrow drilling margin through systematic optimization of wbs treatments and minimization of non-productive time | 
180473-ms 	 hydraulic fracture modeling and well performance analysis in ctd wells completed in tight sands |abstract   the effective optimization of hydraulic fracture treatments in coiled-tubing drilled (ctd) horizontal wells requires the integration of geomechanical modeling and properly designed hydraulic fracture treatments, including carefully selected stage and cluster placement  tight sandstone reservoirs are often characterized by low productive potential due to low permeability, complex compartmentalization and limited reservoir energy resulting from low reservoir pressure  well productivity may be optimized in both open-hole and cased-hole horizontal completions by minimizing the formation damage in these sandstone reservoirs through the application of true underbalanced ctd techniques, proper lateral configuration and optimized fracture stimulation design    in this study, geomechanical analyses were utilized to derive rock mechanical properties of tight sandstones, such as young's modulus and poisson's ratio using basic density, porosity and acoustic (compressional and shear) logs  general drilling experiences and mud weights were considered along with the logs to model pore pressure, overburden and horizontal stresses and a log-based minimum horizontal stress was calculated  the estimated in-situ stress and rock mechanical properties from the geomechanical model were used to investigate the pressures necessary to create hydraulic fractures in the tight sandstones and their propagation direction, in order to improve the flow capacity  hydraulic fracturing models were developed to identify fracture geometry parameters (length, height, width, conductivity and permeability) for horizontal ctd wells in tight sandstones  well performance analysis was performed to estimate potential production rates from ctd wells having various lateral lengths and numbers of frac stages by minimizing formation damage through true underbalanced ctd techniques and optimized stimulation design  effective horizontal lateral length was determined as the combined length of each stage that was successfully treated  modeling the open-hole and cased-hole multistage completion systems in the tight sandstones indicates longer laterals and an increased number of available stages are desirable to increase production    our models suggest that a successful, efficient completion may be achieved in tight sandstone reservoirs through the application of true underbalanced ctd techniques coupled with optimized lateral geometry and fracture stimulation design |

180623-ms 	 unitized wellheads for rajasthan onshore development drilling - proven safer and economical wellhead design compared to bowl and slip wellheads |abstract   this paper describes the safety and cost benefits as an onshore operator shifts from conventionally stacked (i e  bowl and slip type wellheads) to unitized wellhead systems while transitioning from exploration to development phase  there was a paradigm shift in operational safety coupled with multi-million dollars of cost savings during the course of development drilling spanning across 500+ wells  this paper draws a detailed comparison between conventional and unitized wellheads elaborating on the safety as well as operational aspects    the timing of full-fledged deployment of unitized systems by the operator coincided with development of the operator$s onshore rajasthan block  the unitized wellheads had been previously deployed by the operator in a number of offshore platform wells  hence, the operator had sufficient data to demonstrate that the overall economics was in favor of using unitized wellheads  until 2007, mostly conventional wellheads were used by the operator across nearly 140 exploration wells  thereafter, unitized wellheads were extensively used during development drilling in rajasthan post 2009  the unitized wellhead plays a major role in ensuring two barriers throughout drilling and completion operations, which is a requirement in the norsok standards  through careful scope definition and technical evaluation, the operator had ensured incorporation of a number of safety/operational critical specifications of the unitized wellheads including surface casing hanger landing rings, diverter adaptors, mandrel casing hangers, integral lockdown for casing hanger pack-offs, metal-end-cap seals, multi-stage compact bowls, quick make-up bop adaptors, tubing hangers with integral body seals, twcv (two-way-check-valve) profiles, bonnet-lmv (lower-master-valve) interface with dual seal provision etc  in contrast, the slip-and-bowl systems are associated with time consuming and relatively risky operations such as casing string space-outs, wait-on-cement, hot cuts, cold cuts, welding of riser/wellhead, nippling down of bop with less than two physical barriers, bop/wellhead housing installation after every hole section, dependence on cement sheath as sole barrier, risk of leaking lock down screws etc    the time saving unitized wellhead has translated into well construction cost savings for rajasthan development wells drilled by the operator  though the cost of unitized wellheads is approximately 20%-40% higher than the conventional wellheads, the rig time savings and the resultant cost savings clearly offset the higher cost of unitized equipment/service in the rajasthan onshore environment, both in development and exploration drilling  this is a step change from the previous belief that the unitized systems would only be economical for offshore operations  in addition, the usage of unitized wellheads offers safety advantages in terms of maintaining well barriers and brings greater efficiency and quality into well construction operations | 
180646-ms 	 mechanical specific energy for drilling optimization in deepwater brazilian salt environments |abstract   operators exploring presalt areas report issues with bottomhole assembly (bha) wear and failure resulting from factors such as vibrations, stick-slip, and torsional resonance during drilling operations in salt layers  this study presents a new real-time analysis based on geomechanics capability to optimize energy consumption and rate of penetration (rop) in salt-layer drilling and improve economic results    a real-time geomechanical analysis based on mechanical specific energy (mse) was used to optimize drilling and prevent nonproductive time (npt) when drilling in evaporite intervals  this analysis defined two energy limits as a function of depth  both maximum and minimum energy limits were calculated in real time based on estimates of confined compressive strength and intrinsic mse, respectively  the intrinsic mse calculation depends on the mechanical properties of the rocks [i e , unconfined compressive strength (ucs), friction angle (?), and the cutting environment]    when both limits were estimated, a real-time analysis was successfully developed based on measuring and comparing the following:    mse applied during the drilling process, which depends on drilling parameters, such as rop, rev/min, weight on bit (wob), and torque   mse intrinsic values   confined compressive strength (ccs) of the evaporate |the analysis identified excessive energy consumption to help reduce and mitigate factors, such as axial/lateral vibrations, stick-slip, torsional resonance, and wear of bha components in this geological environment  all factors were estimated and analyzed through empirical relations based on logging while drilling (lwd) logs and mud logging parameters    results of two case studies show how excess energy results in excessive vibrations and wear of the bha when this energy analysis is not applied and energy stabilization, rop efficiency, and mitigated vibrations when the methodology is implemented  a depth versus time plot shows drilling performance optimization with 12 operational days saved and no operational npt registered  economic results were also positive    this study aims to create a methodology that helps optimize the rop in real time for salt environments based on the estimation of the minimum and the maximum (optimum) values of energy necessary to drill efficiently and avoid bha failures resulting from excess energy in the drilling system | 
180694-ms 	 geomechanical properties of clearwater shale at elevated temperatures |abstract   caprock integrity is essential to the success of steam assisted gravity drainage (sagd) operations  this issue is especially critical in the case of shallow sagd operations where the in situ stresses are relatively low and, by necessity, the steam pressure has to be limited in order to ensure the safety of the process  limited information is available on changes in caprock material properties that occur when temperature and stress conditions change in areas of the caprock affected by sagd  by including these changes in caprock properties in the calculation of maximum operating pressure (mop), it is possible that the allowable mop could increase  this would allow the sealing capability of the caprock to be exploited more fully and provide an avenue for improving the economics of shallow sagd operations    this paper presents the results of experiments measuring geomechanical properties of clearwater caprock, at both ambient temperature (25°c) and elevated temperature (115°c and 200°c)  the shale samples used in the tests were cut from two sets of shale cores that had been obtained from the wabiskaw member of the clearwater formation at athabasca oil sands sagd projects  the first set of core samples originated from a depth of approximately 200 m  the second set was obtained from a different site and a shallower depth, approximately 150 m  the purpose of these experiments was to study the effect of temperature on geotechnical properties such as the elastic parameters (bulk compressibility, young’s modulus, poisson’s ratio) and shear strength parameters (cohesive strength, friction angle), and to investigate the behaviour of shale permeability in a stress, pressure and temperature environment similar to one that might exist during sagd operations    the experiments were performed in a triaxial cell, under conditions in which the pore pressure and axial and confining (radial) stress were controlled  the triaxial compression tests indicated that the elastic properties and shear strength of the shale samples were sensitive to temperature, for the range of effective stresses used in the tests  while the change in bulk compressibility was negligible, the samples became much stiffer (higher young’s modulus) and stronger (higher cohesion, lower friction angle) at elevated temperature  the measured increases in permeability caused by a reduction in effective stress were relatively small, usually not greater than a factor of ten over the initial permeability  in one exceptional case, at elevated temperature, the permeability increased by a factor of nearly one million, but even in this case the maximum permeability measured was never larger than 10 md  a substantial portion of the change in permeability occurred after the sample failed in shear  the increase in permeability that was measured on the clearwater shale samples at elevated temperature was somewhat greater than at ambient temperature, particularly at larger volumetric strains    at present, only a limited number of tests have been carried out to measure changes in caprock properties under temperature, pressure and stress conditions that prevail during sagd  further tests would be required to establish a better quantitative understanding of these changes in caprock properties | 
180704-ms 	 probabilistic analysis on the caprock integrity during sagd operations |abstract   geomechanical simulations are often used to study the deformation and mechanical failure behaviour of caprock formations in a sagd operation  different assumptions are made when building the simulation models  usually the overburden formations above the reservoir are described by a limited number of vertically separated layers with varying thickness  each layer is assumed homogeneous with laterally uniform material properties  in many cases, these simplifications are not accurate  it is important that the simulations properly consider the vertical and lateral variations    this paper presents a probabilistic analysis on caprock integrity using a randomized finite element simulation approach  volume of shale (vsh) logs and x-ray diffraction (xrd) analysis data are used to generate stochastic distribution of 3 major litho-facies: sands, shale with low illite/smectite (i/s) contents and shale with high i/s contents  the litho-facie distributions are then mapped onto the finite element discretization of simulation models  mechanical properties of the 3 major litho-facies are measured in a geomechanical laboratory test program  the geomechanical finite element model is coupled with thermal reservoir simulation results to study the deformation behaviour of caprock during a sagd operation  following a number of simulations, the results are statistically analyzed to estimate the probability of the caprock to enter plastic yielding | 
180705-ms 	 steam circulation strategies for sagd wells after geomechanical dilation start-up |abstract   dilation start-up has been widely used in petro-china's xinjiang oil field as a means of reducing start-up time and enhancing production from its "super" heavy oil reservoirs through the steam-assisted gravity drainage (sagd) process  sagd dilation start-up employs geomechanical dilation mechanisms to achieve these preferred results  using a short-period of small-volume and high-pressure fluid injection, the dilation start-up facilitates the development of a dilated zone that vertically connects the sagd well pair and is laterally uniform along the length of the well  this zone allows for more effective heat transfer to the inter-well area through convection than what is achieved through simple conduction during the conventional sagd steam circulation start-up  in petro-china's xinjiang oil field, conventional sagd start-up requires 10 to 12 months of non-productive steam circulation before oil production can begin  wells treated with the sagd dilation start-up can be converted to production after only 2 to 3 months of steam circulation    this paper presents optimized steam circulation strategies which can be used with the dilation start-up treated sagd well pairs  numerical simulations are effectively integrated with field trials to derive best practices for steam circulation after the dilation start-up  the objectives are to get earlier and increased sagd production as well as enhanced horizontal steam conformance  operating parameters such as steam injection pressure, rate and pressure difference between the sagd well pair were found to influence these objectives | 
180711-ms 	 numerical assessment of the maximum operating pressure for sagd projects considering the effects of anisotropy and natural fractures in the caprock |abstract   this paper presents a numerical assessment for the maximum operating pressure (mop) of a steam assisted gravity drainage (sagd) project considering the effect of the natural fractures (nfs) and intrinsic anisotropy of the cap shale  current numerical and heuristic assessments usually ignore the effect of the intrinsic and structural anisotropy of the cap shale in the caprock integrity studies    a coupled hydro-thermo-mechanical (htm) model was developed to assess the mop  the coupled model employed a novel constitutive model which was developed to investigate the effect of nfs and intrinsic anisotropy in the cap shale  the coupled model was validated against surface heave measurements, and later utilized in a sensitivity study to assess the mop for cases with different number of nf sets, fracture density and fracture dip angle    results indicate that the mop is highly sensitive to the fracture density and dip angle  according to the results, vertical fractures have minor effect on the mop while oblique fractures with the dip angle between 25° to 65° significantly affect the mop  neglecting the nfs can lead to significant overestimation of the mop  this highlights the necessity to include the nfs in the caprock integrity assessments    the numerical model presented in this paper considers the intrinsic anisotropy and the presence of nfs in the cap shale, while existing mathematical tools for caprock integrity studies have not incorporated the intrinsic and structural anisotropy  ignoring the anisotropy in caprock can potentially cause a considerable overestimation of the mop | 
180717-ms 	 investigation of post-abandonment surface deformation in sagd operations |abstract   steam-assisted-gravity-drainage (sagd) has been extensively applied in thermal recovery from oilsands reservoirs in the athabasca region of northern alberta  as the steam chambers associated with sagd well pairs become mature, a form of abandonment is often applied for pressure maintenance in the depleted zone  quantification of potential surface subsidence associated with sagd abandonment becomes critical especially when the mature wells are in proximity of future developments  in addition, induced shear stresses should also be estimated to fulfill well integrity requirements  in this case study, a coupled reservoir – geomechanical simulation model is developed, calibrated and utilized to estimate the magnitude of post-abandonment subsidence and the induced shear stresses in surmont sagd pilot project  in the context of this study, first, the development of a simplified 2d static geomechanical model using an original geomodel realization as well as geomechanical properties and stress profiles is discussed, which forms the basis for the coupled simulation model  the calibration workflow of the coupled reservoir-geomechanical simulation model to historical heave data is then reviewed and the impacts of different parameters on calibration quality is investigated  finally, the estimation of subsidence and the induced shear stresses in the nearby wells is discussed, and the magnitude of residual heave is quantified  the results of this study show that only a fraction (up to 40%) of surface heave is reversible (in form of subsidence) during the abandonment phase  therefore, the magnitude of the surface subsidence and the associated shear stresses are quite small  the modeling study has also shown that a small magnitude of subsidence may be recorded even 10 years after abandonment  however, more than 50% of the surface subsidence is observed in the first two years post-abandonment  other important findings of this study includes (1) documenting the effects of thief zone interaction as it relates to irreversibility of surface heave; (2) documenting the impacts of various geomechanical parameters on the quality of calibration against the historical heave data; (3) observation of the relative impacts of the pressure and temperature fields on the magnitude of heave; and (4) quantification of incremental, yet small, shear stresses along the nearby horizontal wells | 
180721-ms 	 sagd operation in interbedded sands with application of horizontal multistage fracturing: geomechanics and fracturing aspects |abstract   steam assisted gravity drainage (sagd) is a widely used thermal recovery method  during steam injection in interbedded sands, the portion of the deposits above the vertical permeability barriers is likely not recoverable with current practices  this paper discusses some of the geomechanics and fracturing aspects of using multistage fracturing in sagd operations in interbedded sands such as ihs, where the vertical permeability barriers impede the gravity drainage process    the first part of this work (to be presented in a separate manuscript) covered the reservoir engineering aspects of this method, where it was assumed that it is possible to successfully create vertical fractures in the oil sands and through shale layers  in this paper, the geomechanical challenges in implementing the method and after the start of operation are discussed, starting with a review of relevant hydraulic fracturing field trials in the oil sands  some interface crossing criteria are reviewed and the extended renshaw and pollard criterion is used to study fracture propagation through sand-shale interfaces  these results are then compared to results of a numerical simulation using a coupled reservoir-geomechanics-fracturing simulation software  it is shown that tensile hydraulic fractures can be created in the oil sands, and fractures can cross sand-shale interfaces and be filled with desired concentration of proppant  it is shown that small but high conductivity fractures that are required for the success of the proposed method, can be generated by using currently available proppants and fluid systems  after start of the steam injection, the conductivity of the fracture might be reduced by various mechanisms such as proppant embedment  it is shown that the reduction due to embedment would not be significant at high range of proppant concentrations and also due to the low stress regime in the alberta oil sands  furthermore, the design considerations for various liner systems that can combine the fracturing process and the sagd phase are discussed and a few new designs are proposed  finally, a step by step roadmap for field implementation of this method is presented    the novelty and main contribution of this paper is the analysis and design considerations of the application of multistage fracturing in sagd process in the field  our results indicate that the field execution is feasible, and a field trial of the technique is justified | 
180722-ms 	 effect of geomechanics on optimization of solvent assisted sagd sa-sagd in oil sands reservoirs |abstract   it is generally accepted that solvent-steam injection in heavy oil/bitumen reservoirs outperforms steam only injection in terms of oil recovery rate, ultimate oil recovery and steam oil ratio  important parameters in sa-sagd design are solvent selection, injection strategy and solvent retention in situ  the role of geomechanics in optimum application of sa-sagd, however, remains largely unexplored    recent studies suggest that solvent transport, solvent dilution effect and the temperature distribution around the edge of the steam chamber have major control over sa-sagd performance  solvent-steam injection significantly alters the temperature distribution around the chamber edge compared to steam only processes (sagd)  the temperature redistribution, in addition to the altered pore pressure, produces geomechanical effects such as porosity and permeability alteration, relative permeability changes and residual saturation alterations which in turn, influence solvent-steam-oil phase behavior and solvent transport and retention, among others  these chains of events affect the steam chamber growth and the solvent distribution, which affect optimum solvent selection and solvent-steam injection scenarios  these geomechanical considerations are of particular interest for bitumen deposits, both oil sands and carbonates, where chemical, thermal and fluid pressures can impose significant volume changes within the reservoir especially in shallower, lower confining stress settings    the role of geomechanics in sa-sagd was explored numerically using a sequentially coupled modeling approach with stars (cmg) and flac (itasca)  a 2d homogenous oil sands reservoir geomodel at a shallow depth was considered for the purpose of this paper  studies were conducted at two scales: 1) edge of steam chamber and 2) reservoir scale including underburden and overburden  the results of these numerical studies revealed geomechanics considerations directly affect the optimum solvent type selection and injection strategy during high pressure sa-sagd processes  these studies provide valuable direction for further detailed mechanistic studies (both numerically and experimentally) and provide valuable input to the challenges of optimizing sa-sagd processes in oil sands | 
180739-ms 	 results of a polymer flooding pilot in the tambaredjo heavy oil field, suriname |abstract   a polymer flood pilot has been ongoing since september 2008 in suriname in the heavy oil tambaredjo field operated by staatsolie  initially, the pilot consisted of one injection well and four producers and was later expanded to three injection wells and nine direct offset production wells (all vertical)    the tambaredjo oil field is the largest oil field in suriname and has been producing since 1982  the field contains approximately 525 mmstb stooip of 16° api oil with an initial viscosity of 300 - 600 cp at reservoir conditions  primary recovery (± 30% ooip) is relatively high given the oil viscosity; this is believed to be due to a combination of compaction drive, edge water drive in the northern part of the field and limited bottom water influx in other areas, and perhaps foamy oil behavior  in spite of this high primary recovery, large quantities of oil remain in the reservoir, making it an attractive target for eor    due to the relatively thin pay, thermal methods have not been considered for the reservoir but on the other hand polymer flood was judged suitable  the oil viscosity is high but still lower than in other successful projects for instance in canada while other reservoir characteristics are also suitable: low reservoir temperature and low water salinity allow the use of standard hpam polymer, and high permeability is beneficial for injectivity  moreover, the reservoir is highly heterogeneous, which has presented some challenges to the process    initially, a polymer viscosity of 45 cp was injected which was later increased, first to 85 cp and then to 125 cp in order to improve the sweep efficiency  the overall response to polymer injection has been positive even if some wells have not responded positively to the injection, and incremental recovery (over primary) to date is estimated at on average 11% stooip  due to the unconfined nature of the pattern some wells adjacent to the pilot have also shown response to injection    given the success of the project, work is currently under way for an expansion of the polymer flood to encompass 33 additional injection wells    the paper presents the results of the pilot and describes the operations and challenges encountered during the project, in particular during the injection of the higher viscosity polymer  the combination of high reservoir heterogeneity, use of hydraulically fractured vertical wells and high polymer viscosity injected contribute to make this pilot an interesting field case | 
180746-ms 	 experimental study on the failure behavior of inter-bedded shale during thermal stimulation |abstract   for the last decade, the integrity of caprock was the dominant topic in sagd aspects, especially after josyln creek steam release accident (ercb, 2010)  lots of works had been done to identify the failure mechanisms (carlson, 2012) and massive progress had been made(collins, walters et al , 2011; yuan, xu et al , 2011; walters, wang et al , 2012)  one of these efforts was to determine the maximum operating pressure from geomechanical study (walters, wang et al , 2012)  another issue in sagd operation falled into geomechanical category as well was inter-bedded shale (ibs), which largely impeded the vertical growth of sagd chamber (ito, t  hirata et al , 2004)  ibs generally yielded low operation performance in heterogeneous reservoir and gradually draw the attention of the industry and academia  yang (yang and butler, 1992) was the first to conduct physical simulation to study the effect of relative position and size of ibs on sagd performance  he concluded ibs above the injector would force steam chamber to detour which largely delayed the rising process of chamber  so breaking ibs to facilitate fluid flow has been an objective pursuit by the industry    actually the efforts to prevent caprock from failure was essentially the reverse purpose of breaking ibs  the conditions leading to caprock integrity issue were exactly those to promote potential failure of ibs  conventional ideas like drilling slim hole, vertical well, tunnel or fishbone wells (chang, ivory et al , 2012; john l  stalder, 2012; ptac, 2012; tunney cathal, 2012) might sound great but failed to meet the challenge of identifying location of ibs precisely  alternately in situ method was more feasible and most works reported in public domain fell into this category  as is well known, rock failure happened normally in the forms of shear failure and tensile failure (carlson, 2003; collins, 2005; dusseault and collins, 2008)  shear failure was especially common in anisotropic stress condition  accompanying with this concept, uniaxial boundary condition was widely integrated (walters, wang et al , 2012)  it was rather simple and ideal model  in addition, failure criteria was another important ingredient for shear failure study  models like mohr-coloumb (carlson, 2003; collins, 2005; dusseault and collins, 2008) and drucker-prager (yuan, xu et al , 2011; yang, xu et al , 2013) were generally used in academic research  the former one was widely used in engineering activities while the latter one was commonly adopted for numerical simulation (ipek, frauenfeld et al , 2008; du and wong, 2010)  tensile failure was also possible in certain unloading condition (xu, yuan et al , 2011) and should be concerned properly  it's necessary to mention li's work (li and chalaturnyk, 2006) in which a relation between permeability and volumetric strain was derived  this essentially bridged the gap between reservoir engineering and geomechanical research and helped understand permeability enhancement after failure    apart from numerical simulation, physical experiments also provided valuable thoughts to address ibs issue  collins & carlson (carlson, 2003; collins, walters et al , 2011) taught proper methods to core, store, and prepare core plugs for experiments  collins (collins, 2005) reviewed the work at utf project and concluded that stress front propagated far ahead of temperature and pressure front  this finding indicated ibs would be broken by means other than fluid injection  one of the most feasible approach was thermal stimulation which was already there in sagd operation  heat was one of the most important component in thermal stimulation process and heat transfer always exist in ibs no matter steam or hot water entered  in contrast, fluid wouldn't penetrate ibs with extremely low porosity and permeability and hence alter the stress condition inefficiently  dr yuan (xu, yuan et al , 2011) conducted lab tests and showed both shear failure and tensile failure of ibs during thermal loading  he argued that the stress path and loading history was important and might lead to thermal contraction or thermal expansion  thermal expansion was critical in thermal stimulation process(agar, morgenstern et al , 1983; butler, 1986) which might result in pore pressure increase and anisotropic stress status  to which extent this factor might affect the strength of ibs depended on the competition between thermal expansion and pressure dissipation  on the other hand, thermal contraction of shale was also extendedly studied (bois, curistec et al , 2011; li and wong, 2013) and fractures would developed in certain condition  hueckel (hueckel and baldi, 1990; hueckel and borsetto, 1990) studied saturated clay heating under undrained condition  he presented yield surface change in p'- q - t plot and found overconsolidation ratio played an important role in the failure behavior  wong (wong, 1998) proved that swelling caused by water imbibition was an alternative to weaken shale and improve effective permeability | 
180750-ms 	 temperature-dependent deformation prediction of oil sand by coupled geomechanical and fluid flow modeling |abstract   reservoir deformation during steam injection of sagd operation can result in the increase in formation permeability that can positively impact to the bitumen production  the reservoir deformation behavior is controlled by the mechanical properties of oil sand, which are highly dependent on temperature  this work is focused on the temperature dependency of elastic properties of oil sand and its impact on geomechanical responses during a sagd operation  coupled geomechanical and fluid flow modeling technique is employed to illuminate the impact of the change in elastic properties to the reservoir deformation behavior    rock physics modeling is conducted at first for quantifying the temperature effect on the elastic properties of oil sand  based on the investigation of log data from an actual sagd operation field, we used the soft-sand model to calculate dry-frame elastic properties of the unconsolidated sand  we then applied and investigated several substitution methods to quantify the effect of the pore-filling bitumen on the elastic properties of the oil sand  we selected one of the solid substitution methods instead of gassmann equation because bitumen behaves like solid at low temperature  the coupled hydraulic, thermal, and geomechanical simulator, tough-flac, is used to investigate the effect of oil sand's elasticity on reservoir deformation behavior  the coupled modeling for sagd is conducted for two simple cases; one case with the elastic properties at original reservoir temperature and the other case with the updated elastic properties considering the increased temperature  comparison of the results from the two cases demonstrates the importance of considering the effect of temperature on the elastic properties of oil sand  this work is new in terms of combining rock physics modeling for quantitative description of the oil sand elastic properties and the coupled hydraulic, thermal, and geomechanical modeling considering the temperature-dependent elastic properties of oil sand |

180788-ms 	 development of a real-time decision-making dashboard for drilling homogeneous unconventional shale plays |abstract   in the current market of drilling programs that emphasise cost effectiveness, making optimum decisions in a dynamic real-time setting is very important  we have observed a disproportional reliance on intuitive decision making in upstream oil & gas operations  in this paper, we propose a process that enables data driven decision making  we then implement this process for a specific situation    in homogeneous unconventional shale drilling, the number of factors that effect drilling performance are greatly limited  well drilling times are relatively shorter and so many more wells are drilled in a short period of time  this allows for an opportunity to learn quickly from past wells  we developed a decision-making dashboard that uses data from past wells and helps predict the outcome of a change before it is made  we used multiple linear regression (mlr) as the statistical tool to derive correlations between parameters and drill rate (rop)  historically, mlr has been used as a tool to optimize the conventional rotary drilling process  however, these analyses are based on limited field data and can yield inaccurate results  the introduction of new drilling technologies such as polycrystalline diamond compact (pdc) bits, rotary steerable systems (rss), and horizontal well placement have render past models obsolete when applied to modern unconventional homogenous shale wells    real-time data were collected from the lateral sections of eight horizontal marcellus shale wells drilled from a single pad located in greene county, pennsylvania  twenty-seven variables were identified and evaluated  a mlr of these variables was calculated for each of the eight wells  weighted averages of the resulting coefficients were then used to derive a predictive rop model  a decision-making dashboard was created using the coefficients generated through mlr on field data specific to the rig, well-plan, and area being drilled    in conclusion, a novel method of making data-driven decisions in real-time was developed  this dashboard is especially useful because it formulates a method of extracting actionable information from historical data  care must be taken to ensure data used for analysis are of good quality and specifically related to real-time applications  these considerations include rig limitations, formation types, well profiles, mud properties  updating the dashboard with more data as it is gathered enables continued learning from historical well-data in a systematic, data-driven method that has not existed in the past | 
180796-ms 	 advances in subsea separation and processing resulting in discharge of produced water at the seabed |abstract   as hydrocarbon fields in production mature, the resultant increase in produced water poses a problem due to the ever-increasing costs associated with handling and separation  current technology requires produced water to be brought back to a host platform or onshore from offshore reservoirs to address this issue of produced water separation and disposal  significant interest within industry exists for subsea separation technology, especially where current technology is challenged  the need for new or improved technologies is particularly salient when considering the topic of seabed discharge of produced water  interest is further magnified in regions such as trinidad and tobago, where exploration activities in deepwater blocks have commenced and subsea processing could prove advantageous when compared to topsides    this paper will discuss the need for development and testing of a subsea produced water treatment system for seabed discharge and the ongoing efforts involved in commercializing this technology  various existing subsea separation systems will be presented, with reasons why each has failed to render a solution to the issue of disposal of the produced water to the sea  a discussion will be made to illustrate the new era of linear separators, spherical separators, and compact flotation devices that may bring about a technology breakthrough for allowing subsea separation and discharge of the environmentally clean produced water to be discharged at the seabed    oil-in-water sensors enabling continuous measurement of produced water discharged at the seabed will also be introduced to illustrate current technology developments  the sensors' design basis and criteria are compared to existing discharge limits in the u s  gulf of mexico and trinidad and tobago to highlight the benefits of their use in these regions  in particular, four (4) sensor technologies subject to bench-scale testing in mid-2016 and their working principles are outlined | 
180803-ms 	 rock mechanical properties of shallow unconsolidated sandstone formations |abstract   rock mechanical properties, such as the poisson's ratio, bulk, shear and young's moduli are required for various oilfield operations such as seismic processing, reservoir simulation studies, and hydraulic fracturing for sand control  these properties are usually determined from compressional (p) and shear (s) wave velocities which can be captured by the dipole sonic logging tool  for unconsolidated rocks (shallower than 6000 ft), the p and s-wave velocities are difficult to predict due to the dispersive nature of these rocks  also, the available correlations in the open literature to determine these parameters should be used with caution since these were developed mainly for deeper formations    in this study, we compared the sonic wave velocities empirically predicted by castagna et al , eberhart-phillips and han with the logged sonic wave velocities across the cruse formation for eight onshore wells in south-western trinidad  we also investigated more suitable methods of matching the logged velocities across the cruse, by developing new empirical models and an analytical method (hertz-mindlin contact model) to account for the unconsolidated rocks  the basic input data required for predicting the sonic velocities and dynamic rock mechanical properties were porosity, clay content and bulk density which were taken from the log data  the models for obtaining the static rock mechanical properties were tested against the results of mini-frac tests in two offset wells in the cruse    the artificial neural network (ann) empirical method was shown to be best suited for predicting the dynamic rock mechanical properties for the cruse formation, since average absolute errors (aae) of 3 and 6 % were obtained in matching the p and s-wave velocities respectively  similarly, the aae obtained from applying the three empirical correlations were worse than 17 and 30 %  this error was generally observed to lessen for wells which encountered the cruse at greater depths  while aae of 6 and 12 % were obtained from applying the analytical method, reservoir depletion was found to significantly affect the results of the modeling due to the implied presence of hard-to-predict free gas saturations  also, it was found that the analytical method is the only viable procedure to predict the static rock mechanical properties in lieu of laboratory core tests  the analytical method has been tuned in this study using true vertical depth (tvd) as a correlation parameter for the first time, and it can generally be used to estimate both the dynamic and static rock mechanical properties of the cruse formation for future oilfield operations | 
180834-ms 	 the viability of slim-hole drilling onshore trinidad |abstract   slim-hole drilling refers to the drilling of a well with a wellbore typically less than seven inches in diameter  slim-hole drilling is beneficial to the low budget operator as there are considerable savings on rig time and costs and the rig size is ideal for drilling in remote areas  during slim-hole drilling, drilling fluid hydraulics is of great concern since significant pressure losses can occur in the drill pipe and annulus due to the reduced annular clearances  in addition, the flow regime generated in a slim-hole and the compatibility of the drilling fluid with the formation, can have an impact on the stability of the wellbore    slim-hole drilling has been successfully conducted onshore trinidad in the morne diablo / quinam block for a number of years  the most commonly used drilling fluid is salt water based mud since it is cheaper and easier to dispose of than oil based mud  however the open literature did not show any studies conducted to determine the impact of drilling fluid hydraulics and drilling fluid compatibility on well-bore stability  in this study, twenty-five water based drilling mud formulations were prepared using different concentrations of sodium chloride, potassium chloride and calcium chloride  the rheological properties of each formulation were determined and the bingham plastic and power law models were applied  the frictional pressure losses for three commonly drilled slim-hole configurations were then computed and compared  outcrop shale samples from the area were then treated with each formulation and the percentage loss in mass due to hydration and disintegration was measured for each sample    the results from these two tests showed that of the mud formulations tested, overall, those with kcl (2 9 %) and cacl2 (0 7 %), kcl (3 6 %), kcl (0 7 %) and nacl (2 9 %), nacl (0 7 %), and cacl2 (2 9 %) were determined as best suitable for slim-hole drilling for the well configurations used  for these mud formulations, frictional pressure losses using both rheological models were the lowest and provide adequate rheological properties  the outcrop samples also showed the lowest percentage loss by mass when treated with these formulations indicating that they possess the desired wellbore inhibition properties  however, formulations containing nacl only are the least expensive with straight kcl formulations being the most expensive | 
180884-ms 	 an integrated method to characterize shale gas reservoir performance |abstract   the application of horizontal well drilling coupled with the multistage fracturing technology enables commercial development of shale gas formations  however, due to the complexity of fracture network propagation, simulation of such reservoirs is challenging and associated with uncertainties  in order to minimize the uncertainty of modeling, we correlate first-hand pumping schedule data with the reservoir performance directly through coupling a fracking process with a reservoir simulator  this provides us an integrated way to characterize a well trajectory, hydraulic fracture configurations and shale gas reservoir performance  in addition, a geomechanical effect on the reservoir performance under certain fracture configurations is studied using a geomechanics module developed by cmg ltd    gohfer is widely used in a hydraulic fracking analysis  in this work, we couple gohfer simulation output with the cmg module to determine the hydraulic fracture configuration  thus, a method to correlate the first-hand pumping data (a slurry rate, slurry concentration and pumping pressure) with the reservoir simulator is given  because of the stress sensitivity of a shale formation, we employ a linear-elastic constitutive law to depict the rock behavior with young's modulus of 5,000,000 psi and poisson's ratio of 0 2  moreover, a barton-bandis model is used to describe the tensile opening of natural fractures for the dual-permeability reservoir model    from a series of numerical simulation studies, we find that the effective normal stress will increase with the development of a shale gas reservoir which will lead to a decrease in porosity and permeability  for the base case without a geomechanics effect, it will produce higher cumulative gas production than the case with the geomechanics effect  when producing for six months, the difference of the cumulative gas production between the two cases is 14 3%  the integrated process provides insights about shale gas reservoir performance with available data and handy tools | 
180904-ms 	 analysis of completion and production strategy for a horizontal well with open hole gravel pack  a case of study in teak field tsp, east coast trinidad |abstract   one of the most critical issues in tsp fields is the unconsolidated character of its sands  historically, most of the wells drilled in tsp fields, including vertical, deviated and horizontal wells, have been completed with cased hole gravel pack (chgp)  however, over the course of the years, these completions have been known to fail eventually, especially in the case of horizontal completions  among the failure reasons are the complexity of such operations and the drawdown applied during production    during the last drilling campaign in 2014, a horizontal well was completed with open hole gravel pack (ohgp)  in addition to the change of completion, the production strategy was also modified to delay the water breakthrough and reduce the drawdown  these changes have significantly contributed to increase the production of the asset and opened the opportunity to apply these changes in wells for future campaigns    the horizontal well, was drilled through unconsolidated sand (pliocene), where continuous fluid losses were expected to be encountered  during the well project execution it was necessary to create a mitigation plan in order to minimize the risk of fluid loss (rate) circulation before running the lower completion  for this it was necessary to include an isolation valve to control the losses once the packer was confirmed to be set  normal reservoir pressure, and available facilities, was key factor to decide to include a gas lifting system in the upper completion which was also designed to have the maximum id as possible for future intervention jobs such as acid stimulation and logging operations  finally the well was successfully completed in ohgp with no signs of bridging  based on the results obtained a complete detailed analysis for the pre and post job will be exposed in this document    this paper outlines the different challenges faced, as well as to highlight the action plans, mitigations and lessons learned encountered during the planning, design, and execution of the completion phase  in addition, a review of the production history of similar completions and the production strategies followed will be discussed  finally, the results of this well will be summarized and lessons learnt shared |

180997-ms 	 successful dynamic closure test using controlled flow back in the vaca muerta formation |abstract   the vaca muerta formation is a shale oil and gas reservoir under active tectonics created by the andes which are compressing the basin in an east to west direction and creates a varying stress regime both in horizontal and vertical directions  additionally, this formation is composed of alternating layers of three litho-types with contrasted mechanical properties  these are organic shale, carbonate and ash beds  slippage or debonding at weak-strong interfaces separating laminations is suspected to further contribute to the development of horizontal fracture components or t-shape fractures during hydraulic fracturing when the fracturing pressure reaches the overburden (zhang et al  2007)    selecting the proper landing position of horizontal wells in these compressive environments depends not only on the reservoir quality but also in selecting a layer which combines lower stress with sufficient vertical connectivity, thus minimizing detrimental effect from t-shape propagation behavior    closure pressure can be obtained by performing a dynamic in situ stress test by force-closing the fracture (nolte 1979; raaen and brudy, 2001)  to this effect, ypf initiated in 2015 a campaign of in situ stress measurements across the quintuco-vaca muerta system in vertical exploration and pilot wells  the objective was not only to predict a more accurate mud weight window to drill through the vaca muerta but mostly to measure as best as possible the difference between the overburden and the minimum horizontal stress to build a mechanical earth model accurate enough to help select better landing points for horizontal wells    there are 3 scales at which dynamic closure tests are performed  at the smallest scale, a micro-fracture is created by pumping a little amount of drilling fluid at few liters/minute in 1m open hole isolated between straddle packers  at the largest scale, in a cased-hole perforated well, the dynamic closure test is performed as part of fracturing data acquisition before fracture operation: at this scale the test involves tens of bbls pumped at 5-10 bpm  finally stress can be measured during extended leakoff test (elot or xlot) acquired in open hole at the casing shoe  after a literature review of the development of the flow back method this paper presents extensive details and operational procedure recommendations that were obtained from successful xlot combining multiple cycles with injection, forced flow back and reopening sequence in the neuquen basin | 
180999-ms 	 conventional fracturing vs  complex fracturing network in tight turbidite oil deposits in mexico |abstract   over the past decade the hydraulic fracturing industry has been working to increase oil production from low-permeability or "tight" sands formations by applying the experience and techniques gained from shale oil and gas well completions  the shale-based completion approach calls for the creation of complex but short-length fracture networks via the use of low-viscosity fluid systems combined with pumping at higher rates than a conventional stimulation  this paper is a case study of an oil-producing basin in mexico  it evaluates the impact on cumulative production from stimulations assumed to have a greater fractured length compared to stimulations of the complex fracture network type with their associated shorter fractures  this paper uses data from a 13-year period (2003 to 2016) comparing wells in two tight sands fields with varying characteristics such as well design, vertical and horizontal configuration, fracture fluid systems and completion techniques    due to the studied fields' petrophysical characteristics, hydraulic fracturing was necessary in all cases to economically produce hydrocarbons  beyond this common characteristic, key properties varied across fields, with high heterogeneity due to the characteristics of the turbidite reservoirs  natural fractures were not always present, permeability varied from 0 3 to 5 md, while average porosity was 15% with low changes in vertical stress  microseismic data acquired in the basin provided information critical to understanding fracture behavior and, when combined with fracture simulation software, estimating propped geometry    among the central observations of this study is that the stimulated reservoir volume (srv) has certain limitations when oil-bearing compact turbidites are being stimulated  this was especially observed in lateral wells where the minimum horizontal stress (shmin) increased gradually towards the heel of the well, making it more difficult to generate a complex fracture    the study area's stimulated wells showed a strong correlation between fracture half-length and cumulative hydrocarbon production  this proved true even among wells with complex fracture networks that typically had higher initial production  the critical conclusion of this study is that an oil well in low-permeability compact turbidites with greater fractured length can generate cumulative production up to 60% greater than a well with a complex but shorter half-length fracture network | 
181018-ms 	 automatic performance analysis and estimation of risk level embedded in drilling operation plans |abstract   it is not unusual that the difficulties encountered during a drilling operation can be tracked down to choices made during the planning stage  however, generating a robust drilling operation plan is not easy as there are often substantial uncertainties associated with the actual geological context  to address this problem, a method is proposed that evaluates quantitatively the risk levels of a drilling operational plan as a function of the underlying uncertainty associated with its description    to achieve that goal, the first task is to describe precisely the sources of uncertainties  the limits by which a drilling operation shall conform may be uncertain therefore defining fuzzy risk boundaries  the actual well construction may deviate from the plan, either because of unavoidable uncertainties in measurements as with the actual wellbore position, or because adjustments will be made during the operation such as changes in mud weight and rheology  finally, the actual possible drilling performance may be subject to unforeseen geological variations and unprecise formation rock strength characteristics    equipped with this probabilistic environment, we can perform drilling optimization in two successive steps  first, the uncertainty is propagated into drilling simulations, and risks associated to pressure control, cuttings transport, and drillstring stability are evaluated  second, parameter optimization within the allowed window, can provide a strategy to obtain the best performance possible with respects to acceptable risk levels  as a result, both quantitative risk analysis and drilling optimization under several constraints are available to the drilling engineer as a decision support tool for well planning |

181041-ms 	 the smart digital platform for effective well control management |abstract   the oil and gas industry has increased its efforts in preventing and mitigating risks associated with loss of well control and loss of primary containment  initiatives have primarily focused on increasing the awareness and education of field and operations personnel  the foundation of this strategy rests on the belief that increased awareness of threats, risks and enhanced training will lower well control risks and eliminate well control events  despite this renewed focus, industry data show that well control events and high-potential near-misses have not diminished  in addition, findings from incident investigations point to human-factor-related causes, including lack of procedural discipline, non-compliance errors and cognitive errors    for organizations to deliver flawless execution at the wellsite while effectively preventing or mitigating well control or loss of primary containment events, a robust closed-loop methodology that leverages smart risk detection and mitigation systems must be employed  this paper analyzes the critical process safety requirements in the industry and provides solutions centered on a smart integrated digital platform  this platform, built on technologies such as precursor sensor and alarming technologies, barrier and equipment health monitoring, wellsite performance analysis, sophisticated workflow management and video and audio analytics, will effectively coordinate and manage these dynamic risks    a data management workflow that uses automated risk assessments, threat detection, structured and nonstructured contextual data will minimize the impacts of human factors and drive operational efficiency, process assurance, reduction in nonproductive time and project cost  these enhancements will enable global organizations to proactively drive effective risk management of well control and loss of primary containment events  this paper will explore the application, methodology and value of this smart, integrated digital platform through the presentation of case studies | 
181163-ms 	 voidage replacement ratio as a decision variable in closed loop reservoir management process improving field production efficiency |abstract   closed loop reservoir management (clrm) aims to automate the classic reservoir management process by means of using artificial intelligence, control theory and optimization workflows  one of the tasks performed during a clrm is the optimization process which deals with defining the best allocation of resources so as to maximize, for instance, net present value  this resource allocation may be wells location, injection (or production) rate for each well, etc    in this context, the goal of this paper is to introduce an innovative approach of clrm for optimization of waterflooding process by using voidage replacement ratio (vrr) as a decision variable to generate optimum npv of a given field  it is argued that this decision should be taken prior to any definition on well injection rates or either zone injection rate for intelligent wells    a simplified oil-water reservoir model is used to simulate real field behavior under a number different scenarios of vrr values defined by an optimization algorithm designed to reach maximum value of a simplified npv function  from that initial model, three case studies are performed to answer three questions:    how can different reservoir and economic scenarios impact decision of the optimum value of vrr to be pursued by reservoir managers?;   how to adapt the proposed method to different development project drivers?   is it possible to improve field's performance by defining an optimum sequence of variation for vrr through time? |this paper demonstrates that, although being the most common practice for waterflooding projects, a strategy of keeping vrr ~ 1 do not always lead to optimal profitability in terms of npv  they are also discussed the many aspects to be considered when deciding on the pressure management strategy for developing a reservoir safely and economically while limited by technical and operational constraints    the studies performed demonstrate how an active vrr management during production lifetime might generate improved efficiency of company's assets aligned to its development strategy  also, a reliable rule of thumbs guideline is presented to give operators a qualitative insight on how different geological and economic scenarios might impact on the definition of optimum strategy for vrr management | 
181179-ms 	 compact and highly efficient heat exchanger based on packed beds of nanoparticle-doped spheres |in this work, we demonstrate at a laboratory scale the possibility of using a radio frequency (rf) heating system as a heat exchanger, with future applications for heavy oil processing  this laboratory work is the base for further improvements in heavy oil operations  the system consists of a pipe packed with nanoparticle-doped, superparamagnetic spheres as the bed material  the experimental results are compared to the data obtained with a volume average numerical method  |in the rf heating system, the spheres are excited when subjected to oscillating electric fields ensuing thermal energy dissipation; this mechanism is called the neel relaxation, a type of electrical induction heating  we have tested this system’s performance using water and heavy crude oil flowing in non-electrically conductive ceramic pipes packed with different sizes and spheres materials  pressure, temperature and electric consumption data corresponding to varying flow rates have been collected and the numerically solved heat transfer equations are used to extend the system characterization; this will allow for industrial apparatus design considerations  |steady state data indicate that fluid heating is achieved at smaller residence times than in conventional heaters; temperature can be controlled with a great accuracy by varying the parameters of the rf generator  when heat leakage could be contained (through insulating the pipe outer wall and relatively low temperature gradients), heating efficiencies were significantly higher than 80 %  the volume average numerical method shows that the liquid flowing through the packed bed gets uniformly heated  thermal and flow characterization are achieved for reynolds and nusselt numbers in the range of 10-2-102 respectively  |this set up is able to heat in an efficient and temperature accurate manner for a wide range of flow conditions, and can be potentially used as a highly efficient heat exchanger for production operations (e g , steam generation) in areas where the construction of surface facilities (fuel storage tanks, boilers) is not possible, either for environmental reasons or for lack of land space  a rf heat exchanger would only require a reliable source of electricity | 
181197-ms 	 influence of confining stress in petrophysical properties changes during thermal recovery in silty sands colombia |abstract   thermal recovery processes in heavy oil reservoirs have become an efficient technique for the exploitation of the viscous oil that is trapped in the porous space  the heat reduces the oil viscosity and thus allows it to flow from the formation to the well  in recent years, there have been technological advances that have permitted such operations to become safe and profitable  having a right understanding of what happens to the reservoir and the surrounding formations during thermal recovery has become a topic of interest to reduce the environmental impact of these operations and to generate models that predict production and recovery factor accurately and reliably    understanding the geomechanical behavior of this type of formations under different scenarios of stress and temperature is essential to model this kind of operations due to possible scenarios during thermal recovery  confining condiciton is related to the depth of the reservoir and tectonic activity in the area  heavy oil reservoirs are mainly located at detph less than 3000 feet according to shafiei et  al (2013) [1]  this usually makes the reservoir formations to be unconsolidated or poorly consolidated, this kind of formations show elastoplastic behavior where stress-strain relationship plays an essential role in the production/injection process    samples from an outcrop of an oilsand formation located in eastern cordillera of colombia were collected to performe triaxial tests at high temperature conditions  picacho formation presents a high content of fines as other important heavy oil formations in colombia, where thermal recovery has been considered  fines content is crucial in the understanding of the material behavior due to particular silt and clay behavior such as thermal consolidation and mineralogic change caused by the temperature increment    during heating, different parameters were measured in order to understand what occurs to the porous medium while it is subjected to changes of temperature  the measurements include pore volume, total volume and permeability at different stages during the heating process  the experiments were perfomed at different conditions of effective confining stress (mainting pore pressure constant)  the results show a significant dependence of the petophysical properties such us permeability and porosity to the confining stress at which the porous medium is subjected | 
181199-ms 	 effectiveness in heavy oil wells cleaning at boscan field with cyclone bailer and coiled tubing unit |the obstructions generated by elastomers is one of the most common problems in the majority of the heavy oil fields producing with progressive cavity pump (pcp) in venezuela  for this reason rehabilitation work are done constantly to clean wells with the objective of reactivating, or increasing their production  |given that the application of conventional rehabilitation work done with service rig using wash pipe and shoe mill has not shown successful results because of lack of circulation in the well; arises the need for a new cleaning technique by using the cyclone bailer tool combined with coiled tubing unit  |the global procedure of this combination involve making runs with coiled tubing and the cleaning's bha composed of: a shoe mill, collecting chamber, a flapper valve, a bottom filter, a high torque bottom motor, and a cyclone bailer which allows, by a suction effect, catching the residuals inside the collecting chamber  once the collecting chamber is filled with elastomers and oil residuals, the tool is taken to surface for cleaning and this process is repeated until reaching the target depth and remove all obstruction  |as a consequence of applying this technique on the four wells studied, an average overall effectiveness of 85% was achieved in clearing blockages ranging from 363-817 ft in liners from 3-1/2 to 6-5/8 in, in an average of 8 runs in 7 days operational time per job, thereby achieving full production restoration at 769 bpd, which meant an average increase of 22% above the estimated production of 630 bpd  |the result of the application of the cyclone bailer tool to remove the cumulated rubber residuals in the liner showed more effective than cleaning with jets, or conventional motors with wicks used previously, this is due to compaction and the sizes of the elastomers residuals, which in several occasions reached up to 1 5 feets in length, too big to pass by annular space between inner diameter of liner and outer diameter of coiled tubing (ct) and the debris were too heavy to be lifted using fluids energized with nitrogen  |it is important to highlight that during the first run of well intervention with this technology, no further progress was observed due to flapper valve obstruction in the bha due to the presence of large pieces of trapped elastomer, which prevented entry of other elastomers in the collecting chamber, making it difficult to reach full capacity and thereby causing lost time in the recovery of elastomers and well cleaning, so it was decided to try changing the bha eliminating the flapper valve to allow free passage of elastomeric rubber clippings and so achieve greater debris collection by run, thus obtaining better results in the operation, due to their compaction and maintaining a low fluid pumping rate while pulling the ct to surface to prevent their return to the well |

181312-ms 	 low-velocity non-linear numerical simulation in tight sandstone oil reservoirs |micro and nano throats are widely distributed in tight sandstone oil reservoirs and non-linear flow characteristics are obvious  however, no existing non-linear mathematical models and numerical simulations account for the effect of throat radius heterogeneity and fluid on non-linear flow characteristics  additionally, they aslso do not account for the mutation of relative permeability curve resulted from non-linear flow characteristics  therefore, in this paper, based on the method to characterize the non-linear flow characteristics and to calculate the relative permeability with non-linear flow characteristics, non-linear mathematical model is built  then the numerical simulation module is developed  it is found that because of the effect of non-linear flow characteristics and quasi threshold pressure gradient, the early oil production of conventional model is largest and that of quasi threshold pressure gradient (qtpg) model and non-linear model are the same  additionaly, qtpg model overestimates the threshold pressure gradient  therefore, the sweep and cumulative oil production of conventional model is larger than that of non-linear model, larger than that of qtpg model  becasuse the middle of the production well and injection well has the minimal pressure gradient, it has the minimal effective permeability  accounting for the effect of non-linear flow characteristics and permeability stress sensitivity on relative permeability, the sweep area of injected water is small  although the permeability is the same, the non-linear flow characteristics and permeability stress sensitivity are more obvious when throat distribution is narrower  as a result, the effective permeability is lower and sweep area become smaller  therefore, oil rate and cumulative oil production is lower | 
181321-ms 	 how to correct the petro-physical properties for simulating shale gas production using current commercial simulators? |numerical simulation is important to understand and predict the development of oil and gas reservoirs  existing commercial simulators, such as cmg, eclipse and vip, have been widely used in the past several decades for their robust performance in computing and scaling  in these reservoir simulators, the fluid flow models are based on darcy's law or its extended form; the volume of the adsorbed phase or component is overlooked as well  while this is acceptable for conventional oil/gas reservoirs or chemical flooding reservoirs, the gas flow regimes such as slippage flow, transition flow, and molecular-free flow significantly is deviated from darcy flow for shale gas reservoirs  besides, a large portion of the gas is stored in the pore in the form of adsorbed gas  if the volume of the adsorbed gas is still overlooked, the volume of free gas and original gas in place (ogip) will be seriously overestimated  for the above reasons, it is commonly thought that existing commercial simulators could not be ideally used to simulate the development of shale gas reservoirs  hence, it is desirable to attain a feasible approach to correct the petro-physical properties of shale gas effectively within the commercial simulators, in order that one can use them to accurately simulate the development of shale gas reservoirs  in this paper, we first derived the correction formulas for the bulk porosity, free gas saturation, and connate water saturation used for correcting the disregarded volume of adsorbed gas in commercial simulators  then, we derived the models of permeability and porosity multipliers in matrix considering gas adsorption/desorption, geomechanics, non-darcy flow regimes, and diffusion of adsorbed layer  finally, the above models were used to attain the corrected petro-physical properties for simulating gas production based on the practical properties of shale gas reservoirs using commercial simulators  the validation was performed by comparing the simulation results of commercial simulator with the published mechanism simulator using gas field data  the results show that the simulation results using commercial simulator achieve good agreement with the published mechanism simulator with the corrected petro-physical properties  the corrections of bulk porosity, connate water saturation, and free gas saturation are very essential  the correction formulas for these properties can largely decreases the error of ogip and the calculated gas production  both permeability and porosity multipliers are the functions of gas pressure, but they are not a monotone decreasing/increasing function  the gas production may be significantly overestimated or underestimated without consideration of these characteristics of shale gas in different fields  the contributions of different mechanisms are also demonstrated using the commercial simulator  this work can evently solve the issue that existing commercial simulators cannot accurately simulate shale gas production  the researchers can easily use these commercial simulators with these corrected formulas, which is a great progress for modeling the development of shale gas reservoir |

181328-ms 	 effect of dynamic active fracture interaction dafi on activation of natural fractures in horizontal wells |abstract   activation of natural fractures is generally assumed to be a major contributor to the productivity of unconventional reservoirs completed by creation of many fractures in horizontal wells  these natural fractures are assumed to form an interconnected high permeability network that shortens the length of the flow path and facilitates higher flow rates from the reservoir    this paper reviews activation of the natural fractures that lie in the formation adjacent to, or in between, hydraulic fractures, but not directly connected to them  the solution uses the mohr-coulomb failure criterion and general equations for stress distribution around a hydraulic fracture    the paper shows that under favorable conditions the stresses induced by the growing hydraulic fracture can activate existing natural fractures by either tensile or shear failure  natural fractures close to the hydraulic fracture have the best chance for limited tensile activation  this type of activation is insensitive to differences between the original in-situ principal stresses  activation by shear sliding is more likely to happen in cases of larger difference between the in-situ principal stresses and, again, will be of limited extent    hydraulic fracture conditions that increase probability of natural fracture activation are higher extension pressure, and proximity to the natural fracture  natural fractures farther away from the wellbore have a better chance of activation if they fall within the influence zone of a long hydraulic fracture    activation of natural fractures by tensile stresses may create a zone of formation dilation and enhanced permeability around the hydraulic fracture  this increases the productivity of the hydraulic fracture and the reservoir    creation of a single hydraulic fracture is more likely to activate natural fractures than two or more concurrent fractures  the zone of activated natural fractures will also be larger  increased normal stresses caused by creation of multiple concurrent fractures can actually close or narrow natural fractures that have already existed within the formation between these fractures    shorter spacing between adjacent hydraulic fractures can increase the percentage of the formation volume between them that contains activated natural fractures | 
181342-ms 	 quantitative analysis of proppant-formation interactions by digital rock methods |abstract   understanding the mechanisms driving proppant, fluid, and formation interactions, especially in shale reservoirs, provides many advantages, including helping design new treatment methods for stabilizing faces of shale fractures, mitigating proppant embedment, controlling clay and fines migration, and ultimately improving well production  this paper describes new imaging tools and processing methods used to demonstrate the impact of treatment fluids applied during hydraulic fracturing in shale formations  results are correlated to provide guidance for selecting appropriate clay stabilizers to enhance propped fracture conductivity    four types of outcrop shale formation samples (mancos, barnett, eagle ford, and marcellus) were studied after conductivity tests were performed using fresh water  the workflow involves the following: (1) perform a computed tomography (ct) scan on the shale wafers; (2) process and segment the image to separate proppant, void space, and formation material; (3) calculate proppant embedment depths on both sides of the shale wafers; (4) calculate proppant-induced fracture widths and extract fracture patterns; (5) determine the percentage of void space and broken proppants; and (6) correlate these measures    fluid interactions with shale materials were manifested in the presence of proppant under closure stress through proppant embedment, effective propped fracture width, proppant-induced fractures, void space, and broken proppant percentage  by performing comparisons between eagle ford shale samples with fresh water or certain treatment fluids, proppant embedment depths were observed to be shallower under treatment conditions  while the number of proppant-induced fractures increased, their widths were observed to be narrower in treated shale samples, which is consistent with the trend  this reflects the importance of the treatment fluids, which help reduce the impact of proppant embedment to maintain the effective propped fracture width  the proppant-induced fracture pattern became more complicated in shale samples that were exposed to treatment fluid, resulting in a significant increase in surface area for hydrocarbon desorption  the proppant bed void space was shown to increase significantly after treatment  in addition, broken proppant amounts were reduced in the shale samples after treatment with the fluid, which reaffirms its positive effects  overall, quantitative comparisons between samples treated with fresh water and certain treatment fluids substantiated the positive impact of clay stabilization for providing protection for various formations  the results provide guidance for selecting appropriate treatment fluids for certain reservoirs and help reduce formation damage risks and costs    applying novel digital rock techniques to study the interactions between fluid, proppant, and rock samples provides the most straightforward method to visualize and quantify changes  the developed nondestructive workflow proved to be useful for selecting the proper fluid system for treating certain reservoir formations and thus enhancing production  quantifying proppant-rock interactions enables operators to determine the effects of the fluid system more accurately compared to using current conventional methods |

181365-ms 	 production pressure drawdown management for fractured horizontal wells in shale gas formations |abstract   the development of unconventional shale gas formations in north america with horizontal multifractured wells is mature enough to identify production malpractices and abnormal productivity declines generally observed within 18 to 24 months of initial production  the primary objective of this study is to address all known causes of these productivity declines and to develop a fully coupled geomechanical-flow simulation model to simulate these production conditions    this model mimics the impact of depletion-induced in-situ stress variations on short-term and long-term productivity by taking into account several phenomena, such as stress-dependent matrix and natural fracture permeability as well as reduction in hydraulic fracture conductivity due to proppant crushing, deformation, embedment, and fracture-face creep  matrix permeability evolutions, considering the conflicting effects of non-darcy flow, and compaction, have also been accounted for in this model  numerical solutions for simplified hydraulic fracture planar geometries are then obtained using a finite element method (fem) scheme    a synthetic case was defined to investigate the effects of each individual phenomenon on short-term and long-term production  results show that the combined effects of permeability alterations in matrix and natural fractures as well as conductivity losses in hydraulic fractures may result in substantial gas cumulative production loss  the model also reproduces familiar field-observed trends, with lower long-term production corresponding to higher and higher drawdowns  this behavior is attributed to the stress-dependent evolution of reservoir permeability and hydraulic fracture conductivity  the results conclude that ignoring impacts of any of the above phenomena results in overestimation of ultimate recovery  furthermore, it is shown that proper management of pressure drawdown and the penalty for lower initial production rates in unconventional shale gas reservoirs can yield substantially higher ultimate recovery    the model is fully versatile and allows modeling and characterization of all profoundly different (on a petrophysical level) shale gas formations as well as proppant materials utilized for the stimulation treatments  this integrated model can be used for optimization of key parameters during the hydraulic fracture design, for fine-tuning production history matching, and, especially, as a predictive tool for pressure drawdown management |

181395-ms 	 comparative analysis of various failure theories for borehole breakout predictions |numerous papers have been published for predicting the borehole breakout problems (mclean 1990; zoback 2007; ewy 1999)  the original theory proposed by zoback (zoback 2007) used the mohr-coulomb failure theory with a linear elastic stress strain relation  initially, it was applied to igneous rocks and large diameter boreholes  with these original applications, the linear mohr-coulomb theory predicted the breakout width within a reasonable accuracy  recently, the applications have been expanded to breakout problems for shales, mudstones and sandstones  however, there are some drawbacks  for sedimentary rock applications, the mohr-coulomb failure theory significantly over-predicts the breakout width  in addition, strong rocks show significant non-linearity before failure, hence, we need to artificially increase unconfined rock strength (ucs) and friction angle  the theoretical breakout width cannot be matched with the breakout width observed from the image logs unless these adjustments are made  using the image logs and the rock strength measurements obtained from several fields, comparative analyses were conducted for various failure theories with linear and non-linear stress strains  these failure theories include mohr-coulomb, drucker-prager, lade, modified-lade, mogi and critical plastic strain  the authors also compared linear and non-linear stress strain theories  the authors estimated the increase in ucs necessary to match the breakout widths observed from the image logs obtained from several fields  the authors utilized caliper logs to compare the breakout depths as well  |the results show that if a linear stress strain relation is used, ucs must be increased artificially by 1 09-2 25 times  this increase is as much as 2 25 times for the mohr-coulomb failure theory  on the other hand, if a non-linear stress strain relation is used, no artificial increase is necessary except for the mohr-coulomb failure theory  in addition, the effects of temperature change and shale swelling are varied depending on the failure theories  these effects are supposed to de-stabilize the boreholes  interestingly, the borehole stability differs depending on the failure theory used  moreover, the actual breakout depths are always deeper than those predicted with a linear stress strain theory while they are shallower than those predicted by a slip line failure theory  |this paper compares the merits and demerits of each failure theory when applied to borehole breakout problems  many triaxial tests were conducted to determine the stress strain and failure envelopes  the predicted breakout widths were compared with the measured breakout widths from the image logs  this kind of comprehensive evaluation (theoretical, experimental and field analyses) has not been performed in previous studies |

181407-ms 	 a shale matrix imbibition model – interplay between capillary pressure and osmotic pressure |high and efficient deliverability of stimulated reservoir volume through a hydraulic fracturing treatment relies on three segments: fluid flow from matrix to the interface between fracture and matrix media, fluid-rock interaction at the fracture-matrix interface, and conductivity of fracture network  thus, fluids and salt exchange between matrix and fracture network are critical and worth detailed investigation  moreover, matrix imbibition as an important eor mechanism has been extensively studied but the focus was mostly given to capillary effect  however, for shale, due to the pore structure and clay content, some physico- or electro-chemical forces at molecular level cannot be overlooked anymore, such as osmosis  |a multi-mechanistic numerical shale matrix imbibition model is developed  the model takes into account dynamic water movement caused by capillary pressure and osmotic pressure as a function of water saturation and salt concentration, respectively  the rock matrix is considered as the mixture of two different components, one with small nano/micro-pores and semi-permeable membrane property and the other having larger meso-pores  the model properly simulates water and salt transportation occurring across the matrix-fracture network contact surface driven by capillarity, osmosis, and salt diffusion  to honor the physics, the salt/ions concentration equation differs from previous work by removing the osmosis component and a new membrane efficiency coefficient is defined and properly incorporated in the model  |spontaneous imbibition test results were used for matching and validation purposes  the simulation results well explained laboratory high-salinity water imbibition curve, which can be divided into three processes  initially, a capillary driven imbibition sucks high salt-concentration water into matrix near the matrix-fracture contact surface  however, due to the significant salinity contrast between imbibed fluids and in-situ matrix salinity, a drainage process can be induced  eventually, as salinity difference decreases and osmosis is weakening, final imbibition stage starts  this model provides a basis for laboratory measurements interpretation and brings some insights to reveal the underlying mechanisms for field post-frac flow-back behavior | 
181410-ms 	 cubic law evaluation using well test analysis for fractured reservoir characterization |in fractured reservoir, the use of the so-called cubic law represents a method to describe fluid flow through fractures and to estimate effective fracture porosity from effective fracture permeability and matrix block size  the method supposes perfect fracture connectivity  in practice, however, it often underestimates field fracture porosity  this paper explores the relation between fracture porosity, fracture permeability and matrix block size using field, and in particular well test, data  |we used field data coming from four naturally fractured sand-stone reservoirs in foothills  values of storativity ratio (?) and inter-porosity flow coefficient (?) coming from thirty-three pressure buildup derivatives interpretations are listed and used to estimate fracture porosity and matrix block size  the effective permeability associated to each well test, which is obtained from the stabilization of the pressure derivative, was also recorded  a non-linear regression was put in place in order to correlate fracture porosity, matrix block size and effective permeability  obtained fracture porosities and block sizes are similar to values from other sources, such as thin section analysis and image log data  |the most significant finding is that field data can be correlated by introducing in the cubic law a correction parameter that increases fracture porosity by about two orders of magnitude  the reason for deviation from the theoretical cubic law can be threefold: first, the cubic law considers the entire hydraulic aperture of the fracture as contributing to the fluid flow, while in reality the flow may be hindered by presence of cement in-filling the fracture (thin section data supports this assumption); secondly, the cubic law assumes a perfectly connected fracture network, while in real cases some fractures may die out without intersecting any other fracture; thirdly, transient flow effects and distribution of block sizes may lead to a less well pronounced dip in the derivative, which may be interpreted as a larger fracture porosity when using a pseudo steady-state model for analysis  the correction parameter is likely not universal, and will depend on the degree of fracture in-fill and connectivity in a given field  |the work presented in this paper provides fracture permeability, fracture porosity, and block size estimates for the given type of environment  it issues a strong warning with respect to the application of the cubic law to estimate fracture porosity, and proposes a corrected cubic law expression that gives more accurate results  the methodology is useful for characterizing fracture porosity, a parameter that is notoriously difficult to measure |

181427-ms 	 solving the challenges of short and long-term production forecasting and uncertainty using a fully-coupled implicit integrated production modelling system |abstract   integrated modelling is of paramount importance while determining optimum development plans for any asset, especially for high-stakes offshore plays  it can be used for generating reliable reserve estimates and short to long-term forecasts  however, performing such studies has been a difficult proposition for the petroleum industry    a number of logistical and technical challenges are present for any integrated modelling project  the logistical challenges appear because of multiple engineers working on multiple tools for different parts of the modelling work  the lack of timely feedback between teams often leads to the forecasts being unreliable  moreover, several different tools and models need to be maintained for various disciplines and for different stages of asset development – presenting training and staffing issues    the technical challenges appear because of missing features in current tools  for example, it is common in the current workflow to see discontinuities across the use of various model fidelities  this deficiency can be seen in the application of reservoir models, where complex reservoir structures and processes are described in standalone reservoir forecasts by refined discrete models (particularly for long-term forecasts and reserve estimates) and in integrated forecasts by material balance tank models (typically used for short- to medium-term forecasting)  the latter approach is often not suitable for making longer-term forecasts, yet the current tools fail to suggest when such simplifications lead to significant errors  furthermore, in assets with multiple reservoirs and complicated fluid blending in the production facilities, the traditional modelling approach may lack the required physics to adequately model operational constraints or perform allocations  lastly, an end-to-end uncertainty and optimization framework is generally missing in the conventional approach, particularly where decisions are being made on the integrated production system  as a result, while users can often explore uncertainties and design decisions within the scope of their particular discipline, a coherent, integrated picture is difficult and often impractical to pull together    in this paper, an innovative solution to the above mentioned problems is discussed  for demonstration purposes, a synthetic asset model has been developed, which represents a complicated deepwater asset  the asset has two heterogeneous reservoirs, with unique and complex fluids, such that modelling should account for fluid blending in the shared production network  a multi-user, multi-discipline, multi-fidelity tool is used that allows for collaboration and sharing of data between reservoir, production, and geomechanics engineers through a relational database  multiple fidelities are used in the reservoir, wells, production network and geomechanics, with lower fidelity proxies typically being automatically generated from the more rigorous corresponding model – allowing for an easy-to-use, consistent and fit-for-purpose integration of model components  even so, the adequacy of lower fidelity models is ensured by quick and easy comparisons with high fidelity models  all the relevant physics are modelled for a gas re-injection project, system bottlenecks are identified, and reliable short, medium and long-term forecasts are created using a consistent modelling approach  forecasts are optimized for production, and valuation of forecast options including the timing and design of in-field drilling and compression upgrades are considered within the stochastic uncertainty of the dynamic reservoir models | 
181446-ms 	 a fully coupled 3d finite element investigation of hydraulic fracture growth in elastoplastic rocks |invaluable to both well stimulation and wellbore stability is the study of fracture initiation and propagation  the literature is rich with fracture tip phenomena theories  in particular, the effect of tip plasticity has been the subject of much debate  however, little has been done to investigate the effect of rock mass plasticity, a potential controlling factor in weak and compactible rocks  this paper advances a 3d dynamic computational model to replicate the growth of hydraulic fractures in elastoplastic rocks  |the proposed model is based on a non-linear finite element formulation that couples solid deformation and fluid flow  rock is treated as a work-hardening elastoplastic material whose plastic deformation can be found using an associated flow rule  this paper features a new computational method to find material tangent stiffness tensor in non-linear finite element analysis  a meshing/remeshing scheme is employed to maintain a high mesh resolution and to reach infinite boundary effect while keeping simulation runtime reasonable  the model tested successfully against analytical solutions for pressurized cracks and radially growing hydraulic fractures  |due to the action of fracturing fluid pressure on fracture faces, normal stress increases on the fracture faces and a zone of tensile stress forms ahead of the fracture  the size of this zone dictates fracture growth rate  due to plastic deformation, when subjected to loading, compared to elastic rocks, elastoplastic rocks experience less increase in normal stress on the fracture face and a smaller tensile zone  combined with typically high permeability of compactible rocks, this results in slower fracture growth, larger fracture widths and higher fracture pressures  another significant observation is that elastoplastic rocks can undergo shear localization, depending on rock properties, stress state and treatment conditions  |this paper presents a unique method to account for rock mass plasticity during fracturing operations  it showcases a robust 3d computational non-linear finite element model with a concrete physical foundation  simulation results are in agreement with both laboratory and field observations | 
181449-ms 	 assessment of permeability anisotropy in anisotropic reservoirs with integrating multicomponent induction and conventional permeability logs |abstract   permeability is one of the most important petrophysical parameters in formation evaluation and reservoir description  unlike porosity and saturation, permeability can be a non-zero rank tensor  most published log-based permeability models are only used to determine scalar or isotropic permeability  however, more and more oil/gas reservoirs have been found in anisotropic formations  in these geological environments, the permeability, resistivity, and some other petrophysical parameters are frequently anisotropic  from an industry-wide viewpoint, very few logging tools provide measurements that can be used as inputs for the calculation of log-based permeability anisotropy (horizontal and vertical permeability)  multicomponent induction (mci) tools are examples that can measure resistivity anisotropy  this paper describes the algorithms and interpretation workflow that can be used to assess permeability anisotropy from an integrated interpretation of resistivity anisotropy and conventional log-derived permeability    as an extension of present permeability models in isotropic formations, a new permeability model in an anisotropic formation is obtained  based on this anisotropic model, a new relationship between resistivity anisotropy and permeability anisotropy is determined in anisotropic formations  this relationship shows that the permeability anisotropy is a function of the resistivity anisotropy ratio and pore structure parameters  by comparison, the previously published results include only a few special cases in the new relationship  assuming that the log-derived permeability data are available and are calibrated based on the effective permeability or one component of the permeability tensor, the remaining permeability components can be obtained from the relationship of resistivity and permeability anisotropy  in thinly laminated shale-sand formations, log-derived permeability and horizontal or vertical permeability cannot accurately represent true reservoir permeability because of the vertical-resolution limitation of logging tools  to overcome this limitation, the true reservoir permeability is evaluated from the calculated horizontal and vertical permeability based on a multimodal permeability tensor model  for practical applications in anisotropic reservoirs, an interpretation workflow is presented for permeability anisotropy evaluation with the joint interpretation of resistivity anisotropy and log-derived permeability from conventional/advanced sensor logs (e g , resistivity, imaging, and sonic)    the algorithms and workflow are validated by using the numerical simulation and field data  the new workflow has been used in the permeability anisotropy interpretation of synthetic data with and without random errors  after the synthetic data validation, the workflow is applied to field log interpretation  both applications showed that this new addition of the permeability anisotropy should significantly assist in the accurate assessment of the reservoir, as well as in fracture detection and subsequent oil development and production | 
181454-ms 	 insights on overflushing strategies from a novel modeling approach to displacement of yield-stress fluids in a fracture |overflushing to displace the fracturing treatment away from the wellbore and into the fracture is common in multistage completions of horizontal wells in unconventional formations, but it can damage overall fracture performance by overly displacing proppant to leave the fracture unsupported or allowing gravity slumping to occur, again leaving unpropped area  a novel modeling approach was investigated to gain insight into the process and determine reliable bounds for overflushing  |from a fluid mechanics viewpoint, overflushing is displacement of a hershel-bulkley fluid by a power law fluid in a hele-shaw cell, leading to saffman-taylor instability at the fluids' interface  most hydraulic fracturing simulators use power-law rheology  a novel numerical model accounting for the yield-stress behavior exhibited by proppant-laden slurries was developed using the lubrication approximation and includes transport equations for fluid volume fractions and a nonlinear elliptic equation for pressure with mixed-type boundary conditions  the pressure equation is solved with a fixed-point (picard) iterations method, with the multigrid linear solver used at each iteration  |the model was validated against three sets of experiments in hele-shaw cells: gravitational slumping, displacement of newtonian fluids with fingering, and displacement of a yield-stress fluid by a shear-thinning fluid, leading to formation of fractal fingering patterns  good agreement is obtained  based on fracture mechanics, we analyzed what portion of the fracture may be left unsupported before it is severely pinched during drawdown as a reliable bound for overflushing volumes  a parametric study was focused on the displacement of the yield-stress slurry by the overflushing fluid, varying overflush volume and rate and rheology contrast between slurry and displacing fluid  qualitatively, when fingers of the overflushing fluid can be created at the overflush/slurry interface, large slurry pillars are preserved in the near-wellbore area, which may keep the fracture open; gravitational slumping is mitigated by the yield stress  three scenarios occur, depending on slurry rheology: from slumping-dominated (low-viscosity base fluid in the slurry), through intermediate to a fingering-dominated scenario, where gravitational convection is suppressed by high viscosity of the slurry (~1 pa s) and considerable yield stress (>1 pa)  the third scenario minimizes the geomechanical risks of overflushing by providing tiny fingers that are unlikely to be pinched out during fracture closure  |from the study, bounds for reliable overflushing are proposed, which are a lot more restrictive when the slurry base fluid does not exhibit a yield stress (e g , for slickwater treating fluids) | 
181499-ms 	 interpretation of the performance results of a polymer flood pilot in the tambaredjo oil field, suriname |abstract   a polymer flood pilot has been ongoing since 2008 in suriname in the heavy oil tambaredjo field operated by staatsolie  the pilot started with one injection well and four producers and was subsequently expanded to three injection wells and nine producers    initially, a polymer solution with a viscosity of 45 cp was injected and this was later increased, first to 85 cp then to 125 cp in order to improve the sweep efficiency  the response to polymer injection has been positive even though some wells have not responded as expected to the injection  the incremental recovery (over primary) to date is estimated at 11 3% stooip  additionally, some wells outside the pilot have also shown response to injection    the performance results of the pilot have already been presented in previous paper spe-180739-ms (delamaide, moe soe let, bhoendie, jong-a-pin, & paidin, 2016)  the current paper focuses on the interpretation of the performance of the pilot  several factors have contributed to make this interpretation challenging: the reservoir heterogeneity with permeability of up to 30 darcy (to air) measured in cores and in pressure transient tests; the characteristics and contribution of a water-bearing formation of cretaceous age below the main reservoir which remains not very well understood  but also the fact that the pilot patterns are not confined; the increases in injected polymer viscosity over the course of the pilot and the role of induced fractures or pseudo-fractures created during the injection of the polymer solution    salinity data recorded over the whole production history of the wells was invaluable for the analysis thanks to differences in salinity between the reservoir, the water-bearing cretaceous and the injection water    the results of the interpretation of the pilot performance have given a higher confidence for possible future expansion of polymer flood in the tambaredjo field  contrary to the common practice of using reservoir simulations to interpret pilots, this work has been conducted with classical reservoir engineering techniques and calculations, and thus presents an interesting case study  some main conclusions for this project are:    polymer injection has generated an incremental recovery of 11 3% ooip; polymer utilization factor ranges between 0 41 bbl/kg and 0 57 bbl/kg of polymer    fluid movement outside the patterns has been observed; it was due to the unconfined nature of the pilot patterns and was probably exacerbated by the limited drawdown imposed on the pattern wells  it is likely that incremental recovery would have been higher had the wells been produced more aggressively    a first response to polymer injection was obtained when a viscosity of 45 cp was injected  increasing the viscosity further did not result in any obvious increase in oil recovery   |for the future polymer expansion, it is recommended to maximize well drawdown and to reduce injected polymer viscosity to improve the economics (polymer utilization factor) |

181511-ms 	 sagd operation in interbedded sands with application of horizontal multistage fracturing; reservoir engineering aspects |abstract   steam assisted gravity drainage (sagd) is a widely used thermal recovery method  during steam injection in interbedded sands, the portion of the deposits above the vertical permeability barriers is likely not recoverable with current practices  this paper examines the reservoir engineering aspects of using multistage fracturing in sagd operations in interbedded sands such as ihs, where the vertical permeability barriers impede the gravity drainage process    assuming that the permeability barriers can be targeted and broken with vertical hydraulic fracturing treatments before steaming, it is very likely that the steam can pass through the shales, effectively heat the otherwise isolated oil, and eventually drain it  the flow mechanism and the recovery response of a fractured sagd well are discussed and it is shown that the suggested process has a great potential to improve production rate and recovery factor  the desired fracture properties and expected production rates are obtained by using both analytical and numerical reservoir engineering techniques  some quick assessment criteria are also introduced    analytical equations to estimate the sagd peak rate were derived for various sand-shale sequences and fracture configurations  the analytical equations can be used for quick evaluation of the fracturing potential in such sagd wells  a correction factor was suggested to compensate for simplifying assumptions    through numerical simulation, a matrix of sensitivity cases was developed with variation of key parameters such as fracture permeability, fracture half-length, fracture spacing and orientation  it was shown that fractures with short half-length but high conductivity are required for the process to work  using the sensitivity results, an optimum range for key fracturing parameters was determined  furthermore, a dimensionless fracture conductivity criterion was used as a general design criterion  the issues around fracturing design and sand-shale geomechanics are presented in a separate paper    the multistage fracturing technique in horizontal wells was first used in tight and shale gas plays, and different variations of the field execution of this technique are now widely available  to our knowledge, this work is the first detailed examination of the potential of multistage fracturing for improving sagd in interbedded pays  it is shown that, if this technique can be combined with in-situ steam operations, some of the problems with steaming interbedded pays can be addressed  in particular, it is shown that the recovery can be substantially improved to be comparable to clean sands  however, the use of multistage fracturing in sagd process also introduces unique execution challenges that require thorough analysis and design, which were the focus of the companion paper (saeedi and settari, 2016) | 
181516-ms 	 why re-fracturing works and under what conditions |stimulated shale wells show sharp decline rates after several months of production imposing the need for rejuvenating production via re-fracturing or other methods  the sharp decline in production from shale gas/oil wells is attributed to full or partial closure and damage of the induced fracture network within the rock  the poor economic conditions stirred by low oil prices has persuaded operators to consider re-fracturing as an affordable option but the mechanisms behind this technique is not fully understood  in this paper, we utilize a fully coupled model to understand stress re-distribution and identify different modes of fracture closure during production from initial hydraulic fractures  rock creep, proppant failure and differential fluid depletion are identified as primary causes of closure within shale fracture networks  we incorporate these phenomena into a poroelaso-plastic model that simulates fracture conductivity evolution during production, and re-fracturing treatments illustrated by re-fracture propagation, fracture coalesce or fracture extension along pre-existing fractures  this methodology provides a realistic initial condition to simulate varying re-fracture designs - different treatment schedules and fracturing fluids  the influence of degradable mechanical and non-mechanical diverters is also incorporated in this model  |our results reveal major stress redistribution in the fracture network especially at the intersections due to depletion  the results show how fracture closure at the fracture intersections causes abrupt or time dependent shrinkage of the drainage area  under certain conditions, re-fracturing may effectively open up these bottlenecks while in extreme situations, it creates new fractures which reorient obliquely  results also reveal the role of in-situ stress anisotropy, magnitude of depletion and complexity of fracture networks in the successful re-fracturing of lower- clay content naturally fractured formations such as the barnett shale  the results do not suggest strong dependency on stress anisotropy and natural fractures orientation in high clay content reservoir rocks like haynesville or marcellus  it shows the quantifiable effect of creep on closure rate and conductivity loss  results show diverters have a profound effect on the expansion of the re-fracture network, although it hinders reactivation of some clogged fractures  using adaptive cohesive elements provides the opportunity to model longitudinal, transverse or oblique re-fracture propagation  |the proposed model introduces a realistic fracture closure mechanism and stress re- distribution during drainage, prior to re-fracturing  this plays a vital role in explaining initial fracture extension, re-frac propagation, fracture coalesce, re-fracture re-orientation, and therefore the effectiveness of re-fracturing treatments  this model offers a practical tool for identifying potentially successful re-fracturing candidates | 
181530-ms 	 hydraulic fracture propagation in a highly laminated shale reservoir with complex natural fracture network - case study using higher-accuracy, full 3-d simulation |abstract   it is often reported that around 60% of hydraulic fracturing stages are ineffective  if so, it is likely that the design accuracy is limited by the current state of modeling and hydraulic fracture (hf) simulations  our study presents a new alternative – a full 3-d simulation with geomechanics coupled to fluid flow  with the conventional simulation, it is extremely hard to model opening of weak lamination (lam) and nearly impossible to generate induced horizontal fractures against the vertical overburden stress  however, horizontal fractures are routinely evident in shale reservoirs as healed fractures observed along the bedding planes  hence, the need and importance of a true 3-d simulator that could incorporate complex geology and dynamically simulate fracture propagation by accounting for realtime changes in geomechanics and fluid pressures  case study uses shale reservoirs, which are heavily laminated with complex natural fractures (nfs)  numerical simulations consisted of four separate coupled modules - geomechanics, hydrodynamics, a geomechanical joint model for interfacial resolution, and an adaptive remeshing module  reservoir stress condition, rock mechanical properties, and injected fluid pressure dictate how fracture elements could open or slide  critical stress intensity factor was used as a fracture criterion governing the generation of new fractures or propagation of existing fractures and their directions  simulation was run on a cray xc-40 hpc system  typical laminated shale reservoirs anisotropic geomechanical properties obtained from literature were used to estimate a 3-d geomechanical model and nf network  hf geometry was significantly different in the presence of weak bedding, compared to when bedding was strong enough to transmit crack tip stresses across the interface  significant amounts of fracturing fluid can be diverted into creation of horizontal fractures, even when the pressure was below the vertical stress, once bedding discontinuities are activated  choices of nf network and lam thickness significantly affected observed fracture propagation  the value of 3-d modeling was clearly established  this method provides more accurate solutions for stimulation design optimization, e g , landing points, number of stages, number of clusters, spacing between stages, and stimulated reservoir volume |

181593-ms 	 a simple unified pressure transient analysis method for fractured waterflood injectors and minifracs in hydraulic fracture stimulation |abstract   pressure transient analysis (pta) is commonly used in industry to estimate parameters such as dimensions (length, height) and skin of induced (hydraulic) fractures, and reservoir permeability  pta interpretation methods are well established for the limiting cases of ‘low’ leak-off [mini-frac analysis (mfa) of stimulation hydraulic fractures] and ‘high’ leak-off [injection fall-off (ifo) analysis of waterflood-induced fractures]  however, traditional methodologies used for these two limiting cases differ fundamentally and there exists no established approach for intermediate leak-off, in spite of many efforts to date    we present exact 3d simulations of hydraulic fracture propagation at arbitrary rate and for arbitrary leak-off (from very low to very high), followed by fracture closure as a result of shut-in and after-closure reservoir flow  based on the trends resulting from these simulations, we propose a novel very simple analytical pta method for estimating fracture dimensions, skin, leak-off coefficient, and reservoir permeability  this method is applicable both to fractured waterflood injectors and mini-fracs in hydraulic fracture stimulation  it presents a consistent approach to before-closure analysis (bca) and after-closure analysis (aca)    we compared the exact simulations with our novel analytical pta method, and with more conventional mfa and ifo approaches, such as g-functions, square root time, and other existing bca and aca methods  for all these cases, it is demonstrated that the currently existing approaches present limiting cases for either low leak-off (mfa) or high leak-off (ifo) of our proposed pta method, and that our novel methodology provides superior results to the existing approaches particularly in the intermediate leak-off range  we also use our numerical methodology to demonstrate that more recently proposed analysis methods using generalized versions of the agarwal/bourdet derivative do not necessarily result in a ‘correct’ interpretation, in particular with respect to identifying the point of fracture closure  with respect to the latter, we also demonstrate that often identification of fracture closure from pta will be virtually impossible    finally, we apply our pta method to a few field cases, thereby demonstrating its simplicity of usage |

181684-ms 	 the impact of geomechanics and perforations on hydraulic fracture initiation and complexity in horizontal well completions |as is well known, hydraulically fractured horizontal wells have been extremely successful in the development of low permeability reservoirs throughout the world  the vast majority of these completions employ cased and cemented wellbores drilled approximately in the direction of minimum horizontal stress  multiple, relatively short perforation clusters are included within each frac stage along the lateral  this efficiently creates many hydraulic fractures propagating orthogonal to the well, but it does not insure that each perf cluster is effectively stimulated  |many efforts have been made to improve the effectiveness of horizontal completions  this has mainly focused on using lateral measurements to place perforation clusters in rock of similar stress so they are more likely to be successfully stimulated  but this ignores the impact of formation initiation pressure and tectonics on fracture initiation  in addition, the number, dimensions and orientation of the perforations in each cluster can greatly influence the effectiveness of the stimulation at each initiation point  |to address these issues a near-wellbore fracture initiation calculator has been developed that predicts whether a fracture will initiate at a perforation, the minimum initiation pressure, the fracture initiation location and orientation at each perforation, and the injection rate into each perforation  these parameters are a function of the casing size and orientation, the mechanical properties of the rock and cement, the principle effective stresses, and properties of the perforations  |a series of sensitivities have been performed to quantify the impact of injection rate, tectonic setting, stress variation between clusters, and perforation properties on hydraulic fracture creation, orientation and complexity at each perf cluster  the sensitivities demonstrate that fractures may not initiate at many clusters and that within an active cluster some perforations may not be accepting fluid  incorporating the results from this model enables engineers to design completions that insure all perforation clusters are effectively stimulated and near-well fracture complexity is minimized  |this methodology does not just look at a single perforation, or cluster  instead, it accounts for the stress variation between multiple perforation clusters within a frac stage, in addition to perforation orientation, dimensions and eccentricity, to predict the likelihood that each perforation cluster will be stimulated  by employing this methodology one can better design a perforating system and optimize perforation placement within a lateral to insure hydraulic fractures are created at all perforation clusters |

181698-ms 	 role of fluid injection on fault activation during hydraulic fracture stimulations |abstract   based on recent reports, there is little doubt that hydraulic fracturing can result in the generation of seismic events with magnitudes greater than zero as related to the activation of faults situated within or within proximity to reservoirs  the question that arises is whether fault activation is related to the presence of fluids and proppant or is related to perturbations in the local stress field  in other words, are these events triggered through stress perturbations or induced by pore pressure reducing effective stress?   fault activation is also related to the degree of surface roughness, asperities and barriers to slip, frictional stress of the rock and the resulting rupture velocity  to derive a picture of the faulting and sub-faulting processes, we examine signals of a m>0 event associated with stimulation in the marcellus formation as recorded near surface with low-frequency sensors along with the sub-faulting behaviour as observed in high frequency signals recorded close to the source  we investigate the dynamics of sub-fracture failures during the rupture process and growth of the overall fracture from initiation to rupture arrest, the role of asperities, roughness, fluids, the failure mechanisms (shearing versus tensile dominance of behavior), and the conditions under which induced-triggered failures may occur    based on our observations, fault activation was related to decreasing frictional resistance on the fault surface due to the presence of fluids  the increasing magnitude for sub-events during fault activation suggests that slip over a larger contact area such as an asperity and that fluid influence was dissipating    overall, failure was dominated by a shearing mode of failure, whereas the sub-fracture failures were mixed-mode, that is, more complex than a simple shearing process and included a strong tensile component of failure that evolved in time  however, from this example, it is difficult to ascertain if fault activation was triggered or induced; it appears both modes are plausible |

181747-pa 	 a review on fracture-initiation and -propagation pressures for lost circulation and wellbore strengthening |summary |fracture-initiation pressure (fip) and fracture-propagation pressure (fpp) are both important considerations for preventing and mitigating lost circulation  for significant fluid loss to occur, a fracture must initiate on an intact wellbore or reopen on a wellbore with pre-existing fractures, and then propagate into the farfield region  wellbore-strengthening operations are designed to increase one or both of these two pressures to combat lost circulation  currently, some theoretical models assume that fips and fpps are only functions of in-situ stress and rock-mechanical properties  however, as demonstrated by numerous field and laboratory observations, they are also highly related to drilling-fluid properties and to interactions between the drilling fluid and formation rock  this paper discusses the mechanisms of lost circulation and wellbore strengthening, with an emphasis on factors that can affect fip and fpp  these factors include microfractures on the wellbore wall, in-situ-stress anisotropy, pore pressure, fracture toughness, filter-cake development, fracture bridging/plugging, bridge location, fluid leakoff, rock permeability, pore size of rock, mud type, mud solid concentration, and critical capillary pressure  the conclusions of this paper include information seldom considered in lost-circulation studies, such as the effect of microfractures on fip and the effect of capillary forces on fpp  research results described in this paper may be useful for lost-circulation mitigation and wellbore-strengthening design, as well as hydraulic- fracturing design and leakoff-test (lot) interpretation |

181811-ms 	 assessment of potential fault activation in tarim basin during hydraulic fracturing operations by using rigorous simulation of coupled flow and geomechanics |abstract   we numerically investigate a potential fault activation in tarim basin, west china, during hydraulic fracturing operations, by considering rigorous coupled flow and geomechanics  in this study, we find that the fault can be activated by water injection, when it is nearly critically stressed, being sensitive to small changes in stress  lower cohesion, lower frictional angle, and higher injection rate can activate the fault more easily  interestingly, the fault becomes activated away from the hydraulic fracture, before the injected water reaches the fault plane  then, when the hydraulic fracture meets the fault plane, the injected water changes the effective stress of the fault significantly, causing large shear failure  we also calculate the magnitudes of the seismic moment, which are low, because only limited areas of the fault plane are failed  thus, from this preliminary numerical study of tarim basin, we can possibly consider the fault activation as a reservoir stimulation technique for the tarim basin field | 
181813-ms 	 multiphase flow performance comparison of multiple fractured transverse horizontal wells vs longitudinal wells in tight and unconventional reservoirs with stress dependent permeability |abstract   hydraulic fracturing and horizontal well drilling technologies have enabled the oil and gas industry to safely unlock large reserves of oil and gas in unconventional resources, especially in shale gas and oil, and tight gas and tight oil reservoirs  however, there is an ongoing debate on whether "the best practice" is to drill a horizontal well in the direction of minimum horizontal stress, which would create transversely fractured well or to drill the well in the direction of maximum horizontal stress, which would create longitudinally fractured well  additionally, little work has been done to understand the complex relationship that exist between principal stresses, well azimuth and/or lateral direction    this paper presents the results of a comprehensive multiphase flow study that investigated the relationship between the principal stresses and lateral direction in hydraulically fractured horizontal wells, and its impact on well performance  secondly, the study also incorporated previous studies, where applicable, of a single phase flow study that was conducted by the co-authors of this paper  both studies focused on transversely fractured wells versus longitudinally fractured wells, and how well azimuth affects productivity, reserves and economics of horizontal wells  the previous study primarily focused on wells that produced single phase fluids, and used single phase reservoir numerical models to study well performance  the study investigated the importance of lateral direction as a function of reservoir permeability, lateral length, fracture-half length, number of fracture stages, fracture conductivity, and well completion type (open-hole vs cased-hole)  the single phase study also included a number of actual field cases where the results were compared to actual wells in both oil and gas reservoirs that had transversely fractured or longitudinally fractured horizontal wells    this study would extend the findings of the single phase flow study by adding multiphase flow dimensions such as effects of relative permeability, non-darcy flow, adsorption gas, stress dependent permeability on induced fractures and conductivity changes in the fracture from the tip to the wellbore  the study used black oil reservoir simulator to study two phase flow mechanisms such as gas-water (dry gas reservoir) and under-saturated oil reservoir (oil-water), and compositional reservoir simulator to model three-phase flow (oil-gas-water) to investigate each parameters' impact on well performance  this study is unique as it examines the permeability ranges from wells with 1 nano-darcy (0 000001 md) to 10 0 milli-darcy in a multiphase flow reservoir simulation  additionally, this paper presents the first multiphase flow study that thoroughly compared the performance of transversely fractured versus longitudinally fractured horizontal wells    key features of the study that would benefit the petroleum industry are;    methodologies for modeling shale gas and shale oil wells with stress dependent permeability, adsorption gas and non-darcy flow effect using black oil models and compositional reservoir simulators    reservoir permeability based cut-off criterion that can be used as guide when selecting whether to drill transversely fractured vs longitudinally fractured horizontal wells    integrating the reservoir objectives and geo-mechanical limitations into horizontal well completions and stimulation strategies    incorporate the effect of reservoir fluid type and fluid properties such as oil composition and density (api) into the decision analysis when comparing transverse horizontal wells to longitudinal horizontal wells    stimulation optimization strategies focused on well recovery, productivity and eur as function of hydraulic fracture spacing (or number of fracture stages) and reservoir permeability | 
181816-ms 	 impacts on srv region in low-permeability formations due stressse around a hydraulic fracture |abstract   stresses induced near a hydraulic fracture are calculated in an elastoplastic mohr-coulomb type formation  while an effective compressive stress increase may reduce the permeability in the formation, the induced shear stresses and dilatant zone developed can increase the stimulated reservoir volume (srv) and the size of an enhanced permeability zone  therefore, the induced shear stresses and dilatant zone are used in this article in order to quantify the size of the srv  it is emphasized that when the srv can be characterized by elastic strains generated during a fracturing process, this reversible srv may not be maintained during production  it is those irreversible srv (isrv) or dilatant volumetric strains that are the key for producing low-permeability reservoir economically  it is suggested therefore that a production enhancement in these formations is dominated by the possible isrv which are quantified by the cohesion, the orientation of the natural fracture network and in-situ stress ratios | 
181817-ms 	 understanding production mechanism to optimise well stimulation by production analysis in keshen hpht and natural fractured tight gas reservoir |abstract   the main pay of the keshen gas field is a tight sand formation with very low porosity (2% to 7%) and permeability (0 001md-0 1md)  due to the ultra-deep formation depth and superior high reservoir pressure (greater than 116 mpa) and temperatures (above 160°c), the well construction and field development costs are very high  therefore, stimulation treatments is essential for achieving sufficiently high production rate and the basis for justifying the costs  natural fractures (nf) are developed in the reservoir with high heterogeneity which leads to complex production mechanism due to interaction between matrix and nfs, and causes difficulties on stimulation optimization    to better understand the reservoir and optimize the well stimulation, the matrix properties, natural fracture, geomechanical data and stimulation data has been reviewed along with production data  massive production history matching work has been done to evaluate the nfs  other dynamic data like the well testing data and pressure data also reviewed to help understand nfs development in the full field scal  production analysis was conducted to link the rock properties, nfs and wells' performance, and provided full understanding of production controlling factor in this reservoir  the post production analysis helped to understand the efficiency of stimulation  the production behavior for different stimulation strategy also have been illustrated by the simulation models to investigate the impaction on the stimualtion optimization strategy by the interaction between matrix and nfs    the study provided a good understanding of the production mechanism in this kind of natural fractured reservoir and nf's impact on the stimulation efficiency  the heterogeneity of nf results in very different production mechanism given similar matrix petrophysical behavior  based on production mechanism, each well requires a customized stimulation to maximize the production potential    this study presented a case study for evaluating the production mechanism and highlighted the importance on evaluating the production mechanism on optimizing the stimulation for the naturally fractured tight reservoir | 
181819-ms 	 analytical model for multi-fractured horizontal wells in tight sand reservoir with threshold pressure gradient |abstract   multi-stage fracturing is currently the most effective method to exploit tight sand reservoirs  various analytical models have been proposed to fast and accurately investigate post-fracturing pressure- and rate-transient behaviors, and hence, estimate key parameters that affect well performance  however, these models mainly consider 2d flow, neglecting fluids flow from upper/lower reservoir when vertical fractures partially penetrate the reservoir  although for linear flow model, olarewaju et al  (1989) and azari et al  (1990, 1991) have studied the effects of fracture height, they merely used a skin factor  moreover, reservoir heterogeneity is seldom included  this paper presents an analytical model for multi-stage fractured horizontal wells (mfhws) in tight sand reservoirs, accounting for upper/lower reservoir contributions, reservoir heterogeneity and threshold-pressure gradient (tpg)    the model is extended from "five flow region" model and subdivides the reservoir into seven parts including two upper/lower flow regions, two outer flow regions, two inner flow regions and hydraulic fracture flow region  reservoir heterogeneity along the horizontal wellbore is considered, thus, the fracture distribution can be various, and fracture pattern optimization strategies are documented  fracture interference is simulated by locating a no-flow boundary between two adjacent fractures  the exact locations of no-flow boundaries are determined based on boundary's pressure which is a function of time and space  thus, the no-flow boundary has minimum pressure difference between its two sides during the well production, making the no-flow assumption reasonable  the experimentally observed tpg and pressure drop within the horizontal wellbore are included    modeling results are compared with those from well-testing software kappa ecrin, obtaining a good match in most flow regimes  specifically, the effects of upper/lower reservoir contributions and tpg are studied under constant-rate and constant-pressure conditions respectively  log-log dimensionless pressure, pressure-derivative and production type curves are generated  results suggest that fracture penetration ratio dominates the early-middle time pressure response  the start time of boundary-dominate flow are significantly influenced by penetration ratio  the larger the penetration ratio is, the earlier boundary-dominate flow regime will arrive  as for production response, with penetration ratio increases, the early dimensionless rate becomes larger, indicating higher flow rate, however, the late-time (td>10) production becomes smaller, that is, the production declines quicker when penetration ratio is large  when tpg is considered, differences in both pressure and production response mainly appear in middle-late time  greater tpg results in higher pressure drop and accelerates production decline  but this influence is marginal when tpg is small (tpg<0 4psi/ft)  effects of other relative parameters, such as formation permeability, heterogeneity, fracture length, conductivity, and wellbore storage are systematically investigated  besides, field data are analyzed and compared graphically, using type curve matching, and reliable results are obtained    low cpu demands and minimal data requirement of this model enable the operators to predict well testing results under different fracture patterns in a simple but effective way |

181828-ms 	 a new approach to the modeling of hydraulic fracturing treatments in naturally fractured reservoirs |abstract   we developed a fully coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical (thm) model for hydraulic fracturing treatments, which was verified via comparison to published literature  this model was then utilized to investigate complex fracture network propagation in naturally fractured reservoirs  mixed finite volume and finite element methods were used to solve this coupled system, in which the mpfa l-method was employed to evaluate the fluid-heat, inter-element flux because of the existence of full tensor permeability caused by imbedded fractures  to elucidate the crossing behaviors as hydraulic fractures meet inclined natural fractures, we extended gu et al 's (2011) crossing criterion to a 3d scenario  moreover, we integrated the modified barton et al 's model (barton et al , 1985) proposed by asadollahi (2009) to address the shear dilation process, which is helpful for accurately estimating the dynamical fracture aperture responding to changes of stresses, fluid pressure, and temperature  numerical experiments showed that principal factors controlling the complexity of the induced fracture network included stress anisotropy, injection rate, natural fracture distribution (fracture dip angle, strike angle, spacing, density, and length), fracture filling properties (the degree of cementation and permeability), fracture surface properties (cohesion and friction angle), and tensile strength of intact rock  we found that: (1) the lower the injection rate and the smaller the stress anisotropy, the more complex fracture network the could be developed; (2) high tensile strength could increase the possibility of the occurrence of shear fractures; and (3) under the conditions of large permeability of fracture-filling combined with small cohesive strength and friction coefficient, shear slip could become the dominant mechanism for generating a complex fracture network  the model developed and the results presented can be used to understand the propagation of complex fracture networks and aid in the design and optimization of hydraulic fracturing treatments |

181843-ms 	 analysis of hydraulic fracture propagating performance with geomechanical characteristics in naturally fractured shale formations |abstract   in order to predict fracture propagation in naturally fractured reservoir, several fracturing models have been proposed  especially, for analyzing interaction between hydraulic fracture and natural fracture, previous models have limits in representing fracture propagation, taking into account multiple planar fracture only with opening mode in fracture mechanics  when hydraulic fracture non-orthogonally encounters natural fracture, hydraulic fracture tip shears along natural fracture interface and then propagates into matrix once it meets the boundary of elastic region  therefore, not only opening mode but sliding mode also needs to be considered in fracture propagation analysis  in this study, we proposed hydraulic fracture propagation model considering geomechanical factors as functions of poisson's ratio and young's modulus using multiple planar fracture with mixed mode by linearly superposing opening and sliding modes    the proposed model was used to analyze the fracture propagating behavior for different shales of marcellus, barnett, and eagle ford with respect to geomechanical properties  from the results of sensitivity analysis for poisson's ratio, young's modulus, and stress anisotropy on crossing angle of hydraulic fracture into natural fracture, it indicated that young's modulus is mostly sensitive among geomechanical properties on fracture crossing angle  as poisson's ratio and stress anisotropy increase, or as young's modulus decreases, hydraulic fracture can easily penetrate into natural fracture  in the aspects of fracture mechanics, as young's modulus increases, the implementation of sliding mode is more significant, whereas, almost no effect regardless of magnitude of poisson’ ratio or stress anisotropy  based on the results of sensitivity analysis, the proposed model was run for marcellus, barnett, and eagle ford shales having different geomechanical characteristics for examining the importance of sliding mode  from the results, since poisson's ratio is low and young's modulus is high in barnett shale, the largest effect of sliding mode was yielded due to its highly brittle characteristics, in which this shale presents larger deformation in longitudinal direction than transverse  meanwhile, in marcellus shale, hydraulic fracture more easily crosses natural fracture with low value of crossing angle, because its young's modulus is lower than barnett shale, consequently, the implementation of sliding mode is less dominating  furthermore, since eagle ford, representing higher poisson's ratio and young's modulus than barnett shale, shows higher deformation in transverse direction by local stress change, the fracture crossing angle was estimated as higher value than barnett shale  that is, hydraulic fracture is difficult to cross natural fracture, and thereafter, propagating direction of fracture is highly deviated  therefore, particularly in eagle ford, the model with mixed mode was found to be extremely important on fracture propagating behaviors  as overall result, hydraulic fracture propagates diversely corresponding to shale characteristics as well as the existence of natural fracture, the stimulated reservoir volumes were estimated quite differently |

181858-ms 	 relationships between mechanical properties and fracturing conductivity for the eagle ford shale |abstract   experimental measurements of the fracture conductivity and rock mechanical properties are presented for the five different geological facies of the eagle ford shale (a, b, c, d and e) as defined by donovan el al  (2012)  in this classification, facies a lies right above the buda limestone, followed by facies b which has the highest total organic content and production  this study places emphasis in this zone  facies a and b are known as the lower eagle ford shale, whereas facies c, d and e are known as the upper eagle ford shale  facies e underlies the austin chalk  conductivity samples in three orientations and core plugs in two orientations were obtained from outcrops samples  the orientations represent vertical fractures with flow in the horizontal direction (x0 orientation) or flow in the vertical direction (x90 orientation), and horizontal fractures with horizontal flow (z orientation)    short term fracture conductivity experiments were performed using a modified api conductivity cell at room temperature  unpropped and propped conductivities were measured with gas flow  low proppant concentration was used in order to simulate a slick-water treatment  proppants of various sizes were placed manually on a rough fracture face  the fracture faces were scanned with a surface profilometer to calculate the fracture roughness  compressive triaxial tests were performed on the core plugs in order to determine the elastic rock properties such as young's modulus and poisson's ratio  additionally, brinell hardness tests were completed to determine the resistance to embedment  mineral composition was acquired by x-ray diffraction analysis    the obtained fracture conductivities were compared to the fracture face roughness, elastic mechanical properties, brinell hardness and mineralogy of the samples  it was found that propped and unpropped conductivities decline exponentially with closure stress  propped conductivity was found to be dominated by proppant characteristics  conductivity is positively related to rock brittleness and inversely related to poisson's ratio  for the samples cut perpendicular to the bedding, no significant difference was found for between horizontal flow (x0) and vertical flow (x90)  the parallel-bedding samples (z) in general have lower conductivity compared with the perpendicular-bedding (both x0 and x90)  within facies b, samples with flow on the bedding plane (z) were found to have the lowest conductivity    the findings of this study provide useful information to understand the outcomes of fracture stimulation in eagle ford, and therefore to assist fracture treatment design | 
181865-ms 	 analysis of thermal effects on hydraulic fracturing near a horizontal well by using displacement discontinuity method |abstract   unconventional gas/oil exploitation and stimulation depends strongly on the efficiency of the hydraulic fracturing (hf) treatment, via which connecting fracture networks are created and thus the conductivity for fluid flow in low-permeability reservoirs is enhanced  however, the cost related to hydraulic fracturing increases monotonically with the number of fractures  therefore, methods to reduce the fracturing cost while still achieving the desired stimulation effect is an important factor to be considered in the hydraulic fracturing design  although thermal effects on stress distribution and deformation have been recognized for decades, the effect of temperature change on shale gas stimulations has not receive enough attention  the injection of a cold fluid into a deep horizontal well can produce a large temperature difference between fluid and rock, for example, during the drilling of a horizontal well and later during the hydraulic fracturing of the well  this paper investigates numerically the thermal effects on the hydraulic fracture initiation and propagation for the condition of constant fluid pressure along the horizontal well by using the coupled 2d displacement discontinuity method (ddm) model, minehf2d  in particular, the fluid pressure used is set to a value less than the required value in driving the growth of an open fracture with a finite length  and the thermal cooling induced tensile stress is needed for the fracture to extend  a comparison is carried out for the mechanical responses, such as fracture length and opening and fluid pressure, under different cooling conditions  the numerical results show that the fractures can propagate with the assistence of thermal cooling  the thermal cooling can increase the fracture aperture to facilitate fluid flow, although the fracture propagation speed is then relatively slowed down  it is aslso demonstrated that, the thermal cooling tensile stress can propagate multiple fractures and the reduction of fluid temperature in the horizontal well will reduce pressure to initiate fractures and potentially lower the cost of fracturing treatments | 
181867-ms 	 the effect of rock properties on fracture conductivity in the marcellus shale |abstract   the success of fracture stimulations depends on the ability to fracture the rock and to maintain fracture conductivity  therefore, in order to have a successful treatment, the effect of rock and proppant characteristics should be understood  this paper investigates the relationship between fracture conductivity and rock properties for two different locations in the marcellus shale    in this work, a series of experiments were performed in order to better understand the mechanical behavior of the marcellus shale  multiple cores from allenwood and elimsport locations in pennsylvania were collected to ensure repeatability in the results  the core samples were cut parallel and perpendicular to the bedding planes in order to analyze the effect of anisotropy in fracture conductivity  additionally, compressive triaxial tests were performed to obtain the rock mechanical properties such as young's modulus, poisson's ratio and ultimate compressive strength, and x-ray diffraction analysis was used to obtain mineralogy composition    the laboratory results were carefully compared with previous fracture conductivity data and surface roughness data from the same marcellus shale locations where proppant concentration was kept constant to reduce the variables affecting the fracture conductivity behavior  the findings showed that the anisotropy effect is present for this formation and reflected in the fracture conductivity values, where samples parallel to the bedding plane seem to have higher young's modulus  it was confirmed that at proppant monolayer concentration the main mechanism for conductivity loss is proppant embedment, where due to the high localized stress, the rock-proppant interaction goes directly to permanent deformation of the rock  it was also observed that a higher young's modulus helps to maintain the fracture width which translates in lower rate of conductivity loss with increasing closure stress, therefore, rock mechanical properties have impact on fracture conductivity  the phenomenon observed is less pronounced if a multilayer proppant concentration is used, where the proppant pack characteristics become an important parameter in fracture conductivity    in this paper, we present an analysis of the effect of rock properties in the fracture conductivity behavior based on a series of experimental results from the marcellus shale, where the role of permanent deformation was taken into consideration as a parameter causing fracture conductivity lost  this is the first time the effect of rock characteristics in fracture conductivity is analyzed based on experimental work for the marcellus shale |

182160-ms 	 a novel approach to evaluate the risk of sanding for optimum well completion design: a deep-water case study from southeast asia |abstract   challenging environments, such as deep-water, require greater effort when designing wells and completion systems  in such cases, hydrocarbon production associated risks must be evaluated from very early stages of field development  particularly, the risk of sanding should be investigated to select and define the optimum well completion, and if required, the appropriate sand control options  this paper presents a novel approach to predict the onset of sanding by describing a case study from a deep-water gas field in southeast asia    sanding analysis generally consists of either a numerical or analytical model calibrated against laboratory tests and production histories  here, both numerical and analytical models are implemented to achieve a robust and reliable prediction in the absence of any production data  for this purpose, the numerical model is prepared and run using a comprehensive material model considering poroelastic-plastic rock behaviour with strain hardening  the rock is modelled from a combination of single-stage triaxial and advanced thick-walled cylinder rock mechanical tests on representative samples from the target reservoirs  a poroelastic analytical model calibrated against the numerical modelling results is then used to conduct sand production predictions with sensitivity analyses for a number of well trajectory scenarios for both cased and perforated, and open-hole completions    although the numerical and analytical models follow different assumptions, the sanding prediction results from both models are consistent  once a reliable validation is obtained, the analytical method can be used with confidence for sand production prediction for future wells through its simplicity and fast realization of various scenarios  the results show that a high risk of sanding exists for both cased and perforated, and open-hole completion systems for the planned deviated wells  hence, downhole sand exclusion options are deemed to be required for the development wells    incorporating analytical poroelastic and numerical poroelastic-plastic sanding evaluations enhanced the reliability of sanding prediction for development wells  this approach is particularly beneficial in the absence of production data at appraisal or early development stages |

182177-ms 	 well planning and stimulation optimisation by integrating 3d geomechanics for a horizontal well in the northern cooper basin |abstract   drilling and stimulation of exploration and development wells in the cooper basin, central australia, has been challenging over the decades due to the high-pressure, high-temperature environment, the high stress anisotropy, and the presence of thick coals  most of the wells drilled to date have been vertical  to improve production, a study was conducted for a low-permeability tight-sand oil field to assess a horizontal well with multi-stage stimulation  the long horizontal well was expected to pass through a region with varying depletions and lithologies, causing lateral variations in stress and rock properties that could only be captured by a 3d geomechanical model    a 3d geomechanical model was constructed to provide an integrated and accurate understanding of the field and to facilitate the planning and design of drilling, completion and stimulation of the horizontal well with reduced cost and risks, and to maximize the productivity  based on detailed 1d geomechanical modelling, a well-centric understanding of the three principal stresses, fluid pressure and rock mechanical properties of the formations was developed for offset wells in the field  the pore pressure distribution and depletion in 3d space was calibrated using well test and long-term pressure survey data  rock mechanical properties and stresses were populated in 3d space using seismic interval velocities and relationships developed in the 1d modelling, honouring the 3d static geological and structural models    the model of pressure, stress and rock property variations in 3d space enabled optimization of the casing program and mud weights  operational best practices to drill the long horizontal well, especially the high-angle build section in overburden coals, were compiled based on a drilling knowledge base developed using data from analogous fields  the use of varying stress and rock mechanical properties along the planned well trajectory in hydraulic fracturing optimization was a differentiating approach to conventional hydraulic fracturing optimization using 1d geomechanics  the treatment was optimized to confine the fracture above the water-bearing formation along the well path  the optimized stimulation design provided the best solution of stages, proppant and fluid selection, and injection schedules to maximize production with minimum cost    based on the detailed assessment, it was concluded that the horizontal well is drillable with optimized mud properties and good drilling practices to overcome the instability in coals  in addition, the reservoir section can be drilled safely with lower mud weights whilst still maintaining good wellbore shape  a multistage transverse fracturing program was optimized to improve the production, mitigating the challenges from the extremely low stress contrast between reservoir and the underlying water-bearing zone | 
182178-ms 	 high stress contrast between different lithologies and its implications for drilling and stimulation in the northern cooper basin |abstract   drilling in the cooper basin faces challenges from the hostile stress environment, high-pressure and high-temperature conditions, and variations in rock properties with depth  the current understanding is that the cooper basin is under a highly deviatoric, strike-slip stress regime with significant stress contrasts between different lithologies  these conditions create challenges for drilling and well stimulation    a series of wells have been reviewed to understand the vertical and lateral stress changes in the patchawarra trough in the northern cooper basin  the temperature anomaly at this location appears to be lower than in the nappamerri trough in the south  a different level of overpressure is also observed, and the formation pressure appears to vary depending on structural location  shallow wells on the ridge appear to be near hydrostatic in the permian sands, but overpressure is as high as 10 5-11 ppg on structures in the deeper part of the patchawarra trough  rocks appear to be generally strong, with siltstones in the permian section being only slightly weaker than sandstones  the stress anisotropy in the sandstone is large; the shmax/shmin ratio is greater than 2  the stress anisotropy is considered to be the reason for preferential wellbore failure in sands instead of shaly siltstones  the stresses in interlayered thick coals tend to be near isotropic  it is also thought that the stress regime is not necessarily uniform with depth; the maximum horizontal stress decreases drastically at shallower depths, and the stress regime becomes normal faulting    the detailed geomechanical analysis shows that the drilling challenges faced in the deeper section are mainly caused by the thick coal sequences  sandstones and siltstones are relatively strong, should not cause much wellbore instability, and are only expected to develop narrow breakouts  for hydraulic fracturing, the small stress contrast (similar minimum horizontal stress magnitudes) between sandstone and siltstone in the permian formation would result in difficulty in confining the fracture in zone  consequently, excessive height growth may cause the fracture to grow into highly fractured coals and may lead to early screen-outs    detailed geomechanical modeling for a series of wells in the patchawarra trough has enabled a thorough understanding of variations in rock properties, pressure and stress in the area  optimised drilling strategies for mud weight and mud properties were adopted for the drilling of vertical and horizontal wells  accurate stress modelling also helped the optimisation of hydraulic fracture design to achieve successful fracture treatments for improved production | 
182215-ms 	 characterization of elastic properties of lacustrine shale reservoir using well logging and core analysis |abstract   understanding the elastic properties of rocks is very important for unconventional reservoirs exploration  unlike marine shale, the lacustrine shale is more complicated with complex mineral composition and frequent sand and shale interbeds  typical analysis for lacustrine shale gas reservoir rock include: triaxial test, x-ray diffraction (xrd), total organic carbon (toc) measurements  the mineral composition is different for argillaceous shale and silty laminae shale  the static elastic properties are controlled by clay content, organic matter and porosity  in this work we evaluate elastic properties of above mentioned rocks using experimeal core analysis and well log data  based on triaxial test, young's modulus and poisson's ratio of rocks are obtained by means of the relationship between strain and stress  argillaceous shale is low to medium strength rock, and silty laminae shale belongs to medium to high strength rock  we find that young's modulus and poison's ratio has a negative relationship with clay content, organic matter and porosity which is present by bulk density and neutron porosity logs  the dynamic elastic properties are obtained from cross diploe acoustic well logging data  the dynamic elastic properties have the same controlling factors as static properties  argillaceous shale and silty laminae shale have significantly different response characteristics in well logging  the porosity is the main factor which leads to the differences between dynamic and static elastic properties  moreover, it is also found that the ratio of static and dynamic elastic properties is a function of porosity  hence, density porosity and neutron porosity from the logs are chosen to establish dynamic elastic properties correction model  the correction model is effective in predicting static properties in lacustrine shale gas reservoirs  we conclude that the static properties obtained from the correction model match with core derived static properties | 
182220-ms 	 comprehensive geomechanical modeling and wellbore stability analysis for infill drilling of high-angled wells in a mature oil field |abstract   reservoir pressure depletion and decline of production are two common features of many mature petroleum fields  drilling and stimulation of long, highly-deviated wellbores is one of the many technologies commonly used to enhance the production in mature fields  reservoir depletion results in reduction of in situ horizontal stresses and more specifically in the formation fracture gradient (fg)  the presence of non-depleted and generally weak interbeds within the pressure depleted reservoirs with a low fg leads to a narrow drilling margin for new infill wells or laterals  therefore, a robust knowledge of rock mechanical properties, formation pressures, the magnitude of in situ stresses and their evolution with production and depletion are essential for successful drilling of new wells in particular and the redevelopment of mature fields as a whole    a case study from a mature oil field in the sarawak basin, offshore malaysia, is presented where the field geomechanical elements were constrained from field data acquired in more than 10 offset wells drilled in early 1980s, and a new re-development well drilled in 2014 with supplementary core, well logs and pressure data  the results of rock mechanical core tests along with acoustic logs in the new well were used to update and verify an early geomechanical model built in the area  extensive production from more than 20 multi-layer sandstone reservoirs resulted in significant pressure depletion whilst some of the deeper and stronger reservoirs still contain significant oil reserves  the geomechanical model was used to identify the narrow-margin drilling and stability risks of infill deviated oil producers targeting by-passed oil in the deeper reservoirs, and horizontal water injectors planned to enhance oil recovery in the field    the results showed that both intermediate and production sections of planned wells would have narrow mud weight windows  depending on the well trajectory, the production sections could have only 0 8 ppg drilling margin due to a higher depletion of deeper reservoirs  the analyses also highlighted thin, weak interbeds in the intermediate hole section that require a minimum mud weight of 10 0-10 5 ppg to limit shear failure to a manageable level considering hole cleaning challenges in high-angled wells whilst the fg of depleted sections could be as low as 11 3 ppg requiring stringent control on downhole pressure while drilling to keep the hole pressure within the safe margin  optimum mud weights, safe drilling margins and casing setting points were determined for nine different well trajectories focusing on the azimuthal and inclination dependency of fracture and borehole collapse pressures    the subsequent drilling campaign of planned infill oil producers and water injectors in the field has been successful due to good drilling practices, using the recommended mud programs consistent with wellbore stability assessments, and careful bottomhole pressure control |

182259-ms 	 the far-field deformation induced by a fracture in a poroelastic layer with application to tiltmeter monitoring of hydraulic fractures in coal seams |abstract   measurements of deformations by using tiltmeters located at large or moderate distances from a hydraulic fracture (hf) have often been used to monitor fracture geometry  the fracture is generally represented as a singular point displacement discontinuity (dd) source, or as a constant dd over a rectangular plane, or as a distributed dd across a fracture plane, and the analytical solution for the induced deformation by a dd in a homogeneous elastic half-space is commonly used directly as a forward model for representing a simple fracture or as a building block for constructing a more complex fracture in mapping the fracture geometry  the mechanical properties of the coal seam in which an hf is placed are typically very different from those of the surrounding rocks  in addition, the poroleastic response associated with fracturing fluid leakoff from the fracture surface into the coal layer may also influence the hf growth and the induced deformation  in order to obtain a correct interpretation of the created fracture geometry and better understanding of the treating pressure behaviour in hydraulic fracturing stimulation of coal to enhance gas production, the mechanical property contrasts and the poroelastic effect induced by fluid leakoff need to be recognised and taken into account    in this paper, a mechanical model based on the concept of eigenstrain and the equivalent inclusion method is presented and applied to the problem of calculating the far-field deformation and stresses induced by a horizontal fracture located in a formation layer with mechanical properties different from those of the surrounding homogeneous elastic half-space  the fracture is modelled as a constant opening dd across the fracture plane, and the corresponding mathematically equivalent eigenstrain is defined based on the fracture opening and formation layer geometry  a simple one-dimensional hydromechanical model has been presented to approximate the fluid leakoff through the surface of a stationary fracture  the analytical solutions allow for estimating the importance of the poroelastic effect associated with an hf in a coal seam  the variation of the pore fluid content due to fracturing fluid leakoff is characterized by the poroelastic eigenstrain  a relationship connecting the induced far-field deformation and stresses with the fracture and formation layer geometry, the fluid leakoff volume, and the mechanical properties has been established  the proposed method offers a simple and computationally efficient forward model to take into account the effect of mechanical property contrasts and poroelasticity on the deformation induced by the fracture when using tiltmeter monitoring to map the geometry of an hf in a coal seam | 
182285-ms 	 change in geomechanical properties of limestone due to supercritical co2 injection |abstract   co2 geo-storage in deep saline aquifers or oil and gas reservoirs is a key technology to mitigate anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions  technically, co2 is captured from large emitters, e g  coal-fired power plants, and injected deep underground into geological formations  in case of hydrocarbon reservoirs, this can be combined with co2-enhanced petroleum recovery, which is rather efficient  one potential host rock for co2 is thus porous limestone; however, the geomechanical response (especially at the microscale) of the limestone when it is exposed to the acidic co2-fluids (co2 saturated brine or wet supercritical co2) is only poorly understood    we thus measured the geomechanical properties of savonnieres limestone cores before and after injection of supercritical co2 at the microscale  the co2 was injected at representative flow conditions: a fully brine saturated storage reservoir at approximately 1000m depth (323k temperature, 10 mpa pore pressure, 5 mpa effective stress) was simulated, and 10 pore volumes of supercritical co2 were injected at a capillary number of 10-6, which mimics storage conditions  the dynamic elastic properties and the formation factor were measured and compared with the geomechanical response    we found that the dynamic young’s modulus decreased, while permeability and porosity increased after scco2 injection; however, the micro-scale indentation moduli showed a dual behaviour: while the indentation modulus slightly increased in less consolidated rock areas, it decreased in the more and highly consolidated areas  we conclude that the scco2 injected into limestone weakens the well consolidated areas, but strengthens the weaker areas | 
182313-ms 	 demystifying log quality control |abstract   all would agree that bad data should not be let into the organization’s systems and its decision-making processes, yet there are no industry standard methods on how best to assure this for well log data  electric well logs are the principal data sets for all geotechnical personnel in this industry: logs generally constitute the main continuous and relatively high-resolution records describing a wellbore, and they are available over the main depth intervals of most wells drilled for hydrocarbon exploration and production    the specialized contractor companies that acquire the logs have quality management systems in place to ensure compliance and consistency with their own specifications  the data deliverables are therefore subject to some quality control before delivery to the operating companies, although it is of a general nature and focused on the acquired data, rather than on their future exploitation    on delivery, the responsibility for any post-acquisition quality control of the well logs frequently falls on inadequately trained and supervised geotechnical persons, who may skim over it on account of its being "too hard" or "too urgent"  people responsible for log quality control frequently report that they find it "difficult" or "overwhelming" and that they "don’t know where to start"  subject matter experts themselves know that logs must always be checked and perhaps conditioned before they can be used  yet few of them have simultaneously the knowledge, the experience, the reference information, the tools and the time to verify the fitness-for-purpose of the data methodically and confidently  this systematic requirement is costly for organizations, and its uncertainty exposes them to unnecessary risks  the situation is exacerbated by concurrent increases in the variety, volume and complexity of the log data and in their rates of change    there must be a better way to assure log data quality and readiness for exploitation  the objective of this paper is to propose a framework to formalize and simplify log quality control in operating companies and other data-user organizations |

182499-ms 	 improving the sanding evaluation accuracy by integrating core tests, field observations and numerical simulation |abstract   managing sand production is becoming an increasingly important issue for petroleum production wells, particularly in challenging environments such as deep water, or gas fields with high flow rate production where sand tolerance is very low and changing the completion strategy could be costly  sand production prediction is an integral part of overall field development planning  consequently, it is important that the risk of sanding is accurately evaluated and appropriate measures are taken for well completion  the critical part in a sanding study is to define a proper rock deformation threshold based on laboratory tests or field observations  due to the lack of sufficient field sanding data or for the sake of modelling simplicity, the rock deformation threshold is frequently defined either inappropriately or too simplistically because of the failure to recognize the intrinsic heterogeneities of reservoir rocks    in this paper, two cases are presented with the deformation threshold "critical plastic strain limit" defined by a numerical simulation approach  one case represents a weak to medium-strength sandstone reservoir and the other a stronger, clean sandstone reservoir  in both cases, a comprehensive core testing dataset and a field-validated geomechanical model are available  in the weak-medium strength case, there were also several years of production history with sanding observations available from a few wells    the numerical method uses an elasto-plastic material model where the rock behaviour is numerically defined from systematic triaxial compressive core tests and a rock failure criterion based on the plastic strain limits modelled from advanced thick-walled cylinder (atwc) core tests with calibration against field sanding observations  from the modelling of a range of high-quality atwc tests and field sand production experiences, strong correlations are found between the critical strain limit and the rock compressive strength for both cases indicating different critical strain limit thresholds for different rock strengths and rock types    although high-porosity and weaker rocks may still have a higher risk of sand production than low-porosity and stronger rocks, the risk of sanding may not be as high as predicted if a single threshold is used for the entire rock strength and porosity range  the use of a single threshold for the whole field could over- or under- estimate the risk of sand production, especially for reservoirs with a moderate risk of sand production    sanding evaluations of the two cases revealed that the predicted sanding risk is potentially misleading if a simple sanding threshold is defined without adequately capturing the heterogeneity in reservoir rocks  this approach may prohibit the selection of an appropriate completion strategy for the entire field  this paper is concluded by presenting a rock testing program procedure for sanding evaluation studies to better capture the heterogeneity in reservoir rocks and, hence, to predict the sanding risk more reliably |

182737-ms 	 novel slim-matrix pdc construction boosts drilling efficiency: a field study |abstract   one of the perceived drawbacks of matrix polycrystalline diamond compact (pdc) bits compared with steel pdc bits is their restricted open-face volume and smaller blade standoff, which is primarily caused by the matrix pdc bits' brittle nature  increased blade standoff gives steel pdc bits a more hydraulically efficient body type, which directly affects rop  in many drilling applications, operators switch to steel pdc to take advantage of their hydraulic efficiency, and recent developments in hardfacing material has expanded the range of applications of such bits  however, there are applications that are still dominated by matrix pdc bits, and a need arose for matrix material that can allow the molding of slim, hydraulically efficient matrix bodies    a new matrix material with enhanced toughness allows for the design of a slim-body matrix construction  this innovative concept has been validated for structural integrity, which was the main perceived risk  the technology was rolled out for 8<u+00bd>-in and 12<u+00bc>-in hole sections and deployed in a field test campaign in all of egypt's different rock columns    the effect and value of faster rop increases with application complexity and depth and is directly proportional to rig spread rate  hence, realizing the application limits of slim-body matrix technology was the main intent of this study  success was measured by observing the effect of hydraulic efficiency across different fields in terms of rop and cost savings  further, to isolate the effect of slim-body construction, several tests were conducted between standard matrix and slim-body matrix construction using the same cutting structure layout and pdc cutter grade    the slim-body matrix construction demonstrates significant improvement in cost per foot for applications and is directly proportional to ucs  this feature is advantageous in interbedded applications, where formations fluctuate from hard to soft and vice versa along the drilled column  this new feature has since been standardized in matrix bits and is being rolled out across various applications with the intent of tackling more expensive drilling operations to show a greater reduction in cost per foot | 
182739-ms 	 role of wellbore imaging and specific mineralogy inputs data in bit selection and design softwares |abstract   formation drillability is one of the most important aspects for planning and designing a new oil/gas well since the factors affecting the drilling performance have complex relationships between formation properties, drill bit design and operational parameters  in view of the high operating cost of drilling rigs, if rate of penetration (rop) can be enhanced, it will reduce open-hole formation exposure time and complications associated with it, resulting in significant savings in drilling time and cost can be realized    normally bit engineers utilize the assumed lithology from mud logs and detailed depth-wise lithology of offset wells  the lithology can also be interpreted from conventional logging data such as sonic, gamma and density  furthermore, the rock's compressive strength is calculated using compressional / shear travel time (sonic log), bulk density (density log) and shale content (gamma log)    these utilized tools to detect the lithology and rock mechanical properties have an extent of uncertainty due to effects either related to the borehole or drilling fluids that require extensive corrections  that degree of uncertainty subsequently can affect the drill bit design criteria, selection and viability of performance-enhancing features    this present paper reveals a new practical approach as a solution to minimize uncertainty in terms of bit design and selection by utilizing wellbore imaging either lwd and/or wireline borehole images and lithology & mineralogy from either wireline mineralogy logs "pulsed neutron" and/or roqsacn instrument to precisely deliver an accurate input data to the drill bit design/selection software modules |

182919-ms 	 abu dhabi stress map, uae |abstract   as drilling of horizontal wells is increasing in abu dhabi, so is the need for a stress map  in this paper, such a map, composed of the in-situ stress field of abu dhabi, is determined by the analysis of borehole breakouts and drilling-induced tensile fractures along with the results of 1-d mechanical earth models  stress orientations are variable across the abu dhabi fields as a whole; however, within 3 of 5 individual stress provinces defined in abu dhabi, mean stress orientations are statistically significant  the stress provinces and stress trajectory mapping reveal that they are systematic continental-scale rotations of stress orientations within abu dhabi  the stress orientations are not parallel to the direction of absolute plate motion of the arabian plate, nonetheless; the regional pattern of stress orientation is consistent with plate boundary forces controlled by the complex nature of the subduction in the northeastern boundary of the eurasian-arabian plates    to date, 130 1-d mem's were generated, 98 of them expose the in-situ stress orientations, which have been compiled as the cornerstone of abu dhabi stress map  of these, over 57 are considered reliable tectonic stress indicators, recording horizontal stress orientations to within ±15°  remarkably, a good correlation was observed among stress orientations deduced from in-situ stress measurements and geologic observations made in the upper 1–2 km and in well bore breakouts extending to 2–3 km depth  the stress fields are believed to be largely the result of compressional forces associated with the subduction of the arabian plate beneath the eurasian plate and possibly from the divergent movement of the red sea along with the sinistral movement of the aqaba-levant fault boundaries  knowledge of the contemporary crustal in-situ stress is of great importance for several applications, such as, borehole stability, hydraulic stimulation and understanding of the structural evolution of the terrain | 
182920-ms 	 basin scale geomechanical modeling of tight carbonate reservoir in abu dhabi: implications on pore pressure development |abstract   the in-situ stress state in a rock mass is widely recognized as being of major importance in unconventional field  the inherent variation of stress distribution associated with geological environments is widely recognized as being a key factor in an unconventional field; hence, the need to understand from the basin-scale phase is critical  the three main ingredients needed to formulate a model for the mechanics of the porous sediments, are the concepts of bulk stress, pore pressure and compaction  most available rock-stress-based numerical engines uses default laboratory properties for the set of lithology's in their library  however, understanding the mechanical properties of the lithologies and applying such to the model makes the result more representative of the local geology    this paper is an update on the previously published model (mohamed et al , 2015), exploring the impact of rock stress and external geomechanical boundary (otherwise known as tectonic stress) on pore pressure development and rock failure  middle cretaceous formation (layer of interest ~ 150 m) was sub-divided into seven layers based on mechanical log signatures  athy's law, formulated with effective stress combined with 3-d rock stress based on poro-elasticity, was used in the forward modeling simulator to improve the pore pressure prediction  depositional events such as erosion and hiatus periods were also taken into account during simulation  the development of porosity, pore pressure, temperature, stress and related rock failure through time were simulated and calibrated to measured data  the main geomechanical properties, such as young's modulus, poisson ratio, cohesion and friction angle depend on lithology and porosity  appropriate relationship were established and ultimately used to calibrate the first–pass rock properties prediction from the numerical engine  model porosity is dependent on burial depth, weight of the overburden sediment columns, and lithology properties  the mean stress was ultimately considered in deriving pore pressure results    results reveal a dynamic representation of the three principal effective and total stresses within the studied formations  the maximum stress shows a ne-sw trend in the synclinal area and n-s trend on the anticlinal structures, the medium stress shows n-s trend on the synclinal structure with an e-w and nw-se trend on well a and pseudo-well a wells respectively  the minimum stress reveals a nw-se direction on the synclinal area and n-s trend on both flanks  the model also shows an improved pore pressure result ranging from 26 97 – 42 50 mpa (with 28 46 mpa average values within layers of interest) revealing ~ 1450 psi (10 mpa) difference when compared to the previous model where rock stress modeling was not performed | 
182924-ms 	 using innovative surface mounted technology to boost production from low pressure oil wells and revive dead wells without any well intervention |abstract   innovative velocity spooltm (surface jet pump) technology combined with novel compact separation was tested at a remote onshore wellhead location in saudi arabia to see if it could increase multi-phase production from low pressure oil wells that were already producing and revive wells that were backed out/not flowing    the velocity spool (vs) is a passive device which utilises often wasted fluid energy (via a choke) from a high pressure (hp) well to reduce the back-pressure of a low pressure (lp) well and boost its' flow to the production manifold  for the vs to work efficiently on multi-phase oil wells, a compact in-line separator is installed upstream to bulk separate the gas and liquid fluids    for this trial, one of caltec's patented vs multiphase skids was installed at an onshore wellhead location and connected to existing hp and lp wells  production from both wells was diverted to the vs to test its effectiveness  the trial tests lasted 3 months    results from the first set of tests showed that the vs boosted production from an lp oil well that was already flowing by an additional average of 400 bbls/d with a corresponding wellhead pressure reduction of 45 psi  results from the second set of tests showed that the vs revived a dead well that had not been flowing since 2004 and made it flow at an average rate of 1100 bbl/d with a backpressure pressure reduction ranging from 54 to 27 psi  prior to the trial, several attempts had been made to bring this dead well back into production using other methods but these had not been successful  the results showed conclusively that the vs was very effective in boosting production from lp oil wells using passive surface mounted equipment and avoiding any well intervention  the production gain was achieved by lowering the fhwp of the well and the amount of gain was dependent on the productivity index of the well    the advantages that the vs offers over conventional technologies such as multi-phase pumps and esps are several: it is tolerant to variations in flow conditions, gas volume fractions (gvf) and associated slugging (without affecting performance), it is surface mounted (so well intervention is not required), low cost, easy to deploy, has no moving parts, consumes zero fuel gas/electrical power and uses already available surplus energy    this paper reports the trial results and discusses the use of velocity spools as an alternative to other boosting methods for oil production  the design and operational criteria of the vs are also highlighted |

182958-ms 	 lwd sonic through casing to measure slowness and evaluate cement success while drilling - a first in saudi arabia |abstract   acoustic measurements are used throughout the lifetime of a well, from seismic to production  logging while drilling (lwd) sonic is traditionally used to log formation slowness in the open hole  in this case study we show that both, measuring formation slowness and evaluating the success of a cementing operation can be obtained with the latest generation of lwd sonic tools while drilling, thus saving rig time, simplifying operations, and adding safety to well integrity solutions  both, formation slowness and well integrity are often an essential criterion for the decision whether to drill ahead or to take additional measures to assure well integrity    in this case study we have demonstrated that there is additional approach wherein formation slowness can also be recorded/captured in cased hole with lwd tools when the cement bonding is sufficient to allow good coupling  continuous formation compressional and shear slowness was recorded and extracted for most of the interval below top of cement (toc) and some short intervals above toc  this advanced technique of logging formation slowness through casing with lwd can complement or even save an additional logging run in some cases and therefore result in significant savings to the operator    where azimuthal cement evaluation is not a strict requirement, knowing the top-of-cement (toc) from lwd can help to confirm well integrity without adding rig-time  should the measured toc be lower than required, then more advanced analysis can be run for additional investigation | 
182977-ms 	 an integrated geomechanics and real time pore pressure approach helps to successfully drill the first horizontal well along the minimum horizontal stress direction in tight sandstone formations |abstract   an operator in the middle east is seeking to develop its natural gas resources to meet rising energy demand  this operator is drilling horizontal wells along the minimum horizontal stress direction in an attempt to generate multiple transverse fractures during stimulation to increase gas production in unconventional reservoirs  however, drilling operations in these wells is extremely difficult because of the in situ stress environment; these conditions result in a significantly increased number of stuck pipe incidents, wellbore collapse, incurring remarkably high nonproductive time  this paper describes the methodology used to define and calibrate the safe mud window for the curve and lateral section of the first horizontal well drilled in tight sandstone formation by conducting a wellbore stability study and real time drilling geomechanics and pore pressure monitoring  the wellbore stability study incorporates all logs and rock mechanical properties propagated on the direction survey and proposed formation tops of the planned horizontal well x-56  the well was drilled successfully with a mud weight of95 pcfto 98 pcf in the curve section and 100 pcfto 106 pcf in the horizontal section  major technical contributions of this paper include: (1) characterization of geopressures and stress field in different formations calibrated with real time data, (2) back analysis methodology to estimate fracture gradient from formation integrity test (fit) & image logs, in addition to this (3) pore pressure zones designation along the stratigraphic column | 
182994-ms 	 uncertainty reduction in geomechanical modeling using continuous core based data in a giant field, abu dhabi, uae |abstract   this paper focuses on a tight carbonate reservoir in a giant field in abu dhabi by identifying shortcomings in conventional modeling strategies for geomechanics and demonstrating the benefits of continuous core data to build more reliable 1-d mechanical earth models (mem)    a 1-d mem was built from the sonic wireline log, which shows significant difference with a profile of ultrasonic p-wave velocity (vp) measured on cores  however, results of rock mechanical tests (rmt) on plug samples (including ultrasonic vp measurements at different stress conditions, and stress-strain curves from triaxial tests) are consistent with the core-based vp profile    we investigate the impact of stresses, resolution and fluid saturation on sonic velocities to reveal the possible shortcomings of sonic wireline logs as an input for geomechanical models and the greater relevance of using core based ultrasonic velocities measured on dry cores for the upscaling of static elastic moduli    finally we propose an empirical relation to correct sonic wireline logs for geomechanical modeling in offset wells    the following conclusions can be drawn from this study:    the core based vp profile, which is highly consistent with the rmt results, ultimately leads to opposed trends in the in-situ horizontal stresses predictions compared to those of a 1-d mem based on the non-calibrated wireline sonic log    only unrealistic reservoir stress conditions could reconcile ultrasonic vp measured on plugs at different stress states with wireline sonic velocities;   using a low resolution vp profile at reservoir stress conditions (combining vp from plug samples and core based continuous vp profile), we show that differences in stress only partially explain the discrepancy between velocities measured on plugs and wireline sonic velocities    although a conventional gassman fluid correction could explain the remaining differences between core measurements and the wireline sonic, its practical application would require the detailed knowledge of the rock mineralogy and of the saturation along the well    conversely, a profile of the bulk modulus of the rock mineral fraction can be derived from the sonic log and the ultrasonic p-wave velocities measured on dry cores corrected for stresses effects    evidences in the drilling data suggest that the discrepancies between the core based sonic velocities and the wireline sonic could be due to natural fractures in the borehole vicinity    an empirical relationship involving wireline logs only was established to correct the sonic wireline log to enhance the reliability of geomechanical models for offset wells   |these findings have important implications for the practical applications of 1-d mem, such as the design of hydraulic fractures  quality control of the sonic logs with extensive data acquired on dry cores reduces the uncertainty when upscaling static elastic properties  continuous velocity profiles acquired on dry cores are therefore highly valuable to calibrate empirical corrections of sonic logs for geomechanical modeling in offset wells |

183204-ms 	 estimating maximum horizontal stress from multi-arm caliper data in vertical wells in oman |abstract   characterization of magnitudes and directions of principal stresses is vital for building a geomechanical model  the magnitude of the maximum horizontal stress is most challenging to estimate among three principal stresses  meanwhile a well known kirsch solution formulated in terms of displacements, allows for estimating the ratio of minimum to maximum horizontal stress in vertical wells when displacements of the borehole wall can be measured (e g , by multi-arm caliper)  this study evaluates the limits of applicability of such analysis    multi-arm caliper readings may be indicative of both inelastic (i e , rock failure) and elastic (e g , contraction) deformation  in case of inelastic deformation (e g , breakouts or key seats) kirsch solution is not applicable  meanwhile within the limits of elasticity, the solution can be more useful  drilling history or a bhi log may assist in identifying zones where no failure or yielding have occurred  then, potentially, the solution allows for reconstructing two of the following parameters: i) ratio of the minimum to maximum principal stresses acting in the plane orthogonal to the wellbore axis, ii) static young's modulus, and iii) static poisson ratio  the suggested approach includes the following two steps  in the first step multi-arm caliper data are used to calculate the ratio of minimum to maximum displacement ku and translate it to the ratio of stresses  where v is the static poisson ratio  in the second step the analytical solutions for non-kirsch displacements can be used to estimate static shear modulus    practical application of the methodology highlighted the need for additional calibration of the log derived data  firstly, the displacements derived from the multi-arm caliper need to be corrected in regard to the orientation of the caliper arms relative to the principal stress directions  because of the irregularities in caliper signatures this can be challenging especially if the principal directions are not known  secondly, careful analysis of the resistivity logs indicates that caliper measuremenst may be affected by the formation of a filter cake  finally, the estimate of the elastic moduli relies on accurate calculations of displacements  the case study discussed in this paper, illustrates that the desirable accuracy may not be attainable because the actual borehole diameter may be uncertain (e g , due to back reaming or a filter cake) or the accuracy of caliper readings may be inadequate  meanwhile the estimation of the maximum stress relies on the displacement ratio ku rather than the absolute value of the displacement  hence, the estimate for the ratio is expected to be more accurate    the suggested technique allows for easy estimation of the maximum horizontal stress  in some cases when borehole diameter is certain and caliper readings are accurate, the technique also provides the means for estimating static shear modulus  the estimate can be further used to decrease the uncertainty of the results obtained with more conventional and sophisticated approaches | 
183239-ms 	 nmr characterization of fluid imbibition in thinly-layered source rocks – where oil and brine invade in the mixed-wet pore system |abstract   the drilling/fracturing of lateral wells in thinly laminated source rocks often confronts critical wellbore instability and fluid loss problems  these problems are mainly caused by the leakage of the fluids into the rock matrix through a system of fine layers and immense network of natural fractures  it is conceived that the penetration of fluids perturbs the rock’s effective stress state or alters its strength  nevertheless a thorough understanding of the instability phenomenon has not been introduced yet where numerous questions over the underlying mechanisms remain unresolved  for instance in a mixed-wet rock system it is unclear how an oil based mud (obm) or water based mud (wbm) invades the different pore volumes; what are the effects of the clay content, types (swelling or not) and total organic content (toc) including their spatial distribution in the shale matrix, and so on?   in this work, we perform nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) measurements on highly laminated source rocks which are sequentially saturated by spontaneous imbibition of diesel and 5% kcl brine  we probe the rate and capacity of oil/brine imbibition focusing on the wetting characteristics of the bedding planes, the effects of mineralogy, toc, and the connected pore network in the kerogen and inorganic matrix on the fluid distribution inside these rocks  hence, we provide guidelines for optimizing drilling-fluid design, horizontal drilling and fracturing operations    for each of the source rocks studied, samples were drilled parallel and perpendicular to the beddings  then, each sample is cut into twin plugs which are submitted to two sequent imbibition experiments: 1- regular imbibition experiment where one of the twin plugs imbibed oil and the other imbibed brine for varied times, and 2- reverse imbibition experiment where the twin plugs are interchanged to imbibe the other fluid  the mineral elements, phases and the toc of the rocks were measured using x-ray fluorescence (xrf), x-ray diffraction (xrd) and hawk pyrolysis, respectively    the measured nmr t2 spectra showed that all samples were able to imbibe both oil and brine with a clear preference of oil indicating a mixed wettability state of these source rocks  this is attributed to the coexistence of organic and inorganic pores in these rocks  moreover, the prevalence of surface relaxation on the nmr dynamics was prominent as all t2 relaxations took place at time scales (t2 <u+2264> 100 ms) much shorter than their bulk values  upon imbibition, brine is observed to flow along the bedding planes which are rich in clay minerals and therefore forming pathways of minimum flow energy  indeed, the interaction between brine and clay is identified to be the potential driver of the rock stability problems especially near the wellbore; however it is firmly dependent on the type of existing clays  oil is absorbed faster than brine and in larger volumes  the discrepancies between oil and brine imbibition is magnified by the presence of fractures which enhanced the network connectivity of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic pores or even across them  furthermore, the fractures allowed the fluids to surpass the vertical bedding planes and thus accelerating the fluid distribution processes inside the pore space |

183307-ms 	 optimizing unconventional completions - an integrated approach |abstract   north american unconventional well completion design has evolved dramatically since 2013 in an effort to keep pace with the productivity gains realized in horizontal drilling  several trends have emerged during the current industry downturn  among these trends are a focus on core acreage with higher yield potential, the use of longer laterals, a movement towards higher proppant loading (pounds per linear foot), an increased reliance on plug and perf techniques, and decreased stage length and perforation cluster spacing (increased perf density)  as a result associated improvements in well initial production (ip) rates and estimated ultimate recoveries (eur's) have been highlighted in oil & gas operator's quarterly shareholder's reports during 2015 and early 2016    unconventional multi-stage completion designs have also quickly evolved along a path paralleling these trends  horizontal well ip rates and eur's have also been enhanced through the adoption of integrated completion designs  recently introduced geo-engineered completions rely on cross-functional expertise and software to integrate petrophysical, geomechanical, drilling, and production data into a completion design  in cases where geo-engineered designs were used, wells showed improvements in eur's over those associated with increased lateral lengths, proppant loading and stage counts  in one recent case using a geo-engineered design it was demonstrated that fewer stages and clusters achieved higher production than offset wells while injecting less proppant and fluid; thus achieving lower completion cost    the use of engineered workflows in tight or unconventional reservoirs is not new  multiple case histories have been published in recent literature illustrating the use of stress variability/contrast or mechanical specific energy (mse) to generate brittleness or other fraccability indices to group stages with similar rock characteristics  in contrast to engineered designs, newer geo-engineered designs integrate multiple inputs (attributes) to determine basin and formation-specific weighted algorithms that correlate to stage and cluster production contribution improvement  the geo-engineered approach has proven repeatable and can be accomplished even when key wireline or lwd data is not available    this paper will document how geo-engineered completion designs evolved from engineered workflows  multiple inputs (e g  production, wireline/lwd/mud logs, core analyses, and big data from national and state data bases) can be combined to determine stage length and perforation cluster positioning  case studies will demonstrate that geo-engineered horizontal completion designs deliver superior well production results when compared to geometric, high-intensity plug & perf designs |

183344-ms 	 geomechanical solutions for drilling through challenging nahr umr shale at high angle: a case study from offshore field, abu dhabi |abstract   adma-opco has undertaken a prestigious campaign to drill a large number of wells from artificial island in abc field, most of these wells are extended reach drilling (erd) wells with step-out up to around 18,000 ft  operational efficiency/costs for drilling erd wells is highly dependent on the wellbore stability, especially while drilling through the problematic nahr umr shale at different deviations and azimuths  nahr umr shale has a known history of causing wellbore instability in uae and the surrounding countries and therefore a geomechanical study was initiated to understand the geomechanical setting in abc field as well as fluid-rock interaction between drilling fluid and nahr umr shale formation  the main objectives of this geomechanical study were to optimize well design and drilling fluids in order to drill through nahr umr shale interval efficiently, additionally estimation of sustainable pressure variation that major faults can take without being reactivated was also performed    an integrated geomechanical study including a 3d geomechanical modeling was carried out, in order to ensure drilling through nahr umr shale formation efficiently  this study covered formation petrophysical characterization, chemical tests on cuttings from nahr umr shale, chemo-poroelastic modeling, weak bedding analysis and also faults reactivation analysis    based on the study mentioned above, both customized drilling fluids program and suitable mud weights were optimized to stabilize nahr umr shale, and mitigate different types of wellbore instability issues  in addition to mud fluid optimization, the sustainable pore pressure variation was also estimated for several major faults    a successful drilling campaign is in progress; so far many deviated wells have been completed without any noticeable troubles while drilling through nahr umr shale  this geomechanical model is helping to implement an effective drilling program for a smooth well placement  a learning curve has been building up continuously for handling more complex well trajectories successfully in the future  from this study, it was realized that, not only fluid-rock interaction and geomechanics related factors need to be taken into consideration for stabilizing a wellbore, but also special attention is needed for the existing micro-fractures within the formation, where increase in mud weight may make hole condition worse  a balanced approach has been adopted including drilling fluid optimization in order to avoid possible multiple failure mechanisms | 
183378-ms 	 deriving 3d model of reservoir geomechanical properties through an integrated geostatistical and basin modeling approach - an example from a mature field in saskatchewan, western canada |abstract   measurement of geomechanical properties using seismic and laboratory methods have been used in oil and gas industry for several years  laboratory methods, in most cases, take only small samples from consolidated rocks, which may not be representative of the elastic regime existing in the reservoir owing to sample size  in general, geomechanical studies are performed on a well-by-well basis  measurements calculated at the wellsite are then used as calibration points to convert the 3-d seismic data to geomechanical cube  however, elastic properties measured this way are restricted to the well location and cannot be interpolated across the reservoir  to overcome these challenges, this paper describes an approach for deriving and discretizing geomechanical and other elastic properties in the reservoir by integrating results of 3d geo-cellular and basin models    the workflow presented in this paper is utilized to calculate cell-by-cell elastic properties of the reservoir by integrating parameters from both basin model and 3d geo-cellular grid  the basin model reconstructs the geologic history (i e  burial history) by back-stripping the reservoir to its original depositional thickness  through this reconstruction, the mechanical compaction, pore pressures, effective stress, and porosity-vs-depth relationships are established for the reservoirs  in the final stage, dicretized calculations of geomechanical properties are assigned to each lithotype (facies) in the geomodel  the discretization of elastic properties into 3d grids resulted in better understanding of the prevailing rock elastic properties and stress regimes helping hydraulic fracturing operators in the effective design of their depletion strategies with minimal drilling risks and costs  this approach provides an innovative way of determining effective minimum horizontal stress for the entire reservoir through distribution of elastic properties in a 3d grid  the conventional approach of using small sample plugs is not sufficient to describe elastic properties for an entire reservoir and can be replaced by current approach |

183513-ms 	 mechanical anisotropy of unconventional shale – build the correct relationship between static and dynamic properties |abstract   most of unconventional shales are mechanically anisotropic and usually treated as transversely isotropic (tiv) media  full anisotropy characterization of gas shale samples traditionally requires laboratory tests on several plugs cut along different orientations to the bedding  in practice, very often, this is untenable – due to the scarcity of shale plugs, experimental challenges, cost consideration and other factors  as alternate, ultrasonic measurements are only performed along the longitudinal axis of the sample, where the apparent dynamic properties are determined using isotropic media equations, and then used to build a correlation model between static and dynamic properties  however, such approximations could result in significant difference in reservoir rock mechanical properties determined from downhole acoustic logging measurements when the simplified apparent dynamic/static correlation model is used    the paper performs ultrasonic measurements, velocity anisotropy analysis, and triaxial compression testing on a series of shale samples cut in two orientations – parallel and perpendicular to the bedding  the static young's moduli measured along the bedding are not always higher than those measured perpendicular to the bedding  for the samples tested, horizontal plugs generally have higher young's moduli than vertical plugs in the range of low modulus, while lower than vertical plugs in the high modulus range  generally, horizontal plugs have relatively higher static poisson's ratios than vertical plugs  both the dynamic and apparent dynamic young's moduli are higher than the static moduli  there exist strong correlations between the dynamic/apparent dynamic and static moduli  however, the apparent dynamic moduli seem to have a relative better correlation with static values than the dynamic ones  in addition, the apparent dynamic moduli are higher than dynamic ones when they are measured perpendicular to the bedding, while they are almost the same when measured parallel to the bedding    the discrepancy observed between the dynamic (measured from velocity anisotropy analysis) and apparent dynamic (using the isotropic model) confirms the importance of distinguishing and carefully selecting between these values when building static-dynamic relations for log-core calibration  the method of performing velocity anisotropy analysis on one horizontal plug only enables one to obtain the complete dynamic properties for the transversely isotropic media, which could considerably simplify the anisotropic measurements, save core material, and make much more geomechanical data available for shale well development |

183545-ms 	 a holistic approach to develop new rigorous empirical correlation for static young's modulus |abstract   evaluating the elastic parameters of reservoir section are very essential for oil and gas industry in alleviating the risks associated with the drilling and production phases of the reservoir  these parameters are used in the optimization of the well placement, well bore instability, completion design, and draw-down limits to avoid sanding, hydraulic fracturing, reservoir subsidence and in many more applications  to carry out any aforementioned operations, a continuous profiles of rock elastic parameters are needed  misleading estimation of elastic parameters may wrongly lead to heavy investment decisions and inappropriate field development plans    retrieving reservoir rock samples throughout the depth of the reservoir section and performing laboratory tests on them are extremely expensive as well as time consuming  therefore, these parameters are estimated from empirical correlations  most of the previous models/correlations were developed using linear or non-linear regression techniques  artificial intelligence tool once optimized for training can successfully model elastic parameters since these tools are capable of capturing highly complex and non-linear relationship between the input parameters and the target parameter    the objective of this study is to develop a robust and an accurate model for static young's modulus based on the wireline logs as an input using three artificial intelligence tools (artificial neural network, adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system and support vector machine)  the data on which these ai models are built comprises of more than 680 real field data points from different fields covering a wide range of values  based on the minimum error and the highest coefficient of determination between actual and simulated data artificial neural network is selected as the proposed ai model to predict static young's modulus    a comparison between the static young's moduli predicted by the proposed model with the published models /correlations reveals that neural network model gives significantly less average absolute percentage error  finally, a rigorous empirical correlation is developed using the weights of ann model in order to make the ai black box model as a white box and universal that can be usable for field applications |

18627-ms 	 analytical solution of matrix permeability of organic-rich shale |abstract   apparent matrix permeability of organic-rich shale is complicated because of its unique pore structure, gas storage and transport mechanisms  in inorganic pores, free gas is the only phase considered  while in organic pores, adsorbed phase coexists with free gas  surface diffusion is the transport mechanism of the adsorbed phase  however, transport mechanism of free gas varies during production and is distinguished by the knudsen number  slip flow, transition flow, knudsen diffusion and surface diffusion are found in organic pores, whereas only slip flow and transition flow occur in inorganic pores  the effects of pore size, pressure and temperature on the transport mechanism are discussed  pressure reduction causes a change in transport mechanisms during production  stress dependency of inorganic pores is one of the factors that affect pore size, transport mechanism and permeability  the apparent permeability is derived by calculating the geometric average of permeability of different units with varying pore sizes and permeabilities  sensitivity analysis shows that stress-dependency plays an important role in inorganic pores, which results in the positive correlation between permeability and pressure  conversely, in inorganic pores, permeability increases as pressure decreases  as a result, permeability decreases and then increases with decreasing pressure | 
18694-ms 	 multistage fracturing optimization for the successful development of a complex tight-gas reservoir in western india: case study |abstract   for decades, the oil and gas exploration industry evaluated assets and screened them for future development based on certain characteristic requirements/pay cutoffs such as shale percentage, water saturation, and porosity  reservoirs that did not meet these specific requirements were considered uneconomical and not considered for further development  currently, as the demand for energy is continuously rising, those reservoirs that were considered uneconomical in the past because of a lack of original hydrocarbon flow capacity and were overlooked are attracting significant attention for development globally, and now a considerable percentage of the world hydrocarbon production is coming from these emerging unconventional reservoirs, such as shale gas, tight gas, and coalbed methane  the challenge in developing these unconventional assets is that they cannot produce at economic rates without an effective stimulation treatment  to achieve the required reservoir stimulation effectiveness, a coherent understanding of the subsurface characteristics of the reservoir is necessary, such as depositional environment, structural and lithological characteristics, rock mechanics, and geomechanical properties  this thorough evaluation of the reservoir is needed not only to determine the best stimulation approach but also to aid in deciding the most suitable well architecture—trajectory, azimuth, and completion concept—to maximize the benefit of the planned stimulation concept  whereas the stimulation treatment design was usually only considered later in the life of the reservoir, for these formations, it is considered during a much earlier stage in the planning phase, moving from a drill-to- produce to a drill-to-stimulate and late-produce concept  hydraulic fracturing is the most effective and widely used stimulation concept in modern times and was vital for making the shale gas plays in north america economic assets  lately, it has attracted much attention, and a significant amount of scientific/engineering efforts are being exerted to develop a better understanding of how rocks will behave under hydraulic fracturing conditions  understanding rock major behavioral characteristics, such as failure mechanisms, fracture growth patterns, and fracture height containment, is crucial for identifying the fracturing strategy, rate requirement, treatment volumes, and, more importantly, the number of stages required to maximize the stimulated reservoir volume (srv) and hence a single well's deliverability | 
18701-ms 	 model fracture formation in mechanical layers during basin burial effects of mechanical properties stress fields pore-pressure and layer thickness |abstract   the aim of this paper is to provide analytical solutions of stress fields in mechanical layers which consist of stiff and soft or compliant layers  the paper examines possible geological conditions of mode i (extension) fracture development on the basis of the analytical calculations with various layer thicknesses, young's moduli, poisson's ratios, external stress fields and pore-fluid pressure  linear elastic model with two different mechanical layers is assumed for the calculations  fluid-driven fractures, hydrofractures, are discussed in detail elsewhere and are not considered here  layer-parallel stresses in the model caused by external stresses and pore-fluid pressure are mathematically calculated for both stiff and soft layers  relative young's modulus and relative thickness between the two types of layers are applied to simplify the associated equations  poisson's ratio v is assumed to be same between the two  this is because the possible variation of poisson's ratio between rocks is much smaller than those of the other parameters  the calculated ratio of minimum to maximum principal stresses within each layer is used to estimate fracture type which can develop under various geological conditions  the results indicate extension fracture preferably develop in stiff layer  stress conditions in the model are primarily controlled by relationship among external horizontal stress <u+03c3>xx, vertical stress <u+03c3>zz and pore-fluid pressure pf: no tensile fracture forms when <u+03c3>xx > pf + v(<u+03c3>zz - pf)/(1 - v); tensile fractures can form only in stiff layers in soft-layer-dominant system when pf + v(<u+03c3>zz - pf)/(1 - v) > <u+03c3>xx > pf; tensile fractures form in stiff layers in both stiff-layer-dominant and soft-layer-dominant systems when pf > <u+03c3>xx > 4pf/3 - <u+03c3>zz/3; tensile fracture can form in both stiff and soft layers in soft-layer-dominant formation with small relative young's modulus when 4pf/3 - <u+03c3>zz/3 > <u+03c3>xx  only shear fractures can form in soft layers, except the rare geological condition of 4pf/3 - <u+03c3>zz/3 > <u+03c3>xx with very small relative young's modulus  the results of analytical calculations provide potential criterion to estimate when and where layer-scale extension fracture network develops in relation with geological history  one implication of the results is that extension fracture formation is not necessarily related to regional tensile stress field but ratio among horizontal stress, vertical stress and pore-fluid pressure  this implies that extension fracture network can form in mechanical layers not only during crustal uplift/exhumation but also during basin-burial in which horizontal stress, vertical stress and pore-fluid pressure are increasing |

18790-ms 	 geomechanical aspects of waterflooding: setting strategies and operational limits for containment |abstract   waterflooding is often planned for unconsolidated sand reservoirs for pressure support or production enhancement  injections may be carried out under "matrix" or "fracture" conditions  despite the typically high permeability and high porosity nature of unconsolidated sand reservoirs, global experiences suggest that water injection in such formations is not trouble free  under matrix injection significant injectivity decline due to formation plugging could be encountered within the first few years or even months of the injector start up, particularly in the absence of fine filtering of water  injection under fracture conditions may be considered to avoid formation plugging and injectivity decline  however field evidences suggest that "fracture" water injection in unconsolidated soft reservoirs could lead to high pressures, potential loss of containment and failure of sand control  the consequence of severe injectivity loss for either injection strategy is early injector abandonment or replacement of expensive wells and production deferment or loss of waterflood reserves    considering the above limitations for different injection strategies, it is paramount that geological settings, formation type, rock mechanical properties and consolidation levels are considered in selecting water injection strategy, well completion and topsides filtration design in field development planning  even with these considerations it is often not possible to confidently predict the performance of water injectors in unconsolidated sand, particularly under fractured conditions  there is no widely accepted theoretical understanding of the fracturing process in soft formations and therefore the predictive capabilities for modelling injectivity are quite limited    this paper presents the geomechanical factors considered for selecting the waterflooding strategy for a particular deepwater, unconsolidated soft sand reservoir in offshore sabah, malaysia  the actual decision making process was based on an integrated approach between various subsurface and engineering disciplines  however, due to the unconsolidated formation settings, as well as the faulted nature of the caprock and reservoir, geomechanics played a critical role in devising the waterflood deployment strategy and setting operational limits to ensure containment  the work involved comprehensive geomechanical modelling of the waterflooding process in the reservoir using both analytical and 3d numerical modelling  global experiences of waterflooding in unconsolidated formations were also invaluable and were integrated in selection of completions and development strategy |

19005-ms 	 a new artificial intelligence based empirical correlation to predict sonic travel time |abstract   sonic logs can be used to estimate rock elastic parameters that are useful in obtaining the in-situ stresses of the rock  in cases where the sonic log is missing, the log values are estimated using empirical correlations  since conducting sonic logging involves time and cost, the industry relies on empirical models  however, none of the available models are universally accepted by log analysts because each model estimates the sonic log values significantly different from the others  the error in sonic log values affects the elastic parameters, which can result in either underestimation or overestimation of the in-situ stresses    the objective of this paper is to develop simple and accurate model to determine sonic travel time based on gamma ray, bulk density and neutron porosity because these three logs are generally available for every well  artificial neural networks are used for the development of the model  an attempt has also been done to converge the results into one simple empirical correlation using the weights of ann model in order to make the model equation universal and usable for field applications    several empirical correlations from literature were selected and subjected to same real field well log data as the ai model to predict sonic travel time and the results showed that ann model was able to predict sonic logs with 96% accuracy with a correlation coefficient of 0 96 while other correlations did the same but with lesser accuracy  in addition, the developed empirical correlation from the weights of ann model gives exactly the same results as predicted by the ann model    the developed model along with the empirical correlation can serve as handy tool to help geo-mechanical engineers detremine the reservoir geo-mechanical parameters and design any operation in cases where sonic logs are not available |

2014-1934272-pa 	 observations of tensile fracturing of anisotropic rocks |summary |hydraulic fracturing is crucial to hydrocarbon recovery from resource plays and is essential to exploitation of geothermal energy  this process creates new tensile fractures and reactivates existing natural fractures, forming a highly conductive stimulated-reservoir volume (srv) around the borehole  although this process has been extensively studies and modeled for isotropic rock, only a limited number of studies have been performed for anisotropic rocks, such as shales, gneisses, and foliated granites  the fracturing process of anisotropic rocks such as shales is examined in this study  we divide the rock anisotropy into two anisotropic groups: conventional and veined  two members of the conventional first group are lyons sandstone, a brittle, quartz-dominated, low-porosity and -permeability, anisotropic (11%) material; and pyrophyllite, a monomineralic-clay-rich, strongly anisotropic (19%) metamorphic rock similar chemically and mechanically to shale with extremely low porosity and permeability  the second group consists of a suite of natural shale samples (18% anisotropy) from the wolfcamp formation containing mineralized veins  fracture initiation and propagation are studied during brazilian tests  strain gauges and acoustic-emission (ae) sensors record the deformation leading to and during failure  scanning-electron-microscope (sem) imaging and surface profilometry are used to study the post-failure fracture system and failed surface topology  post-fracture permeability is measured as a function of effective stress  the influence of anisotropy on fracturing is investigated by rotating the sample-fabric direction relative to the loading axis through increments of 15°  |the rock microstructure, lamination, and brittleness control the activation of the layers  lyons sandstone shows a wide brittle fracture with larger process zone with twice as much layer activation at lower stress levels than pyrophyllite  the fracturing process in veined shale is, however, a coupled function of rock fabric and mineral veins  the veins easily activate at 15° orientation with respect to the loading axis at stress levels of 30% of the unveined-failure load  the resulting unpropped fracture has enhanced permeability by orders of magnitude  we suggest that fracturing from a deviated well reduces the breakdown pressure significantly (compared with a vertical well) and activates a large number of veins with enhanced conductivity without the need for excessive proppant |

2016-032 	 modeling multiple curved fractures connected through a wellbore using a fluid-coupled xfem algorithm |abstract: |a significant challenge in horizontal well stimulation is the ability to simultaneously generate multiple hydraulic fractures (hf) with roughly uniform dimensions within a single stage  when the fractures are relatively close, the outer fractures in a stage exert a strong confining stress on the inner fractures, inhibiting their development and the desired uniform growth of fractures in the stage  there is thus a need to develop computational tools to analyze this mutual interaction between propagating hf to seek designs that can mitigate this inhibition phenomenon which is known as stress shadowing  in this paper, we report the development of an axisymmetric extended finite element method (xfem) that can model multiple simultaneously propagating hf that are able to curve (forming bowl-shaped fractures) and which is able to autonomously partition the flux of fluid among the hf in the stage  to test the flux partitioning algorithm, we compare the xfem code to a parallel planar displacement discontinuity (dd) code  to test the hf curving due to mutual interaction, we compare the xfem to an axisymmetric dd code, which can model two symmetric fractures that can curve due to mutual interaction  finally, we describe an experiment in which five mutually interacting hf with flux partitioning are allowed to curve, and we compare the results to the case in which the five hf are constrained to develop in distinct parallel planes  |introduction |horizontal wells frequently have a significant number of nonproducing perforation clusters in a given stage due to variations in the reservoir properties and the phenomenon of stress shadowing, in which the confining stress induced by the outer fractures in a stage serves to inhibit the growth of the inner fractures  it is thus desirable to develop computational tools that can analyze such situations to determine the optimal choice of engineering parameters to mitigate the effect of stress shadowing and reservoir heterogeneity  a complete model of this situation requires a fully coupled 3d simulator that can model curving hf that simultaneously propagate in a heterogeneous solid medium  thus far, models of this situation have been restricted to homogeneous media involving pseudo-3d approximations that can admit curving cracks (kresse et al , 2013), 2d-axisymmetric hf that are assumed to grow in parallel planes (lecampion and desroches, 2015) or arbitrarily shaped hf that are assumed to grow in parallel planes (bunger and peirce, 2014; peirce and bunger, 2015) | 
2016-033 	 a comparison study of extended leak-off tests in permeable and impermeable formations |abstract: |extended leak-off tests are important in petroleum engineering for obtaining underground stress information, which is critical for issues such as wellbore stability, lost circulation, casing design, hydraulic fracturing, sand production, and reservoir compaction and subsidence  the signatures of extended leak-off tests are very different between permeable formations (e g  sandstones) and impermeable formations (e g  shales)  a proper understanding of this difference is important for test interpretation, particularly for the determination of minimum horizontal stress  based on numerical simulation analyses, this paper contains a detailed comparison of extended leak-off tests in permeable and impermeable formations  the comparison results show that permeability and its related phenomenon such as fluid leak-off can significantly influence pressure versus time response of an extended leak-off test and lead to interpretation difficulties  traditional interpretation methods using time development of bottom hole pressure cannot provide accurate estimate of minimum horizontal stress in impermeable formations due to the negligibly small leak-off through fracture faces to the surrounding formation  the numerical model developed in this paper provides a method for aiding interpretation and design of extended leak-off tests |introduction |knowledge of minimum horizontal stress (shmin) is important in many aspects during the life of oilfield development  it impacts all the development phases from well design to well abandonment  shmin is a key factor for design of well trajectory and casing programs, and prediction of wellbore stability and lost circulation in the drilling and completion phases (feng et al , 2015; feng and gray, 2016a, 2016b; raaen and brudy, 2001)  it is also one of the most critical elements for hydraulic fracturing design to maximize the recovery of unconventional reservoirs  in the production phase, shmin is a required parameter for evaluation of sand production, reservoir compaction, and surface subsidence  for the well abandonment phase, knowledge of shmin is needed to determine the abandonment plug setting depths to ensure the long-term integrity of the abandoned well  in addition, fluid injection operations, such as produced water injection, waterflooding, steam injection, cuttings reinjection and carbon dioxide injection, have become essential elements of field development worldwide  the long-term integrity of reservoir caprock has become a major safety concern surrounding these operations  shmin is a key input for developing reliable, full-scale mechanical earth models and other analytical or empirical models for addressing this safety concern (chan et al , 2015) | 
2016-035 	 geomechanical impacts of a welding salt layer on adjacent sediments |abstract: |we use an evolutionary finite-element model to determine changes in stress and geomechanical features of sediments near a welding source layer of a salt wall  we show that a significant stress concentration develops at the weld tip, which is experienced by all sediments along the weld as the weld tip propagates along the weld  when the source layer welds, salt flow from diapir pedestal into diapir stops, resulting in a hydrostatic salt pressure  this pressure is less than the overburden stress in sediments over the pedestal  in fact, the salt in the pedestal supports only part of the weight of overlying sediments; the rest is transferred laterally to over-weld sediments through shear stresses above the weld tip  this transfer causes the stress concentration at the weld tip  we show that this concentration results in compression of sediments along the weld and hence enhancement of the weld sealing capacity  the resulting compaction can also explain the tightness of reservoirs near welds and the false pullup of their depths in seismic migration models  our study is the first quantitative analysis of stress evolution near a welding salt layer and may help characterize and explore reservoirs near welds more accurately  |introduction |many petroleum prospects lie near salt diapirs that have a welded source layer, developed by complete or almost complete withdrawal of salt from the source layer (jackson and talbot, 1991) (fig  1)  several studies have addressed the important structural features of such welds for the exploration of these prospects, such as the permeability of adjacent sediments and presence of faults in them (jackson et al , 2014; peel, 2014; rowan et al , 2012; wagner, 2010)  previous studies, however, do not address the role of welding on the development of such features  |field data indicate features that could be caused only by the welding process  for example, hoetz et al  2011 studied the data from 23 wells drilled through welds in the zechstein salt basin, northern netherlands, and found a consistent local decrease in the porosity and hence the permeability of reservoirs near the welds  they concluded that the salt layer welding is the cause of the decrease  furthermore, maione 2001 detected steeply dipping faults above welded source-layers of salt domes in the east texas basin  they also attributed the faults to the welding of the salt layers  understanding and predicting the effects of welding on sediments is critical because these effects are often not detected in routine exploration (hoetz et al  2011; maione 2001) | 
2016-037 	 critical issues in subsurface integrity |abstract: |identifying, risking, and maintaining subsurface integrity is of critical importance to a variety of geologic subsurface operations including geothermal, oil and gas production (conventional, unconventional, fractured crystalline, heavy-oil fields), mining, natural gas storage, and sequestration of co2 and hazardous waste  predicting and mitigating out-of-zone fluid migration includes but goes beyond maintaining well integrity: it relies on technical understanding of top and fault seals, reservoir and overburden deformation, production/injection-induced stress changes, reservoir management, completions design and engineering, hydraulic fracturing/height containment, wastewater disposal, induced seismicity/fracture reactivation, and reservoir monitoring (e g , geodetic and downhole measurement and interpretation)  subsurface integrity excludes surface facilities and spill response but includes regulations regarding subsurface activities  |in this paper we present and synthesize examples of subsurface containment loss from oil and gas fields that are documented in the open literature  we then discuss common risk areas or themes in subsurface containment geomechanics that are important to subsurface integrity and illustrate with some general examples how some of these could be investigated by using geomechanical models  |introduction |containment of produced or injected fluids within their intended wellbores or geologic subsurface zones in oil and gas fields is widely recognized as a critical part of exploration and production (e&p) activities in conventional and unconventional plays and reservoirs  for example, it is a primary objective while drilling exploration, appraisal, development, and production wells  maintaining the integrity of wellbores and subsurface geologic elements can potentially minimize drilling and operational risk  effectively managing injection pressures, volumes, and rates of fluids in producing fields depends critically on adequately defining the geomechanical limits set by geologic elements such as overburden, caprock, top seals, faults, and evolving in situ stress states (including reservoir pressures)  characterization of the mechanical integrity of the subsurface relies upon obtaining baseline measurements including lithology, petrophysical and mechanical properties, pore pressure, and stress state that are best obtained during field appraisal and development, before production begins  because the consequences of subsurface containment loss to an operator or partner can be significant, including both direct and indirect costs (e g , clean-up cost, loss of production, and damage to reputation), even for small events, containment-related activities have assumed a larger share of enterprise risk as technologically more challenging fields are evaluated and placed into production [1] | 
2016-038 	 numerical study of flow rate distribution for simultaneous multiple fracture propagation in horizontal wells |abstract: |multi-stage fracturing treatments of plug and perf  completions can greatly increase the efficiency to create massive fractures in horizontal wells  however, there are accepted evidence that fractures in each perforation cluster generally cannot be uniformly developed due to uneven flow volume distribution  to increase the effective fracture number and improve the effectiveness of stimulation treatments, the key is to promote uniform flow volume distribution and fracture growth  in this paper, a series of case studies were investigated to analyze the effects of fluid viscosity, injection rate, fracture spacing, differential stress (shmax - shmin), and young's modulus on simultaneous three-fracture propagation by employing an in-house developed fracture propagation model (xfrac)  the results demonstrated that increasing flow viscosity increases the difference of flow rate between fractures, resulting in less fluid received by the interior fracture  large injection rate can promote more uniform fracture development  small fracture spacing implies strong stress shadow effects, which results in large variation of flow volume into each fracture  differential stress can alter the partitioning of flow volume between fractures  large differential stress restricts a fracture growing along a straight line  young's modulus has significant impacts on hydraulic fracture propagation  numerical results shown that the rock formations with small young's modulus favor uniform fracture geometry  this work analyzed how parameters affect multiple fracture propagation and provided critical guidelines for engineers to improve the effectiveness of multi-stage fracturing treatments  |introduction |hydraulic fractures coupled with horizontal wells have become a standard technology to effectively develop unconventional reservoirs  plug and perf  limited entry completion technology is being widely used to generate massive hydraulic fractures along horizontal wellbore  generally, 2-6 perforation clusters in one stage are created with the purpose of simultaneously generating 2-6 similar fractures  however, it is now well established that multiple fractures cannot be uniformly generated along the lateral (wheaton et al  2014; ugueto et al  2016)  some clusters receive a small proportion of the intended treatment fluid and proppant, resulting in immaturely developed fractures, while some clusters receive more than intended and generate “overdeveloped” fractures  consequently, production from horizontal wells with plug and perf  completions is highly variable along horizontal wellbore  |miller et al  (2011) analyzed the data of production logs from multiple basins and indicated that one third of all perforation clusters contribute to two thirds of gas production and about one third of the clusters are ineffective and do not contribute to production  according to the data of distributed temperature sensing (dts) and distributed acoustic sensing (das), sookprasong et al  (2014) concluded that the dominant perforation clusters are often identified during simultaneous stimulation of multiple fractures  wheaton et al  (2014, 2016) also utilized the data of das and dts to analyze the flow and proppant distribution of multi-cluster fractures and shown the percentages of fluid/proppant existing each cluster through treatment time  the results indicate that multiple perforation clusters cannot receive equal fluid volume, resulting in non-uniform development of fractures  spain et al  (2015) also pointed out that hydraulic fracturing efficiency in unconventional reservoirs is poor that 40%-60% of perforation clusters contribute little or no production  ugueto et al  (2016) utilized fiber optic diagnostic to estimate perforation cluster efficiency in cemented plug and perf  limited entry completions  the paper stated that generally only half or two-thirds of the perforation clusters are properly stimulated or produced at significant rates | 
2016-039 	 the environmental block in coupled geomechanics workflows |abstract: |with the increase in hydraulic fracturing (hf) stimulation techniques in the oil and gas industry, general environmental concerns have become more important  with time and increases in engineering knowledge and computational capabilities, the use of more complicated geomechanical models integrated into a general workflow process for design and optimization of hydraulic fracturing is becoming well established  we examine geomechanical workflows available to show that ongoing research is more systematically applied to achieve a better coupling of static mechanical earth models (mems), hf simulation models, geophysical earth models, dynamic reservoir models, etc  we introduce the environmental block concept in the hf workflow, and explore how the environmental block might be designed to interact with the other blocks to achieve a better understanding of environmental outcomes in geomechanics problems such as hf design  if successfully implemented, a well-designed environmental block can integrate into a design workflow to promote sustainability and social acceptance  |introduction |companies and academic centers in the rock mechanics field know the importance of geomechanical modeling  such models may be used to predict the mechanical behavior of a reservoir, and they can be calibrated and verified with monitoring data for improved or advanced studies leading to better outcomes  |temporally, the geological model precedes the geomechanical model  it specifies the geometrical arrangement of different rock layers (lithostratigraphy), physical properties such as density, grain size, porosity and mineralogy, sedimentary environment and lithotype distribution, and also incorporates structural geology information for folds, faults, and joint systems  populating the model with mechanical properties, stresses, temperatures and pore pressures leads to the general geomechanical model, the basis of engineering design  although there is no sharp line delineation between the geological and geomechanical models, a general (geo)mechanical earth model - mem – is developed by following a series of steps (a “workflow”)  the workflow steps may be well-defined, but the data populating the mem are invariably characterized by differing degrees of uncertainty and granularity (data scale, varying from broad averages to small-scale pore structure information)  |by definition (e g  schlumberger 2015b), a mem is a numerical representation of the geomechanical state of the well, reservoir, or basin  in addition to intrinsic petrophysical and rock mechanics properties (e g , density, porosity, acoustic impedance structure, elastic parameters, ucs, drilling d index…) and structural information (joints & faults…), the mem incorporates the distribution of extrinsic parameters such as the pore pressures (po), stress state (<u+03c3>ij), temperature (to), and perhaps data related to pore fluid composition and chemistry  stresses and pressures are extrinsic parameters because their values are imposed from outside of the rock itself, such as the relationship between total stress and the overburden weight, combined with the effects of tectonism and diagenesis  it is now deemed necessary to construct a mem for all but the most trivial reservoir geomechanical studies, for drilling campaigns, for hydraulic fracturing programs, and so on  the numerical results and information that are in these mems and generated by simulations based on these mems are required for engineers in casing point selection, wellbore stability, borehole placement, essentially all subsurface engineering activity |

2016-044 	 consideration of breakdown conditions of directional wells |abstract: |in 1898, kirsch published equations describing the elastic stresses around a circular hole that are still used today in wellbore pressure breakdown calculations  these equations are standard instruments used in multiple areas of petroleum engineering, however, the original equations were developed strictly for vertical well settings  in today's common directional or horizontal well situations, the equations need adjusted for both deviation from the vertical plane and orientation to the maximum and minimum horizontal in-situ stress anisotropy  this paper provides the mathematical development of these modified breakdown equations, along with examples of the implications in varying strike-slip and pore pressure settings  these examples show conditions where it is not unusual for breakdown pressure gradients to exceed 1 0 psi/ft and describes why certain stages in “porpoising” horizontal wells experience extreme breakdown issues during hydraulic fracturing treatments  the paper also discusses how, in most directional situations, the wellbore will almost always fail initially in a longitudinal direction at the borehole wall, after which the far-field stresses will take over and transverse components can be developed  tortuosity and near wellbore friction pressure can actually add to forcing the initiation of such longitudinal fractures, which can then have cascading effects on other growth parameters such as cluster-to-cluster and stage-to-stage stress shadowing  special considerations for highly laminated anisotropic formations, where shear failure of the wellbore may precede or preclude tensile failure, are also introduced  such failure behaviors have significant implications on near wellbore conductivity requirements and can also greatly impact well production and recovery efforts  |introduction |in vertical wells it is relatively easy to accept that a tensile fracture will initiate along the axis of the well and propagate in the direction of maximum horizontal stress, opening perpendicular to the minimum stress  as the industry has increasingly moved to horizontal well completion and stimulation, the paradigm that fractures will orient in the plane of the maximum and intermediate stress of the earth tensor, and continue to open against the minimum horizontal stress, has been retained  fieldscale development plans are based on the expectation of nearly parallel vertical fractures that are orthogonal to the planned borehole (transverse), or set at a predictable angle to the well axis  azimuth or strike of the fracture is expected to be given by the azimuth of maximum horizontal stress  when the horizontal stress anisotropy is low, a more complex system of possibly orthogonal fractures, or some complex joint network, is expected |

2016-048 	 laboratory investigation on effective stress in middle bakken: implications on poroelastic stress changes due to depletion and injection |abstract: |the effective stress coefficient (<u+03b1>) is important to the analysis of poroelastic stress changes and deformations in the reservoirs  a middle bakken core was tested to study its effective stress in scenarios of depletion and injection  we designed an innovative experiment configuration to expedite the pore pressure equilibration within the tight specimen, and an exhaustive loading path to characterize the dependencies of <u+03b1> (with respect to static deformation) on confining pressure and pore pressure  our test results reveal that the specimen's <u+03b1> is less than unity, and varies between 0 3 and 0 8  it suggests the effective stress is simply not equivalent to pressure difference between confining pressure and pore pressure  the effective stress coefficient <u+03b1> generally increases with pore pressure for constant confining pressure but decreases with confining pressure for constant pore pressure  the variation of <u+03b1> during depletion is more significant than during injection  these observations are also indicative of the microstructures of the specimen in terms of its responses to pore pressure and confining pressure variation  |introduction |the production of hydrocarbons typically causes the reservoir to dwindle  significant deformation can cause well failure, surface subsidence and production loss  what accompanies the deformation is the stress changes around and inside the reservoir (segall and fitzgerald, 1998; zoback and zinke, 2002), which may enhance or inhibit the rate of deformation  on the other hand, activities of hydraulic fracturing stimulation and enhanced oil recovery in unconventional plays inject large volume of fluid into the tight reservoirs  like depletion, injection also induces significant deformation and stress changes, and potentially, triggers faulting and earthquakes (zoback, 2012; ellsworth, 2013)  thus, it is imperative to fundamentally understand the change in stress and strain as the reservoir depletes or undergoes injection  |commonly, the stress changes associated with depletion and injection are considered as poroelastic and treated as such  how total stress (s) and pore pressure (pp) interact and affect rock deformation is dealt by poroelasticity  the concept of effective stress (<u+03c3>) is important to evaluate the net effects of s and pp on the deformation of rocks (terzaghi, 1923; biot, 1962)  the biot coefficient, or the effective stress coefficient, <u+03b1>, is used to couple s and pp  for reservoir stress change and accompanying deformation, the effective stress is dictated by the particular <u+03b1> with respect to rock stiffness |

2016-061 	 theoretical development on morphology of wellbore toroidal breakout |abstract: |few researchers have conducted experimental investigations on the occurrence of wellbore toroidal breakout; also this breakout mode has been observed in the field  unfortunately, there is no published theoretical study that adequately describes the occurrence of this unique feature  thus, we have developed a theory that answers some of the questions related to the occurrence of wellbore toroidal breakout: (a)  is the failure mode toroidal? (b)  is the deepest depth for a homogeneous and isotropic formation at the center? (c)  location of the deepest depth for a heterogeneous formation? to consider the impacts of support pressure on the breakout pattern, the two failure modes were considered, namely: shear fracture and extensile-splitting induced breakouts  minimum strain energy criterion was used in determining the direction of the propagating extensile cracks; and the trajectories of the cracks were tracked with fourier series of piece-wise linear functions  in the numerical experiments conducted, it was observed that the extensile cracks propagated in the r-z plane through mode ii (shear) predominantly, and by mode i in the r - <u+03b8> plane  by rotating the cracks profile in the r-z plane through the vertical axis by the breakout width, the breakout volume can be approximately determined; the volume generated by this rotation is usually greater than the actual volume  |introduction |extensive studies have been conducted on type- a breakout (figs 1a and 1b); the breakout mode is primarily controlled by the tangential stress around the wellbore  bell and gough (1982) predicted that breakouts are spalled regions around the wellbore and the deepest depth align with the direction of the minimum horizontal in-situ stress; they envisioned a dog-eared breakout shape  ewy and cook (1990), martin et al  (1994), ewy et al  (1988) conducted laboratory experiments to confirm bell and gough's hypothesis  the triangular breakout section is often observed in some brittle geomaterials, like granite  |but generally, the breakout shapes are flat-bottomed and broad (zoback et al  1985); these authors assumed that the breakout shape follows the potential shear failure lines and confirmed their theory with some field observations  similarly, kulandar and dean (1985) and pollard and aydin (1988) also supported the curvy nature of the failure surface around the borehole through some observed experiments  other notable laboratory experiments and field observations that support the curved failure surfaces include the works of cuss et al  2003, stacey and jongh (1978), and ortlepp (1978); there are other references that support this hypothesis, which we have not mentioned |

2016-075 	 ultrasonic velocity measurement of sidewall cores for different stress paths |abstract: |integration of geomechanics test results with well log measurements is a crucial step in developing geomechanical models to estimate in situ stress state, maintaining stable wellbore and design hydraulic fracture  limited availability of core material severely restricts design of a comprehensive geomechanics test program  sidewall core plugs, although easier to obtain than conventional cores, suffer from being short relative to the length to diameter ratio specified by astm  this paper presents a solution to overcome size issues related via measuring ultrasonic velocity on sidewall core plugs at various stress paths  a unique experimental setup allows measurement of ultrasonic velocity both parallel and perpendicular to bedding  the results were then compared with velocity measurements obtained from sonic logs  it was observed that velocity measured within an isostatic stress path provides the closest match to log velocities, thus increasing confidence in dynamic geomechanics measurements on sidewall plugs and allowing geoscientists and engineers with low budgets to conduct more comprehensive geomechanics analyses  |introduction |the value of laboratory testing to enhance our understanding of subsurface geomechanical properties to better explore and exploit a hydrocarbon reservoir is well known (plumb et al , 2000; cook et al , 2007)  important parameters that provide baseline information for constructing a geomechanical model of the subsurface include the in situ stress state, strength properties, and stress-strain behavior (zoback, 2007)  among these parameters, strength and stress-strain behavior can be measured in the laboratory whereas in situ stress can be estimated via a combination of well logs, laboratory and field measurement (thomsen, 1986; thiercelin and plumb, 1994)  thus it is imperative to have good quality laboratory data since that would in turn improve estimation of in situ stress state (higgins, 2006) and help geoscientists solve wellbore stability issues and hydraulic fracture design  in this direction, astm and isrm provided enormous assistance via creating standard protocols on how to conduct a test in the laboratory  |according to astm, core plugs used to estimate stress-strain behavior of rock should have a length to diameter ratio of 2 to 1  the process of acquiring and storing cores is a costly operation and lack of core material constrains laboratory testing and generation of geomechanical parameters  sidewall cores, acquired by attachments to wireline logging tools provide a cost effective alternative as they can be (a) acquired relatively quickly and (b) can be acquired when there is a failure to collect core by conventional coring techniques (agarwal et al, 2014)  however, samples with a length to diameter ratio of less than 2 to 1 are less suitable for laboratory testing  we report a solution to issues related to shorter core plugs during geomechanics testing  in this paper, ultrasonic velocity was measured on sidewall core plugs through various stress paths  a unique experimental setup allows measurement of ultrasonic velocity both parallel and perpendicular to bedding  the results are then compared with velocity measurements obtained from sonic logs  it is observed that velocity measured within an isostatic stress path provides the closest match to log velocities in most of the samples  the velocities obtained throughout various stress paths were compared and efforts were made to address the discrepancies between them |

2016-083 	 a revised method of in-situ stress determination from drilling-induced fractures: a case study of high temperature and low permeability formation drilling |abstract: |wellbore breakouts and drilling-induced fractures(difs) which are usually used to determine in-situ stress magnitude and orientation can be recognized by formation microscanner image plot  an exploration well was drilled in a high temperature and low permeability formation, difs showed below 4240m depth and there were no breakouts nearly, zoback's stress polygon model base on anderson's faulting theory and coulomb faulting theory cannot explain the failure phenomenon and determine in-situ stress states  in order to revise the method of stress determination, a thermo-poroelastic model was set up which took into consideration wellbore temperature variation because of drilling fluid circulation, the maximum principle stress magnitude had an upper and lower bound according to wellbore failure, meanwhile difs occurrence time was also a factor for stress calculation, so a series of charts including minimum effective tangential stress and damage coefficient were built to determine in-situ stress  it is stated that thermo-poroelastic model can explain wellbore failure and determine in-situ stress states comparing to elastic theory more properly  the research provides a theoretical method for determining in-situ stress by fmi plot especially for high temperature and low permeability wells  |introduction |in-situ stresses are primary parameters for analyzing wellbore stability, sand controlling and hydraulic fracture, but it is not easy to determine in-situ stresses underground until now  mini-frac and leak off tests can measure field stress directly, but this measurement has to be conducted at a specific depth and only the minimum horizontal principal stress (<u+03c3>h) can be determined by this way  the continuous stress magnitude along the well has to be accessed by means of wireline logging and formation microscanner imager (fmi) logging  wellbore breakouts and drilling induced tensile fractures (difs) are two kinds of typical wall failure which can be identified by fmi, wellbore breakouts direction is aligned with <u+03c3>h direction while difs direction is aligned with <u+03c3>h for vertical well, these two kinds of failure have been used widely to estimate in-situ stress orientation and magnitude  zoback built a polygon model to estimate stress states base on coulomb faulting theory and anderson's stress and faulting classification system (zoback et al  2003)  analytical solutions(zoback et al  1985) were set up to calculate maximum horizontal stress magnitude depending on wellbore breakout depth and opening angel  in order to increase stress calculation accuracy, rock anisotropy was taken into consideration further(lee et al  2013), walton set up a two-dimensional numerical stress model for hard rock (walton et al  2015), on the other hand, drilling induced tensile wall fractures were used to be implication to determine the lower bound of <u+03c3>h (brudy and zoback 1999; berard and cornet 2003)  these models are nearly base on pure elastic theory while determining stress upper and lower bounds  |low-permeability sand rock is porous material and formation temperature variety can change pore pressure and near wellbore stresses distribution which are important for analyzing wellbore stability  pore pressure, temperature and stresses couple each other, so several control equations are set up to solve the thermo-poroelastic problem, then in-situ stresses can be back calculated on the basis of wellbore instability condition by comparing effective stresses to strength and tensile failure criteria |

2016-090 	 ae investigation of multi-wellbore hydraulic fractures at the laboratory scale |abstract: |hydraulic fracturing is often necessary in unconventional oil and gas reservoirs to enhance formation permeability by creating a conductive pathway for fluid flow to one or multiple wellbores  reservoir development often requires many wellbores consisting of several fracture stages  wellbore and fracture stage placement and orientation are of key importance when planning full reservoir development  fractures are often induced parallel to one another along a horizontal well oriented in the minimum principal stress direction  laboratory investigations of fracture spacing and the interaction between two parallel hydraulic fractures were performed  laboratory hydraulic fracture testing was performed through two parallel wellbores in single-block granite samples with dimensions of 15 <u+00d7> 15 <u+00d7> 25 cm3 while being subjected to true-triaxial stress conditions  acoustic emissions (ae) were monitored throughout stimulation of both wells a and b to better understand the extent of microcrack damage induced, coalesced hydraulic fracture orientation, and width of the damage zone  wellhead pressure, pump pressure, and flow were monitored for each wellbore throughout the fracturing processes  ae density imaging showed progressive fracture growth from an openhole wellbore for each well  longer-term monitoring of the multi-wellbore system for several weeks revealed ae events residing within the densest regions of microcracks  these events, termed relaxation events, provided a clear map of the hydraulic fracture network and helped shed light on the continuously changing induced fracture networks  typically, ae monitoring in the field for hydraulic fracture development is used to create a map of induced hydraulic fractures  this map is held constant for future analysis  results from these laboratory tests show the necessity for continuous monitoring and treatment of the induced hydraulic fracture networks as an evolving system of fractures, particularly when pore fluids are being extracted  |introduction |reservoir rock permeability enhancement through hydraulic fracturing is a common practice in oil- and gas-bearing formations, as well as enhanced geothermal systems (egs) reservoirs  reservoirs requiring hydraulic fracture stimulation typically have very low permeability and many are naturally fractured and heterogeneous in composition and stress  introducing hydraulic fractures in a dense naturally fractured reservoir serves to connect the natural network to the wellbore and expose new reservoir material to allow flow from micro and nano pores  with the past implementation of horizontal drilling, many hydraulic fractures are now able to be performed along a single wellbore  the spacing between these fracture stages varies wildly in industry, from the order of tens of meters to hundreds of meters  in many cases, iso-spacing of fracture stages irrespective of material properties or well log measurements is performed  |performing multiple fracture stages along a horizontal wellbore in a naturally fractured network introduces multiple complexities in terms of understanding the wellbore connected network  these include the effects of fracture dimension alteration and stress shadowing effects on induced fracture directions, and the opening/closure of existing natural fractures  studying the problem of hydraulic fracture interaction, laboratory testing is necessary to visualize the processes |

russian |a geomechanical approach to solving the horizontal wells stability problem and increasing well productivity based on the physical modeling of deformation and filtration processes in the vicinity of the well is presented  the modeling was performed on a unique experimental facility triaxial independent load test system (tilts) created at the institute for problems in mechanics of the ras  the importance of taking into account of the strength and filtration rock properties anisotropy is demonstrated on the example of filanovsky field reservoir rock  the tests of rock specimens showed that rocks having the isotropic elastic properties and outward appearance can have significant anisotropy of strength and filtration properties  in this regard, fracture conditions of horizontal well vary for different circuit points, the fracture of a horizontal borehole begins in the areas near the intersection of well contour with the vertical plane  the rock permeability in the horizontal plane was significantly higher than in the vertical direction  modeling of decompression process in horizontal downhole using tilts revealed that the occurrence of non-uniform stress conditions in the vicinity of the well when creating a depression in its bottom may result to a substantial change in permeability in this zone – both to a decrease or an increase  the very significant permeability increase mainly observed in the test specimens corresponding to their location in the points of intersection of the contour of a horizontal well and a vertical plane  the studies lead to the important conclusions regarding the selection of the prioritized strength and filtration properties of reservoir rocks to be determined experimentally under creating and filling in the geomechanical model of the deposit  currently used traditional set of data is based on the assumption of an isotropic elastic and strength properties of rocks (young's modulus, poisson's ratio, the mohr-coulomb or drucker-prager strength constants, etc )  the facilities which based on the karman principle mainly used to determine these characteristics, but they do not allow to create real stress conditions arising in the formations in the vicinity of the well  at the same time, deformation, strength and filtration properties of rocks depend intrinsically on the level and type of

production can be quite remote from reality if the strength rock properties anisotropy, as well as the dependence of the filtration properties on stresses, will not be taken into account  and the central objectives to reduce risk and enhance efficiency in well production will not be achieved |представлен геомеханический подход к решению проблем устойчивости стволов горизонтальных скважин и увеличения продуктивности скважин, основанный на физическом моделировании деформационных и фильтрационных процессов в окрестности скважины  моделирование проводилось на уникальной экспериментальной

процесса понижения давления на забое горизонтальной скважины показало, что возникновение в окрестности скважины неравномерного напряженного состояния при создании депрессии на ее забое может приводить

образцов, расположенных в точках пересечения контура горизонтальной скважины с вертикальной плоскостью  выполненные исследования позволяют сделать важный вывод относительно выбора приоритетных деформационно-прочностных и фильтрационных характеристик горных пород продуктивного разреза, подлежащих экспериментальному определению для создания и наполнения геомеханической модели месторождения

2016-113 	 up-scaling dem simulations |abstract: |discrete element methods (dem) explicitly model the mechanics of the discontinuities of naturally fractured rock masses  however, due to the large number of degrees of freedom in dem simulations and the requirement of small times steps, the application of dem simulations to reservoir-scale problems and long-term fluid injection problems is often computationally prohibitive  in order to reduce the computational costs associated with full-scale dem simulations, an up-scaling method is presented in which representative elementary volume (rev) dem simulations are used to calibrate the parameters of a continuum damage mechanics (cdm) constitutive model that is then used for finite element analysis (fea)  the cdm model empirically captures the effect of the degradation of the rock integrity due to the yielding and sliding of natural fractures in the rock mass  up-scaling is achieved through homogenization, in which the spatially averaged stress-strain behavior of various dem rve simulations is computed  subsequently, a cdm constitutive relationship is fitted using the levenberg-marquardt algorithm (lma) and the homogenized dem simulation data  the cdm model is then used in fea reservoir scale simulations  the cdm model is implemented in abaqustm and dem simulations were conducted using udectm  the up-scaling methodology is demonstrated through a case study on a naturally fractured carbonate reservoir in which the up-scaled cdm model compares well with a direct numerical simulation with the dem model but requires an order of magnitude less computational time  |introduction |discrete element method (dem) models are used commonly in geomechanics to explicitly model the mechanics of naturally fractured rock (nfr) masses (jing, 2003)  nfr is often modeled as a multiscale material due to the vastly different length scales involved in the deformation process (zhou et al , 2003)  at the fracture scale (10-3 m), the physics is dominated by brittle fracture propagation and fracture-to-fracture contact force interaction, while one is normally interested in the reservoir scale (103 m) response as a result of the spatial extension of the fractures  because these scales of interest span approximately six orders of magnitude, multiscale methods are required to assess the overall response as modelling with fracture scale resolution at the reservoir scale becomes computationally prohibitive  |dem models, unlike standard continuum models, consider the fractures within the rock mass as a discrete fracture network (dfn), which explicitly defines the geometry of the fracture network  the physics of block interaction is then governed by the motion, contact forces and traction-separation laws between the rock blocks and the fractures (cundall and strack, 1979)  because nfr behavior is complex, even sophisticated phenomenological constitutive relationships may be inadequate to describe the complete rock mass behavior  the dem approach aims to address this continuum behavioral deficiency by only requiring constitutive relations for the block interactions  (cundall, 2001) |

2016-115 	 critical state modeling of sedimentary rock incorporating healing and decay of rock structure |abstract: |the fluctuation of rock friction, which is an important factor in faulting, has been well captured by a rate and state dependent friction law proposed by dieterich, 1979 and ruina, 1983  nevertheless, dilatancy, which is indicated as a significant factor in understanding fault mechanisms (hirata et al , 2014), is not included in this law  therefore, the purpose of this paper is to develop a rational continuum constitutive model for sedimentary rocks based on critical state theory towards the prediction of the healing and decay effects of rock structure on both frictional and dilatancy behavior  the proposed model is validated with experimental slide-hold-slide triaxial tests on soft sedimentary rock and the potential applications of the proposed model in the numerical simulation of faulting are then discussed  the performance of this model is explained in detail through the simulation of isotropic consolidation of sedimentary rock  this research is a contribution towards the simulation of the fluctuation in rock friction while incorporating the dilatancy behavior of rock in the formulation of the model  |introduction |the finite element method (fem) simulation of faulting has received an increasing attention in the last fifteen years (wang, 2001, zhao, 2004, hu, 2004, liu, 2006, shoubiao, 2013)  the accuracy of fem solution depends on a lot of factors, one of which is the ability of the constitutive model to satisfactory describe the real material's behavior  therefore, a development of an advanced material model for rock friction is crucial for the study of the faulting's mechanism  |the fluctuation of rock friction has been recognized as one of the major causes in faulting's mechanism (burridge and knopoff, 1967)  via extensive study of the friction of rock, (dieterich,1979 and ruina, 1983) proposed a famous empirical rate- and state- dependent friction (rsf) law for rock  this law could well describe the variation of rock friction as observed in the slide-hold-slide direct shear test  since, then a large number of researches related to the earthquake's occurrences were conducted based on this friction law (stuart, 1995, dieterich, 1972, marone, 1998a, shoubiao, 2013)  however, dilatancy behavior, which is believed to be a significant factor in the understanding of fault mechanics (hirata et  al  2014), is not considered in this friction law  in case of a negative dilation of saturated rock masses under undrained conditions, due to dilatancy behavior, the pore water pressure will increase and consequently the mean effective stress will decrease  on the other hand, positive dilation under drained condition increases the porosity which leads to the decrease in the stiffness and the peak strength even if the effective confining stress remains constant  in this regard, rudnicki & chen, 1988 and sleep & blanpied, 1992, hirata et al ,2014 indicated that the dilation would vary the pore water pressure that can affect earthquake generation, and samuelson et al , 2009 discussed time-dependent healing of the fault and its effect on the dilatancy behavior |

2016-120 	 laboratory testing of surrogate non-degraded waste isolation pilot plant materials |abstract: |the present study results are focused on laboratory testing of surrogate materials representing waste isolation pilot plant (wipp) waste  the surrogate wastes correspond to a conservative estimate of the containers and transuranic waste materials emplaced at the wipp  testing consists of hydrostatic, triaxial, and uniaxial tests performed on surrogate waste recipes based on those previously developed by hansen et al  (1997)  these recipes represent actual waste by weight percent of each constituent and total density  testing was performed on full-scale and <u+00bc>-scale containers  axial, lateral, and volumetric strain and axial and lateral stress measurements were made  unique testing techniques were developed during the course of the experimental program  the first involves the use of a spirometer or precision flow meter to measure sample volumetric strain under the various stress conditions  since the manner in which the waste containers deformed when compressed was not even, the volumetric and axial strains were used to determine the lateral strains  the second technique involved the development of unique coating procedures that also acted as jackets during hydrostatic, triaxial, and full-scale uniaxial testing; <u+00bc>-scale uniaxial tests were not coated but wrapped with clay to maintain an airtight seal for volumetric strain measurement  during all testing methods, the coatings allowed the use of either a spirometer or precision flow meter to estimate the amount of air driven from the container as it crushed down since the jacket adhered to the container and yet was flexible enough to remain airtight during deformation  |introduction |the waste isolation pilot plant (wipp) is a united states (us) department of energy (doe) mined underground repository; certified by the us environmental protection agency (epa); and designed for the safe management, storage, and disposal of transuranic (tru) radioactive waste resulting from the us defense programs  the wastes are emplaced in panels excavated at a depth of 655 m (2,150 ft) in the permian salado formation  following emplacement of waste and the engineered barrier material mgo, the panels will be isolated from the operational mine using an approved closure system  the repository is linked to the surface by four shafts that ultimately will be decommissioned and sealed  |performance assessment (pa) modeling of wipp performance requires full and accurate understanding of coupled mechanical, hydrological, and geochemical processes and how they evolve through time  the overarching objective of this paper focuses on room closure modeling, specifically the compaction behavior of waste and obtaining a well-designed data set to parameterize an improved waste constitutive model  ultimately, changes in the room closure model or other elements of the underground evolution will require acceptance by the epa typically through a peer review process | 
2016-121 	 coupled geomechanics and fluid flow computational algorithm for hydraulic fracturing simulations: case studies |abstract: |this paper presents field case studies of a coupled geomechanics and fluid flow computational algorithm for hydraulic fracture simulation in the marcellus and barnett formations  this computational algorithm is also coupled with tensile and shear-failure models to help describe pre-existing natural fracture evolution and its interaction with approaching hydraulically induced fractures  the numerical simulations are performed using field conditions and known parameters  the goal of the case studies presented in this work is to demonstrate the capabilities of the tightly coupled numerical algorithm for hydraulic fracturing analysis, especially for analysis of a complex fracture network  emphasis is placed on characteristics of pre-existing natural fractures because the characteristics of pre-existing natural fractures directly result in different extents of complexity for created fracture networks  the presence of natural fractures contributes not only fracture interactions, but also well communications  the case studies presented can be used to provide insight for refining hydraulic fracturing treatment designs in similar reservoirs  |introduction |in recent years, cost reduction has become a focal point for operators considering hydraulic fracturing treatments in horizontal wells for unconventional formations  an important aspect of reducing cost is gaining a better understanding of the fracturing process and its influence on fracturing design and production, especially in the case of complex fracture mechanisms  pre-existing natural fractures in unconventional reservoirs contribute uncertainties during the fracturing process in terms of propagation of hydraulic fractures and the interaction between natural fractures and hydraulic fractures  the interaction between hydraulic fractures and natural fractures could arrest or divert propagation of hydraulically induced fractures and generate a complex fracture network (cfn) other than planar fracture geometries  because of such complexity, the classic planar model is too overly simplified to be useful for cfn simulations  |multiple numerical simulation models have been developed for the hydraulic fracturing process for planar fracture geometries and complex fracture networks  these fracture models can be divided into two main categories  one category is continuum-mechanics based models, the other is discrete fracture models  continuum-mechanics based models, such as the continuum damage model (cdm), considers the displacement field and damage of material as continuous state variables  there is no explicit description of fracture surface geometry and no displacement discontinuity across fracture surfaces  continuum-mechanics based models are available in commercial software, such as abaqus, and have been used in fracturing simulations, such as the studies by shen, 2012  these models are facing many difficulties, such as coupling with fluid flow, proppant transportation/settling, and describing the physical interaction behaviors between hydraulically induced fractures and pre-existing natural fractures  much more effort has been put into discrete fracture models that explicitly describe fracture geometries and displacement discontinuities across fracture surfaces  these models deal with different levels of geometry complexity of fracture propagation and interactions, from bi-wing planar fractures to complex fracture networks in 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional space  to fully describe the physics of the fracturing process, these models are also coupled with rock mechanics and fluid dynamics to model complex fracture propagation, stresses induced by fractures, complex fluid rheology inside fractures, proppant transport, and proppant settling  for fracture propagation and stress analysis in rock formations, many numerical methods have been used, including the finite element method (fem) coupled with the cohesive zone model (czm) (chen, 2009), the extended finite element method (xfem) developed by moes et al , 1999, the distinct element model (dem) (nagel et al , 2011), and the displacement discontinuity method (ddm) by olson, 2004  each method has its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of computational efficiency and input complexity, such as heterogeneities of rock properties and distribution of pre-existing natural fractures  fem based models, fem with czm, and xfem, inherit the benefit of traditional fem  they are flexible to incorporate linear or nonlinear constitutive laws, and heterogeneities of rock properties can also be handled rather easily, but these models might be computationally expensive  ddm has its main advantage in meshing fracture geometry; it is only necessary to mesh the fractures themselves, not the volume around the fractures  so, ddm has high computational efficiency, but it is not easy to include rock heterogeneities in the model |

2016-123 	 laboratory-scale hydraulic fracturing: experiment and numerical modeling |abstract: |laboratory-scale experiments are an important method for improving understanding of the hydraulic fracturing process under controlled circumstances, even though it is difficult to realistically simulate downhole conditions in a laboratory  laboratory-scale experiments can also help determine if a numerical model can be used as a predictive tool for hydraulic fracturing analysis  this paper discusses both experimental and numerical modeling performed for a hydraulic fracturing test on a 30<u+00d7>30<u+00d7>45 cm specially designed cement block  the experiment was conducted using a true poly-axial testing system, and was designed to obtain data regarding the behavior of a hydraulically induced fracture and its interaction with a pre-existing fracture  the experimental data can provide insight to better understand the mechanisms of fracture initiation, propagation, and interaction  a computational algorithm was used to perform numerical modeling for the laboratory fracturing test  the computational algorithm tightly couples geomechanics and fluid dynamics models while providing fracture propagation criteria for hydraulically induced fractures  the numerical simulation results are compared in this work to experimental results, illustrating that the numerical model is capable of describing the interaction between pre-existing fractures  it also can help improve the understanding of complex fracture growth in reservoir conditions  |introduction |complex fracture geometries are often observed in naturally fractured reservoirs, such as tight gas sandstones and shales  mineback studies can provide direct evidences of fracture geometries, such as the studies conducted by warpinski, 1987  but mineback is costly and only viable for shallow depths  another way to study the complex fracture geometry is through laboratory-scale experimental studies, which can improve understanding of the hydraulic fracturing process under controlled circumstances  |laboratory-scale experiments have been used to investigate the interaction between hydraulic fractures and pre-existing fractures  blanton, 1982 shows that the principal stress differential and the approaching angle between hydraulic fractures and natural fractures are key parameters  beugelsdijk et al , 2000 examined the impact of pre-existing fractures, stress difference, and injection rate on fracture path complexity  these studies mainly focused on the interaction between hydraulically induced fractures and pre-existing natural fractures  the fracture interaction and propagation geometry within pre-existing fractures is still not well studied in laboratory-scale experiments | 
2016-124 	 improved model for performance prediction during mechanical excavation in weak rock |abstract: |although the behavior of chisel picks in soft rock can be understood within classical evan's model, recent studies have brought its accuracy into question  previously, researchers had recognized several deficiencies in the model: symmetrical geometry cutting assumptions, inverse proportionality between cutting forces and uniaxial compressive strength, and the cutting force not reducing to zero when the pick angle fell to zero  in this paper we use an artificial neural network framework to develop a model for predicting peak cutting forces in shale  artificial neural networks are a powerful computational tool which has gained popularity in recent years  our methodology utilizes physical rock tests and full-scale linear cutting tests conducted at colorado school of mines  the linear cutting machine measures full scale cutting forces while cutting actual rock, featuring a large stiff reaction frame on which the cutter is mounted  the metrics from the linear cutting machine include cutter forces, penetration, specific energy, cutting sequence, cutter speed, angle of attack and cutter tilt  the benefits of this work are more efficient designs of excavation machines such as shearers and road headers, and improved prediction of machine performance in weak to medium strength rock such as shale  |introduction and background |pick cutting tools have been found to be superior to disc cutters when applied to soft to medium strength rock (bilgin et al , 2012)  the behavior of chisel picks and point attack picks (conical picks) can be understood within the framework of evan's theory (evans, 84), which is often represented as shown in equation 1  |(equation) |evan's theoretical model predicts maximum cutting forces assuming tensile failure mode based on symmetrical pick geometry, rock properties and cutting depth  the underlying assumptions are that that the penetration of the pick is smaller than the cutting width and that the resulting tensile crack is circular towards the direction of movement  however the reliability and accuracy of evan's model for predicting peak cutting forces for conical picks have recently been brought into question (kuidong et al , 2014)  some of the problems with evan's model include symmetrical geometry cutting assumptions, the counterintuitive inverse relationship in the model between the cutting forces and the uniaxial compressive strength, and that the cutting force does not reduce to zero when the pick angle (cone angle) falls to zero (figure 1)  although roxborough (1978) suggests that evan's model produces good results where tensile failure occurs; nishimatsu (1972) has demonstrated instances of shear rock failure for low to medium strength rock | 
2016-125 	 application of 3d random voronoi tessellated models for simulation of hydraulic fracture propagation within the distinct element formulation |abstract: |hydraulic fracturing is a complex physical process which involves the coupling of hydraulic and mechanical behaviours, as well as temperature effects in some cases  the interdependence of these various factors is complex, and cannot be fully captured by the relatively simple state-of-practice tools employed in investigations of hydraulic fracturing  in this paper, a new approach is presented for fully coupled hydro-mechanical simulation of hydraulic fracture propagation by using three-dimensional voronoi geometries within the context of distinct element formulation  the block boundaries formed by the voronoi tessellation, provide a random flow pathway for the fluid and the contact breakage due to the increase of the fluid pressure acting on them, replicate the hydraulic fracture propagation  while, the voronoi approach for hydraulic fracturing simulation has been implemented previously in 2d models, this work puts forward a technique for extension of its application to 3d models  a series of verification tests are performed to investigate the suitability of the proposed approach  finally, example applications are presented for simulation of single-stage and multi-stage hydraulic fracturing of intact rock by using the 3d voronoi models at the reservoir scale  |introduction |the hydraulic fracturing process in massive multi-stage hydraulic fracturing (mmhf) operations is repeated multiple times in stages along horizontal wells  the hydraulic fracturing process can be simplified into three stages: |fracture initiation |fracture growth/mobilization |proppant injection |a primary goal of most mechanistically-focused models for hydraulic fracturing is to capture the fracture initiation and growth/mobilization of fractures (and the associated changes in matrix stresses and overall reservoir permeability) prior to the injection of proppant  this is both due to the importance of this initial stage as well as the additional complication associated with modelling proppant transport and deposition  |once a fracture has developed and the fluid volume pumped into this fracture continues to increase, there are several competing factors which determine where the fluid travels and how the energy which is input into the system is re-distributed  these factors include; matrix permeability, rock mass stiffness, fracture toughness and the most important, existing natural fractures | 
2016-127 	 measurement of grain compressibility of fine-grained rock |abstract: |knowledge of biot poroelastic coefficient is crucial to geoscientists for a number of applications, including oil and gas exploration and production, and hydrogeology  this in turn requires estimation of bulk and grain modulus or compressibility  although bulk modulus estimation is a standard laboratory method for shale, no effort was made till date to directly measure grain compressibility in the laboratory  this paper presents a laboratory study to fill this gap  the experimental program described here starts with validation of the technique using aluminum sample  following this, one berea sandstone and one shale sample was tested  finally, using the measured data, biot coefficient was estimated for shale  general agreement with published literature was observed  however, since none of the reported data was obtained through laboratory measurement, further measurements need be performed for shale and other reservoir rocks  |introduction |during deposition and diagenesis, cracks and pores are created in subsurface strata  these void spaces or porosity are in turn occupied with one or more fluid phases ranging from water to liquid or gaseous hydrocarbon depending on depositional/post-depositional environment  intuitively, the mechanical behavior of subsurface strata filled with fully or partially saturated pore spaces differs from that of a rigid or non-porous rock  the extraction of hydrocarbon results into change in pore fluid pressure in subsurface strata  the processes of drilling and completion impact the existing in situ stress field  this is further complicated when intentional/unintentional production of hydrocarbon occurs as the resulting change in pore pressure once again affects the stress field  the effects of pore pressure change on the deformation around a borehole (detournay and cheng, 1988), hydraulic fracturing (detournay et al , 1989) and slip along active faults (rudnicki and hsu, 1988) have been reported earlier  to fully understand this, the theory of effective stress was first proposed by carl terzaghi on one-dimensional consolidation of soil which was later extended to three-dimension by biot (1941)  following this, geertsma (1957) and skempton (1961) separately defined the expression for effective stress for a fully saturated material, which was later mathematically derived by nur and byerlee (1971)  in their work, effective stress is expressed as: |(equation) |(equation) |where pe, pt and pp are effective, total and pore pressure, respectively, <u+03b1> is biot coefficient and k and ks are bulk and grain modulus  biot coefficient was subsequently utilized in estimating insitu stress (thiercelin and plumb, 1994) as well as in wellbore stability analysis and hydraulic fracture design (cheng et al, 1993)  as revealed in eq  (2), it requires estimation of both bulk and grain modulus  this in turn involves saturating the rock material with pore fluid which presents a challenge for fine-grained rock like shale  the complex pore structure and nanometer range pore diameter of shale makes the saturation a shale sample in the laboratory significantly longer, making the test protocol impractical  this paper explores an alternative laboratory technique which is simply a variant of the unjacketed compressibility test  the paper begins with a description of the experimental technique in detail  this is followed by presenting the results conducted using an aluminum cylinder, the purpose of which is entirely validation of the experimental technique  the presentation is concluded by reporting results on berea sandstone and shale and estimating biot's coefficient for those samples  the results presented here indicates usability of the technique in estimation of grain modulus and hence, biot coefficient, for shale  the readers should note that as shown in eq  (2), biot coefficient is estimated using modulus instead of compressibility, it's reciprocal  similarly, all laboratory measurements presented in this paper report a modulus value and one can estimate compressibility from them | 
2016-128 	 connection of elastic and thermal properties of bentheimer sandstone using effective medium theory (rock physics) |abstract: |when realizing thermal enhanced oil recovery projects, it is necessary to have high quality data on thermal and geomechanical properties of reservoir rocks and/or connection between those effective properties at reservoir conditions  recently a number of important papers were published regarding a connection of the effective properties of rock with unique parameters of rock microstructure using the effective medium theory (emt)  we demonstrate how to connect the dynamic elastic moduli of rock in different saturation states with its thermal conductivity (tc) via these parameters  an emt-based model of physical properties of bentheimer sandstone is successfully developed and tested  the model is based on results of microstructure analysis of the sandstone samples and experimental data on elastic wave velocities (vp and vs) and tc of the samples in two saturation states (dry and brine-saturated) and under axial stress up to 21 mpa  we use two approaches of emt: f-model and well known self-consistent approach, to show special aspects of this modeling  we demonstrate how the axial stress affects the rock's microstructure and how it is reflected in the thermal and elastic properties  |introduction |data of rock thermal properties including thermal conductivity (tc) are commonly used in different areas of prospecting geophysics, basin modeling, storage of radioactive materials, etc  while techniques for measuring of tc on core samples in the lab at room temperature and normal atmospheric pressure are well known [1], logging tools for tc are not widely used in the industry and their accuracy is still under investigation [2]  thus, we utilize theoretical models to connect tc with other well-known properties  |modeling of effective rock physical properties is a challenging problem  transport properties (tc and electrical resistivity) as well as elastic properties depend on many factors: mineral and organic composition, cementation, fluid saturation, volume ratios of minerals and voids, size of components and their spatial distribution, and surface properties of grains [3-5]  |five groups of theoretical approaches exist to estimate rock's effective properties: empirical [6, 7], engineering [8-10], effective medium theory (emt) [11, 12], artificial neural network [13], and numerical simulation approaches [14]  those approaches have advantages and drawbacks  empirical approaches use many experimental data to derive dependencies between physical parameters, and they have narrow applicability  engineering ones use exact solutions for medium model with specific assumptions of its structure, such as two-phase layered medium  artificial neural network approaches require huge massive of data  numerical simulation approaches require high-resolution information about the rock structure obtained from x-ray computed tomography  however, the best resolution can be reached on very small samples approximately 8 mm in height  however, for rocks with complex structure representative elementary volume (rev) can be larger | 
2016-131 	 a coupled nonlocal damage model for hydraulic fracture propagation |abstract: |successful capturing the mechanical behaviors of rock is the first and important step for hydraulic fracturing simulation  for heterogonous materials like rock, the numerical fracturing models must correctly represent the energy dissipation during the fracture propagation  however, finite element analysis using strain softening model becomes highly affected by the mesh size and alignment causing non-physical predictions of damage or softening process zone  therefore, the energy dissipation becomes unstable since that it is highly affected by the different size of element used in the simulations, which is so called mesh size dependency  in this paper, nonlocal formulation damage mechanics is employed as the rock constitutive model in hydraulic fracturing simulation to capture the energy  nonlocal formulation abandons the classical assumption that the strength degradation at certain point can only results from the strain-stress states at the point itself, but the states over the whole domain or at least a certain representative volume defined by a characteristic length  also, the simulation involves a numerical algorithm that couples the fracture fluid flow with the fracture deformation in a moving boundary during the fracture propagation using lubrication theory  |introduction |for quasi-brittle materials, the cohesive strength and fracture energy are basic parameters to describe the behaviors of fracture propagation [park et al , 2008]  it is observed that there is an intermediate region between uncracked and cracked parts defined as the fracture process zone  the material softening localized in the fracture process zone consumes energy  the relationship between the fracture energy and size of the localization zone has been verified by the experiments  especially, due to the micro cracks and voids, relatively larger fracture process zone is found in quasi-brittle materials, and results in the difference between the strength measured in laboratory-size sample and the strength of actual structures  this phenomenon is associated with the size effect [bazant and planas, 1998]  in addition, in finite element implementation, the size of localization zone is related to element size  in other words, in traditional strain softening model, the fracture energy depends on the size of element  this effect is called mesh size dependency or mesh size  to capture the fracture energy, [klein and gao, 1998; gao and ji, 2003] introduced the fracture localization zone in virtual internal bond (vib) model to simulate the fracture process zone of materials  the fracture localization zone is consistent with fracture band model developed by [bazant and cedolin, 1979]  as an intrinsic length of materials, the size of fracture localization zone is calculated in conjunction with the j integral  |the constitutive relation, in traditional strain softening model, is calibrated to match the experiment data for all element size  however, the actual softening curve and fracture energy should integrally consider both the elemental strain-stress curve and the size of fracture process zone (size of element in fem implements)  the quantitative analysis will be highly effected since that the model fails to capture energy dissipation during the fracture propagation  the present work will employ the nonlocal damage model to capture the fracture energy with an intrinsic characteristic length, in which the size of element does not have to be the size of fracture localization zone that is more convenient for curved fracture propagation | 
2016-135 	 optimal sample size for managing uncertainty in hoek-brown strength parameters |abstract: |the hoek-brown empirical strength criterion for intact rock is widely used as the basis for estimating the strength of rock masses  estimates of the h-b parameters, the empirical constant m and the uniaxial compressive strength <u+03c3>c are commonly obtained by fitting the criterion to triaxial strength data sets of small sample size  this paper investigates how such small sample sizes affect the uncertainty associated with the h-b parameter estimations  we use monte carlo (mc) simulation to generate data sets of different sizes that represent various rock types, and then investigate the uncertainty associated with parameter estimations for these synthetic data  we show that the uncertainties depend not only on the level of variability, but also on the rock type being investigated  we discuss that the minimum number of required samples depends on the rock type, and should correspond to some acceptable level of uncertainty in the estimations  also, a comparison of the results from our analysis with actual rock strength data shows that the probability of obtaining reliable strength parameter estimations using small samples may be very low  we further discuss the impact of this on on-going implementation of reliability based design protocols, and conclude with suggestions for improvements in this respect  |introduction |in rock engineering, the determination of rock strength is a significant step in the early stages of a project in order to develop economic and safe designs  the well-known hoek-brown strength criterion is commonly used to characterize the strength of both intact rock and rock masses  at its simplest, for intact rock this criterion may be written as |(equation) |where <u+03c3>1 and <u+03c3>3 are the major and minor principal stresses at peak strength, <u+03c3>c is the intact rock uniaxial compressive strength, and m is an empirical constant  |this criterion is usually calibrated, in terms of obtaining estimates of <u+03c3>c and m, by fitting it to the results of triaxial compressive tests conducted on intact rock specimens (e g  carter et al , 1991; eberhardt, 2012; hoek & brown, 1988; kovari et al , 1983)  this is most regularly done using non-linear regression (hoek & brown, 1980; hoek et al  2002; pariseau, 1997)  the regression model used in such work is usually| 
2016-136 	 3d poroelastic simulation and analysis of multiple fracture propagation and refracturing of closely-spaced horizontal wells |abstract: |the paper presents three-dimensional coupled poroelastic analysis of multiple fracture propagation from horizontal wells  a 3d numerical model is developed using a combination of displacement discontinuity method for the hydro-mechanical response of porous rocks and finite element method for the fracture fluid flow simulation  the fracture propagation is analyzed based on the linear elastic fracture mechanics approach  the reservoir rock mass is assumed homogenous and isotropic with constant poroelastic physical properties and the fracturing fluid is assumed incompressible and shows newtonian behavior  numerical examples of multiple fracture propagation from the horizontal wells are presented  the results show that along with reservoir rock properties and in-situ stress state, the spacing among fractures has a strong influence on the evolution of multiple fracture propagation  finally, simulation of refracturing of un-depleted zones between closely-spaced horizontal wells is presented  the results demonstrate the change of stresses and pore pressure due to reservoir depletion mainly depends on the stress anisotropy, reservoir poroelastic properties, and the timing of infill well stimulation or production duration  |introduction |horizontal well stimulation usually involves creating cluster of multiple fractures in stages along the wellbore using different well completion techniques  these multiple fractures stages generate large contact surface area with the reservoir which results in increase of permeability and hence, increases the oil and gas production, and the heat energy production in case of the geothermal systems  the multistage fracturing of a single or multiple horizontal wells is usually carried out either in simultaneous or sequential manner  the multiple fracturing creation process is controlled by the mechanical interaction or “stress shadowing” among multiple fractures, in-situ stress anisotropy, and the net applied fluid pressure  the term stress shadow represents variation of stresses in the region surrounding a pressurized fracture, which is a function of applied fluid pressure  the spacing between the fractures and the horizontal wells, and the in-situ stress contrast play an important role in the mechanical interaction (sesetty and ghassemi, 2015 & 2016)  |several numerical models have been developed to simulate hydraulic fracturing process in the oil and gas reservoirs based on the elastic rock mass assumptions  the poroelastic effects on the hydraulic fracturing process are generally ignored  the rational is that the hydraulic fracture simulation time-scale is such that these effects have not time to develop or the magnitude of these effects are small enough to be neglected  however, in case of low permeability reservoirs (e g , tight oil and shale gas reservoir), where hydraulic fracturing is carried out using relatively low viscosity fluids and high injection rates, the coupled poroelastic phenomenon such as changes in the rock deformation due to diffusion of the pore pressure and pressure induced by mechanical deformation of the solid rock need to be incorporated for better understanding of the fracturing mechanism which often involves rock failure and/or reactivation of natural fractures  these poroelastic effects on the hydraulic fracturing process are included using the back-stress and back-pressure concept (cheng and detournay, 1988; vandamme et al , 1989; vandamme and roegiers, 1990; clifton and wang, 1991; ghassemi and roegiers, 1996) | 
2016-137 	 distinct element method based stability analysis of tunnels in a deep coal mine in china |abstract: |stability studies on two tunnels, a horseshoe-shaped and an inverted arch-shaped tunnel, in a deep coal mine in china, have been performed using the 3dec distinct element code and presented in this study  a pseudo time-dependent support installation procedure has been developed to incorporate the stress relaxation and deformation due to time gap between excavation and support installation  the utility of incorporating stress relaxation before support installation has been explored through observation of support factors of safety and grout failures  the numerical models have been analyzed for different support configurations and unsupported situations  the reinforcement provided by the supports has been demonstrated using changes in tunnel deformations and sizes of yield zones around the tunnels, in addition to observations of support factors of safety and grout failures  results indicate that using longer supports and floor bolting would provide higher stability for the rock masses around the tunnels  a comparison between the closure strains in the two tunnels indicates that the inverted arch tunnel may be more stable under the existing geo-mining conditions at the site  finally, parametric studies point to the importance of cohesion and friction angle estimation for intact rock, and basic friction angle estimation for the rock mass, to ensure robust numerical results  |introduction |since coal is one of the major sources of energy in china, mines have been forced to expand production by going deeper underground (he and song, 2012)  as extraction depths increase, associated ground control issues such as squeezing increase, due to higher in-situ stress fields  china has more coal mines at depths of 1000 m or higher (>20 mines), than any other country in the world (huang, 2008)  the high in-situ stress makes the coal workings hazardous and there have been a high number of roof collapse incidents  for instance, roof fall has been the single highest contributor for coal mine deaths in china, at nearly 1200 deaths in 2008 (the compiling committee of china, 2010)  in addition to the dangers of roof fall, deep excavations also undergo plastic deformations, especially in soft strata such as coal-measure rocks  the plastic deformations can be reduced or controlled through supporting routines such as installation of bolts, wire meshes, cables etc  commonly used support systems in deep metal mines have been documented in literature (eg  peng and tang, 1984; hoek et al , 2000; mark and braczak, 2000; aldorf and exner, 2013)  |the mine being studied in this paper is the xiezhuang coal mine in the xinwen mining area of the shandong province in china  this mine has some of the deepest coal workings in the world, at depths up to 1400 m  the tunnels from this mine, selected for the analyses presented in this paper, run in a soft sandy-shale stratum  the tunnels are of a conventional horseshoe shape and an inverted arch shape  there is no known significant structural discontinuity crossing the tunnel or water bearing strata around the tunnels  the rock mass around the tunnels has three orthogonal joint sets out of which the horizontal set (bedding planes) is most distinct, and has an average joint spacing of 1 m  due to the soft stratum and the horizontal joint set, the tunnels experience floor heaving | 
2016-138 	 evaluation of a modeling framework capturing the evolution of permeability in crushable granular solids |abstract: |this paper discusses a continuum approach to track the evolution of permeability in granular materials subjected to high-pressure compaction and grain breakage  to cope with a range of loading configurations and account for changes in grain size distribution, the breakage mechanics theory is used  in addition, the model predictions are linked to a kozeny equation to evaluate the drop of hydraulic conductivity resulting from the simultaneous loss of porosity and growth of surface area  compression/flow experiments available in the literature for different granular media are used, with the goal to validate the selected methodology for solids mimicking poorly consolidated reservoir rocks  a good agreement between model predictions and experiments is found, thus stressing the benefits of adopting microstructure-based constitutive laws for hydro-mechanical analyses of coupled geomechanical problems  |introduction |fluid flow in reservoir rocks is invariably coupled with processes such as compaction and strain localization  as a result, the interplay between solid matrix and pore-scale flow controls the permeability of rocks under site-specific conditions and it is crucial for the success of any activity involving injection/extraction of fluids (hettema et al , 2000)  in the context of granular rocks, a process likely to affect the success of depletion activities is the production of fines generated by the increase in effective stresses driven by the reduction of fluid pressures  this process is indeed able to induce fracture mechanisms at the scale of the grains, possibly accompanied by cement breakage and particle rearrangement (fortin et al , 2005)  |the variation of rock permeability as a result of loading processes has been widely studied from an experimental standpoint (zhou and wong, 1997; hettema et al , 2000; ostermeier, 2001), and various efforts have been made to embed porosity-dependent hydrologic properties into flow-deformation analyses of the injection/extraction process (rutqvist et al , 2002)  few constitutive models, however, are able to take into account the evolution of the microstructure upon inelastic deformation, as well as the impact of changes in specific surface area due to micro-fracture and grain crushing  |despite this, evidences indicate a significant role of the microstructural attributes on the hydrologic properties of a rock  an example is the permeability of cataclastic fault zones, where the loss of porosity and the increase of surface area due to particle fragmentation promote a substantial drop of permeability compared to the parent rock (evans et al , 1997)  similar conclusions have been obtained by zhou and wong, (1997) who illustrated via laboratory tests the link between decrease of hydraulic conductivity and microstructural damage | 
2016-139 	 construction of a geological information management system and application to construction sites |abstract: |in bedrock construction projects such as dams and tunnels, it is important to have a detailed grasp of the geological structure at the project site and to perform planning and construction appropriate to the situation  to that end, in recent years there have been investigations of various construction information modeling (cim) management methods that realize 3d modeling of the presumed geological situation and the results of actual geographic observations  this paper describes the creation of a construction site support system for geological risk, in particular issues related to geological information cim management system development, system content, and application to actual tunnel and dam excavation projects  |introduction |in bedrock construction projects such as dams and tunnels, it is important to have a detailed grasp of the geological situation at the project site and to perform planning and construction appropriate to the situation  to that end, geological surveys and geophysical surveys are performed at the investigation and design stages to evaluate geological distribution and engineering characteristics at the planned site, and dam foundations and tunnel falsework are designed based on the results  however, at the investigative and design stages there tend to be cost limits as well as limits to the precision of the above-described geological investigations and geophysical investigations, making it difficult to obtain a detailed understanding of the geological situation over a wide area at this stage  |to address these issues, actual excavation and tunnel faces are evaluated during construction to confirm details of the geological situation directly, and to evaluate any differences from the expected situation  depending on the results, it is important that additional engineering measures be considered and construction plans and designs reevaluated accordingly  |against this background, there have been various investigations of a method called “construction information modeling” (cim) in recent years (figs  1 and 2)1)  specifically, the geological situation as predicted from preliminary surveys is represented as a 3d model, and construction planning performed based on detailed verification of the distribution of ground defects so that appropriate measures can be employed  during construction phases, the results of geological observations of tunnel and excavation faces are added to the 3d model, thereby achieving more sophisticated and efficient construction results and aiding in reevaluations of construction plans and designs according to the situation at hand | 
2016-141 	 on size-dependent uniaxial compressive strength of sedimentary rocks in reservoir geomechanics |abstract: |the uniaxial compressive strength (ucs) of sedimentary rocks is one of the key parameters in petroleum related geomechanical projects from hydraulic fracturing to the estimation of in-situ stress magnitudes  due to the scarcity of the rock samples the ucs is often correlated to the interval transient time (equivalent to p-wave velocity) for the field applications, however; the size-dependency of ucs seems to be overlooked in such applications  while the conventional understanding of ucs-size dependency is that the ucs of intact rock decreases with an increase in sample size, recent studies have shown that the ucs increases with an increase in sample size up to a characteristic diameter and then decreases afterward (ascending-descending behavior)  therefore, in this study, a set of uniaxial compressive tests were conducted on shale samples having different diameters  the obtained results were combined with those available in the literature and the unified size effect law was then fitted to the whole data set  a generalized correlation was proposed for extrapolation of the ucs of rock formations from the usc of rock sample having 25 mm diameter  the calibration of a ucs-interval transient time correlation is also given for the shale sample as a practical example  finally, it was suggested that the procedure proposed here is adopted as a standard practice in petroleum related geomechanical projects for higher accuracy in design processes  |introduction |estimation of the mechanical properties of deep formations, in particular uniaxial compressive strength (ucs), is an essential aspect in petroleum geomechanics engineering from reservoir depletion and hydraulic fracturing to borehole stability and estimation of the magnitude of in-situ stress [1-3]  the direct destructive measurement or so-called static measurement [4, 5] is one of the reliable techniques to estimate the ucs of rock samples  only a limited number of cores however are usually available for such test  as a result, indirect estimation of ucs by correlating the ucs laboratory measurement to the interval transient time is of great interest [6, 7]  |the limitations of indirect measurements and required modifications such as dispersion correction has been previously discussed to improve the ucs estimations [8]  it appears that the importance of size effects on the static measurement of ucs [9] has not been yet fully appreciated in petroleum geomechanics despite earlier attempts to raise this issue [8]  size effects in rock engineering have been studied enormously over the last four decades with a common assumption that ucs decreases with an increase in sample size  this has led to the development of a number of descending size effect models based on statistics [9, 10], fracture energy [11] and multifractals [12]  however, it has been shown by masoumi et al  [13] that the uniaxial compressive strength is not only descending but also ascending (fig  1) e g  the sizes that are commonly used in ucs measurement of core samples in the laboratory |

2016-151 	 uncertainty quantification and inverse modeling of fault poromechanics and induced seismicity: application to a synthetic carbon capture and storage (ccs) problem |abstract: |coupling between fluid flow and mechanical deformation in porous media plays a critical role in subsurface hydrology, oil and gas operations and seismic activity in the earth's crust  for carbon capture and storage (ccs) projects, these coupled phenomena determine the interactions between the underground injection of co2, the geomechanical properties of the reservoir and the stability of existing faults  as a result of the inherent uncertainty that is present in complex geological structures, assessing fault stability and the potential for induced seismicity is a fundamental challenge in any modeling effort for ccs projects  here we present a formal framework for uncertainty analysis and data assimilation, which relies on a two-way-coupled computational modeling strategy for fluid flow and poromechanics of faults  we first quantify the sensitivity of key earthquake attributes (time of triggering, hypocenter location, and earthquake magnitude) to geologic properties such as rock permeability and coefficient of friction of the fault  we then perform a bayesian inversion that combines gaussian processes with markov chain monte carlo (mcmc), from which we determine the posterior distribution of the system parameters  we show that this posterior distribution correctly combines information from the synthetic earthquake observations with a priori knowledge about the unknown parameters  |introduction |geologic co2 sequestration is regarded as a promising technology to prevent rising co2 concentration in the atmosphere from industrial emissions  while various types of underground geological formations have been considered for permanent storage of supercritical co2 (ipcc, 2005), deep saline aquifers provide the most attractive option for gigatonne-scale storage, given their capacity and ubiquitous nature (szulczewski et al , 2012)  |a principal concern expressed about the practical implementation of co2 sequestration in deep geological formations is the difficulty in evaluating potential geomechanical risk and the possibility of generating induced or triggered seismicity through stress perturbations in the underground system (nrc, 2013; zoback and gorelick, 2012)  complex computational models that combine multiphase flow and fault poromechanics have been proposed to analyze this type of problems (e g , cappa and rutqvist, 2011; jha and juanes, 2014)  a fundamental challenge associated to the coupled flow-geomechanics models is the inherent uncertainty associated with model parameters, which stems from the always-difficult description of complex geological structures in the subsurface  in addition, for problems where seismicity could be potentially associated to a co2 storage project, the problem of data assimilation (i e , model inversion using the observed seismic data) becomes a challenging task due to the complex characteristics of the seismic waveform signals | 
2016-152 	 3d thermo-poromechanical analysis of reservoir stimulation using damage mechanics with application to the fenton hill hdr experiment |abstract: |the coupled thermo-poromechanical processes are associated with the stimulation of geothermal and hpht petroleum reservoirs  the processes involve strong coupling among fracture pressurization, pore pressure diffusion in the matrix,, transport of heat, change of in-situ stresses and rock deformation  in this work, a fully coupled model is built to study egs stimulation  in order to verify the model, comparisons between numerical and analytical solutions are performed with excellent results  also, code-to-code comparison for a thermoelastic consolidation problem shows very good agreement with published results  at last, simulations of a field case from phase i fenton hill geothermal reservoir are presented to illustrate plausible mechanisms involved in the stimulation of the fractured geothermal reservoir  the numerical predictions of the bottom-hole pressure vs  time show the proposed stimulation conceptual model and the simulator can capture the main characteristics observed in the fenton hill field experiment  |introduction |the coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical (thm) processes in porous and fractured media are associated with a wide range of applications  these include solute transport of nuclear waste repository through rock mass, geothermal energy extraction, fluid injection induced seismicity, injection stimulation of petroleum reservoirs with water that is cooler than the reservoir fluids, and so on  all of these problems involves strong coupling among pressurization and motion of the pore fluid, transport of heat, change of in-situ stresses and deformation of the fracture and the porous matrix  |since biot (1941) proposed the theory of poroelasticity for fluid-saturated isothermal porous media, extensive and excellent efforts have been spent to extend the theory to investigate a wide variety of mechanical phenomena  rice and cleary (1976) have recast biot's theory in terms with straightforward physical concepts  a substantial literature exists to extend the well-known isothermal theory to include the thermal effects (schiffman 1971; booker and savvidou 1984, 1985; kurashige 1989; mctigue 1990)  the governing equations derived in these papers are different only in detail (mctigue 1986)  both analytic and numerical methods are developed to demonstrate solutions for coupled heat transfer, changes of fluid pressure, deformation and alteration of in-situ stresses in a linearly elastic, non-isothermal porous medium | 
2016-153 	 bakken formation shales nano-scale analysis understand mechanical parameters |abstract: |bakken formation is a typical unconventional reservoir which is the primary source of oil production in the williston basin, nd  due to its low permeability and porosity, hydraulic fracturing has been the leading and productive tool to increase the production in the past decade  elastic properties of the rock such as young's modulus, poisson's ratio, and shear modulus is one of the most important parameters which can influence the success of hydraulic fracturing  thus, accurate and intensive understanding of the elastic properties is essential and compulsory for hydraulic fracturing design  in this paper, we collected samples from three different members (upper and lower shale and middle member) of bakken formation  we used 2d xrd to analyze the mineral compositions and fesem to capture images from the microstructures of the rock samples  then we used nanoindenter to evaluate the young's modulus and hardness values of the rock, and compared the results  the results showed that the mineral composition varies with the samples through depth  upper and lower bakken shows more content of clay minerals while middle bakken incorporates more quartz  from the sem images, abundant natural fractures can be seen in the middle bakken formation  finally, it was found that young's modulus also varies with the depth and mineralogical and microstructural compositions  |introduction |after the commercial boom of shale gas and oil in north america, shale reservoir exploration has been widely carried out by many countries  for the unconventional reservoirs, hydraulic fracturing has been a significant development to increase the oil and gas production (li, 2016)  fracturing not only increases the production but also adds the total reserves 9 billion bbls of oil and more than 700 tscf of gas has been added to us reserves since 1949 (carl and michael, 2010)  many factors can influence the performance of hydraulic fracturing, such as the in-situ stresses, heterogeneities, fractures and pore structures (kissinger, 2013; lamont, 1963; johnson, 1998)  elastic properties such as young's modulus is one of the most important parameters that can influence the design of hydraulic fractures (britt, 2009)  rocks with higher modulus are always easier to be fractured  conventionally, the industry or researchers either use cores to carry out dynamic and/or static experiments on plugs or use the sonic log to obtain young's modulus  (priyavrat, 2013)  nano-indentation, which measures the applied load with the depth of penetration of an indenter shows promising application to estimate the elastic properties  in petroleum and civil engineering, many researchers have already acquired the nanoindentation method to study the elastic properties of rock particularly those including organic matter (kumar, 2012; mason, 2014; bathija, 2008)  we employed nanoindentation analysis to study the samples from the upper, middle, and lower bakken formation to better understand the mechanical behavior of this rock unit  also, this data was integrated with the xrd and sem results to correlate the elastic parameters with the rock fabric and composition | 
2016-160 	 three-dimensional bonded-particle discrete element modeling of transversely isotropic rock: verification and application to laboratory test on shale |abstract: |consideration of anisotropy is important in various rock types and applications, e g , borehole stability in shale formation especially when drilling sub-parallel to bedding planes  in this study, three-dimensional bonded-particle discrete element modeling was performed in a transversely isotropic rock using pfc3d as an extension to the previous work conducted in two dimensions (park and min, 2015)  rock anisotropy was taken into account by means of inserting a smooth joint model and verification conducted in terms of both elastic and strength variation with respect to anisotropy angle compared well with the analytical solutions  this study includes validation of discrete element model where the modeled strength and elastic behavior of shale closely matches with those of the laboratory observations  the dem model was able to capture the key anisotropic characteristics observed in the laboratory test such as drastic reduction of elastic modulus and strength affected by transversely isotropic plane which is often the weakest and most deformable  finally, the three-dimensional discrete element model with embedded smooth joints was successfully applied to simulate the laboratory hollow-cylinder testing, which provides an improved insight into the wellbore instability observed in situ  |introduction |anisotropy of rock is generally observed in various rock types, e g , shale that contains a set of parallel bedding planes  these weak cohesive planes contribute to large deformation and low shear strength, thereby resulting in unpredictable borehole damage especially when drilling sub-parallel to bedding planes (okland et al , 1998; zhang, 2013; meier et al , 2015)  thus, the mechanical behavior of bedding planes with respect to their orientation should be properly considered in borehole stability analyses  |discrete element method (dem) particulate system is a powerful approach for simulating the material dynamic behavior under a given boundary condition without the need to establish the constitutive law (potyondy and cundall, 2004)  the main advantage of bonded-particle dem is its outstanding ability to monitor the evolving micromechanisms that can account for rock failure process  furthermore, applications of bonded-particle dem have been expanded into a complex rock mass modeling in larger scale in which natural fractures in rock mass have been taken into account using the discrete fracture network (dfn) model by means of smooth joint model (mas ivars et al , 2011)  while previous studies on the fractured rock mass behaviors focused more on the natural fractures that are normally separated from each other with very low mechanical properties, there is a need for investigation regarding the behavior of weak cohesive planes within the intact rock, such as bedding planes that manifest transverse isotropy of rocks | 
2016-1620 	 time lapsed image logging to characterize natural and hydraulic fracture interaction: innovative “first in type” data acquisition |this paper was prepared for, but not presented at the spwla 57th annual logging symposium held in reykjavik, iceland june 25-29, 2016  |abstract |hydraulic fracturing is established as the technology for economic exploitation of tight reservoirs  the inherent natural fractures (nf) in the rock fabric provide enhanced porosity and permeability, whereas induced hydraulic fractures (hf) provide pathways for hydrocarbon flow into the wellbore  understanding hydraulic fracture mechanism and its interaction with natural fractures plays a vital role in assessment of stimulated rock volume (srv) and prediction of flow rates  |barmer hill formation in mangala & aishwariya area of barmer basin (north west india) is a low permeability laminated diatomite/porcellanite reservoir with high porosity (20-35%) but low matrix permeability (0 2- 4md)  conventional cores, image logs, and well test data suggest presence of natural fractures in this reservoir  after the initial success of production testing with hf in appraisal/development wells, it was felt necessary to understand the nf-hf interaction in these reservoirs for large scale field development  |understanding of rock failure mechanism and geomechanical properties (young’s modulus, poisson’s ratio and uniaxial compressive strength) are important in designing a frac job  however, well flow rates are very much dependent on the rock fabric and natural fracture characteristics  hence better understanding of interaction of hydraulic fractures with natural fractures is essential for successful field development  |to understand nf-hf interaction, an innovative idea was tested using time lapse image log acquisition plan during multiple phases of induced hydraulic fracture operation  generally, oil-base mud is used for drilling in this area to avoid shale stability problems; however, well-x was drilled with water base mud in aishwariya field to obtain high-resolution micro-resistivity imaging  a pre-frac “base” image log (run-1) was acquired to identify laminations and presence of natural fractures & their orientation  consecutively induced hydraulic fracture was initiated using water and then by proppant separately in two operations  image logs were acquired after each operation as run-2 (post step rate test-1) and run-3 (post step rate test-2)  |base image log indicated variations in angle and distribution of natural fractures in different units of barmer hill  comparison of subsequent image logs brought out that while the rock was relatively resistant when homogeneous on image logs, the laminations helped in hydraulic fracture initiation  presence of pre-existing fractures at high angle (>30deg) helped in fracture initiation while no hydraulic fractures could be generated where low angle fractures (<15 deg) existed  this is in agreement with the principle of critically stressed fractures  it was also evident that new induced fractures were created using water & proppant and also further accentuated the natural fractures  micro-seismic monitoring in key wells in the barmer hill also confirmed that the rock develops tensile failure along maximum horizontal stress direction in this low anisotropy environment along with frac continuity between the layers  this innovative field experiment was also useful to understand the rock behavior at micro & mega-scale  |this innovative data acquisition program is “first in type” and can act as a benchmark study to understand the natural/hydraulic fracture interaction in fractured reservoirs  | 
2016-163 	 laboratory study on cyclic hydraulic fracturing of pocheon granite in korea |abstract: |hydraulic fracturing is of great interest for shale gas as well as enhanced geothermal systems (egs)  we present a laboratory-scale proof of concept study for cyclic hydraulic fracturing in which an injection pressure smaller than the monotonic breakdown pressure under continuous injection is applied in a cyclic manner  a series of hydraulic fracturing tests was performed on pocheon granite specimen having a diameter of 50 mm and a height of 100 mm containing an inner hole of 8 mm in diameter  the average breakdown pressures of granite through continuous injection tests were calculated considering inherent strength anisotropy among rift, grain and hardway planes  a preliminary investigation shows that the threshold of a number of cycles for effective cyclic fracturing is in the order of tens of cycles with injection pressure larger than 82 % of the monotonic breakdown pressure  the generated fractures were observed by means of x-ray computed tomography (ct)  it is found that fractures induced by continuous injection are more like a single fracture, while there were many branch failures for cyclic injection particularly at a large number of cycles  the anecdotal evidences from this study imply that hydraulic fracturing in the field could be conducted with a smaller injection pressure when it is subjected to a reasonable number of cycles  |introduction |hydraulic fracturing with minimum impact on the environment, i e  induced seismicity, is of great interest in hydraulic fracturing for shale gas as well as enhanced geothermal systems (egs)  some concepts have been presented, like fatigue hydraulic fracturing and multistage stimulation  the key point in fatigue hydraulic fracturing is the frequent lowering of the injection pressure to allow stress relaxation at the fracture tips (zang et al , 2013)  reducing the maximum injection pressure by cyclic injection will lower the fracture breakdown pressure and, as a consequence, induced seismicity is expected to be smaller  |for multistage stimulation, instead of massive hydraulic stimulation, injection rate and pressure are controlled and stimulated reservoir will be formed stage by stage (zimmermann et al , 2015; meier et al , 2015)  |the multistage stimulation method has been successfully applied in commercial shale gas development (johri and zoback, 2013; lee and kim, 2016)  on the other hand, the fatigue hydraulic fracturing is still at concept proof stage and its validation in field scale has yet to be achieved in egs (zimmermann et al , 2010; yoon et al , 2015)  as the name implies, fatigue hydraulic fracturing is to fracture rocks by cyclic injection to reach a fatigue failure  a general understanding of fatigue failure is that damages accumulate in rocks during cyclic loading, consequently leading to strength decrease  however, the mechanism of rock fatigue failure has not been fully understood yet  both rock type (mineralogically and texturally) and loading mode influence fatigue behavior of rocks (erarslan and williams, 2012a)  note, however, that the fatigue cycling process during mechanical loading (erarslan and williams, 2012a) can be very different from the fatigue hydraulic fracturing process because of the involvement of high-pressurized fluid cycles operating at fracture tips (zang et al , 2013) | 
2016-167 	 a fully coupled hydro-mechanical model for discrete fractured porous rock masses based on numerical manifold method |abstract: |we developed a numerical manifold method (nmm) model for analysis of coupled hydro-mechanical processes in porous rock containing discrete fractures  using a non-conforming mesh approach, fractures are conveniently discretized by dividing nmm mesh covers along fracture traces resulting in a discontinuous model, which can consider discrete fracture deformation (e g  opening and slip) and fracture fluid flow within a permeable and deformable porous rock matrix  we revised shi`s original scheme (shi, 1988) by adding a fracture constitutive model with fracture normal and shear stiffness for mechanically open states  for fluid flow in fractures, we developed a new model to consider along-fracture and normal-to-fracture fluid flow without introducing additional degrees of freedom  we further implemented the new model into nmm with a two-cover-mesh system and with a tree-cutting algorithm to generate the non-conforming mesh  we verified the code for hydro-mechanical coupling in deformable porous media containing single and two sets of fractures and we demonstrated the capability on a problem involving coupled hydro-mechanical behavior of a complex fracture network with multiple fracture intersections  the ultimate goal is to develop an efficient and practical model for analyzing large-scale hydraulic fracturing and fracture network stimulations in energy production  |introduction |coupled hydro-mechanical (hm) processes, i e , the interaction between hydraulic and mechanical fields, are significant in geological engineering, such as oil and gas extraction, geothermal energy and nuclear waste disposal, especially when the geological media consists of fractured rock (rutqvist and stephansson, 2003)  fractured rock may contain arbitrarily oriented and complexly intersected, thin (millimeters to microns) fractures  in such a geological system, two types of hydro-mechanical couplings prevails, i e , direct and indirect couplings  direct coupling occurs directly between mechanical and hydraulic fields in forms of pore-volume interaction  specifically, the fluid pressure changes instantaneously affect deformation and the volume change instantaneously induces changes in fluid pressure  this pore-volume interaction can be described by biot`s equations (biot, 1941)  indirect coupling refers to indirect interaction between mechanical and hydraulic fields through changes in their material properties  specifically, effective stress, affected by fluid pressure, would change the stiffness of fractures, and the deformation of fractures change their hydraulic conductivities  this interaction, involving changing fracture mechanical and hydraulic properties is usually represented by constitutive functions based on laboratory data or in situ experiments (rutqvist et al , 1998, 2000) | 
2016-168 	 simulation of mode ii unconstrained fracture path formation coupled with continuum anisotropic damage propagation in shale |abstract: |the objective of this work is to simulate mode ii multi-scale fracture propagation in shale by coupling a continuum anisotropic damage model with a cohesive zone model (czm)  the continuum damage mechanics – based differential stress induced damage (dsid) model is used to represent micro-scale crack evolution  dsid parameters were calibrated against pre-peak points of stress/strain curves obtained experimentally during triaxial compression tests performed in bakken shale  a bilinear czm is employed to represent macroscale fracture propagation  we calculated the effective shear modulus of a continuum that contained a distribution of parallel cracks according to the dsid model (which does not account for crack interactions) and according to kachanov's micromechanical model (which accounts for crack interactions)  simulations confirmed that above a crack density or damage of 0 3, crack interactions could not be ignored, and we used that threshold to define the transition between continuum damage propagation and discrete fracture propagation and subsequently, to calibrate the shear cohesive strength of the czm  the czm cohesive energy release rate was determined by calibrating a numerical model of triaxial compression test against experimental data obtained on bakken shale  the cylindrical sample was modeled with a czm to pre-define an inclined cohesive fracture, and the dsid model was assigned to the surrounding elements  we used our calibrated czm-dsid model to simulate a biaxial compression test in plane strain  results clearly show that the proposed modeling strategy not only allows simulating the advancement of macro-fracture tips, but also captures the inception and growth of micro-cracks that form damaged zones, as well as the transition between smeared damage and discrete fracture  |introduction |the analysis of fracture propagation in geomaterials (such as rock, concrete) still remains a challenge from the perspective of numerical modeling, which needs to capture micro crack (damage) inception and growth up to the point of macro fracture initiation and propagation, and the formation of fracture paths after the global softening in later simulation stages  state-of-the-art finite element tools are either based on continuum damage mechanics (cdm) or on fracture mechanics (fm)  in cdm, fractures are considered as the ultimate stage of damage accumulation, at which the energy dissipated in the damage zone equals the energy that needs to be released to create new surfaces (mazars and pijaudier-cabot, 1996)  in fm, discontinuous displacement fields propagate through a continuum according to physics-based criteria (xu and needleman, 1994)  fm theories are usually implemented in cohesive zone models (czm) or extended finite element methods (xfem)  because cdm cannot be used to simulate fracture surface debonding at late crack propagation stages and since state-of-the-art czm and xfem do not account for micro-crack propagation prior to fracture surface debonding, several researchers coupled cdm and xfem (comi et al , 2007; jirasek and zimmermann, 2001) or cdm and czm (cuvilliez et al , 2012)  however, even in these coupled models, there is no rigorous calibration of the critical damage threshold that marks the transition between micro-crack propagation and macro-fracture initiation  moreover, the fracture path depends on the location of the cz elements or on the interpolation order chosen in the xfes  thus in the present study, we propose a numerical method that couples a cdm model (for the bulk) to a cohesive zone model (for the fracture)  we present the theoretical framework and calibration method for the cdm model and for the czm in sections 2 and 3, respectively  in section 4, we present the results obtained during simulations of biaxial compression tests in which czs are placed at the boundaries of all the finite elements of the mesh | 
2016-169 	 evaluating the effect of earthquakes on open pit mine slopes |abstract: |there have been some earthquake induced failure instances in open pit slopes, none of those were significant to be recorded as causing operational interruptions or injuries  however, there have been a significant number of natural rock slope failures due to earthquakes  this paper addresses this dichotomy through studies of earthquakes and associated geological parameters relating to natural slopes and open pit mines  the earthquake parameters include magnitude, epi-central distance, focal depth and intensity while considered geological characteristics include failure type, water content, rock type and topography  analyzing these parameters it was concluded that the natural slope failures are triggered by earthquakes with depth and epi-central distance of less than 40 and 150 kilometers respectively, and only nine open pit mines were subjected to such earthquakes  the studies of the earthquake intensity as a function of magnitude, epi-central distance and focal depth show that only ten mines were subjected to shaking intensities of more than 6 in last 25 years, while for natural slopes almost 90 percent are subjected to this range of intensities  among the geological characteristics, water content, failure type and topographical effect were found to separates open pit mines from natural slopes in responding to earthquakes  particularly, water content plays a role in 90 percent of the natural slopes while open pit mines are relatively less affected due to being dewatered naturally or mechanically  most recorded natural slope failures are shallow, which could be not considered as reportable failures in open pit mines  natural slope failures are commonly triggered on the hill tops and ridges as a result of topographical amplification phenomenon while the absence of this effect due to one face or valley shape pit slopes leads to increase in pit slope stability  |introduction |the stability of natural and man-made rock slopes during earthquakes is always a great concern for rock mechanic engineers  natural slopes are usually stable when they are not disturbed by an external force  however, there are a significant number of instances where failures accrued on natural slopes during seismic activities (keefer, 1984; bommer, 1999)  although most of these failures are reported to be in a small scale, there were a few cases in which a large volumes of rock and soil where involved in the failure that can be a high threat to both buildings and life (jibson et al , 1994; harp and jibson, 1995; havenith et al , 2003)  stability of man-made slopes excavated for highways, dams, open pit mines and power plants during earthquakes are also important in civil and mining engineering projects  stability of open pit mine slopes is crucial for economic reasons and safety, due to the presence of miners, expensive equipment, and production requirements in the mining process  in contrast to natural slopes, none of the earthquake activity observations on open pit mine slopes has been reported as significant interruption to the mining operation or serious injury  however, by reaching the final stage of mining in open pit mines the slope angle gets steeper and the new mining methods like highwall mining extend the final pit slope life which increases the probability of seismic activities during their life time  these circumstances cause debates about the necessity of performing seismic analysis for open pit slope stability (read and stacy, 2009) | 
2016-172 	 a novel approach to model dfns validating the geological evolution with present day fracture distributions |abstract: |a new workflow for fracture prediction and modelling based on geological time-step dfn has been used to better constrain the fracture distribution and timing of generation in the motatan domo sur field of venezuela  using the fault response modelling module in move™, simulations of fracture generation under two tectonic transpressive events with shmax of 280° and 310° were modeled to find the best-fit fracture forming event as compared with the observed data  these events are of paleocene-eocene and miocene age, respectively  this workflow includes a dfn built from borehole images of five wells whose fracture properties are spatially modeled taken into account structural and petrophysical indicators of sub-surface fracture systems  a comparison between measured and modeled fractures is discussed to evaluate the influence of each tectonic event  |introduction |modeling the location of discontinuities (faults and fractures) in the subsurface associated with a given tectonic event requires a geomechanical model, which incorporates stress boundary conditions and mechanical properties  in this paper, we outline a new workflow which allows fracture forming events to be simulated and used to predict fracture distributions across reservoirs; the results of these simulations can supplement petrophysical, geomechanical and subseismic indicators to produce more representative fracture models  this workflow is applied to the south dome of the motatan reservoir, which is located in the tectonically complex maracaibo basin of venezuela  |this workflow consists of two phases: 1) the building of present day discrete fracture network (dfn) through the integration of petrophysical, geomechanical, structural and subseismic indicators of fracture systems (e g  curvature and bore hole image data); and 2) the simulation of slip on faults, calculating the resulting strain field and comparing predicted fracture orientations for different tectonic events with the observed fractures  the combination of these two phases provides a better understanding of natural fracture systems and provides information about the development of reservoir fracture systems through time | 
2016-173 	 mechanisms-based fracture model for geological materials |abstract: |over the past decade, hydraulic fracturing has become an industry-changing technology that enables commercial production of hydrocarbons from previously non-productive low-permeability shale formations  r&d efforts focus on the development of economically efficient production protocols, where the selection of engineering solutions is guided by numerical simulations  typically, the simulations are based on phenomenological fracture models that are adapted for the prediction of fluid-driven fracture processes at depth  these models rely on a long-term trial-and-error approach and offer reliable material response at conditions that have previously been experimentally investigated  for this reason, an extrapolation of such phenomenological models into untested regimes is not always successful  |we break with the tradition of using phenomenology and, instead, construct a mechanisms-based fracture model for geological materials  our modified mohr-coulomb fracture model is developed in the framework of tensor representation theory, which allows for a direct translation of fracture mechanisms and the observed inelastic deformation into a mathematically precise description  in our description, plastic deformation is rate dependent and dilatation is determined over a three-dimensional topography of the slip plane  the contribution of asperity degradation is also included  the model monitors crack orientations and, in this manner, adds to the fracture-induced anisotropy  fracture strength is stochastic  we also introduce an effective stress that accounts for the hydraulic pressure deposited onto crack surfaces  friction-induced damage and tensile fractures are the sources of an enhanced hydraulic permeability  our permeability model is also stochastic, and it describes the formation of flow-channels due to the coalescence of micro-cracks in tension and shear  to illustrate the approach we choose material properties applicable to shale  we test the material model using uniaxial tension, compression and triaxial stress conditions on a single element before advancing to relevant subsurface model geometries  |our current study focuses on the simulation of fluid-driven fracture near a pressurized wellbore  the results demonstrate that fracture growth is often dynamic; inertial forces play a significant role  because fracture strength is stochastic, the process often becomes dynamically unstable and produces bursts of kinetic energy that propagate away from localized regions of low fracture strength  as expected, friction-induced damages are responsible for the formation of micro-channels, which in turn are connected to the channels formed by the dominant tensile cracks  the model is implemented to abaqus as a material user subroutine  we calibrate the properties of a shale-like material and study the material responses under axial loading and selected subsurface conditions | 
2016-175 	 including a stochastic discrete fracture network into one-way coupled poromechanical modeling of injection-induced shear re-activation |abstract: |we present a finite element method for the one-way coupled poromechanical modeling of injection-induced shear re-activation in a porous medium embedded with a highly conductive pre-existing discrete fracture network (dfn)  the fluid problem is formulated over an integrated matrix-fracture domain by permitting two sets of flow constitutive laws and by admitting discontinuities in normal fluid fluxes across fractures to account for matrix-fracture mass exchanges  based on a transversal uniformity assumption, a novel hybrid-dimensional approach is proposed where factures need not be explicitly meshed along normal directions, but are modeled as linear line elements tangentially conforming to the edges of linear triangular elements representing the porous matrix  fracture nodes holds no additional degrees of freedom  a dimensional transformation matrix is introduced during finite element interpolation, leading to three additional equi-dimensional modification terms to the mass and stiffness matrices to account for contribution of fractures to flow  the gradient of the modeled fluid pressure is then passed as an equivalent body force vector to the solid problem to solve for induced poroelastic stresses by assuming a single solid constitutive law for the medium  finally, coulomb stresses on fractures are calculated for determining onset of shear re-activation  |introduction |fluid injection into naturally fractured geological media can induce seismicity over a wide range of scales  an understanding of the physical processes of induced seismic and micro-seismic events helps to better assess potential seismic hazards associated with, e g , co2 sequestration and wastewater injection, as well as to assist stimulation of hydrocarbon and geothermal reservoirs with ultra-low permeability  the triggering mechanism of fluid injection induced shear re-activation on pre-existing fractures is fundamentally a coupled hydro-mechanical process  the presence of a discrete fracture network (dfn) imposes significant challenges on numerical modeling of this coupled process, due to not only the geometric complexity, but also two sets of material properties and constitutive laws for both the fluid and the solid, as well as discontinuous changes in modeling targets | 
2016-177 	 chemo-mechanical damage and healing of granular salt: micro-macro modeling |abstract: |a micro-macro chemo-mechanical model of damage and healing is proposed to predict the evolution of salt stiffness and deformation upon micro-crack propagation, opening, closure and rebonding, which is the result of pressure solution  we hypothesize that at a given grain contact, the surface area of contact dictates which mechanism dominates the rate of chemical process  based on thermodynamic equations of dissolution, diffusion and precipitation, we establish a formula for the critical contact area that marks the transition between diffusion-dominated kinetics and dissolution-precipitation-dominated kinetics  we relate the change of contact area to the change of solid volume in the representative elementary volume, and we define net damage as the sum of the mechanical damage and the chemical porosity change  a continuum-based damage mechanics framework is used to deduce the change of salt stiffness with net damage  a stress path comprising a tensile loading, a compressive unloading, a creep–chemical stage and a reloading is simulated  stiffness degradation and residual strain development are observed with the evolution of damage under tensile loading  unilateral effects of crack closure can be predicted by the model upon compression  our micro-macro model also allows predicting the evolution of the probability distribution of contact areas upon chemical effects, as well as the consequent change of net damage and stiffness  the proposed modeling framework is expected to shed light on coupled chemical processes that govern microstructure changes and subsequent variations of deformation rate, stiffness and permeability in salt rock, and to allow the assessment of long-term behavior of geological storage facilities in salt  |introduction |salt rocks, a common geo-material with low gas permeability and favorable creep properties leading to potential fracture healing, are usually regarded as a favorable host for compressed air energy storage (caes), radioactive waste repository, and gas storage  |during creep, crystal gliding mechanisms and grain sliding induce geometric incompatibilities, which build up stresses and intra-granular crack propagation  as grains rearrange, stresses at grain contacts can trigger dissolution, salt ion transport through fluid films, and re-precipitation at low-stress grain boundaries  this phenomenon, known as pressure-solution, can occur in the same conditions of pressure and temperature as grain boundary diffusion | 
2016-178 	 influence of boundary constraint stiffness on stress heterogeneity modelling |abstract: |we have quantitatively analysed the influence of boundary constraint stiffness on stress heterogeneity modelling in fractured rock mass using the two dimensional (2d) combined finite-discrete element method (femdem)  we generalise the boundary constraints found in the literature to a four-plate boundary with variable stiffness  for a 1 5 <u+00d7> 1 5 m rock mass model subjected to boundary loading, the stress tensors induced in the model under various boundary stiffness conditions are extracted and their scatter calculated using euclidean dispersion – a scalar value akin to standard deviation  the results show an overall decrease in euclidean dispersion as the boundary stiffness increases  our findings lead us to suggest that when undertaking stress heterogeneity analyses, a boundary constraint stiffness equal to the young's modulus of rock should be used  although this is only a preliminary investigation of stress heterogeneity simulation, it nevertheless suggests the importance of boundary constraints when conducting such numerical modelling in rock mechanics  |introduction |in situ stress is an important parameter for a wide range of endeavours in rock mechanics, including rock engineering design, hydraulic fracturing analysis, rock mass permeability and earthquake potential evaluation (amadei and stephansson, 1997; latham et al , 2013; matsumoto et al , 2015; zang and stephansson, 2010; zoback, 2010)  because of the inherent complexity of fractured rock masses in terms of varying rock properties and the presence of discontinuities, especially in highly fractured rock masses, stress often displays significant heterogeneity (martin, 1990; obara and sugawara, 2003)  the in situ stress measurement results shown in fig  1 exemplify the dramatic variation in terms of both principal stress magnitude and orientation that may be observed in a small zone (obara and sugawara, 2003)  |studying stress heterogeneity is not only beneficial to understanding the complex nature of fractured rock masses, but also to supporting any rock engineering-related analysis  however, it is often not possible for stress heterogeneity to be thoroughly interpreted due to a lack of sufficient in situ stress data (harrison et al , 2010)  due to implementation difficulties and budget limits, most rock engineering projects usually do not have the luxury to conduct a large number of in situ stress measurements, with the result that numerical simulation approaches need to be employed to investigate stress heterogeneity (harrison et al , 2010; hart, 2003) | 
2016-180 	 fracturing fluids effects on mechanical properties of organic rich shale |abstract: |proppant embedment can be responsible for the decrease in hydraulic fracture's aperture and fracture conductivity in organic rich shale reservoirs  a main reason for proppant embedment is the softening and weakening effects of the reservoir rocks after their exposure to the fracturing fluids which are introduced during the stimulation process  slickwater fracturing has been extensively used in stimulating shale formation  the base polymer/ friction reducer (fr) for the slickwater fluids can be either in the form of water-in-oil emulsion or as a dry powder  in this work, three clay stabilizers including kcl, ki and 50% tetramethylammonium chloride (tmac) and two forms of friction reducers have been studied  six fluids with different combinations of clay stabilizers and friction reducers have been prepared  the organic rich eagle ford shale samples have been treated with these fluids for a certain amount of time, and then uniaxial compressive test and indirect tensile strength test were conducted to systematically investigate the impact of these fluids on various rock mechanical properties  |experimental results show that all six fracture fluids have significant impacts on rock mechanical properties  significant reduction in ultimate compressive strength, young's modulus and brazilian tensile strength have been observed after the exposure of these specimens in fracture fluids  in addition, rocks tend to become more ductile  the fluid containing 0 5 gpt fr (in an emulsion form) has the most impact on shale mechanical properties among others, resulting in 68% compressive strength reduction, 75% young's modulus reduction and 42% of brazilian tensile strength reduction  the mechanisms on fracturing fluids weakening rock mechanical properties are discussed in this work  the results of this research provide insights on fracture fluids selection and preventing proppant embedment for tight sand and shale reservoirs to optimize the hydrocarbon productivity  |introduction |proppant embedment, as shown in figure 1, can be responsible for the decrease in hydraulic fracture's aperture and reduction of fracture conductivity in organic rich shale reservoirs  alramahi and sundberg (2012) have conducted experiments to draw the relationship between the fracture conductivity and closure stress (figure 2)  they found that the corresponding normalized fracture conductivity, defined as a ratio of the conductivity at a given closure pressure to the one at 3 45 mpa, decreases from 1 0 to 1 0 e-6, as shown in figure 2  |the main reason for the proppant embedment is likely due to the softening and weakening effects of the reservoir rocks after their exposure to the fracturing fluids, which are introduced into the wellbore during the hydraulic fracturing stimulation process  this weakening effect will also influence the propagation and orientation of hydraulic fractures  the weakening effect by pure water alone on rock mechanical properties has been observed and well documented in previous studies (han, 2003; meng et al , 2005; hu et al , 2014; and lin and lai, 2014)  uniaxial compressive strength (ucs) experiments conducted by lin and lai (2014) show that young's modulus decreases significantly with the increase of water content  this conclusion was further verified by acoustic velocity measurement in shales (lai et al , 2015)  meng et al  (2005) concluded that the increase of water content could lead to stronger molecule active ability, and thus affects rock strength and elastic properties  hu et al  (2014) indicated that when water content changes in shale, the corresponding water menisci would be altered, which induces changes in bonding force between solid particles and therefore influences the mechanical properties | 
2016-181 	 numerical modeling of hydraulic fracture propagation from horizontal wells in anisotropic shale |abstract: |the purpose of this paper is to study the growth of hydraulic fractures in anisotropic rocks such as shale  the boundary value problems of anisotropic materials often are difficult to solve due to the mathematical complexity, therefore such problems are treated numerically under the assumption of isotropy even though such assumption rarely holds in reality  this paper uses the constant element anisotropic displacement discontinuity method (addm) for fracture deformation with square root elements at crack tips to calculate stress intensity factors accurately  3d correction factor g is also developed for anisotropic ddm to include height effect in 2d problems using the analytical solution for stress distribution around a line crack in orthotropic material  the crack propagation is modeled according to the normal stress ratio criterion which accounts elliptically varying fracture toughness while calculating crack trajectory  crack extension occurs when mode-1 stress intensity factor at tips reaches a critical value kic (<u+03c6>)  the fracture deformation is fully coupled with fluid flow inside the fracture by solving all the unknowns simultaneously using globally convergent newton-raphson method  the simulation results show significant difference in fracture geometries and apertures between isotropic and anisotropic materials  in anisotropic rock, the direction of plane of elastic symmetry w r t fracture influences the fracture geometry  simulations of multi-stage single lateral fracturing, multi-lateral zipper fracturing in anisotropic shale are included  |introduction |shale is categorized as an anisotropic rock at different scales  intrinsic anisotropy of elastic properties of shale is often attributed to the composition of the shale and preferred orientation of platy clay particles  [josh et al , 2012] correlated the degree of anisotropy in shales to the amount of clay and organic content present in it  at field scale all rocks exhibit anisotropy in some form  naturally fractured rocks are softer in the direction perpendicular to the fractures  for example rock with 3 mutually perpendicular sets of fracture systems can be considered as an orthotropic material in the analysis of rock deformation [goodman, 1976]  also micro-cracks can lead to the evolution of stress-induced anisotropy in shales [dewhurst and siggins, 2006, sone, 2012]  the degree of anisotropy in this case depends on the orientation of micro-cracks w r t to principal stresses  along with elastic anisotropy, the shales also exhibit strong strength anisotropy due to the presence of bedding planes  the tensile strength of shale when load is applied perpendicular to the bedding is less compared to case when the load is applied parallel to the bedding  the bedding acts as a plane of weakness that promotes early failure when tension is applied perpendicular to it  |[suarez-rivera et al , 2011] reported degree of anisotropy observed in elastic modulus, compressive and tensile strengths measured parallel and perpendicular to the bedding planes for various mudstones  the degree of anisotropy in young's modulus for the 7 reported samples varied from 1 05 to 4 01 | 
2016-182 	 mining data in a longwall coal mine to predict intersection stability |abstract: |studies have shown that the instability of the roof in longwall coal mines is greatest at intersections due to enlarged roof spans, stress redistribution and other factors  however, the relative stability of intersections in a mine varies, and an improved understanding of what factors impact roof instability can lead to efficient, proactive mining practices that both enhance stability and mining efficiency  |a study was undertaken at an underground longwall coal mine to identify geological and mining factors that were associated with instability and seepage  the statistical analyses relied upon observational and measured data regarding the development of tension cracks, seepage, intersection geometry, mining practices, geological attributes and geomechanical factors at 783 intersections  each intersection was given a roof rating and a seepage rating  common data mining techniques, such as multivariate linear regression, multinomial logistic regression, decision trees and probabilistic neural nets, were considered and evaluated to establish correlations and associations between stability and seepage with the other variables  two of the more successful techniques were decision trees and multinomial logistic regression  the analyses showed that a number of mining and geological factors impacted stability and seepage, and that larger scale factors impacting multiple adjacent intersections were most important for causing instability and seepage  the study also outlines a workflow that could easily be adapted to other mines or to situations where it is not possible to use detailed physical models to study a large number of potential variables and complex interactions |introduction |studies have shown (molinda et al , 1998, 2000; msha, 2012) that intersections have a higher incidence of roof falls than straight entries, and that approximately one-quarter of all rock fall injuries and fatalities occurred at intersections  instability and seepage at intersections of entries and crosscuts in underground longwall coal mines impacts mining efficiency, cost and potentially safety  gaining a better understanding of what factors impact stability and seepage can lead to proactive measures that reduce cost and increase both safety and efficiency | 
2016-183 	 investigation of beam specimen geometries under four-point asymmetric bending for shear mode fracture toughness measurements of rocks |abstract: |four-point asymmetric bending beam geometry can conveniently be used in shear mode fracture testing of rock and concrete-like materials  stress intensity factors are computed by contour integration procedure embedded in a finite element program package  to achieve pure shear mode state, loading configuration and parameters are varied in models of rectangular beams  beam depth is varied as 40, 50, and 60 millimeters  initial crack length/beam depth ratio (a/w) is varied between 0 15 and 0 60  pure shear conditions at crack are generated by changing asymmetric loading spans at upper and lower boundaries of the beam geometry  computations showed that as beam depth was increased, mode ii stress intensity factor decreased  mathematical relations for pure shear mode stress intensity factor were proposed with varying asymmetric loading span and a/w to assure pure shear mode state at crack front  proper loading and beam geometric conditions were identified for pure mode ii fracture toughness kiic testing  from four-point asymmetric bending tests on ankara andesite, average mode ii fracture toughness value was found as 0 61 mpavm  results of shear mode fracture toughness tests showed that variation of beam depth had no significant effect on mode ii fracture toughness of beam type rock specimens  |introduction |shear type (mode ii) loading state is still an active subject of interest in fracture mechanics  although, numerous test methods have been suggested (rao et al , 2003, awaji and sato, 1978, atkinson, 1982, fowell and xu, 1993)[1-4] to measure mode ii fracture toughness kiic of rocks, common opinion in this respect is not well-established yet  |mode ii fracture toughness tests aim to measure resistance of a crack to propagate due to in plane shear stress acting on it  mode ii fracture toughness of rocks appears in practical problems of rock mechanics such as hydraulic fracturing (daneshy, 1974, hubbert and willis, 1957), rock cutting (hood and roxborough, 1992, xu, 1993), and rock burst mechanism investigations (salamon 1963, cook 1965, zipf and heasley, 1990)  |in geotechnical applications, rock medium is usually under the effect of compressive forces as a result of overburden stress  this increases the importance of shear mode crack formation and propagation under pure shear mode or under mixed mode loading involving compressive-shear state over the crack | 
2016-186 	 expansion of geotechnical knowledge by data mining of a geology database |abstract: |in carlin style gold deposits challenging ground conditions can be correlated to the alteration type and intensity as well as ground disturbance (i e  faulting or collapse breccias)  in these conditions, there are significant limitations in the application of conventional rock mass rating systems (i e  rmr or q) because these systems emphasize fracture frequency and fracture condition rather than the condition of the matrix material  as matrix strength is reduced, the condition of fractures and the fracture frequency become less relevant as indicators of geotechnical ground behaviour  as part of this work, a classification scheme was developed to incorporate the intensity of rock alteration as well as the degree of ground disturbance  this scheme provides a hazard classification system for rocks that fall below the practically useful range of conventional systems  |further to the classification system, this study uses geological data cross-referenced to geotechnical data to verify both data sets, and to increase geotechnical knowledge about a rock mass  this is achieved by the mdeng weights of evidence method which uses multiple parameters from the geology log to assign indicator scores for geotechnical condition to each logged interval of a drill hole database  indicator scores are processed by a mathematical algorithm in order to assign hazard rankings for each interval of geologically logged core  this analytical approach produces a non-subjective, repeatable and semi-automated way to evaluate expected geotechnical conditions from existing geological logs which, typically, would otherwise be overlooked by geotechnical practitioners  |introduction |during all phases of mine design (from exploration to operations), geological logging data is generally significantly more abundant and often more detailed than geotechnical records  when geotechnical parameters are collected as part of an exploration campaign, they are often limited to rqd and occasionally a strength and/or weathering estimate  as mine design advances, geotechnical data collection generally expands to cover the necessary parameters for joint characterization and rock mass classification  detailed geotechnical data is generally collected on far fewer drill holes than geological data, resulting in broader inference of ground conditions  |newmont's leeville/turf operation, located along the carlin trend in north east nevada, has such a database with extensive geology logs and (comparatively) limited geotechnical data  in addition, the classification systems that were used in the geotechnical logs, the rmr (bieniawski, 1976) and mrmr (laubscher and jakubec, 2001) systems were not practically useful for all of the ground conditions present on site | 
2016-189 	 geomechanics of heave due to the use of pyritic mudstone, ireland |abstract: |engineering problems in residential and other structures built during the early to mid-2000s in dublin ireland were discovered a few years after construction  the damage ranged from cracks in and displacement and tilting of floors to askew walls, jamming of doors and windows, exterior wall cracks, and pipe damage  the cause of the issues was initially incorrectly identified, but was ultimately attributed to the effects of heave caused by the rapid decomposition of the mineral pyrite in the crushed rock structural fill aggregate  the problem was traced to a single quarry that was mining a transitional geological formation; by the time the problems had been diagnosed, a few million cubic metres of rock had been produced at the quarry  damages due to heave was observed in thousands of structures, primarily residences, in the dublin area; thus the effects were significant  the problems spawned numerous litigation that occupied significant time, expenditures and resources  these cases illustrate the level of care and scientific diligence that must be applied for even mundane and low-cost construction materials such as structural fill aggregates  |introduction |starting in the 1990s through till about 2007, the republic of ireland was undergoing a significant economic boom, with rapid population growth (figure 1) that drove a wave of construction across the country  in the dublin area, with its population of approximately 1 25 million, this growth was more pronounced, and it fueled the demand for more housing, roads, commercial, infrastructure, and other types of construction  |given this sustained and dramatic growth, the demand for aggregate products -- including structural fill, road base materials, asphalt aggregate and concrete aggregate -- to service these projects increased dramatically during this period  the increased consumption of these aggregates resulted in the depletion of some of the existing aggregate sources  the aggregate industry responded by opening new sources of aggregate or making plans to open new supplies within a few years | 
2016-190 	 study of stress shadow effects in eagle ford shale: insight from field data analysis |abstract: |recently, the eagle ford shale has become one of the most heavily targeted shale plays  optimizing the production from wells targeting this play begins with the hydraulic fracture design  hydraulic fracturing treatments with closely spaced fractures allows for a large area of the formation to be fractured and produced more efficiently  however, fractures spaced too close together suffer from stress shadow effects, which may cause an inefficient fracture completion  optimal fracture spacing is a crucial aspect to maximize well production  in this paper, we analyzed pressure data recorded during the hydraulic fracturing process of multi-stage horizontal wells in the eagle ford field  a gradual increase in the treatment pressure recorded during each successive stage of fracturing is a strong indicator of a stress shadow induced by the fractures  the wells we studied in the eagle ford shale did not show the trend of increasing treatment pressure between stages, which may imply that stage spacing is not within the region of stress shadow influence  furthermore, the extent of a stress shadow induced by opening fractures can be estimated by an analytical solution based on fracture height  based on the complex geology of interbedded organic rich marl and limestone in the eagle ford shale, and stage spacing, we inferred that fracture height in these wells might be limited by the ductile rock in the formation  since the fracture height is smaller than the stage spacing, this results in a small extent of stress shadow  furthermore, we built a reservoir model that matches the wells' production and bottomhole pressure data to further quantify the fracture height  the conclusion we obtained is that interbedded ductile layers inhibit the growth of fracture height, resulting in weak stress shadow effects and uniform, planar fractures generated in the formation  through this study we can provide some critical guidelines on the stage spacing and perforation cluster spacing of wells in similar geologic settings  |introduction |the eagle ford has long been known as a source rock for the austin chalk and budda limestone formations, but has only been targeted as a reservoir itself since 2008  with less than a decade of production, there is still much to learn about the most efficient way to produce this shale formation, which has become one of the most targeted shale plays in north america  |the eagle ford shale is a tight formation with very low permeability and the only way for a well targeting the eagle ford to be commercially successful is through hydraulic fracturing  creating fractures in the formation increases the conductive path for hydrocarbons to flow into the wellbore  this process is performed in horizontal wells so that a larger area of the reservoir can be targeted per well  the fracturing process is completed in stages, with each stage producing multiple fracture clusters that propagate into individual fractures  ideally, stages should be spaced as close to one another as possible, since more fractures would increase the contact area between the fractures and the reservoir  unfortunately, as a consequence of spacing fractures too close together, an increase in stress shadow effects can occur | 
2016-191 	 reducing breakdown pressure and fracture tortuosity by in-plane perforations and cyclic pressure ramping |abstract: |formation breakdown failures were early on identified as technical risk in hydraulic fracturing treatments of wells in the sichuan basin, china  this study focuses on reducing the breakdown pressure while improving near-wellbore fracture geometries by a variety of perforation geometries as well as cyclic pressure ramp-ups  a total of six large scale polyaxial experiments on isotropic cement samples were conducted, in which the principal stresses were set to represent a horizontal wellbore in a normally faulted stress regime  the results show that breakdown pressures can be reduced by 25% with in-plane perforations or cyclic pressure ramping  the results further indicate that open hole and conventional plug-and-perf completions lead to more near wellbore fracture tortuosities, while transverse fractures can be initiated from the in-plane perforation geometry  |introduction |most operators active in unconventional resource plays base their hydraulic fracturing treatment design on their experiences gained in north america's normally faulted marine basins  in areas with more challenging tectonic settings and deeper targets, however, hydraulic fracturing treatments need to be designed for higher breakdown pressures, higher average pumping pressures, and the risks of limited fracture height growth as well as pre-mature screen-outs  |in china's sichuan basin, breakdown pressures exceeding the design pressure rating of available standard pumping equipment (15 kpi surface pressure limit) have caused the failure of numerous hydraulic fracturing stages, or required additional perforations or sand jetting before the formation would break down  |in addition to issues related to breakdown pressure, non-radioactive tracer logs and micro-seismic data indicated very limited fracture heights  it might be possible that at certain formation layers, the hydraulic fractures were propagating horizontally  this hypothesis is reinforced by the closure stresses of several injection tests, which yielded a theoretical minimum horizontal stress equivalent to the overburden stress [1]  this suggests a strike-slip (<u+03c3>h > <u+03c3>v > <u+03c3>h) to reversely faulted stress regime (<u+03c3>h > <u+03c3>h > <u+03c3>v)  when stimulating horizontal wells drilled on <u+03c3>h azimuth in such settings, the hydraulic fractures initiate along the sides of the wellbore where the hoop-stress <u+03c3><u+03b8> governed by <u+03c3>h >> <u+03c3>v is minimum  as the fracture then propagates into the principal stress governing zone away from the wellbore, two factors inhibit its re-orientate into the vertical plane: first, the marginal stress anisotropy <u+03c3>v - <u+03c3>h accommodates either orientation and therefore does not act as the required restoring force, and second, the laminated fabric of these shale formations favours horizontal fractures parallel to its bedding plane | 
2016-193 	 study on the inter-relations between post-peak behavior and strength parameter evolution of rocks |abstract: |it is observed that the complete stress-strain curve consists of three parts, i e  the pre-peak part, the negative slope part and the residual part of the post-peak region  in the curve, the maximum stress that the rock sample can sustain indicates the peak strength  the stress in the residual part indicates the residual strength  the negative slope part should describe the strength evolution from peak strength to residual strength  mohr-coulomb (m-c) criterion is employed and the inter-relations between post-peak behavior of the complete stress-strain curve and strength parameter evolution of rocks are studied in the paper  first, a new approach for modeling strain-softening behavior is introduced  the stress–strain curve in the strain-softening stage is approximated in a stepwise way, and the strain-softening processes is modeled by a series of stress drop and plastic flow during the increase of plastic strain  then several sets of parameters are studied and the corresponding stress-strain curves are obtained  the relations between the post-peak strength evolution and the shape of complete stress-strain curves are discussed, and the implications in geotechnical engineering are analyzed  |introduction |when rock (rock mass) is loaded, deformation is produced  what is the relationship between the applied force and the displacement? tests are needed to answer the question  that is why a thorough knowledge of the complete stress–strain curve is of great significance for the researchers(hudson et al 1971, jaeger and cook  1976)  in the early stage of the rock mechanics, the complete curve cannot be obtained due to the limitation of the testing techniques and methodologies  the samples are often very unstable and the tests have to be terminated after the peak strength is reached  |however, the so called post-peak behavior of rocks is more interesting than the pre-peak one because they can sustain applied load after attainment of the ultimate strength  |a typical record of rock compression test is shown in fig  1 where both the pre-peak and the post-peak region(strain-softening region) are included |

2016-206 	 on the application of rockfall risk assessment techniques from field observation and quarry experience |abstract: |rockfalls are a relevant hazard in quarrying and open-pit mining as well as in roads with rock cuts  the spanish association of aggregate producers reported that the most common cause of fatalities in their quarries comes from rockfalls  with the aim of having available methods to quantify this phenomenon in mining, the existing rockfall hazard rating systems for roads such as the rhrs and the rhron were reviewed to conclude that these methods could not be applied to the working conditions of an open pit mine or a quarry  this lead to develop a new technique able to assess rockfall in quarries and open pit mines, named rofraq based on empirical observations and a probabilistic approach that assumes that an accident occurs as a result of a sequence of events  different events are rated, and the product of these ratings represents an estimate of the probability of accidents due to rockfalls  in this paper will be presented two particular case studies to quantify the risk of rockfall in mining operations with this new developed method, to find out that a low risk exists, and that simple protective measures can contribute to a safer environment  |introduction |rockfalls are a relevant hazard in quarrying and open-pit mining, as well as in road with rock cuts, particularly in mountain areas with unprotected steep slopes  records from the spanish association of aggregate producers reported that the most common cause of fatalities in their quarries come from rockfalls, as it is also reported in other parts of the world, especially in australia  |recent research studies in the field of rockfall engineering tend to focus on particular detailed modelling issues (frayssines & hantz, 2009; chen et al , 2013, thoeni et al , 2014), identification of potentially unstable blocks (mavrouli et al , 2014) as well as calibration of parameters (wyllie, 2014)  however, not so many research studies focus in the application of rockfall control and protective measures in quarries and mining fields (giacomini et al , 2013; chai et al , 2015), where a large rate of accidents is recorded every year  |it is highlighted that in an active construction environment, such as quarries or open pit mines, the potential for mechanical initiation of a rockfall will probably be one or two orders of magnitude higher (hoek, 2000), than in those natural slopes where climatic and biological initiating events take place (alejano et al , 2013) | 
2016-209 	 3d geomechanics completion quality mapping |abstract: |heterogeneity in geomechanical conditions likely contributes to the observed variability in hydraulic fracturing treatment performance  we propose a methodology to assess fracturing performance and risks based on geomechanical conditions  high-level indicators include completion integrity, horsepower efficiency, reservoir exposure, fracture containment, and connectivity aspects, which are each broken down into a tree-like structure of contributing sub-factors, to the point where they can be related to geomechanics-based drivers  these drivers are derived from 3d geomechanical models and used to identify in 3d space where the conditions appear to be more or less favorable from a fracturing standpoint  the results can be used to identify where chances of success are higher  applications range from pilot well location in a newly explored area to well positioning and landing during development, to completion design (when model resolution permits)  identified risks, if any, also inform completion design to mitigate these risks  a field case example is used for illustration purposes  |introduction |hydraulic fracturing treatments are not all equally successful  whether measured by treatment data (e g , amount of proppant placed) or by production data, fracturing often exhibits variable performance across stages along a well, or between wells within a field  for example, certain formations may prove difficult, if not impossible to breakdown; high screen-out rates may occur; and certain stages may dominate production, while others contribute very little (miller et al , 2011)  the above holds true across stages designed and executed similarly, if not identically, which clearly indicates that the subsurface has a primary control on the outcome  |subsurface controls are generally split between reservoir quality, or rq, and completion quality, or cq (cipolla et al , 2011)  rq refers to the resource itself and is assessed based on indicators such as reserves and producible reserves  cq refers to the effectiveness of reservoir stimulation by hydraulic fracturing  importantly, the former is a given whereas cq can, to a certain extent, be engineered  therefore, rq is pre-requisite to cq  |hydraulic fracturing treatments across zones with similar rq often exhibit widely different production performance  such is the case in relatively thick shale plays (many hundreds of feet), where, by experience, the wellbore landing targets have been narrowed down to 10-20 ft  some of this variability is caused by heterogeneity in cq  it is reasonable to assume that geomechanical conditions, including rock fabric and stresses, are key ingredients of cq  geomechanical conditions broadly affect the hydraulic fracturing process  in particular, they exert a primary control on fracture geometry (economides & nolte, 2000): the orientation of the minimum stress direction strongly influences the direction of fracture propagation, variations in stress and mechanical properties between layers control fracture height growth and fracture width and even the possible development of pinchpoints, all of which strongly influence the final hydraulic fracture geometry, the placement of the proppant, and how the newly created reservoir contact surface connects to the wellbore and delivers production performance |

2016-215 	 directional equivalent permeability of discrete fracture networks |abstract: |naturally fractured low-matrix-permeability reservoirs exist in most hydrocarbon-producing areas of the world  in such reservoirs, the dominant fluid pathways are provided by networks of hydraulically conductive natural fractures  in order to predict hydrocarbon production, an accurate estimate of the effective permeability arising from these networks is essential  because reservoir simulators typically use continuum approximations of permeability, and are discretized using volume elements that are much larger than the scale of the fractures, obtaining these estimates requires fast, accurate upscaling methods to convert discrete fracture connectivity and permeability to effective flow properties  furthermore, fractures in the subsurface often exhibit a small number of prevalent orientations, which are the cause of frequently observed high degrees of permeability anisotropy  because this anisotropy has a significant influence on reservoir simulation results, it is important to accurately compute directional fracture network permeability, which enables identification of the principal permeability directions  this paper presents a novel and efficient numerical upscaling method for the directional equivalent permeability of a discrete fracture network  in this method, the network is converted into a set of connected fracture segments  using a modified equivalent pipe approach and appropriate boundary conditions, the directional permeability is computed for steady-state parallel-plate flow  the numerical method is compared to a published method that provides equivalent permeability estimates of discrete fracture networks  a consistent finding is that the computed equivalent fracture permeability is a consequence of the conceptual design of each method  this highlights the importance of comparing various methods for computing the equivalent fracture permeability in order to get a better understanding of how a particular discrete fracture network might contribute to reservoir simulation results  in a more general sense, it also underlines the importance of understanding, and retaining for analysis, any assumptions made in modeling efforts  further, the equivalent permeability computed from each method is incorporated into reservoir simulations  differences in simulation results are found to be direct consequences of the specific permeability maps computed with different methods  because each method of computing equivalent fracture permeability elevates different aspects of a discrete fracture network, a comparison of results obtained with different methods allows one to quantify, and possibly to reduce, uncertainty in reservoir simulations  |introduction |rock masses are heterogeneous on many length scales  besides variations in material properties across a continuous piece of rock, rock masses exhibit discrete features such as veins, dikes, joints and faults  some of these have the potential to conduct fluid; here, we will use the term fracture for any such discrete feature  we will use “permeability” in a qualitative way to describe the capacity of such features to conduct fluids, although when used quantitatively they have slightly different definitions and units |

2016-222 	 stress initialization in geomechanics using the adjoint-state method |abstract: |no continuous stress field measures can be made inside the earth's crust, so we developed a technique to estimate the possible stress field from surface stress data  stress initialization is the aim of this work  the method presented here couples an inversion technique with a finite element model fed with local data coming from data such as in situ measurements of the stress tensor (leak-off tests, log data…)  this method guarantees the stability of the initial stress field with the regional stresses thanks to modeling with a finite element (fe) software  the inversion technique consists in minimizing the difference between the fe model and the measured in situ stress by adjusting the elastic parameters of each geological unit of our model at each iteration of optimization  for this minimization problem we use a regular method which has been successfully tested on synthetic 2d models, and we developed the adjoint-state method by formulating the gradient of the error functional towards its parameters in a constraint optimization form, which is still being tested  the result of the minimization problem is a possible initial stress field which satisfies the in situ measurements  |introduction |for monitoring the exploitation of sites, and more specifically for monitoring stress changes due to production, oil companies need to finely estimate the geomechanical properties and the behavior of underground formations for all their activities  to reach this goal, it is necessary to model the exploited site  geomechanical models, as sophisticated as they might be in terms of behavior law, are useless if the stress field is not well initialized  stress initialization is the aim of this work  |clearly no entire stress field measurements can be made inside the earth's crust, so we developed a technique to estimate an admissible stress field from surface stress data deduced from leak-off tests, log data etc  this technique consists in an inverse problem allowing to match a model to discrete stress measurements  |the inverse problem is a mathematical tool which allows to get indirectly scientific measurements(ganse, 2007)  a classical technique of inverse problem is determining model parameters from observed data (tarantola, 1987)  the method presented here is different, it consists in determining the model full stress field from observed data such as stress measurements and elastic parameters  |the shape of the model is also supposed to be given by properly interpreted seismic data | 
2016-224 	 data driven approaches to designing large open pit slopes – lessons from engineering geology |abstract: |as mine open pits become increasingly aggressive and deep (beyond 400 m) due to exhaustion of near-surface resources or implausibility of underground excavation, significant challenges emerge using standard slope stability analysis techniques  typically during overall failure analysis, factor of safety calculations are conducted  although quite useful and despite recent advances in characterizing insitu stresses, the factor of safety approach has its inadequacies  for example, single factor of safety values cannot characterize an entire pit sector under varying geotechnical and environmental conditions  in this paper we draw on lessons learned from large dataset techniques in engineering geology to assess landslides  the proposed approach utilizes the emerging field of deep learning using artificial neural networks  deep learning uses data-driven tools to continually update algorithms used to conduct computations resulting in high levels of accuracy and precision  using our results and relevant examples from the literature, we discuss the benefits and shortcoming of the proposed approach, the appropriate conditions and types of environments for application and suggested modifications and improvements  |introduction and background |rock mass slope stability analysis is one of the most important undertakings during the design of surface mine open pit slopes  typically select cross section profiles from a three dimensional geological model are created and assigned material and geotechnical properties for analytical calculations of factors of safety  in two dimensional limit equilibrium analysis using one of the methods of slices, the factor of safety is expressed as a ratio of the sum of the resistive forces to that of the destabilizing forces  a factor of safety less than 1 0 is indicative of unstable conditions, while a value greater than 1 0 represents stable conditions  for surface mine slopes, both interramp and overall slope stability analyses are undertaken under both static and pseudostatic conditions  the interramp angles are defined by bench face angles, bench heights and bench widths (figure 1)  the overall slope angle is defined by interramp sections separated by wide step-outs for haulage roads or mine infrastructure  in general, except for slopes of high failure consequence, a design factor of safety of 1 2 is adopted (read and stacey, 2009)  slopes of high failure consequence are those slopes that are critical to mine operations, such as hosting major haul roads, those providing ingress or egress points to the pit, or those underlying essential infrastructure  those slopes identified as having high failure consequences tend to have relatively higher factors of safety up to 1 5 (read and stacey, 2009)  in addition, certain adverse geologic environments do not favor high interramp angles due to rock fall and bench overbreak, and hence design angles tend to be flattened to provide wide catch benches  the mine safety and health administration (msha), title 30 of the code of federal regulations, section 56 3130 requirements for open pit slopes demand that adequate benches must be in place to retain rockfall above work or travel areas | 
2016-225 	 case study: mechanisms of dilution at henderson mine |abstract: |one of the challenges in panel caving is the amount of dilution that might be expected from exhausted levels located above the current production levels  generally, a panel caving mine is designed for a dilution entry point (dep) to occur at 70-90% of the recovery, but if the waste is finer than the newly caved ore, a preferential influx of waste can enter earlier into the drawpoints, resulting in a low dep  another source of dilution can be expected when the draw rate exceeds the caving rate, allowing waste to rill along the solid boundary of the cave and enter into the drawpoint at an early stage  |freeport-mcmoran inc 's henderson mine, located in colorado, is a large underground panel caving mine that uses a mixing method that assumes that dilution can only flow vertically (laubscher, 1994)  in order to study other mechanisms of dilution such as fines migration and rilling, this paper presents a case study in which drawpoints located in different locations are back-analyzed using rebop  |the results show that rebop, by imposing a certain cave shape, is able to model and predict rilling  although, back-analyzed drawpoints behaved differently depending on the location with respect to the cave front and their neighbours, no apparent relationship between the best-fit cave angle and the position of the drawpoint was found  this suggests that the evolution in cave shape and angle (and hence entry of waste via rilling) could be complex and hard to know ahead of time without three-dimensional predictions (e g , via cave-scale modeling) that consider local rock mass strength and major structures  |introduction |one of the challenges in panel caving is the amount of dilution that might be expected from waste material located above economic ore or from exhausted levels located above current production levels  generally, a panel caving mine is designed for a dilution entry point (dep) to occur at 70-90% of recovery, but if the waste is much finer than the newly caved ore, a preferential influx of fine waste can enter earlier into the drawpoints resulting in a lower dep  moreover, another mechanism of dilution can be expected when the draw rate exceeds the caving rate, allowing waste to rill along the solid boundary of the cave and enter the drawpoint at an early stage  |the case study described is taken from freeport-mcmoran's henderson mine, an underground molybdenum mine that utilizes the panel caving method of extraction  an example of early dep is illustrated in figure 1 showing a typical grade-tonnage curve from henderson mine's 7700 production level  the darker curve represents the sampled grade profile and the dotted line represents the expected curve (using a standard mixing matrix) | 
2016-227 	 experimental characterization of toughness profile for hydraulic fracturing of shales |abstract: |a key technical challenge in successful hydraulic fracturing (hf) of gas and oil-rich shales is to understand fracture growth through layered systems from a horizontal wellbore  this understanding enables an improved hf design and selection of the horizontal wellbore landing depth  in the absence of the clear stress barriers for fracture height growth it is important to account for fracture toughness variations  since fracture toughness is relatively difficult to measure routinely we attempt to establish good correlations between it and other more readily measurable physical and mechanical rock properties  this paper presents the measurements of fracture toughness for a liquid-rich shale done using the cracked chevron notch brazilian disk (ccnbd) geometry following the international society for rock mechanics suggested method  the data do not confirm strong correlations for fracture toughness previously reported in the literature  only weak correlations with sample bulk density, compressional and shear velocities were observed  the contrast of measured toughness values are used to define the upscaled toughness profile  its impact on the fracture geometry is demonstrated through numerical simulations for slick water and cross-linked gel stimulations  |introduction |efficient hydraulic fracturing (hf) is one of the most important technologies to the current unconventional gas/liquid rich shale plays in the oil and gas industry (see, e g , king, 2010)  a key technical challenge in successful hf treatments is to understand hf growth through layered systems from a horizontal wellbore  |a conventional target for stimulation with hf would be a sandstone reservoir bounded by the non-reservoir units, typically shales  in such cases a clear lithological characterization aids to reduce uncertainty about the fracture height growth, which is mostly controlled by the stress contrast between sand and shale layers (e g , smith and shlyapobersky, 2000)  important distinctive attributes of unconventional plays are an uncertainty about the vertical extent of the target zone, the significant height of the induced hydraulic fractures as interpreted from the microseismic data, and uncertainty about the control parameters in a thick package of geological layers with subtly varying lithology | 
2016-229 	 water weakening triggers mechanical instability in laboratory fluid substitution experiments on a weakly-consolidated sandstone |abstract: |an original testing protocol was designed to study the substitution of in situ fluids in reservoir rocks with minimal impact on the in situ effective stress  the weakening effect of the substituting fluid can therefore be easily identified  our results for the weakly-consolidated sherwood sandstone show that (i) the strength and static elastic moduli decrease when water saturates the pore space; (ii) the injection of water in a critically loaded sample initially saturated either with air or inert oil induces a drastic increase in the creep rate and the development of a mechanical instability; (iii) the mechanical instability detected by ultrasonic and micro- seismic monitoring is mainly localized in the water-flooded zone; (iv) this instability corresponds to a loss of cohesion; (v) during oil substitution by water, the instability is delayed and the loss of cohesion is less pronounced  this loss of cohesion is expected to lead to sand production in weakly consolidated siliciclastic reservoirs  in addition, the injected fluids significantly affect the ultrasonic p-wave velocity which (vi) increases during oil injection and (vii) decreases during water injection  therefore ultrasonic monitoring can be used to detect the advancement of the fluid front within the rock pore space  |introduction |to assess water-weakening effects in reservoir rocks, previous experimental studies have focused on changes in the failure envelopes derived from mechanical tests conducted on rocks fully saturated either with water or with inert fluids  so far, little attention has been paid to the mechanical behavior of reservoir rocks during fluid substitution under conditions similar to enhanced oil recovery operations  water-based fluids are often used during development and production operations of oil and gas fields  these operations include: (i) well drilling with water-based muds; (ii) reservoir secondary oil recovery by water flooding; (iii) chemical or thermal enhanced oil recovery; or (iv) hydraulic fracturing  |mechanisms generally associated with fluid/rock interactions include: (i) hydro-mechanics: pressure drawdown/effective stress increase; (ii) petrophysics: change in surface tension/wettability and capillary forces; (iii) hydro-dynamics: seepage forces resulting from water pressure gradients  these mechanisms have been, and still are, extensively studied and assessed for problematic fields around the world  however, hydrochemical weakening of the rock frame specifically associated with exposure to water-based fluids has also been recognized as an important driving mechanism |

2016-243 	 wear of geo-materials by mechanical impulse |abstract: |shear along rock faults is always associated with wear of the sliding blocks that commonly results in the production of fine powder called gouge  we experimentally analyzed intensity of wear-rate and frictional strength during shear of dolomite and granite samples at slip-velocity of v = 0 001 <u+2212> 1 0 m/s, and normal stresses of <u+03c3>n = 0 25 <u+2212> 4 5 mpa  the experiments showed that the friction coefficients of these rocks depend on the mechanical power-density, which is the rate of energy dissipation during slip  the wear-rates, wr, showed dependency on the mechanical-impulse of the form wr = a · [<u+03c4>/v]b where <u+03c4> is shear stress, v is the slip- velocity, and a and b are material constants  this relation of wear-rate to loading indicates that for rocks, the archard (1953) model is only a special case for low slip-velocity  we propose here a model based on microfracturing wear at stressed asperities that explains the observed dependency of wear-rates on the mechanical impulse  |introduction |the resistance of faults to slip serves as a proxy for the strength of the crust  in addition, the static and dynamic frictional strength of rocks are fundamental for understanding faults behavior during creep and earthquakes [brace and kohlstedt, 1980; lockner, 1995]  frictional sliding is always associated with rock wear by fracturing, shearing, particles plucking and rock comminution [haggert et al , 1992; hundley-goff and moody, 1980; mair and abe, 2011; scholz and engelder, 1976; boneh et al , 2013]  the common product of fault wear is gouge powder, which is a fine grain material found everywhere along natural and experimental faults  when fault blocks start slipping against each other, the associated wear is characterized by three stages: initial, running-in and steady-state [boneh et al , 2013]  the very high wear-rates during the early two stages gradually decrease with slip, and the steady-state stage displays low and constant wear-rates [wang and scholz, 1994; queener et al , 1965]  these stages also correlate with the friction evolution from a transient stage of weakening to steady-state [boneh et al , 2014]  microstructural observations relate the wearrate stages with the development of a gouge layer as a ‘third body’ between the fault blocks [siman-tov et al , 2015; godet, 1984; boneh, 2012]  |the controlling parameters of fault wear-rates and the quantitative relations between wear-rate and friction are still enigmatic in spite of some recent developments (lyakhovsky et al , 2014)  we experimentally analyze here the wear-rates and frictional strength of a sedimentary rock (kasota dolomite) and an igneous rock (sierra white granite) during steady-state slip  at this stage, a gouge layer is mature and fully separates the fault blocks into a three-body configuration  we demonstrate that the wear-rate intensity is best represented by the mechanical impulse of the shear loading | 
2016-244 	 numerical modeling of borehole breakout in ductile formation considering fluid seepage and damage-induced permeability change |abstract: |borehole breakouts, a series of complex processes that simultaneously affect the borehole wall, are characterized by initiation, propagation, and stabilization sequences  this paper presents a hydro-mechanical model incorporating plasticity strain softening by a drucker-prager-plastic yielding criteria and fluid seepage by darcy's law in simulating breakout behavior  damage-induced permeability change is also considered and modeled with a predefined relationship between the magnitude of plastic strain and permeability  a sensitivity study was performed using the proposed model to quantify the effects of in-situ stresses, mud pressure, and seepage time on breakout initiation and/or propagation  results show that stress concentration induced initial breakout shape with low mud pressure is larger than that with high mud pressure  fluid flow in the formation significantly affects breakout propagation and makes it a time-dependent process  for low mud pressures, the initial breakout shape without seepage is similar to the final breakout shape after seepage  for high mud pressure, the initial breakout shape is smaller than final breakout shape  the final breakout shape is also influenced by anisotropic in situ stresses and formation permeability  this proposed model provide a useful tool for evaluating the risk of wellbore breakout  |introduction |a “borehole breakout” is a phenomenon in which portions of failing rock spalls from the wellbore wall due to high compressive stress around wellbore wall during or after drilling  excessive breakout can lead to problematic wellbore stability and integrity issues, such as wellbore washout, wellbore collapse, and completion difficulties  moreover, spalled cuttings resulting from borehole breakout are difficult to circulate out while drilling, which negatively affect drilling efficiency  on the other hand, field breakout events can be analyzed to obtain useful in-situ stress information  breakouts are routinely used to determine the direction of horizontal stresses, and some authors have also suggested using it to constraint the magnitude of the maximum horizontal stress (zheng, kemeny, and cook, 1989; zoback et al , 1989; dart, 1990; ito, zoback, and peska, 2001)  |for a vertical well, bell and gough (1979) first observed that breakouts normally occur as a cross-sectional elongation in regions of high compressive stress (usually tangential stress around wellbore) and that they are parallel to the direction of the minimum horizontal stress (j  s  bell, 1979)  for a deviated well, stress concentrations around wellbore are influenced by well azimuth, well inclination, in situ stresses, rock properties, and drilling mud pressure (li and gray, 2015)  the breakout of a deviated well also occurs at the region of maximum compressive stress but it is no longer parallel to the direction of minimum horizontal stress (zhou, 1994)  generally, the initial shape of breakouts induced by stress concentration for hard and brittle rocks can be estimated by a linearly elastic model with idealistic assumptions that wellbore is circular and intact and rock properties are homogeneous for both vertical and deviated wellbores | 
2016-246 	 well integrity analysis: 3d numerical modeling of cement interface debonding |abstract: |with ongoing environmental concerns and increasingly stringent regulations, the traditional topic of wellbore integrity is more important than ever before  a great deal of importance is attached to the cement sheath because it is necessary to provide zonal isolation and well integrity during the life of a well  debonding at the casing/cement or cement/formation interfaces, which may result in substantial flow channels and fluid leakage, is often responsible for the loss of wellbore integrity  a three-dimensional finite-element model is developed in this paper to simulate debonding fracture propagation at cement interfaces  debonding is driven by pressure build-up at the casing shoe due to fluid leakage  the model can be used to quantify the length, width, and circumferential coverage of the debonding fracture  the simulation results show dependence of debonding fracture width and circumferential coverage on in-situ stress conditions, initial cracks around the casing shoe, and cement and formation properties  for example, with initial cracks in the cement interface, debonding fractures tend to develop vertically along the axis of a vertical well, rather than circumferentially around it  the method proposed herein presents a useful step towards prediction of well integrity and provides improved guidance for cement selection and completion optimization  |introduction |well integrity, always of importance, is becoming more so because of increasing environmental concerns and regulatory activities  moreover, increasingly hostile environments such as hthp fields, ultra-deep-water fields, and geothermal fields, along with more complicated development operations, such as those encountered in gas producing wells, gas storage wells, water injectors, and cuttings/waste injectors, all present new challenges for well integrity  failure of well integrity can lead to costly remedial operations or total loss of the well, severe environment contamination, and even fatal accidents to operating personnel  |the cement sheath is the heart of well integrity  it is expected to ensure well integrity by providing zonal isolation and support for the casing throughout the life of a well, from well construction, hydrocarbon production, to post-abandonment (gray, et al , 2009; feng, 2016)  a successful cementing job is expected to result in complete zonal isolation, without leaving any leakage pathway in the annulus between casing and formation  unfortunately, this goal is not always achieved, and failure of cement sheath commonly occurs during the life of a well (fourmaintraux et al , 2005) | 
2016-251 	 a 3-d poro-elasto-plastic model for sand production around open-hole and cased & perforated wellbores |abstract: |this paper presents a coupled reservoir-geomechanics continuum model for sand production simulation around an open-hole and a cased & perforated wellbore in a weakly consolidated formation  sanding criteria are based on a combination of tensile and shear failure from mohr-coulomb theory and strain-hardening/softening  once the failure criteria are met, a new erosion criterion for entrainment of the sand based on the calculation of hydrodynamic and resistant forces on sand grains is implemented to predict sand erosion  to capture the strain localization, dynamic mesh refinement has been implemented in the model  an open-hole completion is first simulated to conduct a sensitivity study with both mechanical and fluid flow properties  then, cased & perforated well completions are modeled to analyze the stability of perforations  sand failure and production are induced primarily by stress concentration around the borehole and large gradients in fluid pressure  several factors, including the perforation orientation, perforation arch stability, perforation diameter, and length of perforation, are shown to be important and are discussed  this model is able to predict the onset of sanding and the severity of sand production around wellbores and perforations, and help design perforated completions  |introduction |it is estimated that 70% of the total world's oil and gas reserves are in poorly consolidated reservoirs [1], where sand production is likely to happen  sand production may affect the completion adversely due to plugging of perforations or production liners, wellbore instability, failure of sand control completions [2], and collapse of some sections of a horizontal well  in addition, sand-related problems always increase production costs considerably by erosion of pipelines and surface facilities, reduction in productivity, intervention costs and complexities, and other environmental effects [3]  on the other hand, a controllable amount of sand production can avoid redundant and complex sand controls, such as gravel packs, which have been extensively used to prevent sand production in unconsolidated formations [4]  thus, a model that is able to predict the onset of sand production and the volume of sand produced is crucial before making a decision of whether to use sand control and how best to utilize such methods | 
2016-252 	 non-linear shear strength descriptions are still needed in petroleum geomechanics, despite 50 years of linearity |abstract: |despite utilizing multi-discipline teams in petroleum and service companies, and despite the remarkable abilities of these same companies to produce petroleum in many forms and in highly adverse environments, there appears to be a misalignment between the geomechanics used, and rock mechanics, the latter apparently not used, judging by workshop presentations  is it possible that this is because geomechanics specialists are not aware of long-available non-linear description of shear strength, for both the fractures and matrix, in nfr and gas shales? description of the non-linearity has been a goal of many in rock mechanics for the last 50 years, with a well-known start by patton, 1966 reporting in the first isrm congress held in lisbon  his bi-linear strength envelope was an immediate improvement on mohr-coulomb linearity, and set the scene for others to improve upon this bilinear description  the 1973 non-linear jrc- and jcs-based criterion of the present author was considered too complex by byerlee, 1978, who favoured use of a friction coefficient  shear strength represented in geomechanics remains linear, so is often unrealistic  |introduction |due to remarkable educational compartmentalization, there is widespread use of linear shear strength assumptions in the petroleum geomechanics taught in university courses  this is further applied by many oil companies and oil service companies, actually on both sides of the atlantic, and indeed even in the middle east  this is undoubtedly due in part to the application of byerlee's well-known friction coefficients by zoback and co-workers at the university of stanford during the last several decades  the linear frictional strength assumptions are applied to signify probable critically stressed fractures, first in deep wells, later in naturally fractured petroleum reservoirs, and in the more recently exploited unconventional gas shales  linear shear strength assumptions are also applied to the intact rock, which is usually described by simplified linear mohr-coulomb, despite many tens of mpa change of effective stress during the sometimes short lives of the reservoirs  |the commonly used byerlee-type friction coefficient to signify that fractures may be critically stressed, with values quoted typically from 0 6 to 0 85, actually gives no insight into pre-peak phenomena, which include the beginnings of roughness and dilation mobilization, giving potential permeability enhancement in the case of gas shales and critically stressed fracture sets in nfr | 
2016-255 	 historical developments of true triaxial testing machines – challenges and improvements |abstract: |true triaxial testing of rock is a challenging issue in rock mechanics because specialized testing equipment is required  unlike conventional triaxial tests, true triaxial testing incorporates the effects of the intermediate principal which are now widely recognized as important in high stress environments, such as deep boreholes  previous studies have shown that the increase in rock brittle strength as a function of the intermediate principal stress can be substantial, as much as 50% or more in some case  using a historical context of development of methods and techniques, we explore and compare the evolution of true triaxial testing machines spanning several world regions such as russia, asia and north america  current standards of the specimen preparation are described and the problems related to true triaxial rock testing are then discussed  in general we classify these challenges in categories associated either with a machine's material and design or with contact between the machine and specimen  finally we cover the most popular machines, their importance and benefits, and factors leading to future directions  |introduction and background |brittle rock strength can be expressed in terms of the minor principle stress, <u+03c3>3, intermediate principle stress, <u+03c3>2, and the major principle stress, <u+03c3>1  the role of the intermediate principle stress is commonly ignored given that its effect on rock strength is relatively less than that of the minor principle stress  however the significance of the intermediate principle in extreme earth engineering such as large earth dams, deep underground mining, and in borehole break outs, geothermal and earthquake studies is now widely recognized  true triaxial rock tests unlike conventional triaxial rock tests account for the role of the intermediate principle stress (figure 1)  |true triaxial rock tests are important because they satisfy the general rock testing principle that stress conditions applied to specimens mimic ‘in-situ’ conditions  for example, while useful, uniaxial compression stress (ucs) tests (<u+03c3>1 > <u+03c3>2 = <u+03c3>3=0) are not valid for simulating conditions within the earth's crust  on the other hand conventional triaxial tests (<u+03c3>1 > <u+03c3>2 = <u+03c3>3) are more reasonable and are widely used in practice  it turns out that, although cumbersome to undertake, it is actually true triaxial (polyaxial) tests (<u+03c3>1 > <u+03c3>2 > <u+03c3>3) which represent insitu conditions very close to reality |

2016-258 	 laboratory scale investigation of enhanced geothermal reservoir stimulation |abstract: |geothermal energy production by water circulation in natural and/or man-made fracture systems is referred to as enhanced or engineered geothermal systems (egs)  the permeable zones of an egs must be created by stimulation, a process which involves fracture initiation and/or activation and propagation of discontinuities such as joints by pore pressure and stress perturbations  economic design and operation of egs can be achieved by reliable characterization of the stimulation results which relies mostly on analysis of micro-earthquake (meq) and tracers  in this work we study the reservoir stimulation process on a laboratory scale to improve the current understanding and to help quantify the fracture geometry using acoustic emission (ae) cloud, spontaneous potential (sp), and tracer analysis  to do so, we have developed a new poly-axial hydraulic fracturing test system which allows us to perform reservoir stimulation experiments on rock blocks with size up to 18’ x18” x 18” under pore pressure and representative in-situ stress regimes while simultaneously recording sp and ae during fracturing and circulation  in this paper, we describe preliminary experiments conducted at room and elevated temperatures along with a circulation phase in the latter case  reservoir stimulation has been accompanied by ae events that are generally correlated with the stress state and fracture geometry, however with less than expected intensity  results show excellent correlation between the fracturing events and the sp signal  |introductiongeothermal energy is considered as a promising optionfor future clean and sustainable energy supply however, certain technical barriers need to be removedfor large scale utilization of the resources  particularly,questions related to reservoir creation in different rocktypes and stress conditions need be addressed laboratory scale studies present a good opportunity tohelp resolve some of the pending challenges along withrecent field-scale efforts within the framework of theforge (frontier observatory for research ingeothermal energy) initiative  the main purpose of thisproject is to gain a better understanding of the geometryand the heat exchange properties of the hydraulicallyinduced fractures in enhanced or engineered geothermalsystems (egs)  to realize this goal, a new lab-scalehydraulic fracture test system has been developed thatallows us to replicate aspects of the egs hydraulicfracturing treatment in the field  our work improves thestate-of-the-art by allowing the simultaneous monitoringof acoustic emission (ae), spontaneous potential (sp)and tracers during the stimulation and circulation phases  |the lab-scale egs test systemthe developed lab-scale egs system has severalintegrated subsystems  the main subsystems are: apolyaxial frame and heaters, hydraulic fracturing andcirculation system, ae and sp acquisition system, andfluids and tracers  fig  1 (top) shows the fully assembledtest systems and fig  1 (bottom) shows the heating bycirculating hot water  more information about thesesubsystems are described in hu (2016)  at the flowingsection, two test result will be described, the first testwas conducted at room temperature  for the secondexperiment, the hydraulic fracturing portion was testedat room temperature while the circulation portion wasconduction at higher temperature | 
2016-261 	 mechanical behavior and microstructure development in consolidation of nominally dry granular salt |abstract: |uniaxial consolidation of granular salt is carried out to study the mechanical behavior and fabric development in a material that deforms by microscopic brittle and intracrystalline-plastic processes  dry granular salt is sieved to produce well-sorted size fractions  the granular salt is consolidated in a heated cell at axial stresses up to 90 mpa and temperatures of 100 - 200 °c to document stress-consolidation relationships and microstructural development  polished and chemically-etched petrographic sections of salt samples prior to and after deformation at 150 °c are studied using transmitted- and reflected-light optical microscopy  we show that temperature has profound effect on porosity reduction during consolidation  at tested conditions, the dominant deformation mechanism is crystal plasticity; brittle deformation is largely suppressed  samples consolidated at higher maximum axial stress develop higher overall dislocation densities  the distribution of dislocations, however, is strongly heterogeneous from grain to grain because of the complex grain-scale loading geometries and the distribution of intragranular flaws such as fluid inclusions  static recrystallization occurs in some highly strained areas, but overall is minor at 150 °c  the experiments help to improve our understanding of consolidation, and serve to guide the fabrication of synthetic rock salt as experimental material, as well as to inform and test constitutive models of deformation of granular salt for engineering needs  |introduction |the rheological properties of rock salt have been an important research focus because it is considered aviable geomaterial for engineered repositories of waste and energy resources, such as radioactive waste, oil, and gas (urai et al , 1986; carter et al , 1993)  rock salt also is studied as an analog to other geomaterials in that various deformation mechanisms, including cracking, frictional sliding, pressure solution, crystal plasticity, and dynamic recrystallization are easily activated at laboratory conditions (zhang et al , 2007)  |extensive experimental work has been done on rock salt to determine constitutive relationships and guide numerical modeling (e g , watanabe and peach, 2002; ter heege, et al , 2005; zhu and arson, 2015)  both natural and synthetic rock salt have been used for experimental investigations; artificially prepared rock salt is of higher purity and can be fabricated in a way that best serves parametric studies (e g , carter and hansen, 1983; schenk and urai, 2004; bourcier et al , 2013)  consolidation of granular salt is a common method used to produce synthetic rock salt samples; however, salt is highly sensitive to moisture so it is critical to have a good control of the humidity of the environment in which nominally-dry salt samples are produced, stored, and processed  maintaining a consistently dry environment during all stages of handling salt samples can be challenging | 
2016-266 	 geomechanical prediction of thermal induced fractures in a reservoir |abstract: |recent advancements in reservoir modelling have provided a springboard for oil and gas operators in the uk north sea to focus on modelling thermal induced fractures caused by cold water injection  in this study, we used a finite difference method in a reservoir simulation software to simulate heat transfer within the reservoir, due to cold water injection  then, we modelled the stress changes induced by the temperature changes, using a finite element method in a geomechanical modelling software  the results from this study clearly show the formation of thermally-induced fractures at the injector wells due to tensile stresses, a direct consequence of cold water injection  results also show how the deformation increases when the reservoir formation temperature is further lowered as more cold water is being injected  using the coupled simulations, north sea operators can now understand the interaction between pressures, stresses and fracture propagation away from their injectors  knowledge of the fracture propagation gives the operator an idea of the optimum well spacing between the producers and injectors, and limits on the maximum injection rate and pressure  this avoids channeling of injected water at the injectors through the thermally-induced fractures directly to the producer thus, protecting multi-million dollar investments  |introduction |thermal induced fracturing has been an area of interest for many years and this has substantially increased in the past decade with sustained high oil prices  a large percentage of producing oil fields around the world are applying some form of secondary injection with a good chunk of that percentage injecting water for secondary recovery and pressure maintenance  many offshore operators directly inject sea water into their reservoirs which could potentially lead to shrinkage of the near wellbore rocks  the degree of shrinkage is particularly important in temperate regions where there is a higher temperature differential between the reservoir and the injected sea water  this shrinkage results in tensile stresses being induced in the formation and may lead to thermal induced fracturing  |in every formation, we have the 3 principal stresses which are the minimum horizontal stress (<u+03c3>hmin), the maximum horizontal stress (<u+03c3>hmax) and the vertical stress (<u+03c3>v)  in conventional fracturing due to pressure induced stresses, for fracturing to occur, <u+03c3>hmin has to be exceeded  but in the case of thermal induced fracturing, the reservoir could fracture at a pressure substantially lower than the minimum horizontal stress  at failure, this stress value is closer to the tensile stress cut-off of the formation | 
2016-267 	 ultrasonic velocity and anisotropy of organic-rich chalks |abstract: |based on the assumption of vertical transverse isotropy (vti), we investigated the ultrasonic velocity and anisotropy of organic-rich chalks (orc)  these chalks, from the late cretaceous ghareb and mishash formations in israel, have a wide range of porosity (0 – 45 pu), high kerogen content (5 – 15 wt% toc) and include sections with varying degrees of thermal maturation  cores were extracted both from the shefela basin of central israel and two wells in the southern golan heights  we measured ultrasonic velocities of p and s waves in different directions using the ultrasonic transmission method, whilst adjusting effective (confining) pressure levels  the elastic constants were then calculated from the measured velocities and densities, as well as thomsen anisotropy parameters  compared to previous studies of organic-rich shale source rocks, which exhibit strong acoustic anisotropy, these organic-rich chalks display weak, yet still measureable transverse anisotropy  our results present significant differences between the immature and early-maturation stage samples  in our samples, it had become evident that microcracks are present during the early-maturation stage, yet are absent throughout the immature stage  an additional distinction between the maturation stages reveals itself while examining the elastic constants, showing a much stiffer nature in the early-mature sample, which could also be attributed to compaction and lower porosity  |introduction |accelerating interest to develop unconventional oil and gas fields in the late cretaceous ghareb and mishash formations in israel motivates our laboratory work to measure and describe the seismic anisotropy of these rocks  these late cretaceous formations consist mainly of fine-grained carbonates with high concentrations of organic matter  the lithology of these rocks is mostly chalk, with occurrences of cherts, marls, porcelanites and phosphorites  these target layers show sedimentary layering and complex network of organic matter and minerals  evidence of mechanical and petrophysical anisotropy had been recognized in previous studies of immature orc from the shefela basin [1], [2]  as far as we know, however, it is the first time that acoustic anisotropy of these formations is being measured  |it is generally believed that at the field scale seismic anisotropy is influenced by three major factors: (1) interlayering of lithologies, or laminae, of contrasting elastic properties on scale much finer than the propagating seismic wavelength (2) preferred orientation of minerals and (3) stress-induced fractures and microcracks that show preferred alignment [3] | 
2016-268 	 implementing a universal tip asymptotic solution into an implicit level set algorithm (ilsa) for multiple parallel hydraulic fractures |abstract: |the near-tip behavior of a hydraulic fracture determines the local dynamics of the fracture front, and therefore affects the global fracture geometry  several physical mechanisms may compete to determine the near-tip behavior  in this paper, we consider the simultaneous interplay of fracture toughness, fluid viscosity, and leak-off, which together cause the solution to vary at multiple scales in the near-tip region  in order to avoid having a mesh size that is able to resolve the finest length scale, an implicit level set algorithm (ilsa), which uses a suitable asymptotic solution for the tip element to locate a fracture front, is employed  the latter asymptotic solution comes from the analysis of a semi-infinite fracture propagating steadily under plane strain elastic conditions  equipped with an accurate closed-form approximation for this asymptotic solution, which resolves the effects of the fracture toughness, fluid viscosity, and leak-off at all length scales, we analyze the problem of the simultaneous propagation of multiple parallel hydraulic fractures  |introduction |hydraulic fracturing is a process, in which a pressurized fluid is injected into a rock formation to induce crack propagation  this technology is used primarily to stimulate oil and gas wells [1], but, in addition, is used for waste disposal [2], rock mining [3], as well as for co2 sequestration and geothermal energy extraction [4]  to increase the efficiency of operation in petroleum applications, multiple hydraulic fractures from different perforations are often generated simultaneously from one well-bore  in this situation, outer fractures induce an additional compressive stresses on inner fractures and cause non-uniform fracture growth  this phenomenon is called stress shadowing and has been addressed in numerous studies [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] to name a few  it can significantly affect the fracture geometry and the associated production rate  for this reason, it is important to develop numerical models that are able to predict simultaneous growth of multiple hydraulic fractures and that can be used to design more efficient hydraulic fracture stimulations | 
2016-269 	 using ellipsoidal inclusion model to study shale gas mechanical anisotropy |abstract: |this paper studies the apparent relation between the ultimate strength and the elastic properties, anisotropy, and composition of shale rock  the study uses a series of finite element models created in the numerical analysis software abaqus  the model considers a representative volume of shale rock adopting a binary mixture of a soft phase (clay and kerogen), and a stiff phase (quartz, feldspar, pyrite, and carbonates)  the geometry of the finite element model is similar to the theoretical representation of the clay and kerogen shale constituent as an ellipsoidal inclusion in a stiff matrix  this method describes how the far field stress which is the average stress acting on the total volume of rock is partitioned among its stiff and soft constituents  the volume fraction of the ellipsoidal inclusion controls the clay and kerogen volume, while the aspect ratio of this inclusion controls the anisotropy of the rock  the young's modulus predicted by the fe models match very well with those predicted from the semi-analytical differential effective medium (dem) model when the same elastic properties are adopted for the inclusion and matrix  the dem investigates the correlation between the internal stresses acting on each rock constituent and the mechanical properties of the composite rock  two groups of analysis are performed to investigate failure anisotropy  the first group used mc model for both stiff and soft component and the second group used mcc for the soft component  results explain the mechanical anisotropy by depicting the failure mechanisms in both horizontal and vertical samples  |introduction |the strength and deformability of shales are fundamental properties relevant to shale gas production  understanding how different factors affect these mechanical properties is of great importance to successful exploration and production from unconventional reservoirs  sone and zoback (2013a, 2013b) showed a clear correlation between ultimate strength and stiffness of the shale gas and the percentage of clay and kerogen content  another factor crucial to the characterization of shales is its mechanical anisotropy and how it is related to the orientation of bedding planes in the fabric  |although it is not easy to accurately predict rock strength from petrophysical parameters (chang et al , 2006); sone and zoback (2013b) showed that the elastic modulus seems to be a reasonable indicator of rock strength and ductility  an explanation for that is not readily available because of the fundamental differences in time scale and strain magnitude between elastic deformation and rock failure  in addition, both elastic modulus and ultimate rock strength are found to be consistently higher in horizontal samples (compression direction is parallel to bedding) than in vertical samples (compression direction is perpendicular to bedding) | 
2016-270 	 breakage mechanics modeling of the brittle-ductile transition in granular materials |abstract: |during comminution, several energy dissipation processes operate simultaneously, including plastic work due to internal friction, fracture energy release due to particle breakage, and plastic work due to the rearrangement of fragments  recent studies show that the plastic work due to particle rearrangement amounts to an important part in the total dissipated energy, which is much larger than the fracture energy released to create new surfaces, especially at high stress  this evolution of energy distribution between breakage dissipation and plastic work during the comminution of granular material manifests as a transition from brittleness to ductility  however, there is still no micromechanical model that can capture this transition  breakage mechanics is a continuum mechanics theory that allows to analyzing the behavior of granular materials based on statistical and thermodynamic principles  we use this theory to propose a model that couples the energy dissipation caused by breakage and frictional plastic work  a friction plasticity parameter is coupled to the breakage parameter  physically, the relationship between plasticity and breakage translates: (1) the increase of the dissipation induced by breakage in front of that induced by plastic deformation when fragments produced by breakage have rougher surfaces with higher friction angles than the non broken particles; and reversely; (2) the increase of the dissipation induced by plastic deformation in front of that induced by breakage when the multiplication of fragments results in higher particle coordination numbers, shielding effects and higher particle strength  our modeling hypothesis is supported by experimental observations reported in the literature, and simulations show that our coupled breakage-plasticity model better captures the brittle-ductile transition observed in granular materials  the proposed modeling approach is expected to improve the fundamental understanding of quasi-static confined comminution, which is a major issue in civil engineering, powder technology and the mineral industry  |introduction |the quasi-static confined comminution is used in civil engineering, powder technology and mineral industry  it is well known that during this process, particle movement and crushing will occur in order to increase the compressibility  thus, the input energy will be dissipated by the plastic work due to friction and surface energy due to particle breakage (mcdowell et al ,1996, walsh and tordesillas,2004):| 
2016-273 	 influence of embankment loading on the hydro-mechanical response of a natm tunnel in saturated ground |abstract: |tunnel design in urban areas must account for overburden loads as well as additional loads imposed by future surface infrastructures, called the embankment load  in saturated ground, the embankment load will generate not only mechanical response through stress and displacement changes, but also hydraulic response through pore pressure changes  because this hydro-mechanical (h-m) response will be transferred to the tunnel liner and because the liner deforms with the ground, the embankment load will correspondingly influence the liner's stability  this paper examines how severely the induced h-m response from the embankment load will affect the integrity of a horseshoe-shaped (natm) tunnel in saturated ground  two tunnel models are created in the computer code flac  one model is under weak and low-permeability ground (i e , clay), and the other one is under relatively strong and high-permeability ground (i e , granite)  each tunnel model is run under different liner drainage conditions: permeable and impermeable  the embankment load is then applied 10 years after tunnel construction  simulation results suggest that impermeable tunnels will experience the most severe bending moment from the embankment load, particularly for tunnels in clay  further, the severity does not stop shortly after the load is applied, but continues towards the steady-state  |introduction |one of the geotechnical issues associated with tunneling in urban areas is excavation-induced deformation which, if not carefully controlled, may cause damage to existing surface structures  while this effect of tunneling has been a major environmental issue and widely studied for decades, research on the reverse situation – the influence of surface structures on an existing tunnel – has been limited  nevertheless, the extra deadweight from future surface infrastructures, called the embankment load, should be addressed for tunnel design because it can affect the structural integrity of the tunnel  |in dry ground, the embankment load will change the stress and displacement fields of the ground beneath the structure until equilibrium is reached  in urban tunneling, where the overburden is shallow, changes in the stress and displacement in the ground will easily generate additional ground pressure and structural forces on and in the liner, respectively, i e , increasing the liner axial forces and bending moment (rezaei et al , 2013; katebi et al , 2015)  further, embankment loads have also been seen to widen settlement troughs, such as those found above the metro tunnels in london and frankfurt (potts & addenbrooke, 1997) | 
2016-275 	 modeling of natural fracture propagation under sedimentation |abstract: |during sedimentation, buried rocks are subjected to an increase in vertical stress  this increase leads to a decrease of porosity that is commonly called mechanical compaction  indeed the mechanical compaction, depending on its rate and on the burden rocks' permeability, can induce a significant overpressure  thus, a competition is initiated between dissipation of fluid overpressure and sedimentation rate  the overpressure decreases in horizontal effective stress and may result in fracture initiation  the present study deals with the propagation of natural fractures in seal formations  a particular emphasis is put on mode i fracture propagation due to rapid sedimentation process  the initiation of fractures and their growth are studied by numerical simulation using on finite element code dedicated to fractured porous media (porofis)  fractures are represented in this modeling by cohesive joint elements undergoing damage, and the flow in the fracture is described by the poiseuille's law  the interaction between hydraulic and mechanical processes are studied in order to understand the mechanisms of natural fracturing under sedimentation |introduction |basin modeling is commonly used to describe the basin evolution during sedimentation from a reconstruction of its history  in some particular cases, transfer properties of sediments can change significantly due to natural fracturing (twenhofen, 1950; schneider et al  1999)  in petroleum industry, and especially for exploration, the knowledge of fracturing processes and history enhances the prediction of overpressure, the potential locations of hydrocarbon storage and the matrix equivalent permeability  fractures can constitute preferential flow paths or barriers that control hydrocarbons migration in petroleum reservoir  the deep natural fractures initiation and propagation is a well-known topic in geomechanics  it seems obvious to observe that in depth, fractures nucleation and initiation are triggered by existing defaults, but the loads behind its initiation are unknown or poorly characterized  historically it was impossible to imagine joints initiated at very high depth which from an analytical view was inconsistent with the deep stresses field  it took until the effective stress concept introduced by terzaghi, (1936) and the concept of poroelasticity introduced by biot, (1941) to explain tensile stress at very high depth  according to these concepts fractures are initiated when the pore pressure exceeds the main compressive minor stress, this phenomena is called natural hydraulic fracturing (audet et al , 1992; mourges r  et al , 2011; david et andrew, 1990)  lorenz and finley, (1991) and lorenz et al ,(1991) have shown that it is not possible to initiate fractures in homogeneous poroelastic formation in regional context  furthermore previous references showed that natural fractures are initiated in the vicinity of natural defaults in the rock  |in this paper it is shown that when sediment layers have heterogeneous poroelastic properties, especially their compressibility, it is possible to gather favorable conditions to initiate fractures at the interface between the layers  in the following basin's typical structures that are likely to produce a natural fracturing under a rapid sedimentation will be presented  then the main governing equations of the different physical phenomena involved will be given  finally from a numerical modeling with a code based on finite element method (porofis) natural fracture propagation in a typical case will be simulated | 
2016-276 	 comparing laboratory hydraulic fracturing and brazilian test tensile strengths |abstract: |based on the continuing need for crude oil and its products and also the challenges associated with new reservoir discoveries, improving the recovery factor from known oil and gas fields is deemed necessary  matrix stimulation and hydraulic fracturing (hf) are two common methods for reservoir stimulation, intended to improve the flow connection of the wellbore with the reservoir and therefore aid flow rate and usually enhance the ultimate hydrocarbon recovery factor - rf  hf is usually the most effective approach to accelerate hydrocarbon production and improve rf in many reservoirs as it can access larger reservoir volumes than other methods, particularly in the case of horizontal wells and multistage hf  hf treatment of horizontal drains is a complex engineering process with large capital investment needs; a 16-well shale gas pad in the united states or canada can cost $usd 100,000,000 or more  hence, to mitigate risks of inadequate hf treatment by reducing uncertainty in the design phase, hf design parameters may be better defined through laboratory tests  this study was performed on a series of specimens prepared from specimens of core from an iranian carbonate gas reservoir  the 400 meters cored interval was first categorized into five geomechanical units (gmu) based on rock texture and fabric  then, six intact specimens from each gmu were selected, and laboratory hydraulic fracturing tests were performed on three specimens of each gmu at three different confining pressures (5, 10 and 15 mpa)  the hf test conditions (confining stress, fluid properties, injection rate and etc ) were identical in order to evaluate the lithology variation impacts, and were not intended to assess differences in viscosity, rate, or other related effects  brazilian tensile strength tests were conducted on three samples of each gmu  by establishing the relationship between breakdown pressures and confining pressures, the hf tensile strength of each gmu was calculated  results illustrate that there are meaningful differences between tensile strengths inferred from brazilian tests and those back-calculated from laboratory hf tests  these differences are larger as a function of the porosity: generally, in high porosity specimens, tensile strength values derived from the hf tests are about 4-5 times higher than from the brazilian test  issues of defect size and poroelastic effects are invoked to explain the large differences, although proving this quantitatively remains an elusive goal  it is not apparent what mathematical modeling approach might be used to more rigorously assess the differences quantitatively, but a micromechanics fracture modeling approach based on statistical inference using micro- to core-scale tomographic input or digital micro- to macrofabric maps may allow better incorporation of the fabric elements at various scales | 
2016-277 	 new performance criterion for thin spray-on liners: tensile toughness |abstract: |this study suggests a new support performance criterion for tsl “tensile toughness”  for an effective tsl support performance, neither highest strength nor elongation capacity alone is enough by itself  the key criterion for support performance must consider both requirements for load carrying and straining capacities of a tsl  tensile toughness of materials can combine these two parameters and give better representation of energy absorbance capability of tsls  for this purpose, 3 different widely used 7-day cured tsls were tested according to astm d-638 tensile testing standard  as a result of these tests, tensile strength, elongation at break were measured and the toughness values were calculated  details of sample preparation in the laboratory and the testing procedures were also presented in detail  as a result of this study, for the first time in the literature, various tsls' energy absorbance capacities were found  |introduction |ground support is always a primary concern in all earthwork projects  going deeper in underground mining has been necessitating the requirement for different types of support systems by the help of the technological improvements  in accordance with this, thin spray-on liners (tsl's) were invented in 1990's  tsl's are generally cement, latex and polymer based, either reactive or non-reactive, fast curing multi component surface support materials that are sprayed to the rock surface at a layer of 3 to 5 mm thickness  although they are known as a new form of shotcrete, they have numerous advantages in comparison  those advantages are; |fast curing rate and ability to reach adequate mechanical properties in few hours after application [1, 2, 3] |discardable rebound amount and wastage during spraying process [2, 4, 5] |wide displacement range (elongation ratio) [6, 7, 8, 9, 10] |ease of application and fast application rate [2, 6, 8, 11, 12] |smaller spraying equipment [6, 13, 14] |less material handling with respect to other ground support products [6, 15, 16, 17] |decrease in the operating costs [4, 5, 6, 11] |thinner thicknesses of applied material with respect to other surface support systems [5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 15, 17] | 
2016-279 	 a probabilistic assessment of the casing integrity in a pre-salt wellbore |abstract: |geomechanical uncertainties inherent to the pre-salt wellbores may be responsible for severe operational and environmental impacts, since drilling deep wellbores in salt rock formations is challenging and risky  the aim of this research is to assess the potential risk to the wellbore related to salt creep  for this purpose, a finite element model of a pre-salt like synthetic wellbore is used  the evaluation scenario considers an elliptic borehole in which the casing remains uncovered by the cementation sheath  the emergence of plastic deformation in the casing is considered here as a failure event  the salt rock (halite) is modelled as an elasto-viscoplastic material, and creep behavior is simulated using the sophisticated multi-mechanism deformation model  uncertainties associated to the key parameters for salt creep behavior are taken into account as random variables described by probability distributions  the fast probability integration mean value methods are adopted to obtain the cumulative probability distribution for the time when the failure event occurs  the probabilistic analyses have highlighted that the most important variables for salt creep and associated threats are those related to the stress state, temperature and creep-rate parameters  in this research, the probability of the casing undergoing plastic deformation before the time predicted by the deterministic analysis is 40%  the results show that even representative geomechanical models with sophisticated constitutive laws can lead to an unreliable solution when parameter uncertainties are neglected  |introduction |geomechanical uncertainties inherent to the pre-salt wellbores may introduce severe operational and environmental impacts, since drilling deep wellbores in salt rock formations is challenging and risky  |typically, wellbore integrity analysis relies on several geomechanical parameters taken as deterministic values, and the results are directly related to that specific parameter set  hence, even the most sophisticated geometric models may not provide an accurate response whenever the parameter variability is not considered  |having in mind the operational threats related to the pre-salt exploration, one can observe that the uncertainties omitted in the deterministic analyses may represent severe financial and environmental costs  hence, considering the complexity of this scenario and the duality between risk and benefit, it is highly advisable to take into account the uncertainties related to the geotechnical parameters | 
2016-281 	 the in-situ stress response of reservoirs to pressure reduction followed by pressure increase: depletion and rebound stress paths from two case studies |abstract: |for reservoir injection and containment studies we need to be able to describe the relationship between the change in formation pore pressure and the in-situ stress magnitudes, specifically, the minimum principal stress magnitude which is the primary control on the pressure required for tensile fracturing and/or the opening of existing natural fractures  the coupling of the pore pressure change and stress response is termed the ‘stress path’  |the oil and gas industry has reasonable field data to understand the stress path during reduction of reservoir pressure, however, there is very little published data for the change in in-situ stress magnitude with reservoir pressure increase subsequent to a depletion stage (e g  santarelli et al, 1998)  the field data showed almost zero increase (rebound) of the minimum principal stress as the reservoir pressure increased, which would lead to a small and decreasing operational ‘window’ for an injection project where hydraulic fracturing could cause loss of containment  |two comprehensive field studies have been completed where reservoir pressure depletion was followed by water injection which increased formation pressures  the first case study analysed data from a field located in the uk sector of the central north sea, where reservoir sands were depleted prior to the start of water injection  well and subsurface data have been collated and analysed to determine the pore pressure – stress coupling during depletion and during injection  we have determined explicit stress paths for the depletion and the rebound, with the latter being significantly different from the one previously published value  |the second case study from an offshore field, south china sea, analysed a comprehensive data set of step-rate test data which measured the change in the minimum principal stress magnitude as the reservoir pressure increased over a number of years  the data supports a rebound stress path which depends on the effective stress changes during both depletion and injection and whether the coulomb failure limit is reached  |the results of the studies have been used to determine the operational drilling window for further drilling and well intervention activities, which reduces costly non-productive time events  the findings of these studies have a much wider impact in terms of how we understand and operate water injection projects as well as having major implications in terms of understanding containment modelling and assurance |introduction |when the pore pressure decreases as a result of production, the effective stress increases and the porous rock compacts  because the depleting reservoir and the non-depleting rock around the reservoir remain connected, the compaction-induced displacements at the reservoir boundaries induce deformations and stress changes in the rocks around the reservoir  these stress changes will, in turn, affect the depletion-induced effective stress change in the reservoir (coupled system, see addis, 1997)  we define a maximum total principal stress path coefficient <u+03b3>1 as the change in maximum total principal stress <u+0394>s1 per unit depletion <u+0394>pp  |(equation) |and the change in minimum total principal stress <u+0394>s3 per unit depletion <u+0394>pp as the minimum total principal stress path coefficient <u+03b3>3 |(equatiom)| 
2016-283 	 impact of fracture interactions, rock anisotropy and heterogeneity on hydraulic fracturing: some insights from numerical simulations |abstract: |this paper examines the impact of mechanical interactions between hydraulic on their shape and geometry and growth patterns  the impact of rock anisotropy and natural fractures on the evolution of a fracture network is also examined  both 2d and three dimensional simulations using dd-based methods and finite element modeling are presented  |introduction |development of unconventional geothermal and petroleum resources requires reservoir stimulation to access a large volume of rock with a network of fractures that provide both surface area and fluid flow pathways  in the case of petroleum source rock development, stimulation is often accomplished by multiple hydraulic fracturing of horizontal wells whereas geothermal reservoir stimulation relies upon injection induced shear on pre-existing fractures and their coalescence  maximizing facture permeability generation and retention, and minimizing the risks of seismicity and other environmental impact is a highly desirable goal, so that stimulation modeling and analysis are called upon to guide the practice  the hydraulic fracturing process presents a complex mathematical problem that involves the mechanical interaction of propagating fracture(s) with the dynamics of the injection fluid  specifically, fracture initiation, fracture propagation, fluid flow in a deformable fracture and fluid diffusion into the rock, heat transfer between the fluid and the rock, and hydraulic fracture interactions with the natural fractures need to be considered  therefore, advanced modeling is necessary for improved understanding of the stimulation process and for design optimization  such models can be used to predict fracture geometries, orientation, stimulated volume, and induced stresses in the reservoir (e g , for meq interpretation and refrac analysis)  |hydraulic fracturing numerical models are usually developed based on a particular conceptual model  early hydraulic fracturing numerical models (e g , carter et al , 2000; ouyang et al , 1997; yew, 1997; lee et al , 1994; clifton and wong, 1991; clifton and abou-sayed, 1981; 41; vandamme and curran, 1987; cleary et al , 1985; wiles and curran, 1982; abe at al , 1976) were developed for conventional reservoirs based on the concept of a tensile fracture propagating under fluid pressure (e g , barenblatt, 1962; perkins and kern, 1961; geertsma and de klerk,1969)  however, field observations of micro seismicity during fracturing of geothermal reservoirs (e g , cornet, 1997; roff et al , 1996; fehler, 1990) and surface area estimations based on gas production in shale reservoirs (e g , ghassemi and suarez-rivera, 2012) show the existence of a complex fracture network, suggesting shear-slippage as a major mechanism of stimulation  indeed, numerous hydraulic fracturing jobs have shown shear failure to be the main source of permeability enhancement, particularly where natural fractures are pervasive (rutledge and phillips, 2002; mayerhofer et al  1997; chipperfield et al  2007)  however, analysis of pressure transients and rates often indicate the propagation of a major feature in the tensile mode consistent with the classical hydraulic fracturing concept  in this scenario, one could still envision leakoff from the major hydraulic fracture into the rock would cause slip on pre-existing or newly formed discontinuities and enhances the permeability in the vicinity of the main fracture via shear stimulation (e g , (e g , see dusseault and mclennan, 2011)  different interpretations of field experiences have spurred different stimulations concepts and numerical models for analysis | 
2016-284 	 the effects of stress changes and natural fractures on hydraulic fracture interactions |abstract: |a fully three-dimensional hydraulic fracture simulator was used to demonstrate the impact of stress changes and natural fractures on hydraulic fracture network geometry  propagating hydraulic fractures change the local stress field, affecting the trajectory of nearby fractures propagating simultaneously (e g  in a multi-cluster stage) or sequentially (e g  subsequent stages in the same or other laterals)  this can induce fracture complexity even in a very simple stress regime with no pre-existing natural fractures  the paper also shows that the geometry of a natural fracture system can dominate the shape of the fracture network developed during hydraulic fracturing  it is essential to simulate fracture propagation in three dimensions to capture these effects accurately  |introduction |most hydraulic fracture simulators were initially developed to simulate the propagation of a single planar fracture from a vertical well  their ability to model multi-stage, multi-cluster fracturing of horizontal wells is very limited because it is often added using approximations and empirical correlations  more recently, a general-purpose fully hydraulic mechanically-coupled geomechanical simulator (damjanac and cundall, 2016) has been used to model these scenarios  this type of simulator, based on the distinct element method (dem), captures the effects of stress changes around complex fracture networks, including both the induced hydraulic fractures and natural fractures and faults (e g  mack and zhang, 2016, maxwell et al, 2016 and leonard et al , 2016)  |in the dem-based simulator, the fracture trajectory is limited to the geometry of the pre-defined blocks in the model  it thus becomes very computationally challenging to model the propagation of fractures for which the fracture trajectory is unknown  some solutions have been developed for two-dimensional problems (e g  olson, 2008, cipolla et al, 2011), but these methods are not easily adapted to situations with dipping beds, slip on bedding planes, significant height growth or varying material properties  |damjanac et al (2015) have described a simulator (xsite) which can be used to efficiently model fully three-dimensional fracture propagation  the simulator was specifically developed to model realistic hydraulic fracturing scenarios, including the interaction of multiple fractures with each other and with pre-existing natural fractures  |this paper presents the application of this simulator to typical field cases including zipper-fraccing and a case in the horn river basin in canada with extensive natural fractures | 
2016-285 	 incorporating universal scaling of fracture stiffness and surface roughness effects for improved productivity prediction in naturally fractured reservoirs |abstract: |tensile, opening mode fractures created in a variety of low matrix permeability rocks have initial, unstressed apertures in the <u+03bc>m to mm range as determined from image analyses of x-ray ct scans  subsequent hydrostatic compression of these fractured samples with synchronous radial strain and flow measurement indicates that both mechanical and hydraulic aperture reduction varies linearly with the natural logarithm of effective normal stress  these stress-sensitive single-fracture laboratory observations are upscaled to models of fracture populations displaying frequency-length and length-aperture scaling laws commonly exhibited by natural fracture arrays  functional relationships between reservoir pressure reduction and fracture network porosity, compressibility and directional permeabilities are generated that can ultimately be exported to the reservoir simulator for improved naturally fractured reservoir performance prediction  |introduction |many fine-grained reservoirs (clastics, carbonates and mudrocks) require the additional permeability associated with partially open natural fractures (nf's) to achieve economic flow rates  depletion-driven matrix compaction is routinely accounted for when simulating the performance of conventional reservoirs such as deep-water sands (guenther et al, 2005; pourciau et al, 2005) however predicting in a similar fashion the impact of declining fluid pressure on naturally fractured reservoir (nfr) productivity is less well-established  |uniaxial strain testing of recovered core provides direct measurement of formation compressibility and matrix permeability reduction (crawford et al, 2011; ewy et al, 2012) that can subsequently be incorporated in conventional reservoir simulation studies to account for compaction  challenges in capturing analogous geomechanical effects in nfr performance prediction can in part be attributed to a paucity of hydromechanical measurements of nf response to effective stress changes appropriate to the hydrocarbon reservoir environment and difficulties in upscaling the laboratory stress-sensitivity of single fractures to in situ nf populations exhibiting frequency-size distributions in geometric attributes  |we report new measurements of stress-dependent mechanical and hydraulic aperture reduction in fractured specimens and describe a workflow for upscaling this dynamic response to discrete fracture network (dfn) models which we use to rank the influence of in situ stress orientation and magnitude, pressure depletion and fracture surface roughness on network compressibility and permeability response | 
2016-290 	 thermal effects on sand prediction |abstract: |sanding onset and sand production rate in non-isothermal conditions are of interest both for post-cold heavy oil production with sand (chops) and thermally related (enhanced oil recovery) eor processes for sand control and optimized production purposes  critical drawdowns with different sanding criteria representing different types of formations or failure mechanisms are presented based on fully a coupled geomechanics model under a uniform in-situ stress and non-isothermal conditions  comparisons between validated isothermal conditions and those of heated/cooled formations are made  sand production rate after the onset of sanding is also calculated and two different formulations defined by sanding zone change and displacement at the wellbore wall for an open hole case are developed and used  |introduction |differential temperatures applied between a wellbore and found in the far field, impose a non-isothermal condition in energy producing formations  both formation mobility and skeleton deformation may induce incremental flow and possible formation failure leading to either wellbore collapse or sanding issue at the same time  these effects can be a major concern for well completion, as unwanted sand may be triggered, attempting to improve the production in petroleum engineering  as a possible post-chops production strategy by heating the formations up, sanding may be purposefully mobilized for permeability enhancement and for better steam circulations  a combination of viscosity reduction and formation permeability increase, mobility change, is intuitively desirable for production enhancement in those mature eor processes  although extensive sanding related studies has been reviewed by veeken et al 1992, thermally related reports on sand prediction and sand rate calculations are rare and quite limited (wang, 1998)  thermal coupled geomechanical related studies seem to heavily be focused on wellbore stability and fracturing issues (mctigue (1990), kurashige (1989), wang & papamichos (1994), wang & dusseault (1995), settari & walters (2001))  part of the reasons for the lack of the related studies on sand production with thermal effects may be due to the fact that the conventional thermally related eor processes are combined with a strict sand control strategy  furthermore, a complete fully coupled thermal-geomechanics-flow framework is rather complex and poses great challenge mathematically  |chops has been applied in alberta and elsewhere for those intermediate heavy oil reservoir  about 8-15% recovery rate by the current chops completion (smith, 1988) pushes us to search a post-chops strategy to produce additional oil after a preliminary production  field experiences and our intuition with a combined chops-thermal method indicate that incremental oil can be produced by reducing oil viscosity and introducing sanding related permeability enhancement  furthermore the steaming circulation process may be enhanced once wormholes or high permeability zones are generated and thermal effect may further improve sanding processes  in this study, a general thermal-geomechanics-fluid coupling procedure is reviewed  three possible sanding mechanisms are identified, reflecting different sand failures mechanisms, and the corresponding critical drawdowns are derived  both critical producing drawdowns and sand rate subject to different wellbore temperatures are calculated, respectively | 
2016-294 	 simulations and case studies for enhancing production in a stress-sensitive fractured carbonated reservoir |abstract: |a fully coupled dual-porosity model is developed and used to simulate a given field condition  history match from ten wells in northwest china shows a significant and sustained production decline, despite a continuous increase in drawdown  a critical drawdown is identified, after which the drawdown increase effect is neutralized from that from the permeability reduction  a different drawdown increase strategy by maintaining a constant bottom hole pressure (bhp), yet increasing the far-field reservoir pressure is proposed and applied  this way the drawdown can be increased without reducing the near wellbore permeability  production decline can be stopped and reversed  simulations on the field indicate that more than 30% production rate increase can be expected from each well, depending on the in-situ stress level against the permeability changes in the formation  identifying these critical drawdowns is also economically important, as ineffective drawdown increase can generate zero or negative incremental production, at extra cost  |introduction |permeability reduction and production decline are well-known problems in stress-sensitive formations  such a permeability change normally is evaluated in the lab when the confining effective stress changes is correlated to the permeability changes  production declines are believed to be triggered by this permeability reduction when the near wellbore stresses are increased in these stress-sensitive formations  this phenomenon can be observed in the field but may not be specifically quantified, when an increasing drawdown is applied, attempting to increase production  although simulations and history matches were performed extensively (bai et al , 1994, klkanl and pedrose 1991, chen and teufel 1993, chin et al , 1998) a comprehensive study on how to reverse a production decline in a stress-dependent permeability formation is desirable  in this study, a basic correlation between permeability and effective stress changes is utilized  the in-situ permeability and those corresponding stress levels are identified  we must emphasize that the formation permeability may change with the effective stresses, but the range of the stress changes and the corresponding permeability should be identified first so that we can anticipate if those induced stresses due to a drawdown change fall into the sensitive range  this is an important indicator if we may link the production declining issue to the stress sensitivity in these reservoirs  a procedure for simulating and solving a problem as such is proposed in this article  first of all we can determine what kind of stress-sensitive experimental tests should be performed and used for field production evaluation  commonly, the permeability is defined as a function of the confining stress, which is in the principal stress direction  in what follows, we propose to define the permeability as a function of the normal stress to the principal flow direction, which is dictated by the natural fractures and the geological bedding  furthermore, if plasticity and dilatancy occur, the shear component of the stress tensor should be also used  secondly we can determine if a production decline can be reversed by controlling the wellbore drawdown, i e  if the drawdown and stress concentrations fall into the sensitive range to the permeability indicated from the experiments  thirdly we may diagnose if a production decline in a specific field is mainly caused by these stress sensitive permeability change  finally we may find alternative ways to increase drawdown without bringing down the permeability particularly near a wellbore at the same time  in other words, once we can correlate producing well drawdown to the induced stress changes, which are in the stress-permeability sensitive range, then we can adjust the producing drawdown to serve the purpose for production enhancement  once these factors are identified, a dual-porosity model is utilized for production calculations  it should be realized that without considering these factors, any attempt to increase production by lifting drawdown may be fruitless or neutralized by the consequence of permeability reduction  production declines in a fractured carbonated reservoir northwestern china are observed and enhancing strategies are proposed | 
2016-298 	 determining minimum and maximum horizontal stress magnitudes from borehole sonic measurements in organic shales |abstract: |organic-rich shales have proven to be an important hydrocarbon resource  optimal completion of producer wells requires horizontal stress distributions and anisotropic mechanical properties from sonic data acquired in a vertical pilot well  minimum horizontal stress distributions require estimates of multiple transversely-isotropic (ti) elastic constants  conventional techniques for the estimation of a sub-set of ti-constants yield c33, c55, and c66  to obtain the minimum horizontal stress, another off-diagonal element c13 must be estimated from a rock physics model mannie that requires calibration against either core data or minimum horizontal stress estimated from the micro-frac tests at select depths  this paper describes a new workflow that yields four of the five ti-constants c33, c55, c66, and c13 from the inversion of dipole flexural dispersions in the absence of any dipole shear slowness anisotropy  in addition, inversion of the fast- and slow-dipole flexural dispersions observed in thin limestone stringers interbedded in shales yield six of the nine orthorhombic constants  estimates of c13 and c23 provide the key inputs to the poroelastic stress model to output both the minimum and maximum horizontal stresses  this new workflow accounts for shale heterogeneities on a scale that is of importance in the placement of lateral producer wells, fracturing stages, and perforation clusters  |introduction |stress distributions and rock mechanical properties in organic shale-gas reservoirs play an important role in an optimal placement of a lateral and completion of a producer well for enhanced hydrocarbon productivity (walsh et al , 2006; 2007; higgins et al , 2008; waters et al , 2011)  optimal placements of a lateral is preferred in depth intervals bounded by higher minimum horizontal stresses than the target producer well  stress distributions of this type help to constrain the hydraulic fractures within the producing layer  anisotropic mechanical properties of shale formations are expressed in terms of the vertical and horizontal young's moduli and three poisson's ratios from the five tiv constants  young's moduli and poisson's ratios can help to predict the fracturability of shale intervals  |conventional techniques for the estimation of minimum horizontal stress gradient as a function of vertical depth is based on the poroelastic stress equation  inputs to this equation are the 5 ti-constants together with tectonic strains that require calibration against measured minimum horizontal stress from a micro-frac test at a nearby depth  while sonic data from a vertical pilot well is routinely processed to yield the ti-constants (c33, c55, and c66), one of the important off-diagonal elements c13 requires cluster processing of sonic data from both a vertical and deviated sections in the same shale lithology (jocker et al , 2013a; 2013b; brooks et al , 2015)  alternatively, c13 can be estimated from compressional wave velocity in an oblique core plug  yet another technique is based on invoking a rock physics model mannie together with the necessary calibration against core plug data (schoenberg et al , 1996; suarez and bratton, 2009; horne, 2013)  all of these three techniques are based on inverting velocity data acquired in different volumes of shale formations for the estimation of c13  these volumes of shale can be far away from the vertical pilot and lateral producer wells that need to be optimally completed for enhanced hydrocarbon productivity | 
2016-300 	 investigation of thermal effects of fluid injection into unconsolidated formation in microscopic numerical models |abstract: |the temperature difference between injected fluid and surrounding rock can play an important role in initiation and propagation of fractures in completion and simulation operations  in this work, the thermal effect is investigated using dem-based micromechanics model implemented in particle flow code (pfc)  the rock mass is represented by an assembly of discrete particles that are bonded at contacts  in the developed thermo-hydro-mechanical (thm) module, heat conduction across the solids in the rock matrix and heat convection between the injected fluid and solid particles are coupled  the evolution of the system is driven by a continuous point source of heat  simulation results show that the thermal induced stress, temperature and pore pressure predicted by this model are consistent with laboratory observations and simulation results from conventional continuum mechanics models  this study indicates that thermal stresses can greatly affect initiation and propagation of fractures and assist the communication between injection pressure and pore pressure in the rock formation; thermal fracturing can be considered as an effective method to connect fracture network, enhance weak zones and create more fractures  |introduction |the effects of thermal contrast between injecting fluid and surrounding rock can play very important roles in initiation and propagation of fractures in completion and stimulation operations  a significant temperature difference between the wellbore fluid and rock formation may introduce additional compressive or tensile stresses, depending on whether the fluid temperature is higher or lower than the surrounding rock [1]  most existing research works related to thermal stresses have focused on the geothermal and fractured reservoirs  for example, zeng et al  [2] investigated the potential of heat production from deep hot dry rock and indicated that produced heat relies on thermal conductivity, injection temperature and water production rate  in a fractured reservoir, the heat flow within the fracture is primarily accomplished by advection; in the area outside the fractured zone, heat flow is mainly controlled by conduction [3]  |the investigation of thermo-hydro-mechanical (thm) process in fractured reservoir has been developed rapidly in recent years  both numerical simulations and laboratory experiments showed that cooling injection is an effective approach to improve reservoir permeability  |three-dimensional structural model showed that rock shrinkage will very likely take place after several months of cooling circulation and the tractions across fractures around reinjection borehole can significantly increase [4]  the laboratory studies showed that a strong thermal gradient is generated by increasing the number of cryogenic stimulation after injecting liquid nitrogen (ln2)  the fracturing can be enhanced as a result of creating new cracks and reactivating/opening preexisting cracks  in addition, this method avoids the shortcomings of water-based hydraulic fracturing, such as formation damage, water supply shortage, and contentious political climate [5] | 
2016-305 	 a novel mesh generation algorithm for field-level coupled flow and geomechanics simulations |abstract: |generating a suitable hexahedral mesh for field-level coupled flow and geomechanics computation is still a challenging task  the lack of an analytical representation of the reservoir geometry makes generating a valid mesh for geomechanics a tedious and time-consuming endeavor  indeed, usually the reservoir description comes as a static-model, i e , corner-point geometry mesh, which is appropriate for flow simulations but not necessarily for mechanics  having different meshes for flow and mechanics can alleviate this constraint but there is an intrinsic interpolation error in the procedure  |in order to minimize this error, we generate in the pay-zone region a mechanics mesh by smoothing the flow mesh  this procedure ensures that a valid mesh for finite element purposes is obtained and the projector, which maps pressures from the flow mesh into the generated reference mechanics mesh, is the identity matrix  this resulting pay-zone mesh is propagated into its surroundings by means of elliptical smoothing using linear elasticity  we also show that the same hexahedral mechanic pay-zone's mesh can be converted to a valid tetrahedral mesh by exploiting every hexahedron in a certain number of tetrahedrons  this latest procedure is attractive to bringing tetrahedral meshes into the picture, which allows treating constraints for the meshing process, i e , faults and pitchouts, accordingly  |finally, field-scale reservoir compaction and subsidence computations are carried out by using continuous galerkin finite elements for mechanics, coupled with a slightly compressible single-phase flow simulator in order to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed algorithm  |background |geomechanics at the reservoir level, i e , reservoir compaction and subsidence, usually involves solving flow and mechanics by an iterative coupling technique [1-3]  this raises a question about what it is going to be a valid mesh for mechanics  at first glance, one may consider using the same mesh for flow and mechanics, at least in the so-called pay-zone  meshing only in the pay-zone requires the in-situ stresses as neumann boundary conditions, which is limited due to the uncertainties to measure them accurately in the field [4]  another approach is to extend the reservoir mesh on its surroundings (i e , non-pay-zone), which increases the computational cost by generating a large mesh for mechanics but it allows using simpler dirichlet boundary conditions for displacements instead  this latter approach is more tractable in spite of its additional computational effort [1]  |there exists a gap between static-model builders packages, such as schlumberger's petrel for instance, and mesh generators  usually as a starting point, one may have a corner-point mesh for the pay-zone but neither geometrical nor analytical description of the reservoir itself [5]  this lack of representation makes generating a mesh in the non-pay-zone for mechanics a complicated and tedious task for most users  another advantage of having such geometry is being able to generate a different mesh for mechanics even in the pay zone, which is quite attractive for several reasons such as having a coarser mesh for mechanics in the pay-zone or even non-matching meshes in the non-pay zone |

2016-318 	 effect of non-linear plasticity of clay on collapse gradient for deep water drilling |abstract: |this study presents a numerical approach to account for the non-linear clay plasticity on wellbore stability analysis for deep water drilling  the numerical model considers the stress path dependent (anisotropic) strain-hardening/post peak softening behavior, which is typically observed during undrained laboratory testing of clay materials, using the ngi-adp soil model  a linear-elastic assumption estimated almost no drilling window that did not fit with the field drilling experience  the analysis including the hardening behavior results in a smaller failure zone around the wellbore wall than the linear-elastic perfectly plastic model  when the collapse criterion is defined as an extension of the failure zone that does not trigger a drastic reduction in the shear strength around the well, the proposed approach estimates a possible drilling window for a horizontal well, which was originally estimated as having no drilling window  this study indicates that proper modelling of clay plasticity can provide an efficient solution for deep water drilling of shallow reservoirs  |introduction |shallow clay sections in deep water settings are a complex challenge regarding wellbore stability analysis  often, clay strength is low compared to pore pressures and the drilled formation behaves under an undrained condition due to relatively low permeability compared to typical drilling times  consequently, collapse gradients, estimated using an idealized linear elastic or linear elastic perfectly plastic behavior, are commonly estimated as too high [1]  |as illustrated in figure 1, clay materials show significant non-linear plastic ductility, more than mudstones or stiff shales  when the idealized elastic model is used for the clay material, importance of nonlinear plasticity is ignored  neglecting plasticity may result in inaccurate wellbore analyses  it is common in the field to observe that drilling through clays or soft shale formations are possible even beyond their elastic limit or the peak failure strain due to non-linear plasticity [2, 3]  therefore, for an optimum well design in deep-water drilling scenarios, the non-linear plastic behavior of clay around the drilled wellbore should be properly taken into account  |this study investigates the effect of non-linear clay plasticity on wellbore stability by a numerical approach  |the numerical model considers anisotropic strain-hardening and softening behavior of clay, which is typically observed during undrained laboratory testing of clay material, using ngi-adp soil model [4]  first, a typical plastic behavior of clay while drilling is discussed and compared to laboratory tests  the model is then applied to a deep water drilling design, which initially estimated almost no drilling window using a linear-elastic assumption; a mismatch with a field drilling experience  in the end, applicability of calculated plasticity on the collapse gradient is discussed |

2016-335 	 a hydro-mechanical erosion analytical model for sand prediction |abstract: |sand production is one of the major research subjects in petroleum industry  the physical processes that dominate the problem depend on the in-situ stress field and the hydro-mechanical conditions (i e  the state of the material)  the problem is usually dealt with either experimentally or numerically due to the complexity of the governing equations  in our previous work, we introduced an erosion model which is built upon the physics (fluid-solid poro-mechanical coupling) usually incorporated in erosion models for the prediction of sand production  in this work we briefly outline the mathematical framework upon which our sand production model works due to erosion  the focus of this analysis is the parametric investigation of the material parameters that dominate the poro-elastoplastic constitutive model (cohesion and friction angle) for weak unconsolidated formations  typically such formations are dominated by plastic compaction upon loading and are characterized by low cohesive strength (low cohesion) but significant frictional stress dependent strength (high friction angle)  |introduction |sand erosion, in the sense that interests us in this work, is the phenomenon where a fluid saturated rock loses its mechanical integrity due to the applied stress field and is transported away in the presence of pore pressure gradients  the unintended by-product of solid particles of oil and gas production is generally referred to as sand production  in practice, the aggressive pumping of oil from the well causes grain dislocation from the solid matrix of the rock thereby leading to mechanical problems such as accumulation of sand in the wellbore and the creation of unstable cavities in the geological formation  particle influx into the wellbore may lead to various problems such as erosion of valves and pipelines, plugging of production liners and sand deposits in the separators  additionally, during production, sudden erosion in high pressure gas wells represents a major safety risk (tronvoll and fjaer 1994; tronvoll et al  1997)  the design issue that arises from this problem and it is of considerable interest to the oil and gas operating companies, is the prediction or control of these particles  |in the view of modelling, the different processes that are involved in the sand production problem are associated with: 1) fluid and solids transport, 2) fluid/rock interaction and 3) rock deformation  modelling of the sand production physical problem is not a trivial process as it involves the following coupled mechanisms: a) the mechanical instabilities and localized compressional or tensile failure (damage) of the rock in the vicinity of the wellbore due to stress concentration and b) the hydromechanical instabilities caused from internal and surface erosion, which manifest themselves in releasing and transferring the particles caused by the action of seepage forces  these two mechanisms are coupled since the stress concentration will lead to loss of cohesion of the material causing localized damage which in turn will increase the amount of loose solids that can leave the rock formation (vardoulakis et al , 1996; papamichos and stavropoulou 1998; papamichos et al , 2001) |

2016-339 	 considerations on slope stability in a jointed rock mass |abstract: |we consider a jointed rock mass in which significant brittle fracturing is necessary between discontinuous joint segments for overall failure to occur  simple methods to determine slope stability in such a rock mass rely on assumptions about the behavior of rock bridges  we use simple examples to show such assumptions — for example, the notion of an equivalent shear strength — to be unjustified  further, the fracture behavior of a joint segment may be influenced by the proximity of another joint segment, even if there is no fracturing between the segments  the conclusion is that small details of joint geometry may influence the stability of a slope  since such details cannot be determined for in situ rock masses, it is believed that for the class of rock masses considered slope stability estimates must be assigned great uncertainty, or a large number of realizations must be considered to understand the range of outcomes and to determine the probability of failure  |introduction |the methods by which the stability of slopes in jointed rock can be determined depend on the nature of the jointing  for pervasive jointing at a wide range of joint orientations, the rock may resemble a soil, so that soil-mechanics approaches (e g , analyses of slip surfaces) may be appropriate  at the other extreme, for very sparse jointing in a weak rock fabric, a similar approach works  in both of these cases models based on continuum mechanics formulations are appropriate and have been used successfully for analysis of slope stability  the continuum rock mass properties, typically characterized by mohr-coulomb or hoek-brown failure criteria, are determined by using empirical relations to upscale strength parameters determined in laboratories on relatively small samples (e g , 5 cm in diameter)  these models usually show that failure mechanisms form as a result of shearing under confined conditions  the unconfined (ucs) and confined compressive strengths best characterize resistance of material to such a failure mode  consequently, attention and resources are focused mostly on determination of compressive strength of intact rock and increasing the confidence in the failure criterion in the region where all principal stresses are compressive  in these kinds of rocks, similar to soils, stability of the slopes is often characterized by a single number, the factor of safety  although the factor of safety of slopes is not uniquely defined, because the usual definition of <resisting-force/driving-force> cannot be used when such forces cannot be identified, the strength-reduction approach (dawson et al , 1999) has been widely used  |for intermediate cases of joint spacing, where significant brittle fracturing between joints is necessary for overall failure, a different approach is needed  the failure of the rock mass, which can lead to slope instability, is a combination of sliding on pre-existing joints and failure of intact rock (or rock with discontinuities on a smaller scale) between pre-existing joints  the intact rock between pre-existing joints is often referred to as a rock bridge  for example, read & stacey (2009) discuss a method by which a composite slip surface is identified, with the surface consisting of a sequence of entities that may be joint segments or rock bridges  the latter entities apparently can either be intact rock or an equivalent rock mass volume that contains distributed small, disconnected fractures  the authors appear to assume that the mode of failure in the rock bridges is one of shearing |

2016-346 	 roof collapse modeling with flac3d |abstract: |recently, a numerical model based approach for support analysis has been developed at the national institute for occupational safety and health (niosh)  in this approach calibrated models are used to determine a stability factor for a supported entry  the stability factor is determined using the strength reduction method (srm)  the success of the srm depends on the ability to accurately identify a collapsing or stable roof condition in the models  a collapse condition can be identified by considering the mechanical ratio and the velocity/acceleration of the roof grid points  it is found that during collapse, grid points of the zones within the collapsing roof move at least 50 to 100 times faster than in the remainder of the model  however, the default local damping scheme in flac3d attempts to arrest the collapsing roof, which may result in an incorrect assessment of roof stability  in order to solve this problem, combined damping is used  in addition, unloading of the model to simulate the excavation is controlled strictly with a relaxation algorithm to provide efficient energy dissipation  |introduction |the strength reduction modeling technique has a long history in numerical model analysis in rock slope stability engineering (lorig and varona, 2000)  this modeling technique was adapted to underground coal mine entry analysis by esterhuizen (2015) to address the need for a method to compare the effectiveness of different support systems when designing ground support in coal mines  the srm calculates a stability factor of the entry roof by gradually reducing the rock strength until failure is indicated  the stability factor is expressed as the inverse of the strength reduction factor  for example, if collapse occurs when the strength is reduced by a factor of 0 5, the entry stability factor will be 2 0  the stability factor can be used to assist in developing a final support design by comparing the effectiveness of various support systems and the stability of excavations under various geological and loading conditions, as demonstrated by tulu et al  (2016)  |the success of the srm depends on the ability to accurately identify a collapsing or stable roof condition in the models  in this paper, a procedure to reliably identify the collapsing roof in a flac3d model is presented  |the modelling approach |the srm stability factors are determined using the flac3d finite difference code (itasca, 2014)  a systematic procedure is used to estimate model inputs based on the coal mine roof rating (esterhuizen et al , 2013a)  model calibration and validation studies were conducted to ensure that the developed modeling technique provides realistic estimates of the stability of mine entries  as part of the validation studies, model calculated stability factors were compared to the results of the empirically based analysis of roof bolt systems (arbs) method (mark et al , 2001)  outcomes of the validation studies are presented by esterhuizen et al  (2013b, 2013c) | 
2016-350 	 monitoring the hydration process and shear wave evolution in cemented paste backfill  |abstract: |the use of cemented paste backfill (cpb) in the mining industry has increased over the past two decades  a comprehensive understanding of the stiffness development of cpb during early binder hydration stages has great impacts on the safety and economy of mines  ultrasonic wave velocity measurements were performed to characterize the effect of relative humidity (rh) conditions and binder content on the stiffness development of cpb  in this paper the evolution of degree of hydration (doh) is investigated for cpb with binder contents of 3% and 5% at different rh conditions to study the impact of cement hydration on stiffness development  an insight is presented on the development of shear wave velocity (vs) with the ongoing hydration process during the first week after mixing  developing self-desiccation suction in sealed samples was measured  the lack of significant early restraint by the paste to volume change resulted in the delay of the evolution of significant suction forces until high doh is reached  the study concluded that low cement concentrations results in delaying the formation of solid paths and stiffness development  therefore, changes in shear stiffness of the cpb and self-desiccation suction are not proportional to changes in doh  |introduction |cemented paste backfill (cpb) has been increasingly used in the mining industry over the past two decades  confidence in cemented paste backfilling systems has been increasing as it has the advantage of easy transportation to underground openings, rapid rates of backfilling, increased ore recovery, less water drainage concerns, and the environmental benefits of diverting tailings from surface storage  a comprehensive understanding of the strength and stiffness development of cpb during early binder hydration stages has a great impact on the safety and economy of mines  in particular, it helps to achieve safe and economic barricade designs and to optimize the backfilling process which impacts the scheduling of mining activities  strength and stiffness development of cpb are believed to be mainly influenced by two factors, the binder content and type; and the curing relative humidity (rh) conditions  one of rh bounding conditions is when free water is available to compensate for pore water consumption ensuing cement hydration  the other bound is when cpb is left to air-dry  stiffness development in cpb at both bounding rh conditions is investigated by studying the ongoing changes in ultrasonic wave velocities during the first week of curing by galaa et al  (2011)  wave velocity measurements to characterise stiffness development of cpb was practiced in several studies such as ercikdi et al  (2014), yilmaz et al  (2014) and yilmaz and ercikdi (2015)  in the area of cement and concrete research, ultrasonic wave velocities have been used to assess the hydration process and strength development by many researchers (e g  d'angelo et al  1995, boumiz et al  1996, chotard et al  2001, akkaya et al  2003, abo-qudais 2005)  moreover, the effect of rh curing conditions in the context of strength assessment and/or autogenous shrinkage prediction is extensively studied in the concrete area (molina 1992, jensen and hansen 2001, lura et al  2002)  however, the water to cement (w/c) ratio in cpb is extremely higher than what is normally used in concrete  consequently, various factors are found to be of influence on cement hydration in concrete and may not have the same level of significance in the case of cpb  galaa et al  (2011) concluded that rh has a more significant effect on cpb than that of the binder content  in the current study, the degree of hydration is measured for identical samples at the same rh conditions in galaa et al  (2011) in order to further investigate the conclusion drawn by the mentioned study  in addition, another rh condition is studied where samples are sealed, evaporation is neither allowed, nor free water supply is available |

2016-353 	 investigation on a slope movement in a complex rock formation: modeling of the deformation mode and remedial measures |abstract: |this paper deals with the analysis of deformation behavior of a slow movement in a complex rock formation (marly-arenaceous formation)  the time history of displacements measured in the last 20 years shows that the ongoing deformation process is essentially a stationary creep phenomenon, also influenced by transient variations in pore pressure distribution  the movement was recognized after the discovery of intense cracking in the concrete lining of a hydraulic tunnel running across the slope, which will serve for water diversion from a rockfill dam, not yet in operation, located adjacent to the moving mass  field investigations strongly suggest the ongoing movement takes place along a basal slip surface, formed by a tectonized clay rich interbed, with mobilized friction angle close to residual  the influence of reservoir level increase on the slope displacement and mobilized friction angle of the slip surface has been highlighted  the observed slope movement has been studied by employing viscoplastic model in 2d plane strain analyses (flac code)  the steady state movement can be predicted reasonably using the model  some creep analyses, carried out considering also the proposed stabilizing embankment at the toe of the slope have shown a substantial decrease in horizontal displacement velocity  |introduction |the slope movement presented in this study was recognized in 1985 after the construction of a hydraulic tunnel in right bank of chiascio river valley (italy) (fig  1)  the movement affects large portion of a ridge which has a longitudinal direction approximately perpendicular to the river valley  the moving mass accounts for about 18mm3 and is creeping at an average velocity of 13-17 mm/y  |a rockfill dam was built in 1984 just downstream of the moving mass to create a reservoir at the toe of the slope for water supply by a diversion tunnel located on the right bank  up to now, the reservoir behind the dam has never been impounded  the tunnel departs at the toe of the slope perpendicular to the valley and runs downstream crossing the slope in the east part (fig 1)  so far, the diversion tunnel has been operated only once, in 1991-1992, not for regular water conveyance but for temporary deviation of the river flow  |the first sign of the ongoing movement was seen from a damaged section of the diversion tunnel located well inside the ridge, at 250m from the intake structure under an average overburden depth of 50 m  the damaged tunnel stretch was soon interpreted as the place where the tunnel axis intersects a deep-seated slip surface |

2016-363 	 distribution and properties of faults and fractures in shales: permeability model and implications for optimum flow stimulation by hydraulic fracturing |abstract: |the spatial distribution of reactivated fractures and fracture permeability after stimulation are key controlling factors that determine typical drainage areas, shale to well connectivity, and hydrocarbon flow rates in fractured shales  in this paper, the influence of fault and fracture populations on the permeability of fractured shales is studied using an analytical model and field data of fault and fracture populations derived from a 3d seismic survey covering the posidonia shale formation in the west netherlands basin  the analytical model incorporates fault and fracture populations and describes the permeability of fractured shales using 3d permeability tensors for layered shale matrix, damage zone and fault core of fault zones  a model sensitivity analysis shows that bulk permeability can vary considerably, depending on permeability anisotropy in the matrix, damage zone and fault core, the orientation of matrix layers and damage zone fractures, and the location relative to the fault core  the field data shows the distribution of fault sizes and displacements and associated model input parameters in comparison to typical fault scaling relations from literature  implications of the analysis for optimum well planning and flow stimulation using hydraulic fracturing in naturally fractured shales are given  |introduction |in many prospective shales, hydrocarbon production is determined by the distribution and properties of natural faults and fractures (gale and holder, 2010; king, 2010)  the spatial distribution of reactivated fractures and fracture permeability after stimulation are key controlling factors that determine typical drainage areas, shale to well connectivity, and hydrocarbon flow rates  fault and fracture populations, orientations, and permeability have been analysed in studies of seismic surveys, outcrop analogues, core material, and laboratory experiments (odling et al , 1999; bonnet et al , 2001; torabi and berg, 2011)  data from these studies can be used to characterize fault and fracture populations, and describe permeability of fractured shales for areas with limited available data (terheege and debruin, 2015a)  also, natural faults and fractures are not generally incorporated in conventional hydraulic fracturing simulators that are based on tensile opening of induced fractures (e g , meyer and bazan, 2011)  knowledge on typical distribution and properties of natural faults and fractures can therefore help optimizing flow stimulation by hydraulic fracturing  |reservoir-scale fault zones generally exhibit a specific architecture with a fault core and damage zone, surrounded by intact reservoir rock (caine et al , 1996)  |this architecture will determine the permeability in the vicinity of fault zones (mitchell and faulkner, 2012)  considering the importance of the distribution of faults and fractures in determining stimulated reservoir volume and gas production, it is important to better describe permeability in faulted and fractured shales and incorporate this description in models of gas flow | 
2016-364 	 fully coupled geomechanics and reservoir simulation for naturally and hydraulically fractured reservoirs |abstract: |unconventional reservoirs are often characterized by a multicontinuum stimulated formation with complex propped and unpropped fracture networks that occur over a wide range of length-scales and geometries  coupled numerical simulation of geomechanics and flow and transport in such formations can lead to an improved understanding of production from these systems  computational efficiency and accuracy are both critical for modern simulation workflows for engineering design  a mixed continuous-discrete fracture discretization approach is proposed whereby a single cartesian mesh is applied, and discrete representations are embedded to capture primary fractures, whereas continuous representations may be used for well-connected natural fractures  the geomechanics is approximated using a hybrid extended finite element method (xfem) for discrete fractures and a dual porosity-poroelasticity treatment for the continuous representations  the flow and transport in discrete fractures are approximated using an embedded-discrete-fracture model (edfm), whereas the continuous representation is through a dual porosity treatment  in addition to validation and mesh refinement results, a number of computational examples are presented illustrating the first-order effects of the coupled physics in realistic models  |introduction |production from unconventional resources such as tight and shale-gas reservoirs involves the coupling of a number of complex multiphase flow and geomechanical phenomena  unconventional reservoirs are comprised of an ultra-low permeability fractured matrix that may consist of multiple continua  natural fractures form highly connected networks with a wide range of length scales  the fractures are primarily supported by pore pressure  horizontal wells stimulated by hydraulic fractures that emanate from the wellbore along clusters within multiple stages  the fractures are supported by pore pressure as well as proppants that are delivered during the completions process  the proppant concentration may vary along fractures  |empirical observations from field practice suggest that geomechanical effects may play a first-order role in production from unconventional reservoirs  it is frequently observed that the production rate in tight gas reservoirs declines rapidly in a manner that is believed to be closely related to the evolution of fracture aperture and permeability with time (huang and ghassemi 2012)  proppant embedment and pore pressure-structure interactions can have a significant impact particularly within the interplay between offset wells  numerical simulation of the coupled process in such formations can lead to an improved understanding of this interplay  |numerous models have been proposed to capture the effects of a range of complex constitutive relations for flow and transport including confinement and non-darcy effects (jiang and younis, 2015; wu et al , 2013)  models for that resolve the geomechanics in gas production systems are scarce due to the complexity of treatment for the coupling to flow and due to the presence of discontinuities in the form of discrete fractures  the influence of conductivity loss associated with discrete hydraulic fractures has also not been well studied  therefore, coupled processes between matrix deformation and fluid flow are important to predict fracture permeability change and reservoir production behavior (huang and ghassemi 2012) |

2016-368 	 thermal effects during hydraulic fracturing in low-permeability brittle rocks |abstract: |a three-dimensional finite-element model for hydraulic fracturing has been developed that accounts for local thermal non-equilibrium between the injected fluid and host rock  the model also accounts for fluid flow and heat transfer within the fracture, heat conduction through the solid rock, deformation of the rock, and propagation of the fracture  fluid flow through the fractures is modeled using the lubrication equation, and is fully coupled to the thermoelastic mechanical model through the pressure exerted by the fluid on the fracture walls, as well as by ensuring compatibility of fracture volumetric strains  fractures are discretely modeled using triangular surfaces in an unstructured three-dimensional mesh  the growth of fractures is modeled using linear elastic fracture mechanics (lefm), with the onset and direction of growth based on stress intensity factors that are computed for unstructured triangle-tetrahedral meshes  the model has been verified against analytical solutions available in the literature for penny-shaped (3d) fractures  a radial hydraulic fracture from a horizontal well is simulated to investigate the effects of the thermal non-equilibrium between the fracturing fluid and the host rock  for the case of very low matrix rock permeability, results show very little influence of thermal effects on the creation of hydraulic fractures  |introduction |in hydraulic fracturing, the fracturing fluid is commonly not in thermal equilibrium with the solid medium, leading to heat transfer between the fluid inside the fracture and the host rock, through the fractures surfaces  natural and man-made examples are the creation of several-kilometers-long magma-driven dikes (spence and turcotte, 1985) and hydraulic fracturing of gas shale (tran et al , 2013), respectively  |hydraulic fracturing has attracted a great deal of attention over the past decades  many analytical and semi-analytical solutions have been developed to quantify hydraulic fracturing variables of interest, such as injection pressure, fracture aperture and fracture length (cf  adachi et al , 2007)  these semi-analytical solutions provide the foundation for hydraulic fracturing design (e g  cleary, 1980; cleary et al , 1988)  these solutions are constructed by combining the equations for laminar flow through the fracture with elastic deformation of the adjacent rock  fluid flow through the fracture is commonly modelled using lubrication theory (batchelor, 1967) for an incompressible newtonian fluid obeying the cubic law, while fracture aperture is calculated using linear elasticity in conjunction with linear elastic fracture mechanics (lefm) for the computation of the mode i stress intensity factor at the fracture tip (geertsma and de klerk, 1969; spence and sharp, 1985)  the lubrication equation is derivable from the general navier-stokes equation for the flow between two parallel plates (zimmerman and bodvarsson, 1996)  |heat conduction between the fluid inside fracture and surrounding rock solid has been of particular interest in many cases including magma-driven fractures (spence and turcotte, 1985), hydraulic fracturing of wells (wang and papamichos, 1999), and hydraulic fracturing of gas shale (tran et al , 2013; enayatpour and patzek, 2013)  rock temperature at the surfaces of the hydraulic fracture is often considered constant and equal to the temperature of the injected fluid (tran et al , 2013; abousleiman et al , 2014)  however, such an assumption does not satisfy conservation of energy, and does not account the fact that heat exchange between the fracturing fluid and the rock gradually causes the fracturing fluid to thermally equilibrate with the matrix rock  consequently, an unrealistically large effect due to thermal non-equilibrium is predicted by such approaches |

2016-371 	 size effects on triaxial strength measurements and brittle-ductile behavior of carbonate rock |abstract: |for determining strength, core samples should meet the recommended sample length as described in astm or isrm specifications  however, irregularly-sized core samples are tested anyway and the measured strength obtained from these core samples are potentially improperly used in petroleum geomechanics workflows and modeling  previous studies performed on sandstone samples at different lengths proposed a suitable correction factor to apply for unconfined (ucs) and confined compressive strengths (ccs) and compare it to the astm correction factor used in the industry  |this study focuses on applying a correction factor developed in sandstone under triaxial testing to carbonates to verify its applicability in other lithologies  the sedimentary rock type selected and tested in this study is the alabama limestone and the proposed l/d correction factor allows rock mechanics practitioners to use either 38 1 mm (1 5-in) or 25 4 mm (1 0-in) diameter side-wall core samples extracted via wireline rotary side-wall coring in their geomechanical models  |introduction |rock mechanical properties (rmp) are important for petroleum geomechanics analysis  the effect of size, especially as it relates to rock strength, is well understood; what is less understood is the proper correction factor to use when an appropriate core size is not available, especially under confining pressure  our research has been focused on obtaining a representative size effect correction for rmp and to document what role the lithology of the core sample plays in this phenomenon  |previous studies by mogi, 1966, dirige and archibald, 2006, nunes, 2011 and thuro, 2012, merwe, 2003 and bieniawsky, 1968, have shown that there is an effect of length-to-diameter (l/d) ratio on rock strength  |in this paper we present our experimental findings from alabama limestone samples at different diameters, lengths and confining pressures  we attempt to verify that the correction factor proposed for berea sandstones in our previous study (moronkeji et al , 2014) is adequate for other lithologies, or whether lithology specific corrections are needed  |experimental procedure |the tests done on the alabama limestone were x-ray diffraction (xrd) analysis, porosity-permeability measurements, and triaxial testing  limestone samples are usually composed of predominantly calcite minerals  xrd analysis was done on five selected samples to see if the entire samples were homogenous in terms of their mineralogical composition | 
2016-373 	 a fracture mechanics based slope stability analysis with application to reclaimed steep-slopes |abstract: |forestry reclamation approach (fra) is a technique used in surface mining to reclaim already mined areas, which recommends that upper 1 3 m (<u+2248> 4 ft) of reclaimed slope should be left as uncompacted as possible to facilitate successful tree root growth  however, the consequences of leaving upper 1 3 m of uncompacted material may lead to instability of reclaimed slopes that is not accurately simulated using traditional equilibrium limit methods  a numerical model for slope stability analysis based on the fracture mechanics approach is developed in this research  the interface slope region between the lower compacted and upper uncompacted material is assumed as a joint surface  two-dimensional constant strength displacement discontinuity (dd) analysis of the joint surfaces is carried out for the dry and hydrostatic pressure conditions  the weight of the overlying material acts as boundary conditions on the joint surfaces  once, the dds over the joint surface(s) are estimated, then the stresses at the prescribed points on the slope are estimated and checked using mohr-coulomb criterion to locate potential failure surfaces  the advantage of applying the dd analysis is that it reduces the problem dimension by one degree and eliminates discretization of whole slope area  the fracture mechanics based slope analysis gives better estimate of stability, because it accounts for the local stress concentration in vicinity of the cracks  the analytical slope stability results using the dd model, geoslope/w model and field slope monitoring investigation results demonstrated that overall slope is stable  hence, the fra is applicable to steep-slopes provided the slope gradient is maintained through careful final grading  |introduction |the stability of natural or man-made slopes are of the great concern in civil and mining engineering  the most commonly used approach for the slope stability analysis is the limit equilibrium method (lem)  the lem assumes slope as a rigid body and the rigid body motion or rotation causes the slope failure  the factor of safety in the lem approach is determined by the ratio of shear resistance to average shear stress on a pre-defined failure surface  however, the lem approach neglects the local development of stress concentration in the discontinuities or crack/joints in slope  the most suitable approach in jointed rock slopes appears to be that which considers a failure plane consisting of discontinuous joints separated by intact rocks  jennings (1970) first suggested the lem analysis of the jointed rocks and assuming that the intact rock fails in shear mode as a mohr-coulomb material and the strength of rock mass is estimated by using the joint persistence, which is defined as the ratio of total length of joints to the length of the failure plane  tharp and coffin (1985) applied fracture mechanics approach to the stability of small slope containing single crack  the fracture mechanics based slope stability analysis accounts for the crack-tip stress concentration characterized by the stress intensity factors  this approach is based on the principle that jointed rock slope stability is governed by the stresses intensity factors at the joint tips rather by the frictional resistance along the joint surfaces  the crack initiation starts when the tip stress intensity factor exceeds the fracture toughness of the jointed rocks  the factor of safety in this approach is defined in terms of stress intensity factor required to cause joint initiation compared to the fracture toughness  scavia (1990 a&b) adopted the displacement discontinuity method (ddm) to deal with system of discontinuities in the slope and analyzed the slope stability using combination of fictitious stress method (fsm) and the displacement discontinuity method (ddm) and suggested to use stress discontinuity (sd) elements for the outer boundary discretization, whereas the displacement discontinuity (dd) elements are used to discretize the joint surfaces  recently, zhang et al  (2013 & 2014) presented slope stability studies based on the displacement discontinuity method (ddm) and used only the dd elements to discretized both the slope boundaries and joint surfaces  this approach is adopted in this study |

2016-385 	 induced stresses near staged fractures and impacts on srv region in low-permeability (tight, fractured and shale) formations |abstract: |stresses induced near a hydraulic fracture are calculated in an elastoplastic mohr-coulomb type formation  while an effective compressive stress increase may reduce the permeability in the formation, the induced shear stresses and dilatant zone developed can increase the stimulated reservoir volume (srv) and the size of an enhanced permeability zone  therefore, the induced shear stresses and dilatant zone are used in this article in order to quantify the srv  it is emphasized that when the srv is characterized by elastic strains then it may not be always maintained, whereas those irreversible or dilatant volumetric strains can be the key for producing economically in a low-permeability reservoir  it is suggested therefore, that a production enhancement is dominated by the cohesion and orientation of the natural fracture network and in-situ stress ratios  |intorduction |hydraulic fracturing technology has been applied widely as the only effective approach for production enhancement in low-permeability formations such as shale, coalbed and tight reservoirs  although only 20% of the applied fields demonstrate positive results among shale oil and gas producers, a 30% production increase has been reported after an optimized fracturing strategy utilized by considering pre-stressing conditions (henning 2013)  this indicates that a hydraulic fracture process may not necessarily stimulate a formation for production enhancement, unless certain favorable stressing conditions exist, which can be closely linked to geomechanics-related factors such as natural fracture properties, in-situ stress ratios and more importantly the induced stresses near the fracture and their effect on flow conditions  discussions and considerations on the induced stresses for stimulating production are not new  production in stress-sensitive formations has been studied extensively in the past for reservoir simulations and well-testing purpose (variogs and rhodes, 1973, witherspoon, 1980, zoback and byerlee, 1975, klani and 1991, chen and teufel, 1993, chin, 1998, bai et al , 1994, 1997)  although production increase is normally obtained by increasing drawdown in the field, the permeability in the induced stress areas may be reduced and subsequently production decline can be expected  in order to produce crude or gas economically on these formations, a hydraulic fracture technology has been introduced as a process for production enhancement, i e  an effective conduit is generated in these low-permeability formations by force fracturing fluid into the formations  one of the major issues is that stress concentration can act as a barrier or skin to compromise this technology when permeabilities in the vicinity of the hydraulic fracture region are reduced  although stress-sensitivity is identified as an important issue in tight formations, not many data is available to link the production decline to the stress-sensitive effect near a fracture  in addition, shear stresses may also be induced near the fracture and consequently generate a plastic or dilatant zone once these stresses overcome the corresponding strength (wang et al , 1994, dusseault, 2012)  this plastic or dilatants zone may be enlarged and propagate with the moving fracture  it is the objective of this paper to calculate the induced shear stresses and the range of the dilatants zone, which may increase both the permeability in the formation and stimulated reservoir volume (srv) at the same time  the existence of orientation-dependent natural fracture and strength-weakening cohesion may further enhance this effect  thus, combining the in-situ stress ratio, oriented strength, post-yielding strength, induced irreversible deformation and its range, and stresses near the fracture will be the key to evaluate if a tight formation will be produced economically by the hydraulic fracturing technology | 
2016-391 	 modeling induced microseismicity in an enhanced geothermal system |abstract: |the analysis of induced microseismicity is one of few tools available for characterizing the effectiveness of hydraulic stimulation in an enhanced geothermal system (egs)  however, the way in which the size, location, and source mechanisms of these events relate to the stimulation process is poorly understood  using the massively parallel multiphysics code geos developed at lawrence livermore national laboratory, we model large-scale mechanical deformation, fluid and heat flow, and fracturing processes using a fully coupled 3d finite element model and model the corresponding small-scale microseismicity using a point approximation for a population of pre-existing discontinuities distributed throughout the model domain  in our analysis, we explore the generation of microseismic events at the egs demonstration project site at the newberry volcano in oregon  because the rock mass at the newberry egs is naturally very impermeable, the project operators are borrowing hydraulic fracturing techniques from the oil and gas industry to stimulate the reservoir and maximize energy production  using the geos microseismic model we investigate the competing influences of tectonic stress change and matrix fluid flow, anisotropy and heterogeneity in the surrounding rock mass, the population of pre-existing fractures, and the hydraulic stimulation treatment design  |introduction |developing a numerical model of induced microseismicity is technically challenging because of the number of potential processes (mechanics, fluid flow, heat flow, etc ) and the wide range of scales (from the size of the reservoir, down to individual asperities on a slip patch) involved in its development  in this paper, we present an approach we are developing to solve this problem using the massively-parallel multiphysics framework geos  we use a fully coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical (thm) model to solve the problem of fluid and heat flow, mechanics, and fracture growth on the largest scales, a model to evaluate microseismicity on a discrete fracture network (dfn), and a model to evaluate point microseismicity on the smallest scales  |to test effectiveness of this model, we consider a case study from the enhanced geothermal system (egs) demonstration project at the newberry volcano in central oregon, which is operated by altarock energy, inc  under a department of energy grant (cladouhos et al , 2009)  during 2012 and 2014 altarock attempted to stimulate the reservoir through hydroshearing, a process where fluid is injected into the reservoir at pressures below the minimum principal stress to avoid fracturing, but high enough to cause existing fractures to dilate and shear | 
2016-393 	 rock mass modeling approach for simulating wave propagation, rock fracture, and rock ejection  |abstract: |as part of an ongoing research effort to improve ground control safety in deep vein mines, researchers at the national institute for occupational safety and health (niosh), spokane mining research division (smrd) have developed a simplistic approach to modeling dynamic behavior of rock using commercially available software  this methodology will be applied to study the behavior of underground excavations subjected to dynamic loading from remote seismic sources in order to better understand the relationship between seismic wave-parameters, rock mass damage, excavation stability, and ground-support demands  the potential exists to improve safety in burst prone ground through better understanding of the effects of seismic loads on excavations  this paper describes a preliminary one-dimensional investigation of the model that validates its performance and provides insight into the dynamic failure of rock  the main observation is that the dynamic stresses that develop in the rock near a free surface are different than those that occur within a constrained solid  in a constrained solid, the dynamic stresses are directly proportional to the velocity amplitude of the propagating wave  this study shows that in the vicinity of an unconstrained surface, the accelerations associated with a seismic wave are also important to understanding dynamic stress and rock ejection  as the wave passes, forces develop that are equal to the product of the mass and acceleration of the rock block attempting to eject  for a seismic wave of given peak particle velocity, higher frequencies will be associated with higher accelerations and have the potential to be more damaging to a rock surface  increased use of dynamic modeling will develop knowledge of the effects of seismic loading on excavations and ground support and may lead to designs that better protect miners  |introduction |in the last few decades there has been significant advancement in computing power and the capabilities of numerical modeling software for use in geomechanical problem solving  the ability to perform fully-dynamic simulations in geomechanics has never been more accessible or user friendly than it is today  however, practical application of this technology in rock engineering projects is not common place as of yet (compared with static modeling)  further development and increased use of this technology may provide significant insights into problems associated with mining induced seismicity and thereby help protect miners from the hazards associated with rockbursts  |dynamic problems are particularly challenging because a full characterization of the initial static state can never be completely realized in geotechnical engineering, hindering the analysis from the start  additionally, the strength and mechanical behavior of intact rock (christensen et al , 1972; qian et al , 2009; johnson 2010), rock joints (bakhtar and barton, 1984; barbero et al , 1996; mohammed et al , 2006), and many ground support materials (ansell, 2005, 2006; player et al , 2008) are dependent on loading rate  moreover, their dynamic behavior is not well characterized  lastly, the appropriate dynamic loading must be applied and adequate characterization of seismic loads is challenging | 
2016-394 	 framework for simulating fracture, ejection, and restraint of rock around a mine drift subjected to seismic loading |abstract: |researchers at the national institute for occupational safety and health (niosh), spokane mining research division (smrd) have developed a modeling framework, using commercially available software, for investigating the fracture and ejection of rock into underground mine openings caused by seismic loading and the restraint of this failed rock by the ground support system  the modeling framework presented here establishes the conceptual foundation and demonstrates the required capabilities for a model of a simple two-dimensional cross-section of a deep mine drift  the model has been used to investigate the effects of various wave parameters on the stability of underground excavations, both with and without ground support  additionally, kinetic energy of ejected rock and energy dissipated by the ground support system are calculated and compared  finally, the effectiveness of ground support, with and without containment, has been investigated  the main conclusion is that simplified empirical rockburst damage analyses based solely on volume of ejected rock are inadequate  the damage potential of a seismic event should be measured in terms of dynamic energy demand on the ground support  further, peak specific power may be a better wave parameter to correlate with this demand  this research aids in the understanding of the effects of mining induced seismic loading on underground excavations and support systems, and may lead to improvements in miner safety  |introduction |continued advancement of computing technology and capabilities of commercially available numerical modeling software has made fully-dynamic numerical simulation of problems in geomechanics more practical than ever before  however, application of this technology is still not common place (as compared with static numerical modeling)  |numerical modeling in geomechanics is associated with unique and significant challenges because of the uncertainty involved with engineering of natural systems  in rock mechanics, this uncertainty stems primarily from inherent complexities associated with geologic materials  often times, even for static or quasistatic problems, it is not feasible to incorporate these complexities into a model, resulting in solutions that have high margins of error; the problem is data-limited  |solutions to dynamic problems in geomechanics are therefore hampered from the outset, because the dynamic solution is dependent upon the initial conditions, which are generally the static equilibrium state of the excavation, which is itself a data-limited problem  additionally, there is uncertainty surrounding nearly every aspect of the dynamic solution  for a mining rockburst this includes dynamic behavior of intact rock, discontinuities, and ground support; source mechanism; the characteristics of the ground motion and the changes that occur as the wave propagates through the rock mass (path effects); and interactions between the seismic waves, excavation, and ground support | 
2016-397 	 evolution of relay zones in normal faulted terranes: integrating field geological studies with forward geomechanical models |abstract: |echelon arrangement of normal faults is a ubiquitous feature observed at multiple scales (mm – km) in many extensional tectonic settings  the deformation in the intervening rock volume between adjacent fault segments, termed the relay zone, occurs under a combination of rotational and distortional strains that are often distinct from the regional strain on the primary faults  as a result, relay zone structures cannot be reconciled with the far-field strain/stress field  we present an integrated analysis in which traditional outcrop-based geological analysis of the hernandez relay zone (hrz) in the rio grande rift of new mexico is compared and contrasted with quantitative 3d geomechanical forward modeling to provide a mechanical rationale for the observed structures in the hrz  the model results suggest that the observed spatial variations in finite strain and the incremental changes in extension direction in the hrz can be attributed to the interaction between the primary faults  sensitivity analyses of the models suggests that obliquity of the structures in the relay zone increases with increasing fault overlap (for a given spacing), and decreases with yield strength of the intact rocks and coefficient of friction on the bounding faults  sensitivity analysis of forward geomechanical models, when calibrated to field observations can be a powerful physics-based technique for predicting the potential orientations of secondary faults that can act as baffles or conduits for fluid flow in the subsurface  |introduction |over the past 5 decades, structural geologists relied on geometrical and kinematic techniques (e g , dahlstrom, 1969; suppe, 1983; suppe and medwedeff, 1990; malz et al , 2015; vidal-royo et al , 2015) for interpretations and analyses of rock deformation  using empirical and geometric constraints, such techniques provided rapid insights into structural geologic history in different tectonic settings  however the mechanical behavior of rock masses is generally not considered in such techniques  the factors controlling geological deformation include tectonic loading (imposed far-field stresses or strains), rock mechanical properties, strain rate, ambient temperatures and pore-fluid pressures  a comprehensive analysis of geological structures should ideally consider the interaction among these controlling factors across multiple spatio-temporal scales  while modeling the interactions between all the physical processes is still a challenge, idealized geomechanical forward models can provide some useful insights into mechanical controls on geological deformation  |over the past 2 decades, increasing integration of traditional structural geology and geomechanical analyses has provided insights into the mechanical evolution of geological structures (e g , willemse 1997; kattenhorn and pollard, 1999; crook et al , 2006; busetti et al , 2012; goteti et al , 2013; roberts et al , 2015) and in some cases also been used as a quality check for kinematic models (e g , smart et al , 2004; moretti et al , 2006)  advances in computational power and numerical formulations currently support analyzing elastic modeling of complexly faulted or fractured geological media (maerten and maerten, 2006) as well as forward modeling of high strain tectonics (e g , beaumont et al , 2001; goteti et al , 2013; allen and beaumont, 2015; nikolinakou et al , 2014)  these advances provided a physics-based understanding of geological deformation and allowed tracking plausible paths of environmental variables (e g , stress, strain) during rock deformation | 
2016-400 	 noneuclidean model of inelastic deformations applied to rock cutting |abstract: |rock behavior frequently does not fit the classical theory of continuum mechanics because of rock heterogeneous structure  particularly, rock failure may be accompanied by zonal disintegration formation  |the key to building the non-classic model of rock failure is the structure with grain boundaries  deformations of solid bodies with microscopic flaws can be described within the scope of non-euclidean geometry, and non-trivial deformation incompatibility can be referred to as a fracture parameter  |the new continuum model presented in this paper enables prediction of the fractured zones initializing and developing as a periodic structure  the non–euclidean description of phenomenon initiates an appearance of two unusual material constants that can be called ‘non-classic’ moduli  the coupled model must comprise the fourth–order parabolic equation on disintegration thermodynamic parameter to be solved with the classical hyperbolic system of equations for the dynamics of continuous media  |in the classic approach to the rock cutting problem, the fracture is caused by critical shear stresses when failure criterion based on tresca (or more general mohr) theory is applied  in this case it is hard to predict the chip size and optimal depth of cut because the criterion is beyond the model  |in this paper, the developed theory of zonal disintegration is applied to analysis of rock cutting by pdc cutter process  it is shown that initial shear stress at the cutter tip causes the disintegration (destruction) developing deep into the medium with contouring of the rock failure scale; and along the cutting direction with the forming of rock failure scale as well  |introduction |the difficulties of mathematical description of the rock cutting process, as it is emphasized in cherepanov [2], arise from the elongated plastic zones around the cutting edge of a cutter and the interaction of multiple fractures generated from cutting  cutting the rock formation with an apparent shear plane typically occurs under the brittle mode with cuttings formed as rock particles  the size of the rock particles is characteristic for the cutting process  the main experimental results of the cutting process are well studied (e g  see borisov [3],[4]) and are typically reduced to describing the key patterns of the transitional process leading to the steady mode, as well as to characteristic features of the steady mode  on the other hand, the steady cutting mode is characterized with the measureable force of resistance to cutting, including cases when it is a function of the linear velocity of the cutter (cherepanov [2])  any theoretical model of the rock cutting process under the brittle fracturing mode proposed must confirm the experimental results  adding new characteristic features of the cutting process does not bring more clarity to the physics of this phenomenon  the main problem of the rock cutting process may be reduced to finding the characteristic scale of formation fracturing under the conditions of a load applied to the cutter (weight on bit and torque on bit), taking into account the features of the stressed state of the formation in the vicinity of the cutter tip  another issue that must be clarified in order to optimize the drilling process is an optimal cutting depth at a given cutter velocity  the presented study is an attempt to answer these two questions | 
2016-401 	 pore pressure and reservoir location and their relation to the combined basin compaction and formation thermal properties: heat flux and thermal conductivity |abstract |to estimate pore pressure effectively, engineers and geologist strive to define the underlying fundamental principles that drive pressure generation in a basin  generally, pore pressure generation is understood mostly from a mechanical properties perspective i e  compaction  the exponents of the resulting compaction models range from 1 2 to 5  however, the piece of the petroleum system, which is given less attention, is the thermodynamics of such system i e  heat flux through the formation and formation thermal conductivity  the reason may be due to the inability to identify the subtle changes in thermodynamic properties of formation material and how they influence subsurface pressures  furthermore, thermal seals and storage of thermal energy is rarely addressed  in this regard most researchers take the abnormally “pressured” zone to be composed of one interconnected zone that requires finding the “top” of such zone or measure the pressure only at one point in this zone  this paper show that thermodynamic phenomenon can coexist or even dominate compaction effects, portraying evidence of multiple source of overpressure within an abnormally pressured region  the thermodynamic properties (heat flux and thermal conductivity) the authors also show can indicate maturity of hydrocarbon and location of the oil and gas reservoir depth  |introduction |we have examined the work of various authors as it relates to pore pressure and fracture gradient  the predrill estimation of pore pressure and fracture gradient analysis is the bedrock of well-planning processes  optimal pore pressure and fracture gradient estimates rely on the accuracy of overburden gradient calculations, which signifies the characteristics of a given basin  if overburden or vertical stress gradient calculations are off, then pore pressure and fracture gradient estimates may be grossly underestimated or overestimated, both of which can result in severe wellbore instability and/or well control issues  |to introduce a system of pore pressure calculations for oilfield, eaton, b  a , 1975 developed a modified model for pore pressure and fracture gradient for us gulf coast  eaton built on previous works of hubbert and hubbert et al , 1959, hottmann and johnson, 1965, matthews and kelly, 1967, timko and fertl, 1971, barker, 1972  additionally, eaton introduced the concept of how overburden gradient, poisson's ratio, and petrophysical properties of formations vary with depth  eaton then incorporated several parameters in an equation to determine formation pore pressure and fracture gradient  the above authors have built on the overburden compaction theory developed by terzaghi and peck, 1948  subsequently, they defined the effective stress of a system as the difference between the total overburden of overlying sediments and the pressure of fluids occupying the pores of rock material  later the oil and gas industry defined the “normal” pressure as the salt water gradient or 0 465 psi/ft for the gulf of mexico and any pressure in excess of normal gradient as “abnormal” pore pressure  with that said, it is also worth mentioning that pore pressure and fracture gradient cannot simply exist by themselves  the authors put forth this argument because different mechanisms govern the behavior of pore pressure and fracture gradient from basin to basin  furthermore, terzaghi's approach to the compaction-dominated system does not need to take into account the effect of “high” temperature and thermal conductivity of rock material but it would have been appropriate to have included the cold and low temperatures  this is because unusual pressures are often seen to affect the freez-thaw cycles which in turn afect the shape of pores and in places such as alska affects certan surface pressures  for example, the contribution of temperature or geochemical reactions to the effective stress gradient is not represented in neither terzaghi's equation nor the publications by the above mentioned authors  this could be due to the fact that (perhaps) the civil engineering works is limited to rocks and soils buried in shallow depths  however, other than bower, 1994, the above authors expanded further on terzaghi's “compaction” theory work by incorporating different mechanical parameters of the basin system that affects pore pressure and fracture gradient; nonethe less they do not include in their models the temperature and thermal properties of rock |

2016-407 	 longwall caving in potash mining – geomechanical assessment of damage and barrier integrity |abstract: |longwall caving is rather rarely applied or even considered in potash mining, mainly due to the major risks of flooding and rock bursts  |to analyse the loads induced by longwall caving, we employ a discontinuous modelling technique which describes rock mass properties and fracture development with constitutive models for visco-elasto-plastic and adhesive shear behaviour  as a result, the characteristic geomechanical phenomena in longwall caving can be described convincingly  |we present results on the triggering of rock bursts at the longwall face, discussing related concepts in coal mining as well as pillar collapse experiments from the 1980s intended for the development of new excavation methods with yielding carnallite pillars  the hydraulic barrier is impaired by (shear and tensile) fractures reaching upward from the mine and by pressure-driven percolation downward from the lowest aquifer in the overburden  the latter process is initiated by the stress redistribution following the excavations, in particular by the lowering of the minimal principal stress due to extensional strains induced by subsidence over mining edges  once the minimal stress falls below the groundwater pressure, hydraulic integrity is lost and percolation proceeds in the direction of the major principal stress  if the fluid reaches the fracture zone around the cavities, hydraulic pathways open up which lead to a flooding of the mine  we present coupled hydromechanical calculations which can resolve fractures and fluid percolation through the barrier strata  |introduction |the method of longwall caving is applied mostly in coal mining where it was originally developed  in potash mining, long-wall caving is rarely used or even considered as an alternative to room-and-pillar mining  there are two main reasons: |fracture processes in the hanging wall jeopardise the integrity of the hydraulic barrier, possibly flooding the mine  |the high stresses at the longwall face, and the associated risks of rock bursts, are hard to keep under control, in particular for brittle salt rocks such as carnallitite  |hence, longwall caving was employed only for sylvinite, which does not prone to brittle failure, and only historically in the alsace potash district, and presently in six belorussian mines around soligorsk [1]  |the main advantage of longwall caving, as compared to conventional drill-and-blast mining with pillars, is the higher extraction ration when using fully-mechanised mining  potentially, there is an additional advantage when mining brittle salt rocks, e g  carnallitite: the mining-induced seismic energy release is limited  analyses of rock bursts show that the energy release is directly related to the size of the collapsed field and the number of failed pillars  in fig  1, we have collected magnitude, number of collapsed pillars, convergence drop and the average stress drop of failing pillars for a number of rock bursts in potash mining around the world | 
2016-409 	 rocksalt creep, uncertainties, and their implications for surface subsidence above a producing rocksalt-capped reservoir |abstract: |many hydrocarbons reservoirs are capped by thick layers of rocksalt, a material that creeps when a shear stress is applied to it  pumping leads to compaction of the reservoir material but also induces shear stresses inside rocksalt  these need to relax, leading to time-dependent ground deformations and surface subsidence  to quantify creep-induced subsidence we have created simplified yet realistic finite element models of medium-sized rocksalt-capped reservoirs that include key aspects of the subsurface geometry and material properties layering  these show that creep-induced subsidence can be a significant proportion of the total subsidence and so rocksalt caprocks need to be carefully modeled  we discuss uncertainties relating to the low-stress creep behavior of rocksalt and show the subsidence evolution predicted by the use of different constitutive models for rocksalt creep  another source of uncertainty is the poor characterization of the rocksalt body's physical properties spatial distribution  here we touch upon rocksalt grain-size and chemical composition as two such major uncertainties and discuss the effects this can have on the overall subsidence response  we finish with the conclusion that engineers who are faced with the task of predicting the subsidence evolution have to resort to calculating bounds for the resultant response based on a number of possible scenaria for rocksalt body behavior  |introduction |a large number of economically important hydrocarbons reservoirs worldwide are overlain by thick rocksalt layers  examples include the natural gas fields in the netherlands, the large hydrocarbons fields of brazil (e g  mohriak et al , 2012), or of the gulf of mexico (e g  dribus et al , 2008), and the hydrocarbon fields of northwest china (yu et al , 2014)  time-dependent subsidence above reservoirs (or stated in a slightly different way - subsidence that is not proportional to the volumes of extracted hydrocarbons) seems to be a widespread phenomenon (e g  hettema et al , 2002)  the mechanisms through which time-dependent subsidence develops can be numerous, and can include reservoir inelasticity and creep, delayed compaction due to delayed pore pressure equilibration inside a reservoir system  |with previous work we have shown that for rocksalt-capped reservoirs, subsidence due to rocksalt creep can be significant (see marketos et al , 2015)  the above observation alone requires that special focus is given on modeling the rocksalt material response, especially for low-lying coastal regions where subsidence calculations need to be very accurate  with this paper we first briefly present how rocksalt flow can give rise to time-dependent subsidence and then discuss a number of uncertainties related to the rocksalt  with the aid of a finite element model of a rocksalt-capped reservoir we then focus on the effects of these uncertainties on subsidence calculations and propose a way forward in order to practically deal with these uncertainties | 
2016-410 	 deep borehole disposal in salt rocks |abstract: |rock salt provides the world's best barrier, and has thus long been considered as a host rock for nuclear waste repositories  salt domes have vertical extensions of several kilometres and are consequently well-suited for deep borehole disposal, as an alternative to a mined repository  |the isolation capacity of undisturbed salt rocks is based on the creep behaviour which tends to close any access paths  a number of natural analogues where fluids have been contained in cavities under high pressure for millions of years support this picture  for waste disposal, one has to show that the tightness of the geological barrier is not compromised by the repository excavation and the thermal loading due to the waste, and that suitable geotechnical barriers can be constructed  |we discuss the option of deep borehole disposal in rock salt  in contrast to the mined repositories which are usually considered, this option employs boreholes of several kilometres, drilled into a salt dome  the waste canisters are emplaced in the lower part of the borehole  as backfill material, we propose molten salt mixtures, similar to the ones used in solarthermal plants as heat exchange and storage fluids  the waste-generated heat will keep the salt liquid for a long time, ensuring complete containment without the possibility of ground water reaching the waste  the upper part of the filled boreholes, still inside the salt dome, converges under lithostatic pressure due to salt creep, and the top part can be sealed with asphalt, bentonite and concrete  we present some experimental results on the closure of boreholes under pressure and the properties of liquid salt to support our proposal  |introduction |the favourable barrier properties of rock salt have long been exploited for cavern storage of gas and oil, and make it a prime candidate for as waste repository host rock  usual concepts, both in bedded and domal salt, assume a repository mine in a salt formation in a depth of several hundred to a thousand metres where heat-generating waste can be emplaced in drifts or in boreholes below drifts  after emplacement, drifts can be backfilled, and the repository is closed using suitable shaft seal systems  over time, salt creep will cause convergence in the mine and enclose the waste, completely isolating it from the biosphere  |meanwhile, in the context of other host rocks such as claystone or crystalline rocks, the deep borehole disposal concept has been suggested  in this paradigm, boreholes are drilled to a depth of several kilometres, and the waste canisters are emplaced directly from the surface  details of casing, seals etc  depend on specific concepts and host formations  in the crystalline basement, the waste will be presumably be in contact to ground water, however, due to the large depth and hydrogeological factors, the waste can be effectively decoupled from the biosphere  technically, this approach can be much simpler than a mined repository  |here we propose to combine the advantages of these concepts: salt domes can have thicknesses of several kilometres, and can correspondingly accommodate deep boreholes  in large depth, convergence is much faster, and waste can be completely contained rather quickly, without any groundwater access  a novel backfill material – eutectic molten salt mixtures – can further enhance this idea, offering immediate complete containment of the waste as well as retrievability | 
2016-411 	 acoustic velocities and pillar monitoring on the 4850 level of the sanford underground research facility |abstract: |the sanford underground research facility (surf) has repurposed older workings of a long-lived gold mine to host scientific experiments  the present laboratories are developed primarily in precambrian-age amphibolite host rock, but tertiary-age rhyolite intrusives are also present  a portion of the pillar in the vicinity of the new physics laboratories on the 4850 level (1 5 km below the surface) was chosen for examination using seismic tomography to evaluate the degree and location of potential pillar degradation  geophones and sources were placed on opposite sides of a pillar formed by the intersection of two drifts, and an acoustic wave was passed between them to produce multiple paths along which the p-wave velocities were calculated  the resulting tomographic velocity map of the pillar adjacent to the intersection shows a well-developed pattern of decreasing velocities toward the acute end of the triangle due to a decreasing pillar cross-section  higher seismic velocities are associated with areas where the stresses are greater but where the rock has not failed, such as adjacent to well-maintained drifts  |introduction |the sanford underground research facility (surf) is being developed as an underground scientific laboratory in a former gold mine in northwestern south dakota, usa (heise, 2015; lesko et al , 2011)  the underground workings are extensive and have a history that extends over 125 years  the facility is a host for a number of existing and planned physics experiments that require shielding from cosmic radiation along with a lesser number of geological, geomechanical, and biological experiments  although it is still indeterminate, a design life of 30 years is not unreasonable for this type of facility  given the age of much of the underground infrastructure and the expected long operational life of the facilities, it is important to have monitoring programs that can assess the condition of rock making up the underground infrastructure  such programs will allow evaluation of the necessity for mitigation of degradation of rock conditions  the purpose of the present study was to image the conditions of the rock in a pillar at the 4850 level of the facility (1 5 km below the surface) near a critical part of the underground infrastructure  |the geology of the mine and of the rocks that constitute surf was studied extensively during the 125 years when it was an active gold mine  caddy, et al , 1991, and bachman and caddy, 1990, provide the most recent summary of the geologic environment in terms of the overall geology  more recent studies of the geotechnical characteristics of the rock in the vicinity of the physics laboratories on the 4850 level were performed as part of the scoping for early versions of the laboratories (hladysz et al, 2011)  geotechnical work is continuing as the experiment areas are expanded and developed | 
2016-412 	 hydraulic fracture growth and containment design in unconventional reservoirs |abstract: |hydraulic fracture growth in permeability challenged reservoirs often results in irregular and complex fracture geometries as indicated by microseismic observations  in general, fracture characteristic such as length, height growth, extent and conductivity, which in turn contributes to the overall complexity of the resulting fracture network, are controlled by a combination of operational parameters and local geology/subsurface conditions  the operational parameters include well spacing, well orientation, number of stages, number of clusters, treatment rates, and fluid characteristics among others  these parameters are optimized to maximize hydrocarbon recovery and conductive reservoir volume (crv) and in the meantime fractures are contained within the target zones and subsurface integrity is maintained  this optimization, however, needs to be evaluated within the context of local geology and subsurface conditions  for example, presence of natural fracture swarms, mega fractures (or faults), and stress anisotropy can present hydraulic fracture design challenges that need to be carefully addressed by advanced geomechanical analysis  |in this paper, a 3d hydraulic fracture propagation code is utilized to quantify the impact of operational parameters and subsurface conditions on the resulting hydraulic fracture growth/containment and engineering design considerations  extensive sensitivity analysis investigates the effect of each operational parameters and subsurface conditions  examined effects include vertical stress contrast, fracturing fluid properties, completion design, mechanical interactions between multiple stages and/or neighboring wells, and interactions between natural fracture and hydraulic fracture  |the model results show that the hydraulic fracture growth, containment (vertical or horizontal containment) and the resulting quality of the crv is primarily a function of the in-situ stress profile, stimulation design parameters (simultaneous or sequential injection, zipper fracturing), well architecture (number and spacing of stages/clusters, well spacing and location), and the reactivation of pre-existing natural fractures  results show that, if not designed properly or contained, fractures can grow in and out of zones, intersect with the pre-existing fracture networks, interact with existing hydraulic fractures, and interfere with existing wells and thus significantly impacting resulting crv  |introduction |advanced technologies, such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, are developed and widely used to increase hydrocarbon extraction from low-permeability formations  recent industry practices in north america prove that hydraulic fracturing is essential for economic production from permeability challenged reservoirs [1, 2]  however, microseismic (ms) data demonstrate that hydraulic fractures (hf) often develop irregular and complex fracture geometries [3-7] that reduce the stimulation efficiency | 
2016-413 	 effect of confining stress on sand-fiber proppant placement in a deformable fracture |abstract: |we applied a normal stress (<u+03c3>n = 0 <u+2212> 12 8 psi) to a transparent deformable fracture to investigate the behavior of sand-fiber mixtures  using light transmission techniques, we quantified the sand volume fraction ?s throughout the experiment  in the absence of an applied normal stress, <u+03c3>n = 0, the sand and fibers settled into randomly distributed sand-fiber islands  injecting solids-free carrier fluid displaces the settled solids washing them out of the fracture  results for applied-normal stress experiments (<u+03c3>n = 0 <u+2212> 12 8 psi) demonstrate the sand-fiber islands compacted and the solid volume within them increased as <u+03c3>n increased  we observed that these sand-fiber islands supported the applied normal stress and prevented fracture closure, acting as pillars between the fracture surfaces  after injecting solids-free carrier fluid, while keeping <u+03c3>n =12 8 psi, we observed most sand-fiber pillars remained in place and some solids-free pathways were created  the formation of such pathways shows that the addition of fibers to hydraulic fracturing fluids, even at small concentrations, may increase fracture permeability through the formation of sand-fiber pillars capable of supporting a normal stress, preventing fracture closure  |introduction |settling of non-brownian particles in polymeric fluids (e g , xanthan or guar gels) is of great importance for many different industrial applications, especially in industries where the aim is to prevent particles from settling or at least decrease the settling rate of the particles, e g , oil and gas production and well drilling operations  recently, it has been proposed that the addition of rod-like solids (e g , fibers) to polymeric fluids may reduce particle settling rates  elgaddafi et al  (2012) have previously demonstrated a settling rate reduction of a single particle falling through a suspension of dispersed fibers  much of the recent work has focused on the influence of fibers on the rheological properties of the suspension (george et al , 2011; george et al , 2012; guo et al , 2005; ra-jabian et al , 2008)  these studies have shown that adding fibers to a polymeric fluid will increase the apparent viscosity of the fluid and reduce settling rate  the reduced settling rate was attributed to the formation of intertwined networks of fibers and polymeric glucose-chains (guo et al , 2005; rajabian et al , 2008)  previous research characterized the settling of dispersed sand (chhabra and peri, 1991; guazzelli and hinch, 2011; happel and bart, 1974) and dispersed fibers (baldock et al , 2004; herzhaft and guazzelli, 1999; herzhaft et al , 1996) suspensions  however, there is limited literature for the suspension and settling of sand-fiber mixtures | 
2016-416 	 a methodology to select valid results from lab tests to estimate properties of intact rock with microdefects |abstract: |porphyry copper deposits are characterized by a rock mass with a stockwork of mineralized veins and veinlets affecting the strength behavior of the intact rock and rock mass  the observation of tested samples and blocks at draw points pointed out that veinlets and veins have a high participation in the failure mode, according to this a small volume of rock containing veinlets lees than 1mm is considered to be representative of the intact rock  the structural description of the tested samples pointed out four typical failure types and three of them can be considered valid results to estimate the intact rock properties  this failure classification system is useful to define valid results to estimate the intact rock properties  this method had been applied to several operating mines and projects in chile obtaining a better estimation of the intact rock and rock mass properties and has been applied to estimate pillars strength, fragmentation curves, large open pit slopes stability or cavability for deep underground mines increasing the reliability of the results  |introduction |it is normal practice for geotechnical engineers on site to rejects the results from samples which have failed on clearly defined veins or veinlets which are considered to have pre-existed in the sample  these failures are influenced by anisotropy of the rock and tend to be considered separately from the valid results of tests on homogeneous and isotropic intact samples  |the estimation of the intact rock properties from lab tests, as unconfined compressive strength, tensile strength and triaxial tests represents an important item of the intact rock and rock mass geotechnical characterization, as these parameters are used as inputs for the geotechnical classification systems, geotechnical design and numerical modeling in the mining industry  |the porphyry copper deposits are characterized by a host rock affected by different alteration types and a mineralization mostly hosted in a stockwork of veins and veinlets that makes difficult to obtain samples of intact rocks, as homogeneous and avoid of defects or veins  the presence of the stockwork can produce a strength anisotropy in the collected sample, affecting the value of the lab test and the estimation of the intact rock properties  due to this in el teniente mine was developed a methodology [1] to select valid results from ucs, triaxial and brazilian test to estimate in a better way the intact rock properties  |previous works |in the past, at el teniente mine, the estimation of the intact rock properties was based on the statistical analysis of the results obtained from the lab tests [1], [2], [3], however, the different results obtained from several geomechanical campaign, pointed out the necessity to have a good structural description of the tested samples [4], [5], [6] and was developed a method for a detailed structural description of each sample previous and post the lab test [1]  according to this method it was possible to quantify the participation of pre-existing veins in failure mode in tested samples and from observed blocks in draw points, pointing out that over 70% of the tested samples have a failure with participation of pre-existing veins and 100% of blocks at the draw points are delimited by pre-existing veins [1]  figure 1 shows the statistical analysis of the failure mode for tested lab samples and blocks at the draw points at el teniente mine [1] | 
2016-417 	 n-porosity and n-permeability generalized wellbore stability analytical solutions and applications |abstract: |the analytical poroelastic solutions for an inclined wellbore drilled through an n-porosity n-permeability porous medium were derived, taking into account the mudcake buildup on the wellbore wall  to extend the application of this general solution, a triple-porosity porous medium is studied to illustrate the pressure and stress distributions around the wellbore  moreover, the stress cloud approach is presented to visualize the wellbore failure potentials and the drucker-prager criterion is applied to analyze wellbore shear failure  each set of porosity is found to significantly influence the stress clouds at the wellbore wall and the mudweight window  comparison analysis shows that the single porosity simulation predicts the widest mudweight window, followed by the dual-porosity simulation, and then the triple-porosity simulation  compared to the single porosity case, the dual- and triple-porosity simulations predict 8 0% and almost 15 0% higher collapse mudweights, respectively  mudcake also plays an essential role in the wellbore stability  its effect could be to shift down of the stress cloud and therefore decrease the wellbore failure potential  mudweight window is also found to be sensitive to mudcake thickness and permeability, which clearly shows that mudcake effects should be taken into account  |introduction |the poroelastic solutions for an inclined wellbore have played an essential role in the wellbore stability analysis for drilling through a fluid-saturated porous medium  the wellbore stability is severely affected by the time-dependent poroelastic responses of the fluid-saturated porous medium, such as the evolutions of stresses and pore pressure around the wellbore which might lead to time-delayed failure (cui et al  1997; abousleiman et al  2000)  early analyses of the time-dependent stresses and pore pressure responses after excavation were presented by carter and booker (1982) who gave the analytical solutions for a circular tunnel excavated in a fluid-saturated medium  detournay and cheng (1988) derived the analytical solutions for a vertical wellbore under non-hydrostatic stress field and showed that shear failure could be initiated inside the formation rather than on the wellbore wall  the complete analytical solutions for an inclined wellbore drilled through an isotropic fluid-saturated porous medium was given by cui et al  (1997)  later, the solutions were generated to account for material transverse isotropy (abousleiman and cui 1998) and time-dependent pore pressure and flux boundary conditions (ekbote et al  2004)  for a naturally fractured fluid-saturated rock formation, using the dual-poroelastic formulation, wilson and aifantis (1982) presented the analytical solutions for a vertical wellbore under hydrostatic state of stress and li (2003) for a vertical wellbore under non-hydrostatic state of stress  abousleiman and nguyen (2005) derived the complete analytical solutions for an inclined wellbore drilled through a naturally fractured rock formation and subjected to three-dimensional state of stress  dual-porosity simulation was found to predict narrower mudweight window than single porosity simulation (nguyen and abousleiman 2009; nguyen et al  2009)  analytical solutions were also derived for inclined wellbore problem accounting for chemo-electrical and thermal effects which are found to be crucial in wellbore stability analysis (ekbote and abousleiman 2005; ekbote and abousleiman 2006; nguyen and abousleiman 2010) |

2016-419 	 mitigation of the thermomechanical impacts of the rock melt borehole sealing system |abstract: |deep-borehole disposal has received increased attention in recent years as a potential strategy for the long-term disposal of nuclear waste  the target disposal interval for the deep-borehole option is granitic rock at depths between 3 and 5 km below the surface  the feasibility of the deep-borehole option relies, in part, on designing and constructing an effective seal within the borehole to ensure that the waste package does not communicate with the shallow subsurface biosphere through the borehole itself nor through the disturbed rock zone (drz) that surrounds the borehole  |the rock melt borehole sealing concept, which consists of generating a plug from melted rock by means of a downhole heater, is a novel sealing method that has the potential to address concerns with conventional seals (namely, the ability to seal the drz and avoid degradation over long time periods)  however, both modeling results and experiment observations indicate that the extreme temperature differential has the capability to cause fracturing  thermomechanical modeling was used to identify maximum heating and cooling rates, which prevent the development of thermally induced fracturing when applied  the defined heating rates were used for laboratory-scale testing and will eventually be integrated into in situ field-scale testing of the rock melt borehole sealing system at the sanford underground research facility  this paper presents the results of the thermomechanical modeling and compares the predictions with observations and measurements from the laboratory-scale tests  |introduction |deep-borehole disposal has received increased attention in recent years as a potential strategy for the long-term disposal of nuclear waste, and numerous factors suggest that the practice is an inherently safe method of disposal (arnold et al , 2011, 2013)  the target disposal interval for the deep-borehole option is crystalline rock, which occurs at depths between 3 kilometers (km) and 5 km  |at these depths, a distrubed rock zone (drz) is expected to develop in the rock around the borehole as a result of in situ stresses and normal drilling damage  the drz consists of a zone where microfractures (which are disseminated throughout the rock mass) and macrofractures (which are essentially microfractures that have coalesced into visible features) have increased the permeability of the crystalline rock  |the feasibility of the deep-borehole concept relies, in part, on constructing an effective seal within the borehole to ensure that the waste package does not communicate with the shallow subsurface biosphere through the borehole itself nor through the drz  conventional sealing methods consist of redundant seals of cement and bentonite; however, concerns exist in regard to the ability of these methods to effectively seal the drz and the potential for seal degradation over extended time periods | 
2016-420 	 deformation properties of saw-cut fractures in barnett, mancos and pierre shales |abstract: |creating a fracture network by tensile and shear failure in rock, and keeping it conductive with proppants has been the commonly used conceptual model of designing a fracture job  the key to optimizing reservoir stimulation by shear slip is knowledge of how fracture permeability increases with slip and how the resulting unpropped conductivity evolves as the stresses (shear and normal) on the fractures change during production  such data can then be used in numerical models that consider shear slip and time-dependent unpropped conductivity loss to help design stimulation jobs that are more effective in self-propping, and retain their conductivity, thus, maximizing its benefits of ultimately needing less proppants, additives, and less water (reduced stages and re-frac)  therefore, fracture's deformation properties such as shear strength and friction are needed  in this work, we performed laboratory experiments on several shale samples from the barnett, mancos and pierre, to characterize their geomechanical properties  a multistage triaxial testing strategy was applied on saw-cut jointed shale samples to measure deformation properties, and then mohr-coulomb and barton's shear strength criteria were used to determine shear strength envelope and friction properties  |introduction |the mechanics behavior of rock is usually dominated by its discontinuities such as natural fractures, bedding planes, joints and faults, etc  as a result, fractures' deformation and failure properties are significant to engineering practices like wellbore stability and hydraulic fracturing  the natural fracture properties can be measured in two major experiments: direct shear test and triaxial shear test  direct shear test is widely used to measure the strength and stiffness properties of rock fractures (goodman, 1976; astm d5607-08, 2008), since it is easy to utilize large scale specimens at both laboratory and field site testing  however, the direct shear test has some disadvantages  for example, fractures are sheared without confinements, and the normal stress is limited by relatively low capacity of the shear apparatus, and displacement measurements are usually affected by grout deformation  the triaxial shear test can overcome some of these shortcomings as it can be conducted under confining pressure (jaeger, 1959; lane and heck, 1964; rosso, 1976; li et al , 2012)  in this test, a cylindrical specimen with an inclined fracture is subjected to a given confining pressure, and then the differential stress (<u+03c3>diff = <u+03c3>1- <u+03c3>3) is increased until slip on the weakness plane is initiated  thus, the fractures' deformation properties under confining pressure can be estimated from stress and displacement measurements | 
2016-421 	 branch line analysis of faults and fractures |abstract: |we examined branch-like fracture sets (joints, shear fractures, and faults) that occur in brittle rock layers across a range of subsurface datasets and scales  whereas fracture sets are commonly grouped by orientation in order to infer something about their genetic origin, we investigate sets that are believed to be temporally and mechanically related but vary in orientation, specifically, cases where three-dimensional projection of the planes implies hierarchical branching  examples of these features are: antithetic fault connections; splays and branches commonly found in fault zones, dynamic fracturing, and under injection conditions such as dike swarms  a new analysis method is tested to discern these features from limited sampling data using straightforward geometric relations  a computer script was written to determine all of the potential branch lines, or the intersection lines between two planes in space, along a one-dimensional scanline (e g  fractures measured along a wellbore)  the goal is to identify the spatially dependent types of intersections (a) vertical “y” shaped branches; (b) horizontal “y” shaped branches; or (c) 3d arbitrary branches  we compare a few synthetic data sets and a field data set to demonstrate the key patterns  |introduction |structural characterization in many subsurface datasets is limited by lack of three-dimensional data at the relevant scale  wellbore image logs and core provide data on fracture and fault sets at the bedding scale  seismic data can image fracture corridors and fault zones and discrete faults with larger offsets usually on the scale of features 10s of meters or larger  typically the structural style is determined from the larger scale, and the challenge is to synthesize smaller scale structures (i e  wellbore fractures) with the patterns of the larger ones  the patterns of interest to this study are genetically related fractures that are non-parallel and intersect or merge in three dimensions to form tree or branch-like hierarchical structures  |whereas the terms tree-like or branch-like describe the fracture morphology, the term branching implies the fractures are genetically related surfaces that source from, or merge at, a shared intersection  the branch line is where a master fracture or fault surface splits or branches into two or more surfaces of the same type but with different orientations  consequently, branching fractures cannot always be grouped into separate fracture sets in the usual way using orientation alone  |the study was motivated by a recent acquisition of a series of subsurface cores and image logs that penetrated several thousand individual fractures that we interpreted as branching fractures linked to a series of fracture swarms (e g , fig  1)  we present here a proposed method to help differentiate the three-dimensional nature of the branching using only limited wellbore intersection data  the method is demonstrated on synthetic and field data sets to illustrate key patterns detected from the branch line analysis technique | 
2016-423 	 exploring the link between permeability and strength evolution during fracture shearing |abstract: |the evolution of fracture permeability during shearing is crucial in defining the impact of hydraulic stimulation in geothermal and hydrocarbon reservoirs and in describing earthquake mechanisms in induced seismicity  in exploring this phenomenon we link permeability evolution to strength evolution during fracture shearing  in particular, permeability is expected to be incremented by shear-induced dilation for velocity-weakening (i e , seismic slip) rock fractures and decremented by shear-induced compaction or neutral deformation for velocity-strengthening (i e , aseismic slip) failure  to confirm our assumptions, a series of experiments are conducted in a triaxial pressure vessel, where confining pressure, pore pressure, and shearing velocity are applied independently, and the evolution of fracture permeability is concurrently monitored  we explore rock rheology through these experiments for both velocity-weakening (e g , westerly granite) and velocity-strengthening (e g , green river shale) states  the results of comparison study are different from what we expected, but are useful to link between permeability and strength evolution during fracture shearing  this concept will be, furthermore, probed by linking permeability evolution to concepts of dilation and wear recovered from rate-state characterizations of frictional behavior (see fang et al , 2016 for detail)  |introduction |fluid injection into geothermal and hydrocarbon reservoirs (i e , hydraulic stimulation) is recognized as one of the most general processes to improve or maintain the ability of reservoirs  however, at the same moment, fluid injections into underground can cause earthquakes (ellsworth, 2013; majer et al , 2007), and the construction of modeling frameworks for such induced-seismicity are desirable to determine the best scenario of fluid injection (fang et al , 2015b; norbeck et al , 2015)  |to adequately model such induced-seismicity during fluid injection or define the impact of hydraulic stimulation, mechanical property (i e , strength/friction) and hydraulic property (i e , permeability) of rock fracture during shearing are necessary to be clarified  though there are significant number of previous studies for the mechanical property (fang et al , 2015a; kohli and zoback, 2013; marone, 1998), previous studies which note on the hydraulic property are limited  although the hydraulic properties of fracture has been explored through laboratory experiments (esaki et al , 1999), numerical models (ishibashi et al , 2016) or field experiments (guglielmi et al , 2015a, 2015b), it is difficult to explain these results uniformly  specifically, in the former two studies, the effects of shearing velocity on hydraulic properties are ignored  furthermore, no discussion on the link between strength and permeability during shearing are presented | 
2016-424 	 influence of hydrostatic confining pressure on the dynamic tensile failure of rock material |abstract: |a modified split hopkinson pressure bar (shpb) system is adopted to load brazillian disc (bd) samples statically, and then exert dynamic load to the sample through stress wave generated by impact, to simulate the dynamic tensile failure process of rocks under hydrostatic confinement  five groups of samples are tested under the hydrostatic stress of 0 mpa, 5 mpa, 10 mpa, 15 mpa, and 20 mpa  the rate dependent damage model, dominant crack algorithm (dca), which is a micro-statistical crack mechanics method, is used to numerically model the failure process of the confined bd rock samples  |the testing result shows that the dynamic tensile strength of the rock increases with the hydrostatic pre-stress, which is reasonable since the confinement closes the microcracks and make it harder to break the rock samples  it is also observed that the dynamic tensile strength increases with the loading rate, revealing the rate dependency that is common for engineering materials  the modeling of the failure process matches well with the experimental results, demonstrating the applicability of the dca model in predicting the dynamic tensile failure of rock materials  |introduction |tensile failure is a main failure mode of rocks in underground rock engineering projects, in which rocks are subjected to dynamic disturbances while under in situ stresses  when disturbed by dynamic loads from blasting, seismicity, or rockbursts, the underground rocks would be vulnerable to tensile failure  even though the far-field load is compressive, the local stresses may be tensile, as shown in fig  1  from a macroscopic point of view, the bending of the roof induces tensile stress at the roof of the opening; from a microscopic view, the discontinuities in the rock result in tensile stress locally around the opening, so the dynamic tensile failure of rocks under pre-tension has been investigated by researchers [1, 2]  however, the far field rocks under hydrostatic prestress can also fail in tension under dynamic loads  therefore, it is the purpose of this paper to investigate the dynamic tensile failure of rock materials under hydrostatic prestress state | 
2016-425 	 coupled reservoir simulation of geomechanics and fluid flow in organic-rich rocks: impact of gas desorption and stress changes on permeability during depletion |abstract: |reservoir depletion results in changes in effective stresses, which may lead to significant changes in reservoir permeability  these changes are associated with matrix compaction, fracture closure and potential slip  a depletion-induced increase in effective stresses often leads to a decrease in permeability  however, the opposite is observed to happen in some fractured gas reservoirs with an organic rock matrix that exhibits strong sorption-mechanical coupling  during depletion, an adsorbed portion of the gas desorbs from micropores resulting in shrinkage of the organic components in the rock matrix, effective stress relaxation and a potential increase in fracture permeability  the objective of this study is to develop a reservoir simulator with a full mechanical coupling accounting for sorption-induced change of stresses  this paper aims to estimate the influence of the parameters affecting reservoir permeability and to predict its evolution during reservoir depletion  we compare two natural gas fields with strong (san juan coal basin) and weak (barnett shale formation) sorption-mechanical coupling  the results of the study highlight the interplay between mechanical moduli, swelling isotherm parameters, and fracture compressibility in determining the impact of desorption on fracture permeability evolution during depletion  |introduction |natural gas consumption currently constitutes a fifth of the total energy sources [1]  about a half of nonassociated gas accrues to non-conventional gas reservoirs, mainly organic shales and coal seams [1]  non-conventional tight reservoirs have an extremely low permeability, a fair portion of which pertains to fractures as main fluid conduits  the openings of these fractures are dictated by lithology and the reservoir stresses, which may alter during reservoir development [2-5]  two competitive geomechanical processes are known to affect stresses during depletion in organic-rich rocks: pressure drawdown and desorption-induced shrinkage  the latter is of significant importance in coals because sorbed gas constitutes more than 50% of total gas in place and desorption induces a substantial amount of rock shrinkage [6-8]  sorbed gas in hydrocarbon-bearing shales constitutes 5-15% of the total gas in place  sorption capacity is usually proportional to total organic carbon (toc) in shales [9]  decreases in pore pressure associated with reservoir depletion cause increases in effective stresses, which often leads to fracture closure and a decrease in permeability  in contrast, desorption and matrix shrinkage result in a drop in effective stresses and an increase in permeability [8, 10, 11] | 
2016-427 	 impact of flow regimes on coal fines generation during coal seam gas production process |abstract: |this study presents the development and application of a fully coupled numerical model that integrates different flow regimes and the generation of coal fines  the scanning electron microscopy (sem) was employed to obtain coal cleat geometry at the micro-scale  based on the real cleat geometry, the phase field method (pfm) was used to simulate the two-phase flow and the combination of shear and tensile failure criteria was selected to evaluate the generation of coal fines  the results reveal that more coal fines are generated in two-phase flow than single-phase flow  for the two-phase flow conditions, residual displaced phase is observed inside the micro-roughness of coal cleat  majority of coal fines are generated in these regions due to the substantial pressure force induced by significant pressure difference between the trapped phase and the invading phase  coal wettability plays an important role in coal fines generation  using the wetting phase as the injection phase will produce one order of magnitude more coal fines than that from the other way  moreover, the change of fluid phase inside the cleat can create considerable pressure fluctuations up to several kpa, which is not favorable in managing the production of coal fines  |introduction |the life of a coal seam gas (csg) well can be divided into three stages: (1) dewatering; (2) stable production and (3) decline (moore, 2012)  with respect to the flow regimes during these stages, it can be categorized into four groups, namely water flow, gas flow, gas-drive-water and water-drive-gas flows  coal seams are initially saturated with water under high pressure condition  the high water pressure locks csg in coal matrices as adsorption state (gilman and beckie, 2000)  therefore, little gas is produced during the early dewatering stage, and the flow inside coal seams is regarded as single water phase flow  as coal seams are progressively dewatered, at the late stage of the dewatering process, csg production begins to accelerate while water production starts to decline, thereby, the flow is considered as gas-drive-water two-phase flow till the early stable production stage (saghafi et al , 2014b)  when the csg production enters the late stable production stage, single gas phase flow occurs in coal seams, since water is mostly exhausted  it is also the case throughout the decline stage of csg production (moore, 2012)  additionally, in the dewatering and the stable production phases, pressure transient testing may be conducted in place to obtain dynamic reservoir data, which is frequently associated with well shut-in (chen et al , 2015)  during well shut-in, the build-up of water level and pressure may cease the desorption process, forming the water-drive-gas flow regime in coal seams  based on these statements, the flow regimes can be summarized in fig  1 | 
2016-428 	 use of coupled geomechanics and fluid flow model for optimization of multistage hydraulic fracturing and horizontal wells in enhanced geothermal system applications |abstract: |a coupled geomechanics and fluid flow model with commercial hydraulic fracturing component was used in a geothermal research study allowing the creation of complex fracture network in the presence of largely distributed natural fractures  the role of in-situ stress state, discrete fracture network, fracturing fluid and proppant properties have been investigated for an enhanced geothermal system (egs) feasibility study  modeling results indicated that when designing for egs wells, the connectivity between the hydraulic fractures and natural fractures for sustaining the desired heat production in the egs operations was greatly depended on the unique reservoir characteristics of geothermal formations, including lithology, in-situ stress state, pore pressure and natural fracture characteristics such as fracture orientation as well as proper fracturing fluid viscosity, proppant concentration, pump rate, and well spacing  |introduction |the 2015 annual u s  and global geothermal power production report indicates that the united states constructed more than 38 geothermal power projects adding nearly 700 megawatts (mw) to the u s  electricity capacity  majority of the power had been produced in california  the geothermal industry had approximately 3 5 gigawatts (gw) of installed nameplate capacity and 2 7 gw of net capacity in the us by 2014 while the global market for geothermal industry in 2015 was at about 12 8 gw of operating capacity in 24 countries (gea, 2015)  |when compared to the commercialized energy sources like shale gas and tight oil in the unconventional industry, it is still not economical enough to exploit heat from these hot, ultra-low permeability formations without applying certain stimulation technologies (tester, 2016)  therefore, the enhanced geothermal systems (egs) is being developed to enhance the produced heat energy from the unconventional geothermal resources, even those with hard, hot rocks with almost no heated fluid inside  using stimulation technologies such as multi-stage hydraulic fracturing and horizontal well completion, egs would expand the geothermal powering capabilities to larger extent  |in order for an effective use of the same technologies in enhanced geothermal system applications, engineers have to implement the different formation characteristics of egs compared with that in unconventional oil and gas reservoirs  these differences include reservoir lithology, formation temperature, pore pressure, in situ stress states and operational parameter variations resulted from various fracturing fluids, proppants, pumping rates, and well spacing during the treatment operations  moreover, in unconventional tight oil and shale gas operations, permeable conduits are created through the hydraulic fracturing operations in order to connect the existing natural fractures and pore space together for production pathways inside the formation matrix; while heat exchange inside the geothermal system needs to be established between the injected fluid and the heated formations through the conducted conduit  the effectiveness of the heat exchange in geothermal system depends on the total heat extracting volume among heat bearing matrixes and cold injected fluids under a reasonable flow rate throughout the production life | 
2016-429 	 rock brittleness capacity upon compressive fracture energy dissipation to assess drilling efficiency |abstract: |rock drilling is essential in the mining industry  complexities involved in the drilling process encompassing not only rock properties but also the nature of the drilling action impact the drilling performance and operational costs  brittleness is a fundamental rock property relevant to rock drilling and excavation works  however, rock brittleness is a concept yet to be investigated  in this study, a new brittleness index developed upon fracture energy quantities withdrawn from the complete stress-strain characteristics in uniaxial compression of rock is presented  a vast independent data on the drilling performance reported elsewhere in the literature was evaluated against the new brittleness index  the results show that the proposed brittleness index successfully describes the performance of different drilling methods including pdc (polycrystalline diamond compact) rotary drilling, roller-cone rotary drilling and percussive drilling  |introduction |drilling performance is one of the most important parameters to take into account when evaluating project feasibility and economy in the mining and mineral exploration industry  in this sense, several attempts have been made to assess drilling performance by correlating different rock mechanical and physical properties with the drilling performance including rock texture, grain size, density, p-wave velocity, unconfined compressive strength (ucs), mohs hardness and rock mass structural parameters (altindag, 2003; altindag, 2009; hoseinie et al , 2008; taheri et al , 2016)  however, a generalised method to relate drilling performance with rock strength characteristics has not been developed yet  this is due to the complexity of interactions among the variables involved in the drilling process encompassing not only rock properties, but also the nature of drilling  in this view, by coupling relevant drilling parameters with relevant rock properties, a reliable drilling performance prediction method can be developed  |on one hand, to predict rock drilling performance and optimisation of drilling operation, tool-rock interaction laws, i e  the relations between forces acting on the tool in contact with rock, are essential (detournay and defourny, 1992; detournay et al , 2008; franca, 2010, 2011; franca et al , 2015; hustrulid and fairhurst, 1971a, 1972a; hustrulid and fairhurst, 1971b, 1972b)  on the other hand, there is not a unique criterion able to describe rock brittleness quantitatively nor consensus about the most suitable and reliable brittleness index to apply to different rock engineering works encountered in the field  for instance, previously a number of different criteria to assess rock brittleness developed upon prepeak stress-strain characteristics in uniaxial compression (hucka and das, 1974; kidybinski, 1981) and upon rock compressive strength, ucs, and tensile strength, ts, (altindag, 2002; hucka and das, 1974; kahraman, 2002), are not able describe a scale of brittleness to ductility of rock at all (munoz et al , 2016a; tarasov and potvin, 2013; tarasov and randolph, 2011) | 
2016-430 	 a comparison of short-term and long-term creep experiments in unconventional reservoir formations |abstract: |the goal of this study was to compare constitutive parameters derived from short-term (four hour) and long-term (several-week) creep experiments  we conducted a series of creep experiments on clay and carbonate-rich shale samples from unconventional gas and oil reservoirs at room temperature, principally on samples from the haynesville and eagle ford formations  samples with different mineralogies were subjected to a series of multi-stage loading/creep, unloading/recovery cycles conducted over different time spans  all creep stages of the experiments were performed at a constant differential stress level; only the testing time of each creep/recovery stage was varied  following sone and zoback (jour  petrol  sci  and eng , 2014), a power-law creep model was used to obtain the creep constitutive parameters  results of these experiments show that the shale samples follow the same creep trend through time, regardless of the loading history  also, we show that the simple power-law model is capable of describing creep over multiple time periods  using this model, we are able to characterize viscoplastic behavior of shale rocks from relatively short-term (1 day) creep experiments  |introduction |a common challenge in laboratory creep studies is to know how long laboratory experiments need to be carried out to accurately measure the parameters that make it possible to predict rock deformation over relatively long periods of time  this time-dependent deformation affects mechanical and flow properties of sedimentary rocks [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  initial laboratory studies of viscoplatic deformation were carried out via uniaxial and triaxial creep experiments [7, 8, 9, 10]  because of the time-consuming nature of these experiments, relatively few papers have addressed this topic  |in this paper we carried out a series of creep experiments on shale samples with various amounts of carbonate and clay to investigate the constitutive law and creep parameters obtained in loading steps ranging from several hours to several weeks  we extend the comprehensive short-term (several hour) creep experiments reported by sone and zoback (2014) who investigated the role of clay and organic content on viscous deformation of shales from unconventional gas reservoirs [11]  they used a relatively simple (two parameter) power-law model to fit the data  |several mechanisms have been proposed to explain low temperature creep in sedimentary rocks  although peterson and wong (2004) argue that the deformation of rocks at temperatures below 1200 k can generally be considered brittle [12], other studies have shown that it is possible to observe inelasic deformation of rocks at lower temperatures due to mechanical compaction processes [13]  for example, sone and zoback (2014) argued that the time-dependent deformation they observed was accommodated by changes in the pore volume | 
2016-434 	 lessons from larger than expected subsidence due to production of halite and natural gas in fryslan |abstract: |halite solution mining and natural gas production in the west of the province of fryslan in the netherlands cause subsidence significantly exceeding original predictions  subsidence at the centre of the salt subsidence bowl reached 33 cm in 2015 while only 7 cm had been predicted in the 1995 forecast  maximum subsidence above the nearby harlingen gas field was around 33 cm in 2015 compared to 10 cm in the 2003 forecast for the end of field life  in addition, subsidence accelerated over time  from the regulator's point of view, the development of the discrepancies was unacceptable and led to an early reassessment of the salt mining project and to suspension of the gas production by the operator in 2008  extensive research into the causes of the exceedances was able to provide a proper explanation for both occurrences  for the salt solution mining, cavern convergence rates at the in-situ stresses and temperatures at the depth of the project are much higher than initially estimated  this leads to a different production mechanism (squeeze mining), which gives much more subsidence  after convergence and subsidence modelling were corrected for this in 1998, predicted and observed subsidence are in much better agreement  the additional and accelerating subsidence above the harlingen gas field can only be explained by pore-collapse of the gas-bearing reservoir chalk  during the laboratory compaction tests used for the original subsidence predictions, pore collapse only occurred at stress levels beyond those possible in-situ  the explanation for the inconsistency was found to be the strong impact of loading rate on the pore-collapse stress level  the applicability of an existing rate type compaction model for the harlingen chalk was confirmed by new variable loading rate laboratory experiments  using the model to translate the laboratory measured pore-collapse stresses into values applicable under field conditions, a much better agreement with the observed field behaviour was obtained  the harlingen case thus provides further evidence that the large influence of loading rate on the chalk pore collapse stress seen during laboratory experiments applies down to field loading rates and that corrections for this need to be applied in compaction and subsidence forecasts | 
2016-437 	 modernized mechanical testing of kerogen-rich shales (krs) by monitoring in situ microscale tensile failures |abstract: |the nanoindenter has recently been expanded as a method to monitor the tensile failures of krs, by loading and failing micro-cantilever geometries  existing methods have not identified the micro effects of the interlacing kerogen into the overall clay and non-clay matrices  here we demonstrate a sophisticated tool for mechanically characterizing krs in that it accounts for contributions from both the rock and the organic matter  micro-beams are manufactured with a focused ion beam under a scanning electron microscope (fib-sem) and then loaded in cantilever mode with a nanoindenter while monitoring in-situ via sem  the force-displacement curves were analyzed in light of the high resolution images collected during fracture initiation, propagation, and ultimate failure  under loading, the micro-beams exhibit linear elastic behavior followed by plastic yielding before complete failure  this behavior has been shown to correlate with the amount of organic matter in the failure zone of the cantilever beam  |introduction |mechanical characterization of source rock reservoirs such as shales is of primary interest to the oil and gas industry as it seeks to optimize hydraulic fracturing operations  this porous granular material has proven a complicated specimen for mechanical studies due to its high degree of porosity, its silt-sized quartz and other hard mineral particles, and the sea of nanoscale clay platelets that creates an encompassing matrix [1, 2]  shale is a transverse isotropic material [3] whose bedding planes result from the mode of deposition during sedimentation  |the tensile strength of rocks is an important mechanical parameter for hydraulic fracturing design  during the fluid treatment, the pore pressure is increased by injecting fluid under high pressure into the formation  the pump pressure is raised until the formation breakdown pressure is achieved and the fracture initiates  as many laboratory experiments have demonstrated, the tensile strength influences the formation breakdown pressure [4]  classical macroscale testing methods based on isrm standards have been established for determining this rock tensile strength [5]  for example, the brazilian test proposed in 1943 by carneiro is still widely used to indirectly determine the tensile strength of rocks, concrete, etc  [6]  |however, these methods were not able to capture the true tensile behavior of the kerogen-rich shales (krs) in source rock reservoirs  kerogen is the hydrocarbon source material which is interbedded and interlaced with the clay and non-clay mineral matrix on the micro- and nanoscales [7]  the kerogen content varies from one shale source to the next, and the trace levels present in kerogen-free shales (kfs) have no observable effect upon the mechanical properties  rather, the anisotropic mechanical properties of kfs were determined by nanoindentation to be governed by packing density, porosity, and the stiffness of the various components [8]  some success has been seen using the nanoindenter to determine the mechanical properties of krs [9, 10]  these small scale measurements were able to isolate the elastic properties of kerogen from the surrounding minerals [9] |

2016-441 	 improvements in data collection for geotechnical pit slope stability assessment |abstract: |application of downhole geophysical logging techniques, specifically acoustic televiewer (atv) and sonic logging, is used to significantly enhance pit slope stability assessment for proposed or expanding open pit and quarry mining operations  acquisition of discontinuity orientation data required for slope stability assessment using downhole geophysical techniques is faster, more accurate, and significantly less expensive than acquisition via oriented core drilling  as a result of the cost effectiveness, additional data can be collected to provide a more thorough understanding of spatial variations in discontinuity patterns throughout a proposed open pit mine area  discontinuity data can be collected utilizing rotary and reverse circulation drilling methods, reducing the need for expensive, time-consuming core drilling  the speed of the data acquisition using down-hole geophysical methods in rotary holes, as compared to acquisition via oriented core, can eliminate interruptions to mining operations  data collected via atv logging is coupled with in-pit observations and, if available, core data resulting in fast, cost-effective stability evaluation  field data collection involves drilling and geophysical logging of holes, geologic and discontinuity mapping by geologists, and collection of core or rock samples for laboratory analysis  the data collected is utilized to conduct both deterministic and probabilistic assessment of kinematic and overall slope stability conditions  |introduction |relatively recent slope failures have increased attention, including that of regulatory agencies, to slope stability assessment in open pit mines  generally speaking, drilling efforts often understandably focus on exploration of an ore body  such practices often produce geologic models that define the ore body very well, but that contain very little to no geotechnical (and sometimes even geological) data with regard to the expected pit wall rock  geotechnical data can be collected via mapping by geologists in excavated areas, but open pit mine mapping is often limited due to ongoing operations and potentially unsafe access conditions  additionally, the only way to assess the geotechnical aspects of proposed pit walls in unmined areas (expansion or new mining) is via drilling  |downhole geophysical logging tools have been used for geotechnical characterization of rock and subsurface conditions associated with mining and non-mining applications for many decades  examples include road cut slope stability assessment [1], fractured rock aquifer flow assessment [2], and fracture delineation for tunneling [3]  specific to mining, the technology has been successfully utilized to collect geotechnical data in numerous hard rock, coal, and aggregate mining scenarios in both the eastern and western united states | 
2016-442 	 support design and mining practices in bad ground conditions: a case of zimbabwe room and pillar mining |abstract: |good support design is of paramount importance in a bid to mitigate rockfalls  most platinum mines using room and pillar method have failed to reach the target milestones of zero harm due to the presence of geological discontinuities  geological discontinuities along the great dyke of zimbabwe comprise of shear zones, sympathetic joints together with dykes  the prevailing geological structures have led to a decrease in productivity and challenges of support failure  virtuous mining practices together with good support design will lead to an improved productivity, less operating costs and improved safety  the need to improve the key performance indicators led to the compulsion for this research to be conducted based on support design and mining practices in bad ground conditions  geological data and geotechnical data were obtained from a zimbabwean platinum mine  it was clinched that the presence of shear zones deteriorated the rock mass which have led to the unpredictable unravelling of the rocks  the current support systems as well as the mining practices were analyzed and benchmarked  empirical support designs together with numerical modelling were used to design optimum support system  support design encompasses regional support of pillars and local support of roofbolts  various rock mass classification methods were used to get the quality of the rock  from the analysis of the current support systems used, it was noted that the current support systems together with mining practices need to be adjusted for sustainable operations  furthermore, the current mining practices need to be revised since the use of anfo explosive results in excessive bad hangings, stoping overbreak and increased costs  the bords currently mined gave a shorter stand-up time which again compromises safety  pillars need to be redesigned together with the implementation of a new roofbolt system to improve both productivity and safety  optimum pillar design which gave the prime extraction ratio without compromising safety was proposed  |introduction |upright support design and sound mining practices warrants economic and sustainable mining operations  this research makes a crucial review of the current support systems used in bad ground conditions at a zimbabwean platinum mine  the area of research is sited on the great dyke of zimbabwe and is infested by faults and sympathetic joints  platinum group elements (pges) are the primary metals exploited and base metals are also recovered  the orebody is shallow having a maximum depth of 250m  the zimbabwean great dyke is the second leading reserve of pges following the south african bushveld complex (oberthur et al [7])  the comprehensive section of the great dyke is virtually a bowl shaped which encompasses strata that are dipping towards the axis  the dyke encompasses for about 550km having a maximum width of 11km (prendergast [8])  the mineralized sulphide zone (msz) contains the minerals of interest and the economic thickness averages 2m  the host rock of minerals is pyroxenite which is sandwiched by bronzitite and websterite  the average dip of the reef is 11 degrees  figure 1 shows the cross sectional view of the strata | 
2016-444 	 importance of fluid compressibility and multi-phase flow in numerical modeling of hydraulic fracture propagation |abstract: |we evaluate the validity of the two assumptions on hydraulic fracture propagation  we employ the semi-analytical approach in modeling of coupled flow and geomechanics, where flow is solved numerically, whereas geomechanics is solved analytically  we first model a pkn hydraulic fracture geometry numerically and incorporate the fluid compressibility term in order to investigate the effect of the fluid compressibility in hydraulic fracture geometry evolution  the results show that as the fluid becomes compressible, the fracture propagation is delayed because it takes time for pressure to be built up to extend the fracture  in multi-phase flow system, we model a hydraulic fracturing process in a gas reservoir by solving flow numerically yet geomechanics analytically  the fracture propagates slowly when water saturation of the reservoir is low  this implies high initial gas saturation, resulting in high total compressibility of reservoir fluid  we observe the gas concentration at near fracture tip, caused by (1) the movement of initial gas within the fracture to the fracture tip and (2) the possibility of the leakage of gas from the formation to the hydraulic fracture  this existence of gas is another factor that can lead fluid flow within the hydraulic fracture to be compressible  |introduction |the scientific community has taken several assumptions in the study of hydraulic fracturing  for example, one of the assumptions is to ignore the effects of fluid compressibility by assuming the fluid to be incompressible, which is the main assumption used to derive the analytical solutions of the hydraulic fracturing problem  but, considering the stiffness of a typical rock and the stiffness of the injected fluid (e g  water), fluid compressibility cannot be ignored  furthermore, when the injected fluid is gas, such as nitrogen and carbon dioxide, the fluid compressibility must be considered to account for the geomechanical changes in the reservoirs  another common assumption is to disregard the reservoir gas that is going to infiltrate the hydraulic fracture from the reservoir formation during hydraulic fracturing operations, whereas the leak-off from the fracture into the reservoir is usually considered  however, some studies have indicated that the existence of a gap between the fracture tip and the water front is possible (i e  vacuum area [1])  this gap implies the possibility of the leakage of shale gas from the formation into the hydraulic fracture  |in order to investigate the importance of fluid compressibility in the hydraulic fracturing process, we first focus on modeling a perkins-kern-nordgen fracture geometry which is first introduced by perkins and kern [2] and further improved by nordgren [3]  a pkn geometry has been considered to be physically acceptable in a sense that the fracture length is larger than its height, which is one of the primary assumptions of the geometry  we derive mass balance equations assuming the fluid is not incompressible to incorporate fluid compressibility term in the equations  we then validate our numerical modeling by comparing the numerical results with analytical solutions, taking zero compressibility | 
2016-445 	 stability analysis and preliminary support design for longhole stoping prefeasibility study of a greenfield platinum project |abstract: |rock mechanics and rock engineering are disciplines that deal with the study of rock behavior and the design of stable excavations  the design should evaluate the risks associated with excavations developed in the rock  the aim of this study was to ensure that harmful effects of rockfalls and rockbursts are minimized through designing of stable excavations  the research was conducted at a greenfield platinum project  the mining method used for this prefeasibility study is longhole stoping  the depth of operations ranges from 600m to 1100m  geological structures present include faults, joints and shear zones  the host rock is dominantly pyroxenite which is a competent rock  excavations that need to be supported include stopes, development tunnels, drifts and shafts  rock mass classification methods were used in a bid to quantify the quality of the rock mass  geotechnical data was used to propose a preliminary support design at prefeasibility stage of the project  both empirical and numerical methods were used for stability evaluation to inform reliable support design  prefeasibility studies of this nature are crucial as they guide financial decisions on whether or not to commit more resources for further detailed investigation  |introduction |prefeasibility studies normally utilize low cost technology to assess the viability of a project and hence determine if further detailed work on a project is economically justified  amongst crucial aspects of a prefeasibility study are the investigations into stability of excavations and the accompanying support design, the anchors of safety in underground mines  this paper seeks to describe the geotechnical environment together with rock engineering requirements and design for a south african platinum mine greenfield project  the paper will give a brief geology, rock mass classification methods, analysis together with support design and risk assessment of the project  |geology |the project area is located in the northern limb of the bushveld complex in south africa  the orebody varies in thickness and lithology  the rocktypes present include pyroxenites, norites, chromitites, gabbronorites and harzburgites  the mining depth varies from 600m to 1100m  in the project area, low amplitude folds exist  the presence of upthrow fault and rolls weakens the ground conditions  there are also sympathetic joints present with altered orientations and dips  two main aquifers exist in the research area, alluvial and the rustenburg layered  hydrological survey shows that there is less groundwater hence less effect in cohesion  the joint water reduction factor was therefore considered to be one  various measures will be put into place in problematic areas such as regions truncated by faults | 
2016-446 	 methods for fem stress initialization based on stress functions, and application to a reservoir cross-section |abstract: |an accurate description of the in-situ stress field in a rock mass is crucial in different areas of geo-engineering such as: underground excavations, hydrocarbon extraction, co2 storage, hydraulic fracture etc  in this paper, a novel methodology to numerically generate the in-situ stress state within the finite elements framework is presented  it involves two steps: 1) an estimate of the stress components is given for integration point of the discretization, and 2) global equilibrium is verified and re-balancing nodal forces are applied if needed  while the second step is a closed procedure based only on statics, the estimate of the in-situ stress field can be done in different ways in order to incorporate all the information available of the rock mass  in this paper, more traditional approaches are discussed and a new procedure based on the airy stress function is described, in order to generate a stress state proposal at each gauss point of the domain  finally, the performance of different approaches is illustrated with a reservoir example  |introduction |a rock mass or any geological material that is located at a certain depth is subjected to an in-situ stress field  this stress field is the result not only of the geometry and weight of the geologic structure but also of a non-trivial geologic history  this history may include complex phenomena such as deposition, compaction, erosion or tectonic events  |gravitational stresses are induced by the weight of the overburden, and often the vertical (or z) axis is a principal stress direction, while the other two principal stresses are contained in the horizontal plane (xy)  tectonic stresses may be the result of the tectonic movements at local or regional scale  the residual stresses are produced by strain energy locked-in in the rock from previous processes such as burial, lithification, denudation, heating and cooling  according to friedman, 1972 a fraction of these residual stresses persist even after the rock is freed from boundary loads  when the in-situ stresses at a site are measured using any of the techniques available, the stress measure obtained includes the contributions from all those origins combined | 
2016-447 	 numerical modeling of microearthquakes by using coupled geomechanics simulation for planar fracture propagation |abstract: |we modeled microearthquakes (meqs) for tensile failure of vertical fracture propagation by combining geophysics, flow, and geomechanics simulators while accounting for poromechanical effects  each time fracturing occurred, we calculated the seismic moment tensor from the obtained displacement field and newly fractured area  then, using this information, we modeled intensity, location, number of the events, and time of meqs  we simulated various scenarios, taking single phase flow (i e , water) in order to remove complex responses from multiphase flow  we first studied a synthetic reservoir having one single shale layer with two strong bounding layers and a horizontal well  the simulated meqs reflected the propagation of the hydraulic fracture, where the magnitudes of most meqs were between -1 and -3  then, we simulated a vertical well in the more realistic geological model of the arch forth-worth basin, where the barnett shale is located  we studied two scenarios: one in which the fluid was injected into the lower barnett shale and it only fractured into the injected layer, and one in which there was fluid migration from the injection point into the upper barnett shale  the magnitudes of meq for these two scenarios were similar and mostly between -0 75 and 0 75 in strength  for all cases, the event locations of meqs corresponded to the fracture propagation  thus, the forward simulation of microearthquakes can be a useful to detect propagation of hydraulic fractures and stimulated reservoir volume  additionally, we showed that under some reservoir conditions it is possible for fluid to fracture layers above the injection point without fracturing the targeted layer  |introduction |hydraulic fracturing has revolutionized the energy industry for the last decade  this process entails pumping large amounts of sand and water down a well, where the increase in pressure creates a network of fractures that allow petroleum engineers to access trapped hydrocarbons  the operation is poorly understood, so the development of successful hydraulic fracturing methods has been too often a trial and error process  this poses monetary and environmental risks, and a general sense of mistrust towards the oil and gas industry  however, the basics of hydraulic fracturing dictates that a large planar fracture is created in a direction perpendicular to the minimum horizontal stress  in addition to this, a significant number of shear failures (micro-earthquakes) are generated in the surrounding intact reservoir rock [1]  furthermore, depending on the reservoir on which it is performed, hydraulic fracturing can cause fault reactivation and shear slip of existing natural fractures [2, 3]  |the simultaneous combination of these phenomena makes the physics of the problem a difficult subject to study  nevertheless, because the failure induced by perturbation of fluid pressure implies strong interaction between flow and geomechanics [4], we employed a coupled simulator to accurately predict and assess any risk derived from hydraulic fracturing a vertical well | 
2016-448 	 application of electrical and electromagnetic geophysical methods for detecting hydraulically-active fractured zones |abstract: |we perform coupled flow-geomechanics-electrical/electromagnetic (em) modeling and examine the feasibility of surface-based electrical/em methods for detecting hydraulically-active fractured zones in depth  we employ the finite element methods for geomechanics and electrical/em modeling, while the finite volume method is used for flow modeling  after converting flow-geomechanics models to conductivity models via a rock physics relationship, we show that anomalous distribution of electrical conductivity is directly related to injected water saturation, implying that em responses are directly sensitive to hydraulically-active fractured zones  in our modeling experiments, we inject saline water that has high concentration of nacl, to enhance em signals associated with the hydraulically-active fractured zones  by using a steel-cased injection well though which surface electrical sources directly charge saline-water-saturated fracture zones, we demonstrate that surface electrical/em methods can identify the difference in the electric fields between with and without the hydraulic fracture  thus, this measurable difference implies that the electrical and em methods can be an important complementary tool to detect and image propagation of a large hydraulic fracture  |introduction |micro-earthquake (meq) monitoring has mainly been studied for imaging fractures and fluids [1, 2]  meq provides general information about locations of fracturing events  however, the mapping highly depends on initial velocity models which we do not know well, leaving uncertainties in the amount of correlation with the areas that are hydraulically active [3]  the magnitudes of meq are often too small to be reliably recorded in practice  more importantly, meq monitoring does not accurately indicate if the fluid pathways remain open after the injection stops  electrical/electromagnetic (em) geophysical methods have a potential to complement meq because they are be sensitive to fluids in pores and fractures, and have potential to provide independent information about fluid flow associated with hydraulic fracturing  |in this study, we investigate detectability of electrical/em methods for fracture propagation induced by water-based hydraulic fracturing (hf)  the goal of this study is to evaluate em geophysical methods for detecting hydraulically-active fractured zones in hf operations  for the goal, we use the 3d finite element method (fem) for geomechanics, taking linear elastic fracture mechanics, while the 3d finite volume method (fvm) is used for flow [4]  we also employ 3d fem for dc and diffusive em modeling [5], which can accurately and economically handle irregular fractured zones not conforming to rectangular cartesian grids  while fracture propagates, hydrological and petrophysical parameters (e g  saturations of native and invaded fluids, changes in pore volume and aperture) that are computed by coupled flow-geomechanical simulation are transformed via a rock-physics model into electrical conductivity models | 
2016-449 	 numerical investigation of potential cement failure along the wellbore and gas leak during hydraulic fracturing of shale gas reservoirs |abstract: |we investigated wellbore stability during hydraulic fracturing using the mohr-coulomb failure model and an intrinsic permeability step function for failure status  in order to assess the risk of failure, we varied the values of bottom-hole pressure, permeability multipliers for our permeability step function, and the cohesion values between the well casing and the surrounding cement to represent different quality levels of the cementing operation  additionally, we studied shear failure for a homogeneous and a heterogeneous three shale layer reservoir  from numerical results, higher bottom-hole pressures increased the fracture propagation speed because it implied higher geomechanical loading  furthermore, a higher permeability multiplier leads to a larger failed zone because higher permeabilities pressurize the failed zone faster  also, simulations showed that there is very little fracturing when the cement is of high quality  on the other hand, incomplete cementing and/or weak cement can cause significant shear failure and the evolution of long fractures along the vertical well, where they become a factor for potential contamination of aquifers  moreover, simulations of heterogeneous shale reservoir showed how mechanical properties of the reservoir rock can help resist shear failure of the wellbore  finally, a coupling strength sensitivity analysis of the steel-cement interface layer demonstrated that higher coupling strengths induce shear failure  thus, high-quality cement, complete cementing, strong formation rock properties along the vertical well, and low poromechanical effects between fluid and geomechanics appears to be the strongest protection against shear failure of the wellbore cement and contamination hazards to water aquifers during hydraulic fracturing  |introduction |the combination of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing can extract enormous quantities of natural gas from previously thought uneconomic reservoirs [1], making shale gas production an important energy resource of the future [2, 3]  however, the extreme low permeability of the shale gas reservoirs requires hydraulic fracturing to enhance productivity [4, 5]  at the same time, environmental impacts induced by hydraulic fracturing have been raised, for example, contamination of ground water, unstable growth of hydraulic fractures, seismic risks, reactivation of existing faults, and soil contamination due to proppant chemicals [6]  the potential environmental impacts have had a negative influence on public opinion, which is curbing and even halting the american shale gas revolution in its tracks  |dusseault et al  (2001) [7] studied compaction-induced shear failure of vertical wells by fluid production  shear failure is one of the typical mechanisms of well instability  incomplete cementing between the well and reservoir formations is considered one of the highest environmental risks of ground water contamination, as well as a catalyst for wellbore failure [6, 8]  pressurization at the bottom of the well causes high shear stress along the vertical well and can result in shear slip at the contacting area between the well casing and the cemented zone if the contacting area is poorly cemented  cracks from shear failure along the well can be a potential pathway connecting deep shale gas reservoirs to shallow aquifers with higher permeability | 
2016-450 	 rigorous modeling of coupled flow and geomechanics in largely deformable anisotropic geological systems |abstract: |we propose and investigate formulation and numerical simulation for largely deformable anisotropic reservoirs in this study  we employ the total lagrangian method (tl) for coupled flow and geomechanics, which does not need to update the coordinate system each time step  the use of the deformation gradient as well as the first and second piola stresses reflects the change of reservoir configuration, being mathematically equivalent to the updated lagrangian method  to accurately model full-tensor permeability derived from the piola transformation in permeability, we use the multi-point flux approximation (mpfa)  the total lagrangian method with mpfa can provide high accurate and rigorous modeling  we thus consider the total lagrangian method with mpfa as the reference method in this study  then, we compare it with two other methods: total lagrangian method with the two-point flux approximation (tpfa) and infinitesimal transformation assumption with tpfa  from numerical simulation, we find differences between the reference method and the other two methods  displacement based on the assumption of the infinitesimal transformation is different from that of the total lagrangian method  also, we find that volumetric strain and pressure of tl-mpfa are different from those of tl-tpfa  as the anisotropy ratio of permeability increases, the errors between mpfa and tpfa increases  |introduction |small deformation (i e , infinitesimal transformation) is typically assumed in reservoir geomechanics [1, 2, 3, 4]  this assumption is usually valid in reservoir engineering problems associated with rock, which induce small deformation  however, the assumption might be invalid in largely deformable reservoirs, such as oceanic gas hydrate deposits and fractured/crashed salt domes [5, 6]  anisotropic reservoirs are profoundly sensitive to substantial changes in reservoir configuration, having full-tensor permeability and elastic moduli during deformation  this causes non-orthogonal grids in flow  however, the modeling of largely deformable anisotropic reservoirs has little been investigated  |in this study, we employ the total lagrangian method for coupled flow and geomechanics  the coordinate system remained fixed both for flow and geomechanics  instead, the deformation gradient reflects the change of reservoir configuration, which yields mathematical equivalence to the updated lagrangian method [7, 8, 9]  the total lagrangian method also induces full-tensor permeability from the piola transformation, even if the initial permeability tensor is diagonal [11]  to accurately model full-tensor permeability, we use the multi-point flux approximation (mpfa) [12]  then, the total lagrangian method with mpfa can provide high accurate and rigorous modeling, honoring the objective stress rates (i e , lie derivatives)  we thus consider the total lagrangian method with mpfa as the reference model in this study | 
2016-451 	 modelling of a drill bit blaster |abstract: |the drill bit blaster (dbb) studied in this paper aims to maximize drilling rate by creating drilling fluid pulsation, which could lead to lower drill string friction, more efficient removal of cuttings underneath the bit and increased nozzle fluid pressure and velocity; all of which could ultimately lead to more efficient cutting and transport of cuttings while drilling  a testing procedure was established in order to measure the fluid pulsations in above ground testing and to create a repeatable method of testing further designs  an analytical model was created in an attempt to predict and describe the pulsation pressure characteristics as a function of operating conditions and internal geometry and compared against experimental results  the results indicated that internal tool design and operating conditions have a significant effect on the pulsation frequency and amplitude  application of this technology in future designs could allow the bit pressure oscillation frequency and amplitude to be optimized with regard to the lithology of the formations being drilled  this could lead to faster, more efficient drilling which could cut drilling costs and lead to a larger number of oil and natural gas plays being profitable  |introduction |motivation |recovering oil and natural gas resources is an efficiency driven process  often the rate of penetration (rop) of drilling bottlenecks the entire process so it is of significant interest within industry to find methods of improving the overall rop of drilling operations  the drill bit studied in this paper creates a pulsating pressure variation within the body of the drill bit by periodically opening then restricting the drilling fluid flow to nozzles, which run through the bit face  these pulsations could lead to an improved rop through several mechanisms that have been demonstrated to independently increase drilling rop in laboratory and field testing  often there is a difficulty in communicating the surface weight on bit (wob) down hole through the drill string to the bit, which reduces the overall rop as well as introduces uncertainty in surface measurements  barton et al  (2011) recently demonstrated that by creating low frequency vibrations in the drill string the bit life can be extended, better tool face control maintained and drilling rop increased  during testing the dbb created similar magnitude low frequency vibrations due to the changing fluid paths and flow areas through nozzles in the bit  the slightly outward nozzle orientation from the centerline of the bit resulted in force generation along the axial and transverse axis similar to the design tested by barton et al  (2011)  the second rop improvement mechanism is due to improved efficiency of bit face cleaning and due to the vibrations created by the pressure pulsation  lianggang et al  (2015) showed that the greatest benefit of vibration while drilling occurs when the vibration frequency of the bit approaches the resonant frequency of the substrate being drilled  and while the resonant frequency of typical drilling substrates is orders of magnitude above those of the dbb vibration frequency there was still an improvement demonstrated for vibration frequencies far below the resonant frequency  one of the most problematic rop reducing drilling phenomenon, which occurs primarily in deep wells, is known as the confinement or chip-hold down effect and can decrease the rop to a fraction of the rate seen during shallow drilling  in deep wells the intense pressure imposed by the drilling fluid column on the bottom of the borehole confines the drilling substrate causing it to become much harder and more difficult to drill  furthermore, the pressure can cause the substrate to transition from a brittle to a ductile mode of fracture, which further reduces its drillability  lastly, the constant fluid pressure exerted on the bottom of the borehole by conventional drill bits can hold down cutting chips generated during drilling and lead to a regrinding of cuttings which further reduces the rop and can lead to a premature wearing out of the drill bit  the dbb routes the flow of drilling fluid through different nozzles during each cycle of the internal flow interrupter plate, which leads to a depressurization of certain zones under the bit face reducing the tendency of the rock to harden as well as enabling more efficient transport of fresh cuttings away from the face of the bit  these mechanisms have been demonstrated by kolle (2000) during the testing of a design that impulsively depressurized the bit face by periodically blocking the fluid flow and were shown to lead to an increased rop  most importantly these rop improvement mechanisms have been tested in the field in ultra-deep (5000-7000 m) wells in china by li et al  (2009) with a vibration and pulsation inducing mechanism consisting of a spinning impeller blade which caused fluid pulses due to cavitation behind the blades  li et al  (2009) measured very similar fluid pulsation pressure frequency and magnitude (maximum of 10 hz and 300 psi) during testing of this design and recorded between a 10 1-31 5% increase in the rop and a 29 1% increase in average bit life compared to historical performance in the region  if these improvements could be demonstrated with the dbb the reduction in drill time could lead to significant cost savings while drilling and lead to an increased number of oil and natural gas plays being profitable  and due to of the highly modifiable nature of the pulsation generating mechanism in the dbb the pressure profile frequency, amplitude and waveform shape can be adjusted by varying the geometry of the flow interrupter plate holes  this flexibility could allow for an interrupter plate selection based on the operational drilling needs and characteristics of the drilling substrate which could lead to an

2016-455 	 comparison of different methods to estimate uniaxial compressive strength in a barnett shale |abstract: |this study presents a comparison of three alternative approaches to estimate uniaxial compressive strength (ucs) to traditional uniaxial compressive test for shale which may be incompatible with standard sample preparation  rebound hardness and scratch tests have been employed to overcome unique sampling challenges concerning shale lithology  both approaches estimate ucs values in shale formations where sampling is impossible  in addition, this study develops a new approach to estimate ucs of shale referred herein as the “drill test”  comparison and discussion between the three alternative tests and the traditional ucs test are presented  ucs estimations of the three alternative methods showed a range of ucs values from 1933–39,299 psi, whereas uniaxial compressive tests using plugs varied from 1328–58,280 psi  overall, the four methods showed fairly good agreement  however, the current empirical calibration equations were developed from ucs data less than 40,000 psi, but the real range of strength was up to 58,000 psi  therefore, equations should be updated with additional samples greater than 40,000 psi ucs to represent the wider range of rock strength from this barnett core  |background |uniaxial compressive strength (ucs) has widely been applied in rock engineering as a design index of rock structures, since it is one of the fundamental rock mechanical properties  in general, nx-size (2 16 inches in diameter) plugs have traditionally been used to determine ucs values of hard rocks in geological and mining engineering  ucs is also important for petroleum engineering regarding drilling, drill bit designs, wellbore stability, sanding prediction, perforation tunnels, well completions, and frac designs  the oil and gas industry, however, primarily uses smaller-diameter (1 inch) plugs due to limited core resources  further, unconventional reservoir formations have more restrictions in preparing standardized rock specimens based on horizontal discontinuities along bedding planes such as laminations [1-2]  therefore, other alternative methods have been developed to overcome the restrictions and estimate formation strength  this study conducted four different laboratory experiments to determine or estimate horizontal ucs values of a barnett shale core  they are scratch [3-29], drill [30-38], rebound hardness [39-44], and uniaxial compressive tests  the first three methods are indirect estimations of ucs, and thus, they converted each test result to the corresponding ucs value using empirical calibration equations  this study introduces a new approach using drill test and compares with other results for technical review | 
2016-456 	 use of a swarm algorithm to reduce the drilling time through measurable improvement in rate of penetration |abstract: |over the years, the oil and gas industry has played a key role in the us energy sector  oil companies have continually worked to develop technology to maximize performance and reduce the cost per barrel of crude produced, lately with the optimized performance of horizontal wells  horizontal wells allow for more resources to be produced per well; however, they are more expensive since the horizontal section substantially increases length and drilling time  in drilling, now more than ever, optimization of the drilling parameters needs improvement to assist these companies in reducing the drilling time which can potentially save millions of dollars  numerous individuals have analyzed theoretical rate of penetration (rop) equations by finding the optimum value for constant drilling parameters for single bit runs, however, since the formation drilling variables change throughout the drilling process, so should the drilling controllable variables  therefore, the idea of constant drilling parameters potentially results in wasted time and dollars for operators, which could be vastly improved through use of dynamic variables  this leads to a new research approach, one that attempts to optimize drilling parameters through the use of a swarm algorithm with the goal to reduce the drilling time through measurable improvement in rate of penetration, and therefore, reduced total drilling time  in the work presented herein a particle swarm optimization technique (pso) has been incorporated to find the optimum combination of the drilling parameters, weight on bit (wob) and revolutions per minute (rpm) for every foot of formation to be drilled  the integration of this new swarm algorithm into the optimization process allows for rop equations to dynamically change, which can better adjust to the formation environmental variations throughout the drilling process  the results of this new area of research could change the way future horizontal wells are planned  implementation of this algorithm can be applied in a multitude of ways; incorporating it as an artificial intelligence module in an existing drilling optimization simulator program, and/or directly integrated in the planning process by the drilling engineers to optimize drilling parameters for future planned wells  |introduction |drilling overview |oil well drilling is a complex procedure and in order to optimize it, the physical phenomenon must be modeled as represented by the primary governing equation (kerkar et al , 2014)  before the early 1980s, most oil wells were mainly drilled vertically (helms, 2008)  these vertical wells were influenced by many physical control variables including: weight on bit (wob), revolutions per minute of the bit (rpm), drilling fluid type, drilling fluid viscosity, bit type, bit wear, etc  for drill bits, there are many sub segments of this area, however, most all of them can be classified into three categories: natural diamond bits (ndb), polycrystalline diamond compact bits (pdc) and roller cone bits  ndb's are bits that have natural diamonds that are set along the surface of the bit face and grind the rock  pdc bits have polycrystalline diamond cutters set in the blades at the bit face and scrape or shear the rock  roller cone bits are bits that have cones that roll along the rock face which crushes and gouges the rock as the bit teeth crush and penetrate into the rock  in this research, pdc bits will be incorporated since they are the most common | 
2016-457 	 wellbore geomechanics of extended drilling margins and engineered lost circulation solutions |abstract: |wellbore tensile failure is a known consequence of drilling with excessive mud weight, which can cause costly events of lost circulation  despite the successful use of lost circulation materials (lcm) in treating lost circulation events of the drilling operations, extensions of wellbore stability models to the case of a fractured and lcm-treated wellbore have not been published  this paper presents an extension to the conventional stability analysis of a wellbore to such circumstances  the proposed wellbore geomechanics solution redefines the extended equivalent circulation density (ecd) criteria and margin for re-breakdown of a fractured and, if the case, lcm-treated wellbore  an analytical approach is taken to solve for the related multiscale and nonlinear problem of three-way mechanical interaction between the wellbore, fracture wings, and lcm aggregate  the criteria for unstable propagation of existing near-wellbore fractures, together with those for initiating secondary fractures from the wellbore, are obtained  results suggest that, in many circumstances, the occurrence of both incidents can be prevented, provided that the lcm blend is properly engineered to recover certain depositional and mechanical properties at downhole conditions  under such optimal design conditions, the maximum ecd to which the (re-)breakdown limit of a permeable wellbore could be enhanced is predicted  |introduction |the mud pressure that causes tensile failure of the rock surrounding a wellbore is known as the wellbore tensile limit  alternatively, wellbore lost circulation limit is defined as the mud pressure causing lost circulation from a (fractured) wellbore  although the two are often considered identical in the conventional practice of wellbore stability analysis, the lost circulation limit of a wellbore can be greater than its tensile limit (fjaer et al  2008)  the resulting extension in equivalent circulation density (ecd) margins of drilling operation, simply known as drilling margins in the industry, can be large enough to find practical significance in drilling through the so-called narrow-margin zones or depleted sand  |early field evidence (fuh et al , 1992) and laboratory experiments on fracturing large size rock samples (onyia et al , 1994) revealed that the initial tensile limit of a borehole is independent of the specific type or formulation of the drilling mud  conversely, the re-breakdown pressure of an already fractured borehole was observed to depend on the mud type and composition  the term wellbore strengthening generally refers to the practice of enhancing the lost circulation limit of a wellbore through the proper design of the drilling mud formulation  particulate-based mud additives known as lost circulation materials (lcm) have been commonly used for this purpose (morita et al , 1990; onyia, 1994; dudley et al , 2000) | 
2016-460 	 calibration of stiffness and strength for layered rocks |abstract: |oil and gas production from unconventional reservoirs requires drilling and hydraulic fracturing within a layered reservoir, which is usually stratified with a variety of stiff and soft layers  the overall strength of layered rocks is useful for predicting their stability or failure under production conditions, which may contribute to vertical height containment of hydraulic fractures in an unconventional reservoir  in this work, triaxial experimental testing of reservoir-analog materials and three-dimensional particle flow code (pfc3d) simulations were used to evaluate the contributions of layer properties, such as number, thickness, and sequence, on the average strength of a layered reservoir  |the laboratory and pfc simulation results show that the stiffness and strength of a layered sequence are not affected by factors such as bedding plane strength, the number of layers, or layer thickness  however its stiffness and strength can be related to the relative proportions of stiff and soft layers  the stiffness of the layered sequences obtained from the experiments and pfc models are closely predicted by a calculated harmonic average stiffness of the sequence  the stiffness-strength relation obtained from the reservoir-analog materials has a similar form to those in the literature that were obtained from natural rock types, supporting the utility of pfc models of layered sequences  these results support the use of harmonic average and pfc simulations in estimating elastic stiffness and strength in layered and unconventional reservoir sequences  |introduction |oil and gas production from unconventional reservoirs generally requires hydraulic fracturing within a layered reservoir, which is usually stratified with layers of different mechanical properties  for instance, eagle ford shale is a well laminated reservoir with alternating stiff carbonate rich layers and soft clay rich layers [1]  in order to produce hydrocarbon from unconventional reservoirs more efficiently and economically, a better understanding of hydraulic fracture propagation in layered reservoirs is needed  among all the issues, vertical height growth of hydraulic fractures is recognized as one of the critical factors to the success of hydraulic fracturing treatments [2, 3]  if the expected hydraulic height growth is not achieved, a large area of payzone will not be stimulated which affects the production  in contrast, if hydraulic fractures grow into the adjacent rock layers which are not productive, an excessive amount of injection fluid and proppants will be wasted [4] | 
2016-461 	 influence of mineral compositions of rocks on mechanical properties |abstract: |rock is an aggregate of mineral compositions with complex mechanical properties  the uniaxial compression strength (ucs), as one of the most important mechanical properties of rock, is used to evaluate its load capacity during petroleum exploration  in this study, the hoek-brown criterion is introduced to evaluate the ucs of rocks in order to eliminate the influence of confining pressure on the mechanical properties of rock  through the x-ray diffraction (xrd) analysis the mineral compositions are obtained, thereby to establish the relationship between the mineralogy and the estimated ucss through regression analysis  based on that, a piecewise linear relationship is obtained between the dolomite contents and the rock mechanical properties  this phenomenon is further verified with the dem (discrete element method) simulations, and the piecewise linear relationship between the mineral compositions and the rock mechanical properties is applicable for general rocks  |introduction |in the sedimentary rocks, the compressive strength and elastic modulus of rocks increase with the high strength mineral compositions like quartz (chang et al , 2006, nicksiar and martin, 2013)  the contents, structures and properties of the minerals have the important influences on the physical and mechanical properties of rocks (fj<u+00e6>r et al , 2008)  to determine the reservoirs mechanical properties, the conventional method is to test the rock samples from the stratum  the rock mechanic tests need core samples of isrm requirements  the standard cores cannot always be extracted from weak, highly fractured, thinly bedded, foliated and/or block-in-matrix rocks  however, the mineral compositions can be obtained easily through the x-ray diffraction (xrd) analysis  for this reason, studying the correlations between mineral compositions and rock mechanical properties become attractive  |rock, as a complex material, is an aggregate of mineral compositions  the mechanical properties of rocks are influenced by many factors  fj<u+00e6>r et al , 2008 proposed that, as a generalized elastic material, the elastic properties of rocks depend primarily on the following three factors: |the relative amount of each component present; |the elastic properties of each component; |the geometrical distribution of each component  | 
2016-466 	 stability of borehole with breakouts – an experimental and numerical modelling study |abstract: |this paper presents a preliminary experimental and numerical modeling study on stability of boreholes with preexisting breakouts  a set of borehole and breakout stability experiments were carried out using a polyaxial cell on weak sandstone samples  the tests were performed by increasing the outer boundary stresses at a given stress ratio until sufficient failure was induced  the samples were then unloaded and the failed material removed manually to form breakouts  the samples with the new hole geometry were then re-tested along the same stress path with further failure monitored  it was observed that the failure started from the breakout tips  the failure initiation stress was slightly less that on the circular borehole and significantly less than the applied maximum stress in the borehole stability experiments  the breakout did not widen until the external load was close to the applied maximum level  the experiments were simulated numerically using an elasto-plastic damage constitutive model  it has been observed that the numerical simulation was able to qualitatively re-produce some of the experimental observations  |introduction |wellbore instability is a significant contributor to nonproductive time and a major cause of equipment lost in hole during drilling (wu and tan, 2011)  industry approach to overcome the problem is to select a compatible drilling fluid for the rock formations to be drilled (van oort, 2003) and an optimal drilling fluid density that prevents significant wellbore instability and drilling fluid loss (zoback, 2010)  well trajectory could also be optimized based on wellbore stability considerations if permitted by the local geological conditions and production requirement  furthermore, drilling fluid temperature may be conditioned to effect the near wellbore stress condition to prevent wellbore failure or mud loss (maury and guenot, 1995)  |majority research on wellbore stability has focused on initial stability of a circular borehole by comparing borehole stress with formation rock strength, and once the former is greater than the latter for a certain portion of borehole circumference, borehole failure is assumed  such an approach does not consider progressive borehole failure  it is well known that wellbore and/or reservoir stress condition can change during drilling and production  it is important to understand how the borehole that already suffered rock failure and breakouts would response to the changed wellbore and reservoir stress conditions, and whether the breakouts would remain stable or enlarged further resulting in large cavings and borehole collapse | 
2016-471 	 development of biogrouting using plant-derived urease and calcium phosphate compound |abstract: |biogrouting is a new soil improvement methos based on biological processes  calcium phosphate compounds (cpcs) are commonly used as biogrouting materials  their solubility of cpc is ph-dependent, with optimal values for extraction at approximately ph 8  urea hydrolysis is a well- known biological catalyst  it can be induced by urease and releases hydrolysis ions, which can then increase ph  in this study, cpcs and urea hydrolysis were utilized to solidify sand  the urea hydrolysis can be used as a ph regulator for cpcs  furthermore, urease is ectracted from momordica charantia seeds  to test this process, the unconfined compressive strength (ucs) of sand samples was measured  the ucs and ph of the sand samples containing a cpc solution, urea, and momordica charantia seed extract were found to increase  in the sand samples with cpcs and urea hydrolysis, ph was increased by approximately 1 5 and ucs was increased to twice that found in sand samples containing only the cpc solution this study suggest that cpcs and urea hydrolysis together have the potential to increase the strength of sand materials  |introduction |chemical injection of grouting material is an important method of improving soil strength  water glass and cement are examples of widely used materials for grouting that use chemical reactions for solidification  in contrast, in recent years, biogrout(paassen et al  2010; whiffin et al  2007) has been introduced, which uses biological reactions for solidification  this process of ground improvement by biological reaction is termed “biogrouting”  urea hydrolysis has been extensively studied as a biological reaction for biogrouting and as follows: |(equation) |calcium phosphate compound (cpc), derived from bones and teeth, are also used as a biogrouting material(kawasaki and akiyama 2013; akiyama and kawasaki 2012) and are more environmentally friendly than other chemically based materials  cpc also have some unique features, including self-solidification and solubility that depends on its ph  figure 1 shows that cpc precipitation occurs mostly at around ph 8  the basic principle of improving soil strength using cpc as a biogrouting material is that cpc precipitate between particles of sand at a ph of approximately 8, which can be increased using a biological reaction  in our study, cpc is used as a biogrouting material together with a plant-derived urease as a ph regulator  plant-derived urease is safer, can be obtained from commercial food waste and is cheap |

2016-476 	 hydro-mechanical modeling of hydraulic injection inside a fault zone |abstract |fluid propagation inside a fracture crossing another one is investigated  a fully hydro-mechanical coupled numerical model has been used to simulate different three-dimensional configurations  these configurations provide insight on how the crossed fracture is mechanically or hydraulically activated depending on well-defined parameters  it has been shown that the natural fracture can be either activated hydraulically without any shear displacement or mechanically activated while not loaded hydraulically  these configurations are controlled at a first order level by the combination of the in-situ differential stress state and the crossed fracture orientation  |introduction |if pressurized fluid can play a major role in the shear reactivation of faults zone, fluid can also propagate without triggering any significant sliding response (rutqvist et al , 2013)  micro-seismic activities are often recorded while loading hydraulically a fracture network (van der baan et al , 2013)  however, aseismic response can also be observed  in this case, it is still not clear if several micro-seismic events occur but too small to be recorded or if some configurations can promote a pure hydraulic reactivation process without any induced seismicity  |different models for simulating the fluid propagation inside a fracture network have been developed (damjanac & cundall, 2016;yaghoubi & zoback, 2012 for examples)  however, it seems that a systematic analysis to understand the hydromechanical (hm) response of a hydraulically loaded fracture has not been achieved yet  as the fluid propagates inside a fracture network, it might cross another fracture without change of direction or it might be deviated in a new one depending upon both the hm properties of the different fractures and the in-situ stress field acting on the fracture  for example, in the case of a fluid driven fracture, the intersected fracture is under the influence of the effective stress field variation before fluid eventually invades the intersected fracture (ching, 1997)  such stress transfer effect can greatly affect the hm behavior of the crossed fracture  it can drive the fluid in a preferential direction or completely close the fracture, inhibiting the fluid invasion and favoring the fluid to cross this heterogeneity  or, it can also favor slip under shear stress, and depending on the dilation amplitude, trap or not the propagating fluid with an associated shear displacement  thus, the fluid propagation through the fracture network will depend on in situ stress, rock and fracture properties but also on the fluid properties and pressure  extensive theoretical and experimental studies are still carried out for developing a rule governing this type interaction (rahman, 2009; fu et al , 2013; khoei et al , 2015; grasselli, et al , 2015, for examples) but new fully hm coupled simulations are still useful to understand the interaction processes | 
2016-479 	 numerical estimation of structural integrity of salt cavern wells |abstract: |finite element analyses were performed to estimate axial deformation of cavern wells due to gas storage operations in solution-mined salt caverns  caverns shrink over time due to salt creep and the cavern roof subsides potentially threatening well integrity  cavern deformation, deformation of salt surrounding the cavern and impacts on well integrity were quantified using a generic geomechanical finite element model that resembles gas storage operations in solution-mined caverns in the netherlands  the analysis results show that the largest deformation occurs at the floor and the lowest section of the side wall of a cavern, while the roof deformation is typically one order of magnitude smaller than those of the floor and the wall  the predicted vertical tensile strains that can cause tensile fracturing of well cement develop in the lowest 40-100m-long section of the well  the last cemented casing, typically set at a few tens of meters above the cavern roof, can therefore be affected by the vertical tensile strains that could damage cement sheath and threaten well integrity  the actual borehole construction need to be included in numerical models to investigate in more detail the impact of salt creep on wells in site- and configuration-specific underground gas storage projects  |introduction |underground natural gas storage projects have operated successfully since the early 1940's in many parts of the world (thoms and gehle, 2000)  nowadays, thousands of salt caverns are being used to store hydrocarbons (berest and brouard, 2003)  underground storage is regarded as the safest way to store large quantities of hydrocarbons because salt formations are almost impermeable and hydrocarbons are protected from fire, intentional damage, aircraft impact, etc  however, a small number of accidents have occurred in the past; most of these incidents (blow out, leakage of hydrocarbons) were due to well failure (berest and brouard, 2003)  generally, the well integrity problems are the main cause of most gas leakage incidents in underground natural gas storage operations in depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs, aquifers and salt caverns  only 10 of the approximately 600 storage reservoirs operated in the united states, canada, and europe have been identified to have experienced leakage due to geological factors and well integrity issues, typically poor cement jobs, casing corrosion, and improperly plugged wells (perry, 2005)  |well failure was also the cause of the recent leak in the southern california's aliso canyon gas storage facility, the second largest storage facility in the u s , built in a depleted hydrocarbon field (caliepa, 2016; caloes, 2016)  a well was leaking methane for nearly four months, from october 2015 to february 2016  one hundred thousand tons of methane was released into atmosphere, which is the largest gas leak in the u s  history in terms of its environmental impact  another recent example of a leaking well occurred at the epe gas storage facility in germany in 2014, where gas oil is stored in salt caverns (economic affairs, 2016)  the leakage incident at epe caused concerns related to the safety of other underground storage facilities not only in germany but also in the netherlands, as epe is located close to the dutch border and solution mined caverns are leached on either side of the border | 
2016-480 	 preliminary investigation of dynamic characteristics of leaching strings for solution mining of salt cavern storage |abstract: |during leaching for salt cavern underground energy storage, leaching string accidents for solution mining, excessive bending or breakage, etc , often occur  they seriously affect project progress and shape control of the cavern construction  preliminary theoretical and experimental researches on the dynamic characteristics of leaching strings were carried out  it is shown that the main reason why the overbending or breakage of leaching strings occurs is self-excited fluid-structure coupling vibration of leaching strings in confined space, well  the critical flow velocity expression of leaching strings is obtained under idealized condition, revealing that leaching bending stiffness of leaching strings, overhang length and overflowing area are the main influence factors of tubing dynamic stability  the phenomena of water hammer, static buckling and chaotic motion were observed in the model experiment, accounting for the main influence factors  finally, some research advices on the overall analysis of dynamic characteristics of the leaching string are proposed  |introduction |deep salt rocks formation is an ideal place of underground storage for oil, natural gas and high-level radioactive nuclear waste [1]  the salt rock storage is usually built by the method of solution mining through fresh water injection and brine removal [2]  fig  1 shows the process of dissolving salt rock: fresh water or weak brine is introduced into salt cavern through the inner leaching tubing (or the annulus between the inner leaching tubing and the outer leaching tubing), and brine in the cavern is discharged to the surface through the annulus (or the inner leaching tubing)  the volume of the cavern gradually expands due to dissolution and removal of salt rock  the annulus between the outer leaching tubing and the production casing is full of diesel oil or other liquid forming an oil cushion at the top of the cavern  the salt rock at the top of the cavern and weak brine are separated by the oil cushion to suppress upward leaching of the cavern and promote lateral leaching  conversely, if the oil cushion is removed, salt rock of the top of the cavern will be contacted byweak brine, resulting salt cavern developing upward  reasonable adjustment of the oil cushion depth can achieve the controlling of the shape of salt cavern  |during salt cavern leaching, some engineering accidents of leaching strings may occur, such as wear and corrosion of leaching strings, bending deformation, fracture of tubing and damage of casing coupling  these accidents affect the project schedule, and increase the construction cost  fig  2 shows that the bending deformation of inner leaching tubing is serious  when the inner leaching tubing is lifted to the surface for repair or replacement during well workover, the outer leaching tubing may be damaged if the excessively bendy inner tubing is lifted forcibly in confined cylindrical space  sometimes the inner tubing with serious bending deformation has to be cut off, abandoned in the cavern permanently |

2016-482 	 how creeping shale may form a sealing barrier around a well |abstract: |for wells to be permanently plugged and abandoned, rigid requirements for sealing barriers apply  cement filling the annulus outside the casing may provide proper sealing, however in shale sections where the annulus is not filled with cement, the shale may creep towards the casing and eventually form an equally efficient sealing barrier  this paper discusses some geomechanical aspects of the shale barrier forming process, and describes an effort to study the process by a numerical simulation  creep is implemented as time dependent plastic deformation  the annulus gap is rapidly reduced in the beginning, but the closure rate soon drops significantly, probably due to arching effects  for some shales, this effect may possibly terminate the process before the gap is closed  when contact between formation and casing is established, the closure rate is further reduced  ovaling or collapse of the casing are possible consequences, due to high and uneven load on the casing  the simulations indicated that elevated temperature may speed up the gap closure process, however no substantial long term effect of temperature was seen  |introduction |wells constitute efficient flow channels between hydrocarbon reservoirs and the surface  the flow of hydrocarbons through the wells is controlled by the operators; however the annulus between the casing and the rock may become undesired channels for leakage and thus need to be properly sealed, at least in certain sections of the well  traditionally, this is done by injection of cement at the casing shoe  this procedure may leave long sections of the annulus un-cemented, which may be acceptable while the well is in operation and hence under surveillance  for wells to be permanently plugged and abandoned, more rigid requirements for sealing barriers apply, as outlined for instance by norwegian authorities (norsok 2013), and will require substantial additional work  with standard technology, this is a costly process: it has been estimated that 15 rigs will need full time operation for 40 years to complete this job, on the norwegian continental shelf alone (straume, 2013)  |however, in shale sections where the annulus is not filled with cement, it has been observed in a number of cases that the shale may creep towards the casing and eventually form an equally efficient sealing barrier (williams et al , 2009)  this process – if it occurs – may imply huge cost savings for plug and abandonment (p&a) operations  moreover, it is possible that such shale barriers are even more efficient than cement barriers in a long term perspective, as cement tends to deteriorate and possibly cause older wells to leak (dusseault et al , 2014)  |the process of forming a shale barrier, and what prevents the process from occurring in some cases, is not yet fully understood  in this paper, we shall discuss the geomechanical aspects of this problem, and describe an effort to study the process by a numerical simulation | 
2016-486 	 analysis of vertical well collapse volume in radial porous media flows of a high pressure gas |abstract: |this paper analyzes the stress state of vertical wellbore formation in radial flows: phase, flow model and crustal stress  also collapse volume is studied based on the mohr-coulomb criterion  define a critical collapse condition: the stress state of northern adjacent rock on the wellbore satisfies mohr-coulomb criterion  while the collapse of a gas reservoir in darcy flow, darcy-forchheimer flow or accelerating flow will continue to develop in the near-well formation after the stress of adjacent rock reaches certain conditions  the collapse of a gas reservoir in accelerating flow is more liable to develop in near-well formation and the adjacent rock in this kind of flow is the first to reach its critical collapse condition  however, under the dual effect of non-uniform stress field and accelerating flow, collapse may exist in the maximum horizontal stress direction when the stress of adjacent rock reaches its critical collapse condition  besides, the critical collapse radius corresponding to maximum horizontal stress is likely to be the largest  and computational formula of collapse volume is given in this paper  |introduction |when reservoir fluid flows into the wellbore, the pore pressure decreases all the way from the outer boundary to borehole wall [1]  due to the interaction between fluid and fluid-saturated porous rock, changes in pore pressure will lead to changes in the formation wall stress and the effective stress, which may lead to the borehole instability [2]  pore pressure gradient of near-wellbore formation corresponding to different flow models in gas reservoir development and testing is various, especially for overpressed gas reservoir  accelerating effect should be considered in the flow model when flow velocity is large enough  while pore pressure gradient of near wellbore formation in accelerating model is nonlinear and may even be infinite  and the mass flow rate of the fluid has a maximum value [3-5], which will change the effective stress state of near-wellbore formation rock  |during the process of gas reservoir development and testing, adjacent rock is influenced by darcy flow and non-darcy flow, the phenomenon of formation sanding has been studied using plastic coulomb yield criterion and tensile failure criteria, but accelerating effect and collapse volume calculation have not been considered yet [6-9]  research of compressible fluid showed that there exist blocking flow and infinite pore pressure gradient in the flow model with accelerating effect, however, borehole collapse is not involved [10-13]  jin yan et al  [14] studied radial stress of adjacent rock of accelerating flow; they concluded that when the pore pressure gradient is very large, the effective radial stress may be tensile stress  still circumferential stress analysis and collapse volume calculation were not taken into account | 
2016-492 	 monitoring of fracture reopening in sandstones |abstract: |a laboratory method is devised to study acoustic emission induced by critically stressed planes and to understand field micro-seismic activity upon minor pore pressure increase, much below the hydraulic fracturing injection pressure  the experiment relies on generating a shear failure plane, re-loading the sample to the near-failure axial stress that closes/narrows the fracture zone, and finally reopening the fracture with a pore pressure increase  the entire process is controlled based on the acoustic emission response, which determines the reopening early enough to prevent the sliding  a change of the emission event energy distribution exponent is observed during fracture generation/activation and fracture sliding, combined with an increase of acoustic emission activity upon the dislocation  the results indicate that even small pore pressure increases, up to 2 mpa and in extreme cases as low as 0 4 mpa, are sufficient to activate a pre-existing fracture and finally to fail the outcrop and field sandstone sample  this lab observation supports the field findings of micro-seismicity even for low pore pressure increments due to fluid injection below the frac gradient  the field response may arise from geologically created critically stressed planes, which are not sliding at the current stresses, but are suddenly activated with minimal pressure increase  |introduction |reopening or reactivation of an existing fracture/fault in an underground reservoir has important consequences on the field operations during co2 injection and storage phases [1, 2, 3]  sometimes a fracture/fault reopening can help the co2 absorption process inside porous rocks by creating larger surface areas for co2-fluid interactions  on the other hand, it can trigger a co2 leakage path by activating existing fracture networks in the cap-rock  this fracture/fault reopening scenario is equally important to petroleum production phase, where permeability increases once an isolated conducting fracture becomes connected to the main flow path – as a result the productivity is enhanced  therefore, a close monitoring of fracture/fault reopening processes is a necessity  it can help the operators to select injection pressure, mud-weight window and other related parameters for a definite goal, either to stop fracture reopening or to allow it  a good control on the in-situ processes during fracture reopening should lead towards better planning of the well treatment, improve productivity and avoid risk  |the co2 geological storage pilot projects [4, 5] have identified some important scientific aspects for advanced research: how will the injected co2 be distributed within the storage reservoir? what is the mechanism behind the injection-induced micro-seismicity? how can we control and predict it?| 
2016-493 	 computational advances and data analytics to reduce subsurface uncertainty |abstract: |the increased availability and relevance of data for characterizing, analyzing, and modeling engineered-natural systems highlights the current limitations of common pc-based analytic capabilities to cope with the expanding volume, variety, and veracity of these data  these limitations stress the value in utilizing big data techniques and computing capabilities to work with these data and improve the storage, retrieval, and analytical capabilities required for engineered-natural systems analyses and assessments  as a result, the department of energy's national energy technology laboratory (doe netl) is developing and applying several big data approaches and technologies to on-going engineered-natural systems research, such as research focused on offshore hydrocarbon, carbon storage, enhanced geothermal, unconventional resources, and underground fluid disposal  in this paper we detail the development and application of several on-going big data computing capabilities and how they are being integrated with geoscience computing and geospatial analytical methods to improve data integration, processing, and analysis as well as reduce uncertainty pertaining to engineered-natural systems  |introduction |to address the challenges facing today's society, spanning from energy security, responsible use, human health and safety, climate change, and others, the scope and scale of research is increasing to better understand and address these challenges  as a result, research is addressing more complex problems and utilizing larger, diverse data, commonly referred to as big data, to address these problems  associated with the volume of the data, the rate at which the information is provided, and the variety and diversity of data sources and formats, big data are increasingly leveraged for mining and integrating data to support analysis and uncertainty reduction [1,2]  however, utilizing big data or implementing big data techniques for on-going research faces poses challenges in storing, retrieving, and using big data  this includes limitations such as available ram, storage read/write speed, number of processing cores, or bandwidth in a single workstation to cope with the expanding volume, variety, and veracity of these data  budgetary issues may also preclude the ability to purchase a single workstation or server with ample processing capabilities, whereas utilizing new or repurposed desktop pcs to form a cluster may be a more viable alternative  furthermore, it may not be possible with the current state of technology to provision a single workstation with enough resources thus making the clustering approach a more computationally viable approach to meet research needs | 
2016-494 	 modeling of near-wellbore fracture reorientation using a fluid-coupled 2d xfem algorithm |abstract: |we have developed a fluid-coupled algorithm for modeling reorientation of longitudinal fractures propagating from a wellbore aligned with the intermediate or maximum far-field stress direction  a two-dimensional plane-strain model is adopted  the rock deformation solver is implemented using the extended finite element method (xfem)  the model for the fluid flow in hydraulic fractures is based on the reynolds lubrication equation  the fluid pressure and the fracture opening are obtained from the solution of a system of nonlinear equations resulting from the coupling of the rock deformation solver with the fluid flow model  to model fracture reorientation, the direction of fracture propagation is determined based on the maximum tensile stress criterion  we present the results of modeling of the near-wellbore fracture reorientation in the viscosity-dominated regime with this algorithm and study the effect of the wellbore casing on the fracture opening and the fluid pressure required to initiate and propagate the fracture  |introduction |during the hydraulic fracturing process, a hydraulic fracture initiates from an initial flaw at a wellbore and ultimately propagates in the preferred fracture plane orthogonal to the minimum compressive far-field stress direction  if the initial flaw is not orthogonal to the minimum compressive far-field stress, reorientation of the hydraulic fracture takes place, leading to one form of near-wellbore fracture tortuosity  in this case, the fracture opening near the wellbore is reduced, which generates a near-wellbore pressure loss and creates a risk of wellbore screenout due to proppant bridging (mack and warpinski, 2000)  |previous studies (romero et al , 1995; zhang et al , 2011), as well as observed field data and experiments (aud et al , 1994; van de ketterij and de pater, 1999), have shown that using a fluid of a higher viscosity and a higher injection rate reduces the negative effects of this form of near-wellbore fracture tortuosity  however, the increased viscosity and rate require higher pressure to initiate and propagate the fracture  |other factors that can influence reduced fracture width and the near-wellbore pressure loss due to the near-wellbore fracture reorientation include completion type and the geometry of the initial defect of the rock formation exposed to the fluid pressure  for example, if perforations in a cased wellbore are misaligned with the in-situ principal stress directions, a lower misalignment angle results in a lower viscous pressure drop near the wellbore and a lower pressure required to propagate the fracture (abass et al , 1994; zhang et al , 2011) | 
2016-495 	 friction-permeability relationships for reservoir caprocks |abstract: |there is wide concern that pressurized co2 fluid has a potential to induce seismicity in the impermeable caprocks that overlie co2 injection formations  however, the possible impact of induced seismicity on sustainable co2 containment from geological co2 sequestration remains unclear because the earthquakes play a significant but mysterious role in influencing the integrity of the caprocks by hypothesized interrelated friction-permeability interaction processes: (1) the earthquakes may occur seismically (i e , frictionally unstable), enhancing the permeability of faults instantly and leading to potential breaching and loss of inventory; or (2) the earthquakes may occur aseismically (i e , frictionally stable), closing the aperture of faults and reducing permeability through creep  in this study, we explore these processes through experiments in which we measure the frictional parameters and hydraulic properties using green river shale sample as an analogue caprock candidate  we observe that fracture permeability declines during shearing while the increased sliding velocity reduces the rate of decline  the physics of these observed behaviors are explored via parametric study and surface measurement of fractures, showing that both permeability and frictional strength are correlated to the fracture asperity evolution that is controlled by the sliding velocity and fracture material  through the velocity step, the velocity strengthening behavior is observed for green river shale, suggesting that for green river shale, only aseismic slip would occur at a low sliding velocity during which the permeability would decrease  |introduction |geological storage of carbon dioxide (co2) is considered a viable method to significantly reduce co2 emissions from energy production and to reduce global impacts on climate (falkowski et al , 2000)  injection of co2 into deep saline aquifers or depleted oil and gas reservoirs has the potential to sequester significant mass of co2 in a sustainable manner (holt et al , 1995; bachu and adams, 2003; orr, 2009; szulczewski et al , 2012)  one key to the success of long-term co2 storage is the integrity of the resulting seal of impermeable caprocks that contain the charge to deep saline aquifers and prevents leakage into the atmosphere or potable aquifers (shukla et al , 2010)  however, the presence of preexisting faults and fractures distributed throughout the upper crust may influence the longevity of this storage (anderson and zoback, 1982; curtis, 2002)  fluid injection activities (e g , hydraulic fracturing, deep disposal of wastewater, enhanced geothermal stimulation, etc ) can reactivate pre-existing faults and induce seismicity (healy et al , 1968; raleigh et al , 1976; kanamori and hauksson, 1992; mcgarr et al , 2002; shapiro et al , 2006; majer et al , 2007; suckale, 2009; ellsworth, 2013; walsh and zoback, 2015; guglielmi et al , 2015; im et al , 2016)  likewise, large-scale injection of co2 that generates overpressures and decreases effective normal stresses may reactivate preexisting faults in caprocks (fig  1)  as a result, co2-injection induced seismicity may raise the potential that the rupture of caprocks could jeopardize the seal integrity and ultimately result in loss of charge of co2 (chiaramonte et al , 2008; rutqvist, 2012; zoback and gorelick, 2012)  hence, it is of particular interest to understand the evolution of permeability of caprocks as a result of seismic and aseismic deformation in caprocks | 
2016-496 	 where does the stress path lead? irreversibility and hysteresis in reservoir geomechanics |abstract: |reservoir stress changes caused by pore pressure depletion have impacts on hydrocarbon recovery, on safety and stability margins during drilling, and on possible seismicity  stress path prediction is a challenge, in particular when pore pressure is increased by injection after depletion, either for improved recovery or for storage of e g  co2  three different perspectives of stress path reversal are considered here: i) the mechanical behavior of rock that undergoes unloading and reloading, starting from a virgin state, has been addressed through controlled laboratory experiments, ii) an analytical approach has been developed to sketch the interplay of tensile and shear fractures with the stress path itself, and iii) numerical modeling has been performed to account for stress heterogeneities and plastic deformation of the reservoir rock  the results show that all these mechanisms may contribute to the resulting stress path, in addition to the role of thermal stresses associated with injection of cold fluids into reservoirs  |introduction |the concept of reservoir stress path is becoming a more and more relevant tool for describing and understanding the dynamic behavior of hydrocarbon or storage reservoirs  reservoir stress path coefficients are defined (hettema et al, 2000) as the change in the total stress <u+0394><u+03c3> per unit change in the pore pressure <u+0394>pp (subscripts “v” and “h” denote vertical and horizontal directions): |(equation) |<u+03b3>v and <u+03b3>h are often called “arching coefficient” and “depletion coefficient”, respectively  in case of a laterally infinite reservoir in a linearly elastic and homogeneous subsurface, no stress is transferred to the overburden, <u+03b3>v = 0, and the reservoir is deforming uniaxially (no horizontal strain)  the depletion coefficient is then directed by the poisson's ratio v of the drained reservoir rock, and by the biot coefficient <u+03b1>: |(equation) |stress arching, associated with <u+03b3>v > 0, is enhanced by increasing aspect ratio (= thickness divided by diameter of the depleting zone), by increasing stiffness of the surrounding rock relative to the reservoir rock, and by reservoir tilt (see fj<u+00e6>r et al , 2008, ch  12) |

2016-509 	 fracturing of migmatite monitored by acoustic emission and ultrasonic sounding |abstract: |migmatite from the skalka region (czech republic) was chosen as an experimental rock material  it has a macroscopically visible plane-parallel structure (foliation)  the foliation was caused mainly by biotite grain arrangement  four cylindrical specimens of migmatite with sub-horizontal, sub-vertical and oblique foliation were uniaxially loaded up to failure  a network of 8 broadband sensors was employed for acoustic emission monitoring and ultrasonic sounding  a grid search method with an anisotropic velocity model was used for ae hypocenter localization  the source types of successfully localized events were determined from the average first arrival amplitude  structural anisotropy of the tested rock material caused the anisotropy of its mechanical properties (peak strength, young's modulus) as well as a different fracturing in dependence on the angle between the axial stress and the foliation plane  the combination of tension and shear microcracking together with sliding in biotite basal planes was found to control the failure of specimens with sub-horizontal foliation  shearing and sliding were dominant in the failure of specimens with oblique foliation  with greater dip of foliation, the role of sliding increased at the expense of shearing  due to the favorably oriented system of microcracks already present, the shearing and splitting was at the same level during fracturing of specimens with sub-vertical foliation before nucleation began  |introduction |the process of failure of low-porosity rocks depends on their mechanical properties and actual stress and temperature conditions  at low pressure and low temperature, brittle failure is most common  this is a progressive process requiring the initiation, growth and coalescence of cracks (lockner, 1993)  stress strain behavior of low-porosity crystalline rocks during laboratory compression experiments is divided into four characteristic stages: crack closure, elastic region, stable crack growth and unstable crack growth which leads to brittle failure, (brace et al , 1966; bieniawski, 1967; lajtai, 1974)  |the fracturing process of stressed rock begins with crack initiation (<u+03c3>ci), which for low-porosity rocks occurs approximately at 40-50% of peak strength (<u+03c3>p) (cai et al , 2004; nicksiar and martin, 2013)  after <u+03c3>ci, dilatancy begins and stable crack growth follows up to the crack damage threshold (<u+03c3>cd), which is approximately at 80% of <u+03c3>p (cai et al , 2004)  after crossing the crack damage level, there is unstable crack growth accompanied with nucleation of the fault plane (<u+03c3>n) at 97-100% of <u+03c3>p (rao et al , 2011)  the stress drop accompanied with the formation of a macro-scale shear failure plane follows after peak stress is crossed |

2016-513 	 influence of sorptive tendency of porous medium on hydraulic properties of shale |abstract: |routine measurement of hydraulic diffusivity of ultra-low permeability rocks, such as shale, is a prolonged process  this study explores the effects of sorptive characteristic of porous medium on hydraulic diffusivities of shale rocks  the examined rock types include mancos shale, catoosa shale, eagle ford shale, and core samples from gulf of mexico  firstly, the adsorption isotherms of the selected shale rocks were obtained  then, the hydraulic properties of the selected shale rocks were determined using shale-fluid interaction testing cell, which employs the pressure transmission technique  the experimental results show that the moisture content of shale is correlated with water activity using a multilayer adsorption theory  it is found that the adsorption isotherms of various shale formations can be scaled using their respective cation exchange capacity, into a single adsorption isotherm  the study proposes an isotherm correlation, which represents ten different shale formations  analyzing the transient pore pressure response in the downstream side of shale sample allows calculating the transport coefficients of shale samples  hydraulic properties of shales are obtained by matching the pore pressure history with a 1-d coupled fluid flow model  the experimental results indicate that sorptive properties can be inversely related to the hydraulic diffusivity of shale rocks  it is found that with an increase in the magnitude of sorption potential of shale, the hydraulic diffusivity decreases  this work is useful for shale characterization and provides a correlation, which can have various applications including, but not limited to, wellbore stability prediction during well planning  |introduction |prolonged exposure of shale formations with aqueous drilling fluids has shown to be problematic and leads to wellbore instability issues (rahman et al , 2003; nes et al , 2012)  according to york et al , 2009, the wellbore instability problems in a deepwater offshore well could at least cost $2 5 million  many efforts have been done to reduce shale instability by modifying the chemical composition of drilling fluid using different categories of fluid additives (reid and minton, 1992; clark and benaissa, 1993; van oort et al , 1996; patel, 2009)  one of the important interaction processes between shale and drilling fluid is hydration of clay minerals  this phenomenon often leads to various operational problems such as shale swelling, bit balling, stuck pipe, high torque, and reduction of rate of penetration, which ultimately increase the non-productive time and hence the drilling cost (van oort et al , 1996; labenski and reid, 2003)  basically, two kinds of clay swelling can be recognized, namely, the intercrystalline swelling due to the hydration of exchangeable cations and osmotic swelling, where the latter is due to a substantial difference between chemical potential of shale and drilling fluid (cases et al , 1992; van oort, 2003) |

2016-523 	 studies of seismicity generated by unstable failures around circular excavations |abstract: |stress perturbation in highly stressed ground may lead to induced seismicity caused by compressive failure or sudden shear slip along discontinuities  this paper presents a numerical methodology for studying these forms of unstable failures by calculating the unstable excess energy which is released by their occurrence  an explicit finite difference model is used to demonstrate several cases of underground openings being formed in highly stressed ground  energy changes calculated by the models are first validated from analytical solutions  the unstable excess energy released during a brittle failure or slip along a discontinuity is compared with the theoretical approach  effects of material brittleness in more complex models are then explored as well as the strength and failure characteristics of a neighboring fault  parametric studies are performed to identify the circumstances under which seismicity may occur  unstable failure conditions resulting in seismicity emerge in some of the models and excess energy is produced which cannot be stored or consumed in the system  this excess energy is calculated for each model and is used to assess the relative magnitudes of instability for the given conditions  the results of the models demonstrate that a reduction in strength of the rock during failure can lead to sudden slip of the fault and can trigger a self-propagating failure, although in-situ stresses and the stiffness of the system can totally alter the results  the energy based methods of analysis outlined in this paper provide a rational means of studying induced seismicity in potentially complex combinations of rock mass properties, excavation geometries, and failure characteristics of faults or bedding plane discontinuities  |introduction |induced seismicity is one of the most important, yet difficult to address, challenges in underground projects  projects encountering induced seismicity range from mining and tunneling excavations (garvey and ozbay, 2013), to unconventional oil and gas industry (suckale, 2009), to enhanced geothermal systems (evans et al , 2012) or waste water injection (zhang et al , 2013)  this phenomenon refers to tremors precipitated by the stress redistribution and resultant changes in the strain on the earth's crust  these changes may originate from the release of tectonic stresses or stresses induced by industrial activities  although relaxing the induced stresses may also lead to relaxing tectonic stresses (ellsworth, 2013)  |in most cases, seismicity is triggered by rock failure in compression or slip along discontinuities in shear  compressive failures are common in deep underground projects due to the high stresses exceeding the unconfined strength of the rock  a drop of confinement can also cause the rock surrounding an opening to fail suddenly  the stress redistribution may, moreover, lead to de-confinement or an increase in the shear stress along a discontinuity resulting in a slip failure of a fault or discontinuity within the affected stress field |

2016-531 	 numerical simulation of rock dynamic fracturing and failure including microscale material randomness |abstract: |realistic fracture simulations in rock as a heterogeneous brittle material with significant inherent randomness, requires the use of models that incorporate its inhomogeneities and statistical variability  dynamic crack growth in rocks is generally associated with complex features such as crack path oscillations, microcracking and crack branching  we employ two approaches to address rock inhomogeneities for dynamic fracture simulations  first we model fractures explicitly with random size, location and orientation as natural pre-existing crack-like defects  second, we use a probabilistic nucleation technique based on the weibull model to implicitly incorporate creation of new cracks during the analysis  both approaches can be used for the simulation of rocks for which the natural fractures are oriented in a specific angle, as in sedimentary rocks  we use the spacetime discontinuous galerkin (sdg) method to efficiently and accurately capture complex fracture patterns observed in dynamic rock fracture  specifically we employ a novel crack path tracking method, offered by the sdg method's powerful adaptive operations, to accurately model crack path oscillations, microcracking, and crack bifurcation  our approach is applicable to rock fracture as well as problems where an induced major crack propagates and intersects natural fractures  incorporation of macro-micro crack interactions can provide a more accurate estimation in hydrocarbon recovery in tight formations  |introduction |rocks are heterogeneous at different scales  at small grain scale, they are characterized by the presence of microcracks and granular microstructures  in fact, rocks contain a large number of randomly oriented zones of potential failure in the form of grain boundaries  at large mass scale, they are described by the presence of different rock types, faults and weak features such as fracture networks  these inhomogeneities affect the continuum level mechanical characteristics of rocks such as strength, toughness, and elasticity properties  however, mechanical properties of a solid can also be estimated by simulating its microstruc-ture while it is loaded  in this context, failure in rock can be considered as the consequence of tensile and shear micro-fractures which progress within the microstructure and finally result in macro-fractures known as a failure state  |in many applications it is important to consider the natural discontinuities of rocks at different observation scales  microcracks and pores in micro-scale or pre-existing fracture networks and faults in macroscale influence the formation of new discontinuities by joining and interacting with them  rock blasting and hydraulic fracturing in tight formations are two examples in which the goal of induced dynamic loadings is to increase the discontinuities  this issue needs to be properly addressed in computational simulations  the consequences of rock blasting which includes fracturing of the rock and fragment size distributions should be well estimated in design process  in hydraulic fracturing, an induced major crack propagates and intersects natural fractures which in turn are hydraulically loaded and extended to intersect other fissures and finally results in a new complicated fracture network  incorporation of macro-micro crack interactions can highly improve computational estimations for the problems dealing with fracture in rocks  for example, models that do not include the interactions of main hydraulically loaded and propagated cracks with natural fissures often underestimate the hydrocarbon recovery from a tight reservoir  in contrast to these problems at which the aim of numerical evaluation is to maximize the fractures and cracks in rock, there are some events aiming to limit the formation of new fractures and prevent rock failure  natural slopes, dams and underground openings are among the examples in which the existing natural fractures should be included in the simulations for their stability assessments |

2016-545 	 stress and porosity in fold-and-thrust belt systems |abstract: |we use large-strain, drained poro-mechanical models to investigate the evolution of stress and porosity in fold-and-thrust belt systems  we impose horizontal displacement on an initially horizontal sediment layer to simulate the lateral tectonic loading  we find that the maximum principle stress gradually rotates from its initial vertical direction in the far field to sub-horizontal direction near the backstop  we show that sediments above the decollement compress significantly because of increase in both mean effective stress and relative shear stress ratio (q/<u+03c3>'m)  we further show that the sediments within the accretionary wedge are close to or at the critical state (the sediments have reached the highest possible shear stress for the current mean effective stress)  we divide the area above the decollement in thrust belts into 3 zones, based on their final relative shear stress ratio (q/<u+03c3>'m): critical state region, transition region, and geostatic compression region  we built these large strain models with elfen; we model the sediments as poroelasto-plastic materials with a critical state soil model (sr3)  overall, we predict porosity, mean and deviatoric stresses in compressional regimes  our geomechanical analysis of sedimentary wedges provide significant insights of stress and compression in fold-and-thrust belt systems  |introduction |in fold-and-thrust belt systems, understanding stress state and compression strains is crucial to ensure a safe drilling environment and can greatly impact the economic risk assessment for exploration activities  predrill predictions on field stress and pore pressure are routinely estimated using field porosity data acquired from either wells (zhang, 2009) or remote sensing techniques (sayers et al , 2002)  most conventional industry workflows assume that sediment porosity is a function of vertical effective stress  however, this assumption is based on uniaxial compression (compaction) conditions, which are not applicable to fold-and-thrust belt systems: in such systems, the lateral tectonic loading plays a critical role on the final stress state and sediment compression (couzens-schultz and azbel, 2014)  using the assumption that porosity is a function of vertical effective stress in compressional regimes may lead to underestimation of pore pressure (goulty, 2004)  |there is an increasing awareness of the importance of relating sediment compression to the evolution of the three dimensional stress state  hauser (2014) used modified cam clay to describe the sediment compression in deepwater fold-and-thrust belts and demonstrated the importance of incorporating the deviatoric stress  rowe and screaton (2012) applied a critical sate soil material model to numerically study stress and pore pressure in the nankai accretionary wedge  however, there are very few studies that systematically track the evolution of sediment porosity, as well as the overall stress history and failure of sediments in fold-and-thrust belt systems | 
2016-546 	 microseismic geomechanics for refracturing |abstract: |conventional microseismic analysis is often inadequate to determine whether refracture treatments stimulate undepleted areas or simply re-stimulate already-depleted areas  the eagle ford refracture treatment case study in this paper demonstrates the application of microseismic geomechanics to assess the effectiveness of diversion and estimate the distribution of fluid between previously stimulated and unstimulated areas  |the case study shows that depletion-induced changes in stress can enhance diversion, and the distribution of fluid between fractures in depleted and undepleted areas evolves during the treatment  the geomechanical model is used to identify the characteristic pressure signature and microseismic patterns associated with different hydraulic fracture geometries  a practical diagnostic of diversion effectiveness based on microseismic moment is derived from advanced microseismic analysis of the geomechanical response, and some options for completion optimization are suggested  |introduction |due to the low permeability of shale reservoirs, it is generally assumed that production occurs only from those parts of the reservoir that are close to the hydraulic f racture or to natural fractures activated by the stimulation process  many older horizontal wells were stimulated with 10 or fewer stages, with the stages separated by some distance, due to limitations of completion hardware technology  this resulted in sub-optimal stimulation and some areas of the laterals were not stimulated at all  refracturing these older wells has been seen as an opportunity for oil and gas operators to increase production at a lower cost than drilling new wells  |in some cases, diverters are used to block access to open fractures and redirect the refracture treatment to stimulate new areas around the wellbore that were not accessed by the initial treatment  it is important to know whether the diversion is successful or if the initial fractures are being reopened  |microseismic data is often used as a tool to visually assess the geometry of hydraulic fractures, and the related stimulation  this paper shows that this simplistic approach (assuming that microseismic activity is associated with fluid flow and stimulation) is inadequate for refracturing  a more complete workflow and modeling methodology is demonstrated using an eagle ford case study | 
2016-552 	 the application of cryogenic treatment during refracture process - laboratory studies |abstract: |refracturing is an imperative and high-efficiency method to control production decline after first fracturing treatment  however, conventional techniques for refracturing are often challenged by the problem that the new fracture created by the refracturing treatment follows the same path of the original fracture  in this case, only the conductivity of previous fracture is recovered and the new fracture can not contact the undepleted reservoir areas  the application of cryogenic treatment during refracturing process may solve this problem  we conducted rock mechanical properties tests, submersion tests and stimulation tests under cryogenic condition  the test results showed that the shear strength, tensile strength and mode-i fracture toughness significantly decreased after cryogenic treatment; the large thermal gradient caused by cryogenic treatment could create new microfractures and extend previous microfractures on initial fracture surface; a refracturing network appeared in the stimulation test with cryogenic treatment  the test results indicate that the refracture reorientation depends on the failure of the weakened zones induced by cryogenic treatment, apart from geo-stress field  |introduction |hydraulic fracturing is necessary for the economic development of tight oil reservoirs  however, there will be a distinct production decline after a well has been produced for a few years after the initial fracturing treatment  refracturing is an imperative and high-efficiency method to control production decline by creating new fractures in different directions, and has been proved to be the most important means to enhance oil recovery in low permeability tight reservoirs  however, as the frequency of refracturing treatment increases, production gained from each subsequent refracturing treatment declines quickly  the most important reason for this phenomenon is that the fractures created by the conventional refracturing treatment either follow the same path of the original fractures or propagate away from the original fractures with a very small rotation degree, which is a problem that conventional techniques for refracturing are often faced with  in this case, only the conductivity of previous fractures is recovered and the new fractures can not contact with the undepleted reservoirs  of course, plugging-off initial fractures can improve the effects of conventional refracturing treatment  however, creating a new fracture with large rotation degree still is very difficult through plugging-off initial fractures  in order to solve this problem and create a complex refracturing network, we have to know more about the weakness of conventional refracturing theory and change the conventional refracturing treatment | 
2016-553 	 multiple intersecting cohesive discontinuities in 3d reservoir geomechanics |abstract: |reservoir geomechanics is playing an increasingly important role in developing and producing hydrocarbon reserves  one of the main challenges in reservoir modeling is accurate and efficient simulation of arbitrary intersecting faults  in this paper, we propose a new formulation to model multiple intersecting cohesive discontinuities (faults) in reservoirs using the xfem framework this formulation involves construction of enrichment functions and computation of stiffness sub-matrices for bulk (rock mass), faults and their interaction dofs  a sub-divisional scheme has been developed, to perform volume and surface integrations  the sub-divisional scheme can efficiently handle most possible configurations of multiple intersecting/nonintersecting faults in 3d finite elements  in order to be able to model cohesive behaviour of intersecting faults, we have performed additional surface integrations which, to the knowedge of the authors, are not reported in the literature  for example, if an element is intersected by two cohesive faults, we compute 16 volumes an d 8 surface in tegrations for stiffness matrices and 4 surface integrations for force vectors, to form elemental equations  the current distributed implementation using c++/mpi can simulate very large meshes  three-dimensional benchmark cases are presented to validate the accuracy of the approach, and the potential benefits in applications  the present study shows that interaction dofs and their associated surface stiffness matrices play a significant role in accurate modeling of cohesive faults via xfem  |introduction |faults are geological entities with thickness several orders of magnitude smaller than the grid blocks typically used to discretize the domain  due to frictional forces between the surfaces, the natural occurring faults in rock masses are cohesive  cohesive faults may result in relative displacements in the plane of the fracture  due to arbitrary and multiple occurrence of faults, many of them may intersect and result in complex 3d geometries  intersecting faults affect the strength and deformability of rock mass and thus their accurate modelling is required to understand the geomechanical behaviour of reservoirs  numerical modelling techniques can be classified on the basis of the procedure used to represent faults  faults can be represented implicitly by using constitutive equation for the continuum and additional deformations due to opening/slip  the explicitly representation of faults may be done in various ways, the more classical one is via zero-thickness (or sometimes thin layer) elements inserted in-between element faces/edges while all nodal variables maintain the traditional meaning as regula displacements (goodman et al , 1968; gens et al , 1988)  we do implicit representation of the faults using level set functions (das et al , 2015)  the discontinuity can cut the elements in arbitrary ways, which is captured using zero values of level set function  this approach can define the discontinuities with complex geometries  the jump in the displacement field near the fault plane is captured using appropriate enrichment function  for example, for rock faults modeling, ‘heaviside function’ is used to enrich nodes (wells and sluys, 2001) | 
2016-554 	 modified relationship between point loading strength and uniaxial compressive strength by dem |abstract: |a number of studies have been conducted to investigate the relationships between point loading strength (pls) and uniaxial compressive strength (ucs)  the method is widely used in on-site tests because it is convenient and the requirement for the sample in pls is not very strict  however, it's difficult to get an accurate relationship between ucs and pls in laboratory due to strong heterogeneity of rocks  discrete element method (dem) has been proved to be a great tool to simulate and analyze the behavior of rock material  in dem, the particle properties (such as particle contact modulus) can be set to ensure the rock materials to possess the same properties  so we can get the correct correspondence between pls and ucs  in this paper 23 sets of data are simulated which from the laboratory test, and it is found that there are good correspondences  through further analysis, the authors also discuss the influence of experimental conditions on the pls by dem, which includes indenter radius, aspect ratio and particle size  by the simulations, we reached three conclusions: 1) the simulated result is higher than that of laboratory test in pls because of homogeneity; 2) the larger indenter radius, the higher pls will be; 3) pls is nearly a constant when the aspect ratio of samples is between 0 3 and1  besides, if the aspect ratio is lower than 0 3, the pls will increase rapidly  |introduction |in rock mechanics, how to describe the mechanical properties of rock accurately has been one of the key issues  so far, some methods can be applied to measure the mechanics properties of rock, such as point loading test, uniaxial compression test, conventional tri-axial compression test, brazilian disc test, and fracture toughness test  the detailed standard specifications for these experiments are all published (franklin, 1985; hatheway, 2009)  as one of the main properties, uniaxial compressive strength (ucs) can be measured commonly through uniaxial compression test  |however, uniaxial compression test itself has some disadvantages  first of all, it is time-consuming and expensive to make a high precision sample  the flatness of specimen ends must be machined to 0 001 mm  the side must be smooth and straight and the smoothness of all side must reach 0 3 mm (hatheway, 2009)  and then, some of the rocks are difficult to be processed into standard specimens, such as coal, which is featured by cleats  on the other hand, point loading test is convenient and simple to measure the strength of rock, because it is not strict with the shape of the specimen, and we can get results with any size  moreover, the point loading test instrument is easy to carry  point loading test has been widely used in the field of engineering because of these advantages | 
2016-560 	 coupling a fracturing code to a transient reservoir simulator: a hands-on approach |abstract: |practical aspects of coupling a fracture-mechanical finite-element code to a reservoir simulator for hydraulic fracturing applications are discussed  three essential components of the coupling are the stability control algorithm, the fracture permeability model, and the pressure corrector  stability is controlled by specifying the minimum and maximum numbers of finite elements that are allowed to fail at each timestep  trial runs with varied timesteps are performed in order to keep the number of failing elements within the prescribed range  the fracture permeability model links the permeability of failed finite elements to displacement discontinuities (rather than to effective stresses ) a pressure corrector is applied to maintain mass balance in the system  failed elements in the fracturing code create new porosity that is exported to the flow code  if no pressure correction is applied, this effectively means that mass will be artificially produced in the model when fracturing starts  in order to correct for this, the density of the fluid in failed elements is adjusted to maintain the mass balance  this is achieved by introducing a correction to the fluid pressure in failed elements  |introduction |depletion of easily producible hydrocarbon reservoirs calls for a steadily increasing share of low-permeability reservoirs in the global fuel portfolio  such reservoirs include e g  shale gas reserves and tight gas sands  also extracting more oil from conventional reservoirs remains high on the agenda  these current challenges require that stimulation techniques used to increase well productivity in low-permeable and/or complex reservoirs be improved and optimized to ensure a stable production over long time  |hydraulic fracturing is a widespread technique used for well stimulation in conventional and unconventional reservoirs [1]  a fluid, or a sequence of different fluids, is injected form a well into the formation in order to create a hydraulic fracture  with regard to the vertical extent of the hydraulic fracture, treatments are usually designed to contain the fracture within the productive zone and avoid its penetration into the under- and overburden  the fracture length should ensure an economical increase in the well productivity without e g  jeopardizing the integrity of the neighboring wells  this turns design of a hydraulic fracturing treatment into an optimization exercise  it calls for robust and compute-efficient numerical models that can predict fracture growth in a mechanically and hydraulically heterogeneous, and often naturally fractured, rock | 
2016-561 	 the influence of oil-based drilling fluid on the wellbore instability and fracturing in complex shale formation |abstract: |oil-based drilling fluids are widely used in the drilling operation of unconventional shale gas reservoirs, which will affect wellbore stability and fracability of fracturing operation  the core samples obtained from lower silurian longmaxi strata of sichuan basin were investigated using x-ray diffraction tests, pyrolysis test, wettability test, field emission scanning electron microscope tests, nitrogen adsorption tests and uniaxial compressive strength tests to study the impact of oil-based drilling fluid on shale  the results indicate that the lipophilic of shale has an obvious response to its mineral composition and organic matter characteristics  moreover, the stronger lipophilic is, the more serious wellbore instability problem caused by using oil-based drilling fluid becomes  after the immersion in the oil-based drilling fluid, the sem results show that a large number of micro-cracks are generated in the sample, but the effect on macro-cracks is not obvious; nitrogen adsorption results also show that the proportion of the micropores, the total porosity increases, but the average pore size decreases  meanwhile, the fracability of fracturing operation changes with the interaction between shale and drilling fluid  furthermore, based on fracture mechanics, wettability and interface properties have a significant effect on wellbore instability and fracture propagation  |introduction |increasing energy demand and decreasing conventional oil production have shifted the focus of the industry to unconventional resources, such as shale gas resources, which have emerged as an abundant and accessible source of energy  however, successful and sustainable development of shale gas reservoir is still faced with a set of drilling and operational challenges, such as wellbore instability and multi-lateral/multi-stage hydraulic fracturing [1, 2]  organic-rich shale gas formations are quite different from conventional shale formations due to the characteristics of hydrocarbon source rocks, such as rich organic matter and developed fracture networks  oil-based drilling fluids are widely used in the drilling operation of unconventional shale gas reservoirs [3], and shale gas wells drilled with oil-based drilling fluids perform better than those with water-based fluids  however, more and more problems during the drilling process indicate that oil-based drilling fluid is not the best choice [4, 5]  due to the long time immersion in oil-based drilling fluid, the physical and chemical characteristics of shale formations are bound to be influenced to a certain degree, thus maybe affecting wellbore stability in the drilling process and the initiation pressure and fracability in the process of fracturing operation  fracability can be used to evaluate the ability of rock to form a good fracture network  organic-rich shale gas formations contain a lot of natural fractures or shale beddings [6]  oil-based drilling fluids can invade along with a fracture network into formation, and can increase pore pressure of the fracture network to form a local high pressure zone  at the same time, filtrate invaded into shale fracture network may also provide a lubrication for fracture surface  oil-based drilling fluids require to maintain an alkaline condition to enhance the emulsion stability  however, alkali can corrode clay minerals, quartz and feldspar [7], which plays significant roles in triggering fracture generation and propagation, and wellbore instability | 
2016-566 	 dynamic triaxial study of direct shear fracturing and precipitation-induced transient permeability observed by in situ x-ray radiography |abstract: |precipitation and dissolution processes can modify fracture permeability in applications such as co2 sequestration, geothermal energy, oil and gas production, and nuclear waste disposal  in this study, we conduct a triaxial coreflood experiment while imaging with in situ x-ray radiography  the carbonate-rich utica specimen was fractured using direct shear methods at 20 °c and confining pressure of 3 4 mpa  permeability was measured continuously using a dilute bacl2 solution  the specimen's permeability increased significantly to 0 43 md immediately after fracturing at 60 mpa shear stress then decreased with continued fluid flow due to precipitate infilling of the fracture  precipitation was observed in real-time using x-ray radiographs  subsequent analysis showed that calcite in the shale had reacted with bacl2 to produce baco3, resulting in a 67% reduction in permeability  the precipitate was distributed throughout the fracture network but concentrated in regions with relatively narrow fracture apertures  while baco3 is an unlikely precipitate in a natural environment, the use of bacl2 greatly facilitated x-ray contrast with results having applications to other chemical systems that may be kinetically inhibited or difficult to study experimentally  this study sheds light on the use of chemical injectates as mitigation techniques for plugging undesired permeability  |introduction |understanding the controls of fracture permeability is important to assessing the economic viability of fracture-dominated oil & gas and geothermal resources as well as the environmental suitability of co2 sequestration and nuclear waste repositories  in this work, we consider chemical-reaction induced modification to fracture permeability  |chemical reactions impact fracture permeability through dissolution of fracture walls and asperities or by precipitation infilling  in the subsurface, chemical processes are coupled with stress such that changes in fracture porosity are coupled with changes in fracture stiffness or crystallization forces that modify fracture aperture  thus, dissolution processes can weaken asperities and facilitate the mechanical collapse of fractures leading to dissolution-induced reduction of permeability (detwiler 2008)  precipitation processes can prop-open fractures or even force open fractures through the force of crystallization (e g , noiriel et al  2010; wigand et al  2009)  as discussed by detwiler (2008), the potential effects of reaction on permeability are controlled by the relative rates of fluid flow and chemical reaction as expressed in the damkohler number (da)  he showed that dissolution of a fracture under normal stress in a kh2po4 chemical system can result in permeability enhancement where dissolution in the fracture is channelized at high da or permeability reduction at low da where dissolution is distributed and attacks asperities allowing fracture collapse | 
2016-569 	 monitoring rock damage caused by cyclic loading using seismic wave transmission and reflection |abstract: |laboratory experiments were conducted on prismatic indiana limestone specimens with a flaw, to examine the effect of uniaxial cyclic loading on crack growth and, most importantly, the effect of opening/closing of the crack on transmitted and reflected elastic waves  all specimens were initially subjected to a load that produced a kink at the flaw tips, and then were subjected to 20 loading-unloading cycles  the maximum applied load at each cycle was the load of kink initiation and the minimum load was such that no detachment between the specimen and loading platens occurred  after cyclic loading, the compressive load was increased until failure  digital image correlation (dic) was used to observe the damage evolution around the flaw tips and to monitor the opening/closing of the kink  at the same time, transmission and reflection of compressional and shear waves across the specimen were monitored  the dic results showed that the kinks that initiated from the flaw tips completely closed during unloading  the normalized amplitude of the transmitted waves showed a progressive decrease with additional cycles of loading until reaching a steady-state  such decrease in amplitude is thought to be related to additional damage induced to the kink due to the loading-unloading cycles  |introduction |the mechanical behavior of geomaterials is strongly affected by the presence of micro-cracks  a large number of experiments have been done on crack initiation, propagation, and coalescence in pre-cracked brittle materials and show that a number of cracks initiate from the tips of pre-existing cracks [2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 19-21, 24-26]  there are however two types of cracks that are most common: tensile and shear cracks (fig  1)  the tensile cracks initiate prior to the shear cracks and are stable, which means that an increase in load is required for propagation  the shear cracks are initially stable and may become unstable as crack coalescence and failure are approached  two types of shear cracks have been identified, based on their angle of initiation with respect to the flaw: coplanar or quasicoplanar and oblique  coplanar shear cracks make an angle smaller than 450 with the flaw, while oblique shear cracks make an angle larger than 450 [15]  prior experimental work was performed almost exclusively using monotonic loading  in addition, most of the observations in the experiments were made based on visual inspection using optical magnification or highspeed cameras  all of these studies have successfully identified the mechanical behavior of rock and cracking phenomena at the laboratory scale  microscopic characterization of new cracks inside the material and monitoring microcrack development under low amplitude cyclic loading is a very important topic that affects the response of fractured rock mass subjected to repetitive loading such as vibrations, cyclic thermal loading, seismic loading from remote earthquakes, traffic loading, and other ambient noise | 
2016-571 	 role of large scale heterogeneities on in-situ stress and induced stress fields |abstract: |at arma's 2006 symposium, maloney et al  (2006) presented a “reassessment of in situ stresses in the canadian shield” to assist in establishing representative in-situ stress conditions appropriate for sub-regional modeling activities  a recent updated is available from yong and maloney (2015)  in this article, it is demonstrated (a) how earth crust straining may affect the in-situ stress profile, (b) how the in-situ stress magnitudes vary in heterogeneous rock masses, and (c) what the consequences are for excavation stability in such variable stress fields  the first two points are discussed by presenting a reinterpretation of the data set published by corthesy et al  (1998)  for a hypothetical circular shaft with a defined rock mass profile, it is illustrated how large-scale heterogeneities modify the induced stresses at the excavation boundary and thus affect longitudinal variations in the depth of failure  it is concluded that the combination of stress and strength heterogeneities leads to a highly variable excavation behavior with localization of various failure modes  finally, it is demonstrated that the common assumption of far-field stress boundary conditions may lead to non-conservative model predictions when compared to far-field strain boundary conditions  |introduction |natural rock masses are heterogeneous in terms of modulus and strength  this paper was submitted in response to a call for contributions to the subject of “rock heterogeneity across all length scales” and to draw attention to the impact of rock mass heterogeneity on the in situ and excavation-induced stress field  in rock engineering, it is common practice to assume that the stress field is uniform and can be described by a single stress tensor  as a consequence, variations in excavation instability would have to be attributed to variations in rock mass strength alone  experience by the lead author during a recent litigation case, which unfortunately cannot be published, has shown that the stress field was highly modified by rock mass strength and modulus heterogeneities and that the excavation behavior changed drastically as a result of this variability in strength and stress  without reference to this particular case, simplified numerical (voronoi) models, calibrated on published data (corthesy et al , 1998), are used in the following to illustrate that: |variations in field measurements can be attributed to rock mass stiffness variations; |mining-induced stresses along an underground project can be highly varied; and the |variability in excavation behavior has to be attributed to variations in both strength and stress  | 
2016-575 	 developing the ground index (gi) for rock collapse assessment in tunneling |abstract: |assessing the possibility of rock collapse is important when tunneling in unfavorable geological conditions because damage can be minimized  a new methodology based on the rough set (rs) theory and the rock engineering systems (res) is proposed to quantitatively identify the tunnel surrounding rock conditions, and to provide the corresponding hazard level  rock collapse hazards from recent tunnel construction projects in fujian province, china, were investigated  on the basis of 164 compiled datasets, the ground index (gi) was defined  rs theory was implemented to identify reduct sets associated with the attributes while rock engineering systems (res) approach was employed to quantify the interactions between the factors affecting the ground conditions  24 independent cases were selected to validate the proposed gi by comparing predictions given by the gi with the field observations  the final results showed excellent agreement between predictions and observations which suggested that the gi could be used for a quantitative rock collapse hazard assessment of the tunnel surrounding rock  both methods indicated that the rock quality design, intactness coefficient, groundwater and discontinuity condition, are among the most important parameters controlling the conditions of the surrounding rocks  |introduction |the quantitative identification of the tunnel working face and the surrounding rock conditions in tunneling is very important since it can help in evaluating geo-engineering hazards associated with the tunnel construction and minimizing the related risks by adopting appropriate design and construction methods  in areas with complicated geological setting and prone to adverse geological hazards, unfavorable ground conditions are often encountered  this can considerably affect underground construction works  hazardous situations such as tunnel boring machine jamming, rock squeezing phenomena, water or mud inrush, rockburst, rock spalling, tunnel collapse, rockfall threaten the achievement of cost and schedule milestones  |recently, methods that could be used to quantify hazard occurrences in tunnel have been investigated, including: using a vulnerability index to assess geotechnical hazards (benardos and kaliampakos, 2004), laboratory simulations for rock burst and slabbing failure occurrence (gong et al , 2012), the interaction matrix of the rock engineering system to quantify rock behavior (kim et al , 2008;shin et al , 2009), geological drillings to assess the stability of ancient landslide crossed by tunnels (jiao et al , 2013), as well as a qualitative approach for rock mass classification to determine ground behavior and rock mass composition in underground excavations (stille and palmstrom, 2008)  irrespective of the adopted methodology, it is noted that the rock mass classification plays a key role in quantifying a hazard occurrence  meanwhile, a prime requirement to achieve this depends on the establishment of an objective rating system in which the weight of the system parameters are determined in a quantitative manner  as matter of fact, one of the problems with classification systems in rock engineering or in other related fields is the subjectivities they involve which lead to difficulties in determining unequivocally the rating system of a particular rock mass since the qualitative attributes that are often used, propagate a variety of uncertainties into the system | 
2016-576 	 numerical investigation of the effect of frictionally weak minerals on shear strength of faults |abstract: |recent observations suggest that the presence of frictionally weak minerals in a majority frictionally strong matrix may explain the reduced strength and instability in faults  experimental results on synthetic fault gouges using a mixture of a frictionally strong phase and a frictionally weak phase indicate that the fault can be weakened by even a small amount of frictionally weak minerals  these frictionally weak minerals weaken the fault by either acting as weak spots/clusters or as a through-going weak layer in the bulk gouge  a two-dimensional distinct element method (dem) numerical model using the particle flow code 2d (pfc 2d) is developed to investigate the effect of frictionally weak minerals on the bulk shear strength of fault gouge  mechanical response of particles is modeled using a linear-elastic contact model and coulomb's friction law  numerical direct shear experiments were performed on homogeneous mixtures of weak and strong mineral particles and also on heterogeneous mixtures consisting of a frictionally weak layer sandwiched in frictionally strong minerals  the weight percentage (wt%) of the frictionally weak mineral in the homogeneous mixtures and the relative thickness of the frictionally weak mineral layer in the heterogeneous mixtures are adjusted schematically to obtain the weakening regime of the bulk shear strength  a transition from high to low residual coefficient of friction is observed  specifically, for homogenous mixtures a sharp drop of bulk shear strength is observed with 25% of frictionally weak mineral presented in the mixture, and a dominant influence occurs at 50%; for heterogeneous mixtures, noticeable weakening is shown at a relative weak layer thickness of 0 05, and a dominant influence quickly follows at a relative thickness of 0 10  the observed weakening regime matches well with previous lab results using talc/quartz mixtures  |introduction |in nature, tectonic faults tend to slip at much lower resolved shear stress than the stresses inferred from rock mechanics experiments (engelder et al , 1975; dieterich, 1978; marone et al , 1990)  explanations to this difference between lab observations and natural phenomenon include low effective stress, elevated pore pressures (rice, 1992; faulkner and rutter, 2001) and dynamic weakening in which friction decreases above a threshold slip rate (melosh, 1996; di toro et al , 2006; ampuero and ben-zion, 2008)  recent field observations of the san andreas fault (moore and rymer, 2007) and an exhumed low angle normal fault in italy (collettini et al , 2009a, 2009b) show that the weakness of natural faults can be explained by the presence of talc; a frictionally weak mineral  earlier experiments using synthetic mixtures of salts and muscovite/kaolinite (bos and spiers, 2002; niemeijer and spiers, 2005, 2006) showed that weakening can occur with as low as 10% of frictional weak minerals  the shear strength of a fault greatly depends on its mineralogical composition (ikari et al , 2011; fang et al , 2015)  shear experiments using mixtures of talc and quartz sand (carpenter et al , 2009) suggested that in order to weaken the composite gouge, 30%-50% frictional weak mineral is needed  however, there were only 2-3 wt% of talc presented in these weak faults which is surprisingly less than the previous suggestions  the difference can be explained by the generation of a through-going localization zone during dynamic shearing, which greatly weakens the fault  this strong weakening effect of frictionally weak mineral in a majority frictionally strong matrix derives a question of how much the frictionally weak mineral in weight percentage (wt%) is needed; and in terms of localized weakening effect, how thick the weak localization zone is enough to weaken the fault  experiments have been conducted on synthetic gouge consisting of quartz sand as a strong phase and a through-going talc layer as a weak phase (niemeijer et al , 2009; moore and lockner, 2011)  the findings suggest that the frictional strength of the sample gouge decreases systematically with the increase in thickness of the talc layer, two critical values were proposed for a starting point of weakening relative to pure quartz sand and weakening domination point relative to pure talc, additionally, findings suggest that the permeability evolution of fractures is likely linked to such mineralogical properties (ishibashi et al , 2015) | 
2016-581 	 modeling of time-dependent rock failure in abaqus and pfc3d |abstract: |assessing long-term rock stability is an important aspect in the analysis of slopes, dam and bridge foundations, and other infrastructure  at such long time scales, rock failure occurs through time-dependent methods such as subcritical crack growth  natural analogs, such as caves, where rock breakdown has occurred undisturbed over tens to hundreds of thousands of years, can be used to study such failure  an on-going project is reconstructing the process of natural cave breakdown at kartchner caverns through lidar scanning of the cave geometry and rockfall accumulation and 3d damage modeling of the resulting point clouds  two modeling methods are compared in order to examine the importance of including time-dependence when analyzing rock behavior over long time scales  the first method is implemented as a fracture mechanics model through user subroutines in abaqus  damage occurs through calculation of decreasing rock bridge size from subcritical crack growth  the second method is implemented as a bonded particle model in pfc3d, using the flat-joint contact model for intact rock and the smooth-joint contact model for joints  damage occurs through strength reduction of the material properties  the trade-offs in the two models (relative computational simplicity vs  more direct inclusion of time dependence) are discussed  |introduction |assessing long-term rock stability is an important aspect in the analysis of slopes, dam and bridge foundations, and other infrastructure  rock behavior over tens to thousands of years must be anticipated when predicting the performance of, for example, an underground nuclear waste storage facility  at such long time scales, the time dependence of rock failure, typically ignored in short time scale analyses, has a significant effect and must be included in the analysis (epri, 2006)  time-dependent rock failure is thought to occur along pre-existing discontinuities through the failure of rock bridges (kemeny, 2003)  a rock bridge is a section of intact rock along an otherwise persistent discontinuity in a rock mass  some examples of rock bridge geometries are shown in fig  1  the scale of rock bridges can range from centimeters to meters, but typically the rock bridge area is only a small percentage of the total fracture surface area (frayssines and hantz, 2009)  over long time scales, crack growth initiating at the tips of the pre-existing discontinuity slowly decreases the size of a rock bridge  once the rock bridge size reaches zero (i e , the former intact portion is fully cracked), the stability provided by the rock bridge ceases and the discontinuity fails (kemeny, 2003) | 
2016-582 	 an sph approach to the simulation of hydraulic fracture propagation in naturally fractured rock medium |abstract: |the use of the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph) method is relatively recent for geomechanics problems  the meshless nature of the sph method has the potential to overcome the difficulties of mesh-based methods  in this paper, an attempt has been made to develop a numerical procedure for the sph method which enables integrated simulation of pressure driven hydraulic fracture (hf) propagation, including consideration of natural fracture (nf) interaction  in this procedure, a nf plane or joint plane is approximated by straight line segments connected by a discrete set of joint particles  the jump in the velocity field and the surface traction, due to the discontinuity, are determined using joint stiffness properties on these joint particles  joint points follow a mohr–coulomb friction law with a zero tension cutoff for modelling joint opening or shear behavior of the nf plane  for hf initiation and propagation in the continuous part of the domain, the model relies on the drucker-prager plasticity surface to predict the dilatancy aspect of the material response, and the grady-kipp damage model for tensile strain  this paper presents three numerical examples to show the capabilities of the proposed procedure for simulating hf-nf interaction  the first example deals with an internally pressurized circular hole under in-situ stress conditions, the second considers failure of a jointed circular rock sample, and last shows internally pressurized circular hole in the presence of a nf  |introduction |hydraulic fracturing in rock material is a highly complex process, where this complexity is further compounded by the interaction between pre-existing discontinuities such as a natural fracture networks, faults, and bedding planes  the propagation of a hydraulic fracture (hf) can be either arrested or redirected by a natural fracture (nf), where either case will lead to reactivation of the natural fracture  there are two big challenges in predicting the resultant hf network  first, the natural discontinuity planes have to be identified in terms of geometric and mechanical properties  second, an understanding of the mechanical deformation of rocks due to pressure driven fracture initiation, and propagation, in the presence of an in-situ stress state is required  moreover, the interaction between the hf and nf could cause dilation of the nf either in shear or tension  numerical simulation of hydraulic fracturing is an economical and efficient technique for understanding these complex phenomena  mesh-based continuum methods have the advantage of using classical nonlinear material models, however they do not always work well in a complex medium involving large deformation, multiple intersecting fractures and their interactions with pre-existing discontinuities  in particular, special treatments and assumptions have to be made for modelling fracture propagation, closing of an opened fracture and shear, which introduce numerical and geometric complexities in the implementation and lead to degradation of accuracy | 
2016-583 	 pore-scale modeling of the effect of cementation on rock indentation test |abstract: |during co2 sequestration, petrophysical and geomechanical alteration of host formations can occur due to mineral dissolution and precipitation  at the core scale, laboratory tests have shown that sandstone or siltstone can be weakened through either naturally or artificially co2-related alteration, but few quantitative studies have been performed to fully investigate the mechanism  based on the hypothesis that co2 alters the integrity of rock structure by changing cements rather than grains, we attempt to explain the degradation of cementation due to long-term contact with co2 and how it leads to changes in rock mechanical properties  pore-scale modeling by means of the discrete element method (dem) is used to perform the numerical simulations  the model is verified against the analytical cavity expansion model (cem) and validated against an experimental indentation test on sandstone without co2-alteration  the experimental result for the same sandstone but with co2-alteration is reproduced by fitting one microscopic parameter of cementation under the same simulation setup  the result demonstrates that the co2-related degradation of rock properties can be numerically attributed to the weakening of cementation microscopic properties  our study indicates that it is possible to describe the co2-related degradation through particle-scale mechanisms  |introduction |geologic sequestration of co2 is proposed as an economically viable approach to mitigate the co2 emissions from fossil fuel consumption  experiments at both field and laboratary scales have shown that injected co2 is able to change the species composition through mineral dissolution and precipitation (hovorka et al , 2006, 2013; carroll et al , 2011; lu et al , 2012)  the occurrence of geochemical reactions initiated by the dissolution of co2 can have either positive or negative impact  on the one hand, the trapping of co2 could benefit from some of the reactions transforming the dissolved co2 into new carbonate minerals (bachu et al , 2007)  on the other hand, other reactions may jeopardize the structure integrity of reservoir and caprock formations by altering the petrophysical and geomechanical properties (rutqvist and tsang, 2002; espinoza et al , 2011; rinehart et al , 2014; renard et al , 2008)  positive feedback mechanisms leading to rock degradation at co2 storage sites may facilitate the leakage of co2 from host formations  |at the core scale, laboratory tests have shown that sandstones and siltstones can be weakened through either naturally or artificially co2-related alteration (sun et al , 2016), which may be the result of dissolution of interparticle cement (major et al , 2014)  core-flood experiments are a platform for the artificially co2-related alteration but with the limitation of extended experiment durations and complexity (carroll et al , 2011, 2013; rinehart et al , 2014)  autoclave experiments are easy to perform whereas the penetration depth of co2 is limited to millimeters (rimmele et al , 2010)  thus, micromechanical tests which can probe the reacted skin provide a diagnostic tool for rocks reacted in autoclave experiments (sun et al , 2016)  indentation tests have been widely adopted to study the mechanical behavior of different materials (oliver and pharr, 2004; kumar et al , 2012)  the assessment of mechanical degradation of the rocks subject to co2-related alteration can be easily and quickly achieved by indentation tests | 
2016-585 	 rock failure process in indirect tension using sph method |abstract: |this paper uses smoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph) to analyze failure mechanism by predicting initiation and subsequent propagation of cracks without any special treatment or assumption on the fracturing process  an elasto-plastic damage model is incorporated into the sph framework to enable non-linear behavior of the material  this constitutive model accounts for the irreversible process caused by plastic strain accumulation and the degradation of material properties due to damage initiation and development  a circular disc loaded diametrically is simulated within the proposed framework  it has been shown that the tensile stress distribution at the central area of the disc agrees well with the theoretical results  in order to study the effect of the loading angle on the failure process, three different central angles of the boundary load are considered in the numerical simulation  in addition to the circular disc, numerical simulations of a ring specimen under diametrically concentrated load are also presented  |introduction |tensile strength of rock is one of the major concern in the study of rock property along with other properties which plays an important role in various geomechanical activities like blasting of rocks, hydraulic fracturing of a borehole, drilling and excavation in mining  insight into the understanding of the failure process and prediction of failure paths remain a big challenge for a wide range of problems encountered in the field of rock mechanics and rock engineering  experimental studies indicate that failure processes are generally initiated by the development of microcracks, propagation and interaction of several cracks, defects and inherent flaws  mechanical properties and failure characteristics of rock materials are sensitive to the loading conditions  for example, the brazilian test, as an indirect tensile test, is commonly conducted to determine the tensile strength of rock  the failure of the specimen is expected along the loading diameter into two halves, but another failure mode can occur near the loading boundary  moreover, the tensile strength and failure characteristics can vary significantly with the specimen size and loading conditions  |the prediction of breakage phenomenon and failure mode remains a big challenge in the experimental test  in view of that, many micromechanical models have been proposed  the concept and theories of fracture mechanics have been applied to predict fracture generation and propagation in rock medium (paterson & wong 2005)  computational methods are noticeably well suited to investigate the process of rock degradation and failure, such as the lattice based model (blair & cook 1998) in which the local element is considered to be failed by tensile cracking if the local tensile stress exceeds the local tensile strength, the local degradation model on flac (fang & harrison 2002), the synthetic rock mass model based on pfc (potyondy & cundall 2004), and the digital image approaches based on the flac (chen et al  2004), fem (ortiz et al  1987) for localized failure  tang et al  (2000) analyzed the rock deformation, both pre- and post-failure using finite element code, in which the elastic modulus and strength of the individual elements were assumed to follow the weibull distribution | 
2016-586 	 influence of stress on the permeability of a three-dimensional fractured sedimentary layer |abstract: |this paper presents a stress-induced variable aperture model to characterise the effect of polyaxial stress conditions on the permeability of a three-dimensional (3d) fractured sedimentary layer  the 3d fracture network is created by extruding a 2d outcrop pattern of a limestone bed that exhibits a ladder structure consisting of a “through-going” joint set abutted by later short fractures  geomechanical modelling of the fractured rock is achieved by the 3d finite-discrete element method (femdem), which can capture the deformation of matrix blocks, the variation of stress fields, the reactivation of pre-existing fractures and the propagation of new cracks  a joint constitutive model (jcm) is implemented to simulate the rough wall interaction behaviour of individual fractures associated with roughness characteristics  the combined jcm-femdem model gives realistic fracture behaviour with respect to opening, closing, shearing and dilatancy, and includes the recognition of the important size effect  a series of 3d geomechanical simulations is conducted for the fractured rock under various polyaxial in-situ stresses  fluid flow is further modelled for the stressed but static solid skeletons based on the hybrid finite element-finite volume method (fefvm)  the magnitude of the equivalent permeability varies significantly with respect to the change of stress ratio  |introduction |natural fractures are ubiquitous in crustal rocks in the form of faults, bedding planes, joints and veins over different length scales (lei and wang, 2016)  these naturally occurring discontinuities often comprise complex networks and dominate the geomechanical and hydromechanical behaviour of subsurface media (rutqvist and stephansson, 2003)  the understanding of the nontrivial effects of fractures on the overall behaviour of such highly disordered geological media has important implications for many engineering applications including geothermal energy, nuclear repository safety and petroleum recovery  |discrete fracture networks (dfns) are often used to mimic naturally faulted or jointed geological structures (dershowitz and einstein, 1988)  compared to the conventional dual porosity model (warren and root, 1963) and analytical solution for mathematically idealised discontinuity networks (oda, 1985), the discrete fracture approach possesses the advantage of explicit representation of fracture geometries together with specific description of hydraulic transmissivity (herbert, 1996)  flow properties, such as the block or equivalent permeability tensor, of a finite-sized fracture system can be studied from steady state fluid flow modelling (lang et al , 2014; renard and de marsily, 1997) | 
2016-587 	 vast system of dense intersecting fractures: a key feature of hydraulic fracturing of gas shale |abstract: |this contribution presents a multi-physics modeling of fluid-driven propagation of a vast network of fractures and open joints in shale, with a fracture spacing of about 10 cm, as deduced from the observed gas extraction history at wellhead  because of the vast number of fractures and quasibrittle nature of shale, the fracture of shale is analyzed in a smeared way by the crack band model  one key idea is that, to model lateral fractures branching from a primary fracture wall, fracture pressurization, by viscous poiseuille type flow, of compressible (proppant-laden) fracturing water must be complemented with the pressurization of a sufficient volume of micropores and microfractures by darcy-type water diffusion into the shale, which generates tension along the existing fracture walls, overcoming the strength limit of the cohesive-crack or crack-band model  a second key idea is that enforcing the equilibrium of stresses in fractures, pores and water, with the generation of tension in the solid phase, requires a new three-phase medium concept, transitional between biot's two-phase medium and terzaghi's effective stress  finiteelement/finite-volume simulations demonstrate the growth of a large hydraulic fracture system  study of the effects of various parameters could increase the efficacy of fracturing and reduce water injection  |introduction |the recent advances in hydraulic fracturing of oil and gas bearing shale, which have made the us selfsufficient in energy for the first time in a half century, have been nothing less than astonishing  in 2010 shale gas production accounted for 23% of the total us gas production and it is projected to reach 50% by 2035 even at the current extraction efficiency  although many aspects of hydraulic fracturing are well understood by now [1, 16, 30, 33, 44, 53, 54, 56], the details of topology, geometry, and evolution of the fracture system are not  progress in this aspect of fracturing promises increasing the rate of gas extraction, currently standing at only 5% to 15%  |based on the equations relating the measured gas flux histories at the wellhead (in fayetteville basin) to the typical permeability of shale [34, 35, 59], a recent study [13] concluded that the spacing of fractures and opened rock joints in gas shale must be on the order of 0 1 m  because the typical depth of a gas or oil bearing stratum of shale is about 2 5-3 km [24, 49] (fig  1), the overburden pressure is assumed to exceed the fluid pressure  consequently, all the fractures and joints are modeled as essentially vertical, and no horizontal fractures allowed |

2016-598 	 the compaction behavior and permeability evolution of broken rocks: mechanical model and prediction |abstract: |this paper proposed a conceptual model of broken rock mass compaction based on elastic theory by simplifying this compressing process and assuming the connection is a similar cubic mass without huge void space  with this simplification, the stress-strain constitutive law is established  the compacted rock mass permeability evolution was modeled based on the cubic law of porosity and permeability  the mechanical model was coupled into permeability evolution model  the predicted permeability evolution by coupled model is similar with reported experimental results  the modeled permeability results were indirectly validated using the weak sandstone input parameters  compared to intact rock mass, we found that the stress-strain curve of compacted rock mass takes a longer stress-strain path to reach the linearity due to the void space compaction resulted from the friction slipping and re-arrangement of grains  it was also found that the grain elastic modulus does not contribute to the overall bulk compaction and permeability reduction at the initial compaction stage and it will control the permeability evolution only after the broken rock got fully compacted when it can be treated as intact rock mass  the proposed models will potentially lay foundation for the future permeability and caving behavior characterizations using numerical simulation for complex gob area  |introduction |long-wall mining is a very production-efficient coal mining technology with advantages including high recovery, safe working environment, operator-friendly roof management, easy mine management and highly-developed mechanization  in a typical long-wall operation, a working panel is usually more than 200 m in width and 2000 m in length  during the operation, the panel progressively moves forward as the coal is continuously removed and the immediate roof instantly caves behind the hydraulic supports  however, the overlying rock strata hang up and the span increases with mining advance  the overlying rock strata act like a beam and will break into large blocks until the span reaches to its limiting strength value  the broken rocks composed with immediate roof and overlying strata fill in the caved zone termed as “gob” or “goaf”  to meet the health and safety standards, gob gas control is being a challenging task due to its complexity of the gas flow behavior  |the gob with highly irregular shape and different granular broken rocks could reach 4-11 times the thickness of the mining height  (karacan and luxbacher, 2010) and the broken rocks would be gradually compressed by the overburden weight resulting from mining disturbance as shown in figure 1 | 
2016-611 	 dem modeling of the propagation of stress-induced borehole breakout in shale sample |abstract: |shales make up more than 75% of drilled oil and gas formations worldwide, and cause most wellbore-instability problems during and after drilling  understanding borehole failure mechanism is important in optimizing well production  in this study, the initiation and propagation of borehole breakout under monotonically increased far-field stress at reduced-scale are investigated using discrete element method (dem)  the micro-structure of mancos shale is captured by explicitly representing the presence of weakness with a series of parallel smooth joint contacts  square samples (50 mm<u+00d7>50 mm) with a 10 mm borehole in the center are loaded until the formation of breakouts  effects of different factors on the borehole breakout process are evaluated systematically, including the borehole diameter, rock anisotropy and far-field stress conditions  reduction of borehole diameter significantly increases the hydrostatic pressure  rock anisotropy plays an important role in the stress state around wellbore which lead to the formation of preferred cracks under hydrostatic stress  under anisotropic far-field stresses, v-shapes borehole breakouts align with the direction of minimum principal stress in isotropic model and close to the minimum principal stress orientation in anisotropic model  results from this study agree well with those obtained in laboratory on hollow cylinder tests and can provide in-depth understanding on the grain-scale mechanisms that control the previous observations in laboratory and field on the borehole instability in anisotropic rocks  |introduction |in recent years, with the increasing exploitation of unconventional shale gas/oil reservoirs using deviated drilling, a number of borehole instability problems were experienced in field (okland and cook, 1998)  stressinduced borehole breakouts cause major problems during and after drilling  the integrity of wellbore is influenced by several factors, e g , the in-situ stress state, anisotropy of rock deformability and strength, the applied mud weight, and drilling direction (zhang, 2013)  moreover, horizontal drilling has been extensively used in anisotropic shale formations, which are more sensitive to the effect of rock anisotropy (ong and roegiers, 1993)  therefore, understanding the underlying mechanisms for borehole breakout mechanisms associated with anisotropic formations is essential in optimizing well production  |numerical and analytical analyses have been extensively adopted to evaluate and predict the failure of borehole in anisotropic rock formations for several decades  most rock mechanics analysis on stability of openings in rock formations should involve two key steps, first, the calculation of borehole stress distribution for rocks, and second, a stress-related failure criteria (gaede et al , 2012)  among the numerous proposed models in the literature, a linear elastic and isotropic constitutive model, in conjunction with a linear failure criterion, is perhaps the most common approach  however, shale is known to exhibit anisotropic properties not only for their elastic behavior but also for their strength due to their laminated structure  the analytical solution of the nearwellbore stress distribution in anisotropic formations was developed by amadei et al  (1983)  the determined stress field is then used to evaluate the damage of the formation in the borehole vicinity  stress redistribution after the creation of fractures is a dynamic process which is difficult to be captured by constitutive modeling  these uncertainties make it difficult to predict and control failure around underground openings | 
2016-613 	 on-site visualization methods of axial forces in ground supporting members without using electricity |abstract: |three new methods for identifying axial forces in ground anchor or rock bolt are presented  unlike in traditional methods that rely on the use of an electronic device, such as strain gauges or load cells, these new methods do not use electronic devices for reading data, but instead use mechanical schemes to measure axial forces at the same time  since the methods are electricity free, they are maintenance free, long-lasting and can be produced at low costs  the methods are also beneficial in terms of safety management since the costs of axial forces measurements are low and can visualized for workers at all times  the concepts for designing the new devices, lab test results and some field application examples are introduced in this paper  |introduction |it is of primary importance to grasp axial forces in ground supporting members, such as rock bolts or ground anchors as pointed by conover (2010)  as they are installed with an important mission to suppress deformation of rock masses, it is ideal that axial forces acting in them are grasped at all times for the purpose of safety management  standard methods for monitoring axial forces are based on use of load cell inserted behind a base plate, or strain gauges attached to main tendon or rock bolt (for example, hyett and spearing, 2012)  these schemes require electronics hardware for data collection  on-site visualization of measured axial force, using electricity, has been proposed by akutagawa (2012) and the importance of sharing measured information on a real-time basis has been pointed out by izumi et al  (2014)  however, it is often the case that axial forces of up to only 5% of all the ground supporting members are usually monitored, if at all, because of required cost to do so  in order to increase the ratio of monitored ground anchors or rock bolts, for the sake of safety management, a new series of techniques, all of which work without using electricity, were developed to measure axial forces as 1) needle rotation, 2) magnified deformation between a specially created gap on an anchor plate and 3) change in crack patterns appearing on a bearing plate of a rock bolt  principles and applications of these new techniques are introduced in this paper | 
2016-614 	 stress path evolution during fluid injection into geological formations |abstract: |safe injection of a fluid, like carbon dioxide (co2), into geological formations is an essential part of co2 storage and enhanced oil recovery (eor) projects  injection causes pressure changes inside the reservoir, thus changing effective and total stresses inside and outside of the reservoir  these changes can bring the reservoir and/or its surroundings to failure conditions  the existence of faults and weak zones increases the likelihood of failure in rock masses depending on the amount of the injection-induced changes and the formation properties  this paper discusses the stress changes in different reservoir and injection conditions  to do so, an in-house numerical code (mdem) was used  analysis indicates that the pressure buildup can significantly change the total and effective stresses  also, the presence of a fault can influence the stress changes at the fault vicinity, both in the cap rock and the upper portion of the reservoir depending on the fault properties and the in situ stress regime  simulation results show that the upper portion of the reservoir and the cap rock experience a greater decrease in the mean effective stresses and a greater increase in the deviatoric stress in the footwall of the fault in reverse faulting stress regime  this means that the presence of faults can bring some parts of the reservoir and the cap rock to a more unstable condition  but this does not necessary mean that the fault is unstable itself  analysis indicates that due to injection, i e , unloading of the reservoir, faults can deform elastically and the pore pressure difference between the reservoir and the cap rock and/or underlying layer leads to different stress changes compared to the reservoir center  |introduction |fluid injection operations related to geo-energies are becoming more frequent  geo-energies aim at significantly reducing carbon dioxide (co2) emissions to the atmosphere to mitigate climate change  in particular, carbon capture and storage (ccs) has been proposed as one of the most feasible options in the short-term to reduce co2 emissions (iea, 2010)  nevertheless, the cost of ccs may hinder the deployment of ccs projects  thus, giving an additional value to co2 injection through its utilization to obtain an economic benefit will motivate co2 storage in the subsurface  an option of carbon capture, utilization and storage (ccus) is enhanced oil recovery using co2 (co2-eor), as it has been done at weyburn, canada, since 2000 (verdon et al , 2011)  |most of the research involving geomechanics related to geologic carbon storage considers extensive aquifers without including faults (e g , gor et al , 2013; vilarrasa, 2014; goodarzi et al , 2015)  however, the pressure perturbation cone will extend over large distances (up to hundreds of km) for the duration of co2 injection, which is planned to last over several decades (birkholzer et al , 2009; vilarrasa and carrera, 2015)  thus, faults present in the far-field will be affected by injection  additionally, the available storage formations will not always be extensive and injection may have to be done in reservoirs limited by faults (castelletto et al , 2013), like at snohvit, norway (hansen et al , 2013)  furthermore, mature oil reservoirs for co2-eor are usually compartimentalized, so the assumption of extensive formation may not be applicable | 
2016-620 	 failure criterion with intermediate stress and two friction angles |abstract: |for many rock types, mohr-coulomb (mc) failure criterion is a reasonable approximation to strength data, featuring a linear relation with two principal stresses and two material parameters that describe a stress intercept (e g  uniaxial compression or uniform triaxial tension) and pressure sensitivity (e g  internal friction angle ?)  a criticism of mc is the absence of the intermediate principal stress  paul-mohr-coulomb (pmc) criterion removes that limitation by including three principal stresses  pmc has the advantage over other multi-axial stress criteria in that three material constants, such as one stress intercept and two friction angles, one for compression ?c and one for extension ?e, are readily identified  |pmc failure criterion is reviewed and data from a series of conventional triaxial compression and extension experiments on indiana limestone are analyzed  the extension friction angle is larger than the compression friction angle, a sufficient but not necessary condition of the intermediate stress effect  to capture the behavior of the rock in multi-axial loading, pmc is extended to include the results of plane strain compression experiments through the construction of two planes with six parameters  |introduction |a failure criterion can always be written as a function of principal stresses <u+03c3>i <u+2265> <u+03c3>ii <u+2265> <u+03c3>iii or <u+03c3>1, <u+03c3>2, <u+03c3>3 with no regard to magnitude  as proposed by paul (1968), and in a special form by haythornthwaite (1962), the simplest failure criterion applicable to rock in the brittle regime is a linear function: |(equation) |meyer and labuz (2013) named this failure criterion paul-mohr-coulomb (pmc) and wrote it as |(equation) |where vo is the theoretical – it is not measured – uniform triaxial (all-around equal) tensile strength and |(equation) |where ?c is the friction angle for compression (<u+03c3>ii = <u+03c3>iii) and ?e is the friction angle for extension (<u+03c3>ii = <u+03c3>iii)  pmc can be evaluated by performing conventional triaxial testing on a right circular cylinder, where axial stress <u+03c3>a |is applied independent of radial stress <u+03c3>r to achieve either compression failure, which involves axial shortening, or extension failure, which involves axial lengthening  note that mohr-coulomb (mc) criterion is recovered when ?c = ?e = ? (nc = ne), with vosin? = socos?; so is the shear stress intercept on a mohr plane known as cohesion  pmc and mc are approximations to the observed failure response, which exhibits a nonlinear variation of strength with mean stress p = (<u+03c3>1+<u+03c3>2+<u+03c3>3)/3, although pmc contains the intermediate principal stress <u+03c3>ii, which for many rock types, influences strength (paterson and wong 2005; mogi 2007; haimson and rudnicki 2010; ingraham et al  2013; cornet 2015) | 
2016-621 	 applications for numerical modeling of blast induced rock fracture |abstract: |rock blasting is an economically efficient method to break and move rock  an improved predictive capability of blast outcomes leads to greater efficiency  numerical modeling of rock blasting is beginning to see wide spread practical use  the physical processes occurring in rock blasting span six orders of magnitude in length-scale, time-scale and pressure  the interactive physical processes involved are time-dependent, non-linear, difficult to quantify experimentally and occur in a discontinuous, heterogeneous medium  these factors present a significant challenge to the modeler  itasca consulting group has developed a three dimensional numerical model of rock blasting based on the discrete element method  the software, called blo-up, was developed as part of the industry sponsored hybrid stress blast model (hsbm) project  the model is unique as it employs a combination of continuous and discrete numerical methods  blo-up is a model of the complete blasting process including detonation, crushing, fragmentation, burden movement and muckpile formation  this paper gives a description of the modeling method and a summary of recent applications  recent applications include (i) analysis of pre-split and trim blast designs to limiting high wall damage and (ii) optimization of sub-level cave ring design  |introduction |since 2001, itasca has been a member of the hybrid stress blast model (hsbm) project with the goal of developing a numerical model of the rock blasting process  the software created by itasca, called blo-up, uses a unique combination of continuous and discontinuous numerical methods to represent the key processes occurring during blasting  |itasca presently is involved in the hsbm implementation project, which seeks to prove the quality of blo-up model predictions in real world blasting  field-scale bench and underground blasting tests currently are being conducted to validate and improve the model  the goal of the software is to provide blasting engineers a high-quality predictive model of blast outcomes  application areas include mine to mill optimization, grade movement predictions and pit wall damage studies | 
2016-624 	 using scratch tests for rock strength determination in discrete element method |abstract: |discrete element method (dem) has been used in many areas to capture the behavior of non-continuous systems  several factors, however have restricted its application in geomechanics  one of the main drawbacks of this method is the extremely high cpu time required to model a relatively small rock sample with realistic grain size  it has been shown previously that the cutting specific energy, derived from the tangential force, estimates the specific energy  in this study, mechanical properties of a bentheimer sandstone was determined by laboratory testing  the commercial particle flow code in 3d (pfc3d) was used to simulate the rock sample  micro-properties of the sample were calibrated to match the lab results  extensive sensitivities carried out on cutter-to-particle size ratio, depth of cut, cutting speed and back-rake angle  the results showed that the cutter-to-particle size needs to be large enough for strength estimation  the fracture generation pattern was investigated and a peak at the beginning of all tests identified to be related to the formation of fractures ahead of the cutter  it was concluded that under controlled parameter range, the unconfined compressive strength of rock samples can be estimated by scratching test  a comparison of the required cpu time is presented, which shows significant reduction in the computation time  the main advantage was the ability to calibrate the micro-properties of samples with realistic grain sizes and shapes  using ucs test simulation for this purpose was not practical, mainly due to hardware and time restrictions  |introduction |the uniaxial compressive strength (ucs) is the most important geomechanical input parameter for geomechanical modelling (reyer and philipp, 2014)  it is the most frequently used procedure for mechanical characterization and the only criteria for numerous classifications of rocks (borba et al, 2014)  |isrm standards for ucs measurement requires compressing a cylindrical plug between two metallic caps in a stiff system  the compressional stress on the rock sample increases gradually until the sample fails  the test results in the rock's ucs, young's modulus and poisson's ratio  |the method, although being popular in geomechanics, has several drawbacks  the samples need to be perfectly cut and polished from intact rock  slight imperfections on the edges can have significant effects on the failure stress  the standard ucs test is destructive and the crushed samples normally cannot be used for any further testing  the results are also known to be sensitive to parameters like moisture content  the samples need to be chosen such that it is representative of the rock body  this may not be possible in the heterogeneous, fractured or layered rocks (richard et al, 2012)  the final measured strength is considered as the average for the interval of coring and it cannot capture the strength variation in smaller intervals | 
2016-625 	 hydraulic fracture sensitivity study with a fully-coupled microseismic geomechanics model |abstract: |the paper presents a tutorial of the impact that various geomechanical properties and injection characteristics have on the fracture geometry and corresponding microseismicity  the systematic sensitivity study also points to a workflow for using field microseismicity to calibrate the geomechanical models, which can then be used as an optimization tool for future hydraulic fracture treatments in similar wells  a number of sensitivity studies of model input parameters are investigated including stress anisotropy, well orientations, dfn properties, and fluid viscosities  in addition, sensitivity studies are also used to understand the effect of various operational parameters on changes in various drilling and stimulation parameters  a series of charts showing the sensitivity of the model results (fracture geometry, net pressure, reservoir contact and microseismic activity) to both reservoir and completion parameters  the estimated results of these changes can then be used to guide field testing and fine-tune drilling and completions  geomechanical attributes of the hydraulic fracture models can be imported in reservoir simulators for further optimization  |introduction |many standard hydraulic fracture simulators were developed for single fractures with simple planar geometries  their ability to model multi-stage, multi-cluster fracturing of horizontal wells is generally very limited because it is often added using approximations and empirical correlations  in this work, a fully hydraulically-mechanical coupled 3-d model (damjanac and cundall, 2013) is used to conduct a comprehensive sensitivity study of factors affecting hydraulic fracture geometry (length, width and height), proppant placement and microseismicity during the stimulation of a horizontal well  a thorough understanding of these parameters on the reservoir geomechanics can be used as guiding principles for engineering design  |an important aspect of geomechanical modeling is the initial conditions, including stresses, fractures and mechanical properties  gray et al , (2012) estimates geomechanical and stress parameters within a reservoir from analysis of 3d seismic data  in order to fully exploit the value proposition of seismic reservoir characterization, a workflow is needed to transform the information into a complete engineering tool  an appropriate method will improve decisions of drilling wells and hydraulic fracture stimulation  a geomechanical simulation of hydraulic fracture networks is a way of integrating discrete fracture networks, reservoir elastic and stress properties from 3d seismic to model expected hydraulic fracture characteristics and ultimately predict the expected microseismic response  a calibrated geomechanical model will facilitate the geological earth model and microseismic data with engineering injection parameters for a fully integrated interpretation of the hydraulic fracture |

2016-627 	 the application of cement sheath failure criterion in determining the wellbore internal pressure window |abstract: |cement sheath is expected to provide mechanical zonal isolation and borehole integrity during well construction and well life  the damage of the cement sheath may result in abnormal annulus pressure and potential leakage  so internal wellbore pressure window based on cement failure is introduced to preserve zonal isolation during different well stages  a two-dimensional analytical model using a multi-layer thick-wall cylinder is applied for calculating stress distribution in the casing-cement-formation system  in the model, we assumed perfect bonding (continuous stress and displacement) at the interfaces and plane-strain condition  then the internal pressure limits can be obtained using the cement failure criteria for both axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric stress fields  analytical solutions of the 2d model subjected to the axisymmetric stress field showed that the stress state, the mechanical properties of casing, cement sheath and formation, cased wellbore geometry and cement strength parameters both have effects on the internal pressure window, which provides guidance for the cement design  this method provides petroleum engineers a robust tool to maintain cement sheath integrity  |introduction |cement sheath, as a part of well barriers, is expected to provide mechanical zonal isolation and borehole integrity during well construction and well life [1]  the damage of the cement sheath may result in abnormal annulus pressure and potential leakage  hence, the increasing awareness of avoiding the cement sheath failure has been raised among researchers  thus internal wellbore pressure window based on the cement failure is introduced to control the wellbore pressure during different well stages for safety  |after cement sets, casing-cement-sheath system withstand the stresses induced by the well events and maintain integrity during the life of well [2]  however, cement sheath, casing and formation with different mechanical properties have different failure conditions  many cases showed that abnormal annular pressure occurs without casing failure [1], which means that in some conditions the possibility of cement failure is higher than that of casing failure  so it is necessary to develop a model based on cement failure instead of casing failure, since cement failure happens prior to casing failure  on the other side, cement failure may destroy the wellbore integrity, creating flow channel for oil/gas migration between different formations  excessive pressure and temperature change during well operations lead to significant damage to the cement sheath [3]  thus we need to develop a model to determine the internal wellbore pressure window maintaining cement sheath integrity (neglecting temperature variation) during different well stages |

2016-641 	 the preliminary exploration of coal and gas outburst based on static-dynamic coupling loading and effective stress theory |abstract: |this paper proposes a novel understanding of the mechanisms of coal and gas outbursts based on static-dynamic coupling loading and effective stress theory  previous mechanisms of coal and gas outburst have a problem in describing the failure process of coal  static-dynamic coupling loading is required to fully understand the development process of coal and gas outburst  the effective stress theory is also introduced to analyze the coal and gas outburst due to its similarity with that of sand vibrating liquefaction  our results show that coal experiences deformation of shear compression instead of dilatancy in the development process of coal and gas outburst  furthermore, coal not only absorbs in-situ stress, but also endures dynamic loading  in particular, the measured data suggests that when approaching the dangerous region of coal and gas outburst, coal seam gas pressure significantly rises with increasing compressive deformation of coal seam  these results validate our proposal  additionally, a physical-mechanics model is established to realize quantitative analysis of the mechanism of coal and gas outburst  |introduction |nowadays, a comprehensive action hypothesis (xo?ot, 1966, and bufan, 1985) has been widely used in the study of mechanisms of coal and gas outbursts, which is regarded as comprehensive action results of in-situ stress, physical and mechanics properties of coal, and coal seam gas pressure  under the guidance of comprehensive action hypothesis, great attention has been paid to describe the mechanics failure mechanisms of coal and gas outbursts from different aspects (zhemin, 1982  zhongcheng, 1987  shinin, 1990  mengtao, 1991  chenglin and bin, 1995  shaolin, 1999  deyong, 2003  qianting, 2008)  mechanics basis of these mechanisms is mainly derived from traditional rock mechanics  these mechanisms have provided a powerful theoretical guideline for the prediction and prevention in coal and gas outbursts  however, based on traditional rock mechanics, dilatancy cannot explain the rise of coal seam gas pressure during coal and gas outburst which has been observed at site  actually, coal not only absorbs in-situ stress, but also endures dynamic loading which is not taken into consideration in the traditional rock mechanics  coal and gas outburst always occurs in the region which contains tectonic coal  however, mechanics properties of tectonic coal under static-dynamic coupling loading have not been investigated yet  additionally, we find that coal and gas outburst has a similarity with sand vibrating liquefaction, as they are both about granular element under staticdynamic coupling loading  therefore, this paper proposes a novel mechanism of coal and gas outbursts based on effective stress theory and static-dynamic coupling loading theory  our work includes theoretical analysis, site validation, and model establishment | 
2016-643 	 an analytical solution for wellbore stability problem using strain hardening drucker-prager plasticity model |abstract: |in this paper, an exact analytical solution for the wellbore boundary value problem is derived, in an elastoplastic porous rock formation  the rock is modelled as drucker-prager material with the incorporation of hardening behaviour depending on the evolving of the plastic deviatoric strain  by adopting the small strain deformation in the elastic region while large strain deformation in the plastic region, the wellbore stability problem under undrained condition is formulated as solving a system of first order ordinary differential equations in the plastic zone  the illustration numerical example shows the distributions of stress components and the pore pressure around the borehole, in addition to the evolving stress path for a rock point at the borehole surface due to the wellbore drilling  the major advantage of the calculated wellbore drilling curve lies in the fact that it can track the deformation responses of the borehole surface from elastic to elastoplastic states and down to the ultimate strength condition if needed, thus providing much more flexibility and more appropriate mud pressure design over the conventional elastic-brittle models  |introduction |the minimum (critical) mud pressure required to maintain the wellbore stable is often predicted using elastic or poroelastic brittle models, which assume the borehole collapse occurs whenever the calculated elastic/poroelastic stress state at a point surrounding the wellbore attains certain failure criteria of the rock formation (cui et al , 1997; al-ajmi and zimmerman, 2006; zare-reisabadi et al , 2012; kanfar et al , 2015)  the elastic/poroelastic model is simple yet well known to be overly conservative (veeken et al , 1989; charlez, 1997)  to overcome this disadvantage usually a more advanced elastoplastic constitutive model needs to be considered, to incorporate realistically the nonlinear behaviour of the rocks (charlez, 1997; potts and zdravkovic, 1999), so as to predict the wellbore deformation more accurately and therefore a more reasonable estimation of the critical mud weight (graziani and ribacchi, 1993; bradford and cook, 1994; papanastasiou and durban, 1997; charlez and roatesi, 1999; muller et al , 2009) | 
2016-647 	 stability of circular tunnels excavated in rock masses under gravity loading |abstract: |the stability of deep circular tunnels excavated in rock materials subjected to gravitational loading is assessed by construction of the ground response curves  the reduction of internal support pressure results in the development of a plastic (broken) zone around the tunnel  due to the self-weight of the broken material, crown of the tunnel experiences the highest radial convergence  in this study, considering the weight of broken material at the tunnel crown, a new analytical method for determining the ground response curve of tunnels excavated in the generalized hoek-brown rock mass is developed  the effects of gravitational loading on the ground response curve are investigated for several tunnel cases  the results show that in poor quality rock masses, gravity has significant effect on the ground response curve of the tunnel and the tunnel stability and higher support pressure is required to limit the convergence at the tunnel crown than the tunnel sidewalls  |introduction |determination of the stresses and displacements around circular openings has been one of the most fundamental problems in geotechnical, petroleum, and mining engineering  design of tunnel liners and the validation of numerical models are among the practical applications of displacement analysis around circular openings  several analytical and numerical solutions for this axisymmetric opening problem have been developed and various rock mass behaviors including the elastic-perfectly plastic, elastic-brittle-plastic and elastic-strain-softening models with different yield criteria have been assumed for the rock (brown et al , 1983; wang, 1996; carranza-torres and fairhurst, 1999; alonso et al , 2003; park and kim, 2006; sharan, 2008; lee and pietruszczak, 2008; park et al , 2008; gonzalez-caoa et al , 2013)  although mohr-coulomb yield criterion has been widely used in analysis of rock mass due to its simplicity, many studies and experimental observations show that the strength envelope for rock is non-linear  among the non-linear yield criteria, the hoek-brown (h-b) failure criterion (hoek et al , 2002) is widely accepted by the rock mechanics community and has been applied in a great number of projects around the world |

2016-666 	 effect of locating the stope and backfill design on stress distribution |abstract: |in this paper, an attempt is made to optimize the location and design procedure of the backfill stopes according to the some geotechnical parameters  in this regard, a large number of numerical models were made using flac 2d software, because of the plane strain condition  so shallow, semi-deep and deep individual stopes has been defined  since all stopes in this paper are considered as individual excavation, there is not any conventional pillar, although arching effect on this post pillar areas have been investigated as one of the main objectives  in order to determine the stress state in the backfill and its surrounding area, volumetric strain energy released within the fillings has been used as an indicator  this parameter can explain the backfill state (active or passive form) and indicates the efficiency of the backfill  finally, volumetric strain energy released and stress state within the backfill has been plotted versus variable geotechnical parameters  so this paper presents a design procedure and locating approach of the backfill stope according to the geomechanical issues  |introduction |backfilling has become a standard practice in mining operations  one of the main reasons behind the extensive use of backfill in mines is that it can lead to a significant reduction of the amount of wastes disposed on the surface  backfilling thus protects the landscape and reduces the potential for environmental impacts such as acid mining drainage (when sulphide minerals are present)  despite this advantage, it must be kept in mind that the main role of mine backfill is to provide ground support to ensure stope stability and improve ore recovery by reducing dilution [1]  it is thus important for ground control engineers to have well adapted tools that allow a relatively fast and reliable estimate of the stress state in and around backfilled stopes  in this regard, it must be recalled that most backfill materials, even those that include a significant portion of binder, are relatively soft and show a low yielding strength compared to the surrounding rock mass [2]  as a consequence, the backfill placed in a stope tends to settle significantly, often producing fairly large strains (of 5% or more) [3]  the deformation of the backfill may then induce some load transfer along the interfaces due to the frictional forces that develop along the contact with the rock mass [4]  this type of phenomenon, often encountered with confined backfills, is known as arching [5] | 
2016-668 	 studying the impact of thermal cycling on wellbore integrity during co2 injection |abstract: |injection of supercritical co2 into storage reservoirs causes thermally induced expansion and contraction inside the wellbore, potentially leading to the creation of leakage pathways  determining a safe operating range for temperature and assessment of thermal stresses during co2 injection is essential to ensure wellbore integrity  although failure of well barrier materials, such as steel and cement, has been reported in the contemporary literature, most of these studies applied purely mechanical loads to replicate thermally induced stresses  thus, a systematic investigation of thermally induced casing expansion and contraction affecting the cracking and debonding of the well barrier materials is yet to be performed  |in this work, we have applied a combination of experiments and simulations to analyze the thermo-mechanical behavior of the well barrier materials undergoing repeated thermal cycling  the objectives of these studies are to determine when fracturing or debonding occurs as a function of applied thermal cycles and time, where these defects appear, and how prevalent or extensive they are  the experiments were performed in the sintef petroleum research laboratory using downscaled wellbore samples, consisting of a steel pipe cemented inside a hollow sandstone cylinder  the effects of thermal cycling were visualized using x-ray computed tomography to determine the extent of fracture  the simulations were conducted at the lawrence livermore national laboratory using a highly parallel, multiscale, multiphysics code named geos  the experimental results did not show any detectable change in the existing pore volume of the sample for a temperature range between –50°c to 80°c  however, the simulation results suggest that large thermal stresses can develop inside the materials, which may create radial fractures/debonding during the heating/cooling stage  the data gathered from these experiments and simulations can be used to assess the temperature range for minimal impact on well integrity  |introduction |carbon capture and storage (ccs) is a critical necessity to reduce the amount of atmospheric co2 (haszeldine, 2009; herzog and golomb, 2004)  an effective way for longterm storage of co2 is to inject it into underground reservoirs through petroleum wells  however, without proper care and risk assessment, the injected co2 may find leakage pathways out of the wells, affecting the surrounding environments and ultimately re-emerging into the atmosphere  thus, preventing leakages from petroleum wells is crucial to establish safe storage of co2 | 
2016-670 	 comparison of fracture mechanics and damage mechanics approaches to simulate three-point bending and double-notch shear experiments on rock samples |abstract: |three-point-bending and double-notch shear experiments are modeled using a continuum damage mechanics approach, and an explicit fracture mechanics approach, for both homogeneous and heterogeneous rocks  the local damage approach uses the mazars isotropic damage model  in the explicit fracture simulations, fractures are represented as explicit surfaces within a threedimensional unstructured mesh comprised of isoparametric quadratic tetrahedra and quarter point tetrahedra  heterogeneities in strength, stiffness and toughness are introduced in a random manner within ±50% of the average values  a characteristic length is used to define the size of element clusters having uniform properties  both approaches are used to evaluate the influence of material heterogeneity on crack propagation and interaction  both models reproduce well the experimental results for homogeneous rocks  while in the damage model the mesh is fixed and refined globally, the discrete approach only requires refinement around the fracture tips  in the three-point-bending and double-notch shear simulations, the damage mechanics approach is more realistic in that it leads to rougher crack surfaces  however, the fracture mechanics model predicts lower curvature of the fracture, which better corresponds to experimental observations  both approaches predict that the presence of heterogeneities seems to diminish fracture interaction  |introduction |various continuous and discrete numerical models have been proposed to model crack growth in homogeneous materials  however, many materials, such as concrete, rocks, and other quasi-brittle materials, contain heterogeneities, which may affect the growth of fractures (figure 1)  |damage models, derived within the general framework of continuum damage mechanics, are often used to reproduce the effects of stiffness degradation, without explicitly representing discrete fractures  models for quasi-brittle damage include micromechanical models, as well as isotropic and anisotropic empirical models  micromechanical damage models are the most advanced, in that they model microscopic phenomena responsible for the evolution of damage through first-order principles (krajcinovic, 1986)  they are therefore very useful for understanding rock failure  however, they are computationally demanding to implement |

2016-679 	 load and resistance separation for reliability based design in rock engineering |abstract: |the existence of variability in rock mass properties is ubiquitous in rock engineering  as such, probabilistic analysis is required for accurate evaluation of the safety of designs, rather than the use of working-stress design with factors of safety  the fundamental problem in reliability-based design of structures is the evaluation of the probability of the resistance of the structure being less than the effect of applied loads  customary approaches to this assume the resistance and effect of load to be independent (i e  one is not a function of the other)  however, in rock engineering this elementary characteristic of independence may not be valid, as both the load and the strength of rock may be functions of the minor principal stress  in this paper, and using the example of a tunnel in rock, we show how this problem may be resolved through a novel interpretation of the elementary structural problem  we develop and present a non-iterative technique that allows calculation of the probability of attaining rock peak strength and the evaluation of the design point (i e  the conditions giving the greatest probability of failure)  using scenarios of differing rock strength and variability, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method by comparing it to the recognised techniques of monte carlo simulation and the first-order reliability method  |introduction |rock engineering design is characterized by great variability in rock mass conditions and properties  customarily, rock engineering has relied on deterministic design methods with an applied “factor of safety”, with such factors being used to account for variability and hence ensure a sufficiently safe design  however, without characterising the variability, this approach cannot ensure that the design is safe  instead, the reliability of the design should be determined, and this approach is referred to as reliability-based design (rbd)  well-known forms of this are the essentially synonymous load and resistance factor design, lrfd (particularly in north america) and limit state(s) design (lsd) (elsewhere in the world)  the reliability calculation requires definition of a critical state function, known as a limit state, for the structure under consideration, and calculation of the probability of a design attaining that critical state | 
2016-680 	 shear enhanced borehole closure |abstract: |the geomechanical problem of a hole closing in a creeping formation is interesting for different industries (oil, mining, tunneling)  analytical solutions have been derived in the case where far field pressure boundary conditions are applied (barker et al , 1994, liu et al , 2011)  using a power law creep model, we study the effect of applying additional shear stresses at infinity  |we start by deriving an analytical solution for the case of far field isotropic stresses to define a characteristic viscosity and velocity  we show that the solution reproduces liu et al , 2011 without referring to perzyna viscoplasticity  compared to barker et al , 1994 the closing velocities of our solution are substantially slower, which we attribute to their solution not fulfilling the incompressibility condition  |using a finite element code, we investigate how far field shear stresses affect the viscosities and velocities in the vicinity of the hole  new characteristic viscosities and velocities are proposed based on the ones derived for pressure loads  these characteristic values reduce the problem to study the effects of <u+03b2>, the ratio of deviatoric to hydrostatic stress at infinity, and n, the stress exponent of the constitutive law  a numerically verified proxy shows that the effect of shear can be modelled as increasing the closure velocity by a factor equal to (1+n<u+03b2>)n  the bigger the stress exponent the bigger the shear enhancement  this result can be used in the industry to quickly estimate the amount of creep due to general stress conditions  |introduction |wellbores going through creeping formations experience time dependent closure which might translate into drilling problems (dusseault et al , 2004)  in the oil industry, a commonly encountered rock that exhibits creep is salt  from the gulf of mexico to iran or offshore brazil, massive salt bodies have to be safely drilled through to reach reservoirs  to address this challenge, a number of guidelines have been developed to efficiently deal with stuck pipes related with time dependent borehole closure  these guidelines are based both on field experience (e g  yearwood et al , 1988 or holt and johnson, 1986) and on numerical simulations (e g  moghadam, 2013, xie and tao, 2013 or poiate et al , 2006)  both field and numerical studies show the influence of the wellbore pressure on formation creep and the goal is then to determine which mud weight to use to prevent borehole closure | 
2016-682 	 numerical study of critical role of rock heterogeneity in hydraulic fracture propagation |abstract: |log and seismic data indicate that most shale formations have strong heterogeneity  conventional analytical and semi-analytical fracture models are not enough to simulate the complex fracture propagation in these highly heterogeneous formations  without considering the intrinsic heterogeneity, predicted morphology of hydraulic fracture may be biased and misleading in optimizing the completion strategy  in this paper, a fully coupling fluid flow and geomechanics hydraulic fracture simulator based on dual-lattice discrete element method (dem) is used to predict the hydraulic fracture propagation in heterogeneous reservoir  the heterogeneity of rock is simulated by assigning different material force constant and critical strain to different particles and is adjusted by conditioning to the measured data and observed geological features  based on proposed model, the effects of heterogeneity at different scale on micromechanical behavior and induced macroscopic fractures are examined  from the numerical results, the microcrack will be more inclined to form at the grain weaker interface  the conventional simulator with homogeneous assumption is not applicable for highly heterogeneous shale formation  |introduction |hydraulic fracturing is a well-stimulation technique, which creates fractures in rock formations through the injection of hydraulically pressurized fluid  since the 1950s, about 70% of gas wells and 50% of oil wells have been hydraulically fractured [1]  wide and successful applications of horizontal wells and hydraulic fracturing are the key reasons leading to the exponentially growing of tight oil and shale gas production  therefore, understanding the hydraulic fracture propagation in complex unconventional reservoir plays a crucial role in optimizing the stimulation strategy and maximizing the created contacting surface  |however, there are several challenges in precisely predicting and controlling the induced fracture geometry [2]  one significant difficulty is that rock is a heterogeneous material containing many natural weaknesses, including pores, grain boundaries, and preexisting fractures [3]  microseismic monitoring, production data, log, and seismic data confirm that the reservoir formation has strong lateral heterogeneity, which is a key impact factor of rock's mechanical behaviors  during the hydraulic fracturing process, these pre-existing weaknesses can induce microcracks or microfractures, which can in turn change the flow capability of the rock [4], [5]  for example, the bakken formation is a layered heterogeneous reservoir, which is separated into upper, middle, lower and three forks  and even in one layer, the rock mineralogy varies with depth and location  thus, without considering the intrinsic heterogeneity, the predicted morphology of hydraulic fracture may be biased and misleading in guiding the horizontal well completion strategy |

2016-691 	 determination of maximum horizontal field stress from microseismic focal mechanisms - a deterministic approach |abstract: |the state of field stresses is an important factor in the design and execution of hydraulic fracturing treatments  the absolute and relative magnitudes of horizontal stresses directly affect the minimum treatment horsepower requirement and the final stimulation pattern  while the minimum horizontal stress (<u+03c3>hmin) can be directly measured by a mini-frac or a leakoff test, there is no direct means to measure the magnitude of maximum horizontal stress (<u+03c3>hmax)  in this paper, we introduce a new method for determination of <u+03c3>hmax direction and magnitude from microseismic focal mechanisms induced by hydraulic fracturing treatments  the focal mechanisms that meet a certain criterion are used to first determine the <u+03c3>hmax direction  knowing the direction of horizontal stresses, the reference coordinate system of principal stresses is formed by assuming the vertical stress as a principal stress  the normalized magnitude of <u+03c3>hmax is then calculated for each qualifying focal mechanism as a function of normalized <u+03c3>hmin magnitude  the undisturbed <u+03c3>hmax magnitude is estimated by interpretation of calculated <u+03c3>hamx magnitudes for all focal mechanisms  the method was used to estimate direction and magnitude of <u+03c3>hmax for two projects in the marcellus shale, located approximately 30 miles away from one another  |introduction |the state of stress in a formation can be characterized by direction and magnitude of the three principal stresses  for close-to-surface projects, where undisturbed rock is accessible, techniques such as over-coring, flat jack test, hydraulic fracturing, and borehole slotter (jaeger et al , 2008, amadei and stephansson, 1997) can be used to measure the stress magnitudes at the study region  in the case of unconventional reservoirs, however, access to the undisturbed rock is very limited, and most conventional stress measurement techniques cannot be applied  a common assumption in these cases is that the vertical stress is a principal stress whose magnitude is determined by calculating the weight of overburden rock from density logs  this assumption holds true in most cases, considering the high depth of unconventional reservoirs, except for cases where a geological feature such as a fault or fold changes the state of stress locally  given the orthogonality of principal stresses, this assumption requires that the other two principal stresses be horizontal  thus, the problem of determining the field stresses is reduced to finding the direction and magnitude of horizontal stresses |

2016-710 	 thermo-hydro-mechanical model for source rock thermal maturation |abstract: |we present a thermo-hydro-mechanical (thm) numerical simulation framework for thermal maturation of source rock  the framework allows for both fully-coupled and sequentially-coupled formulations  we employ a constitutive model based on ‘critical state plasticity’  the model accounts for both mechanical hardening and thermal softening due to kerogen conversion  the multi-component, multiphase flow and transport processes of both mass and heat are modeled at the macroscopic (e g , darcy) scale  the phase compositions and properties are described by a cubic equation of state; arrhenius-type chemical reactions are used to represent kerogen conversion  the system of partial differential equations and associated constitutive relations is solved using finite-volume discretization schemes for the ow and transport of heat and mass, and a galerkin finite-element method is used for the geomechanics  the thm simulation framework is demonstrated for an in-situ retorting problem with a single well  these thm capabilities have been integrated into the automatic differentiation based general purpose research simulator (ad-gprs) being developed at stanford university  |introduction |oil shale is an organic-rich immature source rock  it consists of heterogeneous mixtures of organic matter (kerogen) and minerals  the mineral-kerogen mixture may appear in finely dispersed form, or in thin laminae (eseme et al , 2007)  the minerals and the organic matter can vary in composition with complex spatial arrangement of the constituents at all scales  oil shale deposits often take the form of large numbers of thin layers (laminations) that can extend over long (areal) distances  oil shale rocks are typically hard and brittle at room temperature with pressure dependent mechanical properties  the tensile strength and mechanical moduli of oil shale tend to decrease with increasing organic content  in shallow oil shale deposits, the difference between the in-situ vertical and horizontal stresses can be relatively small  the laminated nature of the deposit usually leads to (macroscopic) anisotropy in the tensile strength, which can be used to induce long fractures oriented nearly horizontally | 
2016-711 	 a fast and flexible boundary detection algorithm for dem simulation |abstract: |the role of the boundary condition is critical to a simulation  a simulation with its boundary improperly applied will result in significantly different results  conventionally, a rigid or membrane-based boundary is applied for the discrete element method (dem) simulation  this paper describes a 2d fast and flexible boundary detection algorithm for dem simulation  this algorithm is localized so the speed is fast  once the first element on boundary is searched and found globally, all the other elements on the boundary are searched locally  this algorithm is flexible, suitable for closed boundary (where the beginning element and the ending element share the same element, such as the inner boundary of a tunnel), or open boundary (where the beginning element and the ending element are not the same element) provided that the criteria for the beginning element and ending element are given  it is also powerful because it has the capability of handling any boundary shape, whether it is a regular circular or rectangular boundary or an irregular shape boundary  |with this algorithm, the boundary elements could be easily identified and updated periodically  because of the fast performance of this algorithm, the boundary actually could be updated in each iteration  once the boundary elements are identified, the forces applied on the boundary in a dem simulation can realistically act on each real boundary element, rather than a rigid “wall” boundary or membrane-based boundary  |numerical experiments further demonstrate the power of this algorithm  even in a transient simulation where the boundary shape is changing dynamically in various irregular shapes, the boundary could still be captured easily to apply the realistic boundary forces  the algorithm discussed in this paper is for 2d simulation; however, it is expandable to 3d, which will be reported later  |introduction |the role of the boundary condition is critical to a simulation  a simulation with its boundary improperly applied will result in significantly different results  conventionally, a rigid or membrane-based boundary is applied for the discrete element method (dem) simulation (wang and tonon, 2008; tannant and wang, 2007)  a rigid boundary is valid and proper in a simulation if the actual boundary is a rigid boundary where the relative locations of the elements on the boundary and the shape of the boundary do not change during the simulation, so as to simulate a uniaxial compression testing experiment in two parallel plates where these two plates are the boundary, as illustrated in fig  1 (tannant and wang, 2007)  a membrane-based boundary (wang and tonon, 2008) is applied when a solid-liquid hydraulic boundary is met in the simulation where the boundary does not have a big change and the shape of the boundary is not complex | 
2016-713 	 an investigation of static and dynamic data using multistage tri-axial test |abstract: |the focus of this work is to develop an improved understanding of the relationship between static and dynamic data for a suite of four rock samples  “static data” is defined as the large strain (> 10^-3) measurements on unloading and reloading triaxial stress paths  “dynamic data” is the small strain (<10^-6) data acquired using standard acoustic velocity measurement techniques  the results are analyzed in terms of young's modulus  a quadratic fit has been applied to the static data  this allows us to separate the mechanisms present into a linear elastic term, m1, which we believe to be dominated by the contact modulus  m1 is shown to be a constant throughout the entire unload and reload cycles  m2 is the nonlinear elastic term  the magnitude of m2 is due to the opening and closing of compliant pores  these interpretations result from the correlation we find between the linear term and the measured velocity and the nonlinear term with the measured irrecoverable strains  to our knowledge this is the first time the physical mechanisms behind the non-linear elastic response have been isolated  |introduction |static to dynamic correlations are locally dependent on mineralogy and texture  they are typically obtained in the laboratory by measuring velocity while performing tri-axial tests  these measurements are then up-scaled for use with logging tool data  these properties can be mapped for use in reservoir simulation and 4d seismic models  the ultimate goal of this work is to arrive at an elastic-plastic material model  the following sample properties are measured for use in this study: |a  sample stiffness (slope of the loading stress-strain curve includes both elastic and plastic strains) |b  young's modulus, the derivative of the axial strain with respect to axial stress using a constant radial stress boundary condition (static and dynamic)  |c  poisson's ratio, the negative ratio of the change in radial strain to the change in axial strain (static and dynamic) |

2016-725 	 hydro-mechanical effects of pore pressure on deformability and fracture strength of rock: a numerical modeling study |abstract: |although it is recognized that the peak strength of the rock is a unique function of confining stress minus pore pressure (<u+03c3>3 – p), examples of laboratory or numerical studies that focused on investigating the effects of pore pressure on weakening or strengthening the crack damage (cd) stress has received less attention  the objective of this study is to examine, and gain a better insight into the capability of the grain-based discrete element method (gdem) approach in mimicking the effect of pore pressure in weakening the peak strength, crack damage threshold (cd) threshold of material  a cohesive crack-based udec-voronoi code is generated considering the real mineral heterogeneity of a crystalline rock  the hydraulic and mechanical properties of the micro-constituents of the model is calibrated  the compressibility and biot coefficient of the material is determined by applying hydrostatic stress on a square sample  the simulation results demonstrate that like the peak strength, crack damage threshold also follows the “terzaghi's effective stress law”  the modeling approach is able to evaluate the biot coefficient of the crystalline rock based on its derived drained and solid matrix bulk moduli  |introduction |there is a considerable body of experimental evidence which shows that the failure strength of a wide variety of rocks is a unique function of <u+03c3>3 – p, in which <u+03c3>3 is the total confining stress and p is the pore-fluid pressure  as a result, to a fairly good approximation terzaghi's effective stress law (<u+03c3>3 = <u+03c3>3 – p) governs the failure strength of porous rocks (serdengecti and boozer, 1961, handin et al , 1963; murrell, 1965; robinson and holland, 1969, dunn et al , 1973; byerlee, 1975; gowd and rummel, 1977; paterson and wong, 2005)  an example is given in fig  1  that is, in general, the differential stress for fracture strength of a particular rock is approximately the same at the same “effective confining pressure” when the latter is taken to be the total confining pressure minus the pore pressure  in addition to that, according to a series of triaxial compression tests, brace and martin (1968) concluded that the law of effective stress holds for fracture strength of crystalline rocks of low porosity (0 1-3 %) such as westerly granite as long as loading rates are kept below certain critical values in order to maintain the drained loading condition during the test  it should be noted that most experiments support the conclusion that the biot's coefficient (<u+03b1>) for failure of rocks is unity  and that, the biot's coefficient for failure processes has no particular connection to the effective stress coefficient (biot's coefficient) that appears in the theory of linear poroelasticity (jaeger et al , 2009)  as a result, the concept of effective stress coefficient in which the effective stress is equal to difference between the total stress (<u+03c3>3) and effective pore pressure (<u+03c3> p) only applies for linear elastic deformation of the porous material, not to the non-linear part of the axial stress-axial strain curve  however, the peak strength of materials are governed by terzaghi's effective stress law in which the biot's coefficient is considered to be unity | 
2016-728 	 on the stress changes during co2 geological storage: considering two phase flow regime |abstract: |the mechanical response of the target formations during carbon geological storage strongly depends to the fluid pore pressure alterations in the formation  the storage formations must have sufficient capacity and could avoid migration of co2 to the surface  when the highly pressurized co2 is injected into the geological repository the fluid pressure increases in the formation, which results in changes in stresses and deformation of the medium  from geomechanics point of view, the pressure caused by co2o injection, should not exceed the formation strength and should not cause activation of existing faults  therefore, finding a realistic estimation of alteration of stresses during the co2 injection job, has been subject of several studies in the literature  most of the analytical methods available in the literature to calculate the stress distribution are well established for single-phase flows, but it requires extension when a second fluid, in this case co2, is also flowing  in the current work, an approximate analytical model is developed for calculating different stresses caused by injection of co2 in a saline formation, assuming two phase flow pressure regime  here, we investigated the stress regime under induced fluid pressure and temperature alterations during the injection time  |introduction |carbon dioxide storage or carbon dioxide sequestration refers to the processes by which captured co2 is securely stored in deep geologic formations  carbon dioxide storage in geologic formations includes oil and gas reservoirs, unmineable coal seams, and deep saline reservoirs  it has been reported by the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc) that the global capacity of deep saline storage sites is more than thousands of gigatons of co2, which is hundreds of times greater than the annual co2 emissions from industrial sources [1–3]  therefore studying the behavior of co2 when stored in these sites are crucial for the industry | 
2016-729 	 modification of fracture geometry by calcite precipitation |abstract: |geochemical interactions during the injection/withdrawal of fluids into the subsurface can modify fracture apertures through dissolution and/or precipitation of minerals  modification of fracture apertures by reactive flows is strongly affected by non-reactive, non-wetting fluids that limit the fracture surface area and void volume that is accessible to the reactive fluids  an experimental investigation was performed to examine the controls on mineral precipitation within a fracture when mineral precipitation occurs with and without the generation of gas  several differences were observed in the results from the experiments using the two chemical approaches for generating precipitates  the pore-filling precipitates (particles formed in solution) were more uniform in size and were thicker than the surface adhering precipitates (particles formed on fracture surfaces)  the acoustic response for fractures with pore-filling precipitates reached a steady-state after 2 hours while fractures with surface adhering precipitates took longer to equilibrate because of the presence of co2 that was generated during the chemical reaction at liquid– surface interfaces  in surface adhering precipitation case, the generation of co2 limited accessibility of calcium carbonate prenucleation polymers to the entire void volume of the fractures  on the other hand, fractures with pore-filling precipitates exhibited a more uniform acoustic response across the fracture plane than fractures with surface adhering precipitates  understanding the effect of mineral precipitation on acoustic wave attenuation provides a path forward for long-term monitoring of seal integrity  |introduction |geologic sequestration of co2 in subsurface reservoirs relies on different mechanisms to contain the co2 such as stratigraphic trapping, capillary/solution based trapping and mineralogical trapping  stratigraphic trapping relies on “seals” that are low permeability rock, such as shale, that prevents the migration of co2 to shallower depths or other regions in the subsurface  however, the integrity of seals depends on the presence of pre-existing fractures, the generation or reactivation of cracks/fractures/faults and the potential of sealing flow paths along such discontinuities through mineralization/precipitation  sealed or partially sealed mineralized faults are observed in nature  for example, both the refugio-carneos fault in the santa barbara basin of southern california [1] and the moab fault around courthouse rock and mill canyon in utah [2] contain calcite cements  in both cases, the migration of methane-rich fluids mixed with meteoric water has resulted in the precipitation of calcium carbonate along segments of the faults |

2016-755 	 application of artificial intelligent techniques to determine sonic time from well logs |abstract: |geo-mechanical parameters are very important in petroleum industry  in order to obtain the geomechanical parameters, the sonic log (compressional and shear velocities) should be available  in many cases, the sonic log is not available or missing from the log data, for that cases the existing correlations are used to predict sonic time, most of the existing correlations use the compressional velocity to predict the shear velocity  |the objective of this paper is to develop simple and accurate mathematical model to determine the compressional and shear sonic times using log data (gamma ray, bulk density, and neutron porosity)  these three logs are commonly conducted at every well and they are always available  three artificial intelligence techniques namely; anns (artificial neural networks), anfis (adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system), and svm (support vector machines) are used  finally, an attempt has also been made to converge the results into one simple empirical correlation using the weights of ann model in order to make a generalized model that can be used for field applications  |the results obtained showed that anns model successfully predict the compressional and shear sonic times from log data with 99% accuracy giving correlation coefficient of 0 99 when compared to actual field data  |introduction |accurate prediction of rock mechanical parameters is critical for alleviating the risk associated with the drilling and maximizing the well productivity  rock mechanical parameters are used in optimizing the well placement, wellbore instability evaluation moos et al , 2003 [1], completion design, draw-down limits to avoid sand production santarelli et al  1989 [2], hydraulic fracturing, and many other applications  inaccurate determination of rock mechanical parameters leads to heavy investment on decisions and field development, abdulraheem et al  2009 [3]  |generally elastic parameters can be estimated from the sonic logs (compressional and shear velocities) using regression dependent correlations, potter and foltinek 1997 [4] and pickett 1963 [5]  log derived, dynamic rock parameters should be calibrated to core derived static (laboratory) parameters, because the static measurements more accurately represent the in-situ reservoir mechanical properties, edlmann et al  1997 [6]  many of the correlations for elastic parameters determination were been reviewed by chang et al  2006 [7]  they concluded that calibration of the empirical correlations between physical parameters and strength is necessary for any correlation to be used with degree of confidence  further, shear and compressional wave velocities data is not always available from well logs, making the problem more difficult | 
2016-756 	 the effect of pulse frequency on the acoustic emission characteristics in coal bed hydraulic fracturing |abstract: |in order to fully understand the deformation and damage characteristics and to further reveal the evolutionary process of coal  in this article, experiments on acoustic emission characteristics of the pulse hydraulic fracturing (phf) process under different pulse frequencies, are carried out by the large-size true tri-axial hydraulic fracturing test system and the pac ae instrument  the acoustic emission behavior evolution characteristics, the damage evolutionary rule, the ae location distribution and the dynamic feature of b-value are analyzed  the results show that the evolution of acoustic emission behavior stimulated by phf in coal bed can be divided into four phases with time: gentle period, acceleration period, boosting period and steady period  the damage evolution process can be divided into three phases: initial damage period, damage development period and damage accelerating development period  our results show that ae information can reasonably reflect the damage evolution character of coal  besides, a lower frequency corresponded to a stronger ae energy release and a higher intensity of fracture extension inside the samples during the phf process  also in this case, a number of ae events were produced at early stage, where ae location distribution was more homogenous  for the b-value, during the whole phf process, its variation was similar under different frequencies  |introduction |in china, most of the coalbed methane reservoirs have a very low permeability with a permeability coefficient of approximately (0 001-0 1)<u+00d7>10-3 md (karacan et al , 2011)  also, coalbed methane has different occurrence states, which brings great difficulties for the exploitation of coalbed methane (huang et al , 2009)  pulse hydraulic fracturing (phf) is a new stimulation method to enhance the effective permeability of coal seams, improving the production of coalbed methane  the fundamental mechanism of pulse hydraulic fracturing is that fracturing fluids with a certain frequency are injected into coal, resulting in the rupture of coal and forming a well-distributed fracture network due to the pulse loading (li et al , 2014)  at present, the phf technology has only been applied in industrial tests in some domestic mines and just a few scholars have studied it  lin et al  (2011), li (2013), and zhai et al  (2011) studied the mechanism of phf from the point of view of energy, fatigue damages and pulse pressure wave  li (2014) conducted experiments of phf to investigate the effect of pulse frequency on the fracture propagation  zhao et al  (2008) conducted field tests and found that the pulsed high-pressure water injection technology could effectively improve the permeability of coal seams and increase the yield of gas  however, there have been few attempts to study the acoustic emission (ae) characteristics in the hydraulic fracturing process  acoustic emission (ae), which is produced by microcrack occurrence or growth, is a ubiquitous phenomenon associated with brittle fracture in many materials such as rock and concrete (zhou et al , 2007)  ae techniques can continuously monitor the real-time micro-fractures developed in the coal pulse hydraulic fracturing (polito et al , 2013), which can help to determine the morphology changes occurring inside the rock and determine the fracturing mechanism and the level of crack propagation | 
2016-758 	 experimental study of impact of creep on coal permeability |abstract: |drainage of fluids (hydrocarbon or water) from coal seam via drainage boreholes brings about compaction creep and permanent loss of porosity and permeability over time  in this paper, the impact of creep (time-dependent deformation) on coal permeability has been experimentally studied using a triaxial rig  the bituminous coal sample used for the triaxial creep test was excavated from bowen basin, australia  methane gas was used in the triaxial test to investigate the effect of creep triggered by pore pressure depletion on permeability during desorption under constant hydrostatic and axial stresses  the results show that the creep induced to coal results in a significant drop in coal permeability when approximately zero creep rate is reached  permeability measurements show that drop of pore pressure in a step manner from 2 5 mpa to 1 5 mpa, 1 mpa, and 0 5 mpa leads to decrease in permeability loss ratio of 16 8%, 6% and 5 4% for each step change  permeability rebound was not obtained in our experiments for this range of pressures  the experimental results of this study can shed light on complexity of interaction of gas transport and timedependent deformation of coal during gas drainage  |introduction |coal as a soft rock experiences compaction when pore pressure depletes and effective stress increases during coal seam gas (csg) drainage  the increase in effective stress during gas drainage causes the reservoir to undergo compaction (schatz and carroll, 1981)  this mechanical induced compaction causes permanent deformation of coal microstructure and loss of porosity  as a result, a reduction in permeability and weaker response to gas drainage is predicted in the coal influenced by compaction creep  also, deeper coal seams undergo less deformation owing to restriction on stress relaxation in and around the working face during mining  the impact of creep on permeability is more important for lower rank coals located at shallow depth as they are softer than higher rank coals and therefore they experience more creep  creep compaction of rocks, as a long-term process, occurs very slowly at the equilibrium state that has been reached in millions of years  however, creep process and shrinkage of rocks are accelerated when subsurface fluids are drained from the rocks via drainage boreholes  deformation in coal can occur much faster due to being much softer than adjacent rocks (roof and floor rocks) (brantut et al , 2013; kaiser and morgenstein, 1981)  negligence of the impact of compaction creep on coal permeability may result in misestimating the level of drained gas  this may lead to a delay in mining operations due to the need for addressing residual hazards associated with methane gas such as coal and gas outburst and asphyxiation | 
2016-760 	 a simplified dilation model for modeling the inelastic behavior of rock |abstract: |strength degradation and brittle fracture processes in rock result in inelastic deformations that can be measured during triaxial compression tests  post-peak behavior is accompanied by lateral dilation which is observed as bulking of the sample, or of the failing rock mass in the case of a highly stressed underground opening  dilation models describe the evolution of these bulking characteristics as a function of confinement and loading history  comparing existing dilation models used in practice, these either assume a constant dilation value that oversimplifies the post-peak behavior of rocks, or they require the determination of numerous parameters that make them difficult to apply  in this paper, a new empirical dilation model is proposed that not only captures the dilation characteristics of rock but also requires a minimum number of parameters as inputs  the model facilitates determination of the required parameters from conventional triaxial compression tests as well as implementation of the model in numerical codes  |introduction |stress-induced failure of a rock mass around an underground opening is accompanied by large inelastic deformations that have the effects of adversely loading the support system and creating other operational hazards  of special concern is the post-peak behavior of rock, which is accompanied by lateral dilation and bulking of the failing rock  a small amount of dilation is also observed in the pre-peak behavior of rock  dilation models describe the evolution of dilation characteristics of rock as a function of loading history and confinement  |using continuum mechanics and the theory of plasticity, dilation models establish a relation between plastic deformation increments (dep1, dep2, dep3) during the course of inelastic straining of the rock  dep1, dep2 and dep3 are components of the plastic deformation increments in the direction of maximum, intermediate and minimum principal stresses, respectively  dilation models with dep2 = 0 dilation models are expressed as a function of dep1/dep3 or by using a parameter called the dilation angle <u+03c8>  <u+03c8> is related to dep1/dep3 and is defined as a function of loading history and confinement  |conventional triaxial test data can be used for characterizing rock dilation as a function of loading history and applied lateral confinement (<u+03c3>3)  loading history is usually measured by accumulative plastic shear strain <u+03b3>p = epaxial <u+2212> eplateral, where epaxial and eplateral are accumulative axial and lateral plastic strains, respectively  the underlying assumption here is that the incremental plastic deformations, depaxial <u+2265> 0 and deplateral < 0, do not change sign during the course of inelastic straining  from triaxial tests, <u+03c8> can be evaluated from plastic (inelastic) deformation increments as: |(equation) |the evolution of the dilation angle obtained from triaxial tests can be demonstrated using 2d plots in <u+03a8> - <u+03a8>p coordinates (fig  1), or using 3d plots in <u+03a8> - <u+03a8>p - <u+03a8>3 coordinates  the obvious pattern in dilation data is that under a constant applied confinement, dilation angle increases at the onset of inelastic deformation of the rock and reaches its peak value, followed by a gradual decrease  the peak dilation angle value occurs under unconfined tests, <u+03a8>peak(<u+03c3>3 = 0), and reduces with increase in confinement | 
2016-763 	 stress-induced spalling analysis of extraction level pillars using a 3-d extensional strain failure criterion |abstract: |the mineral industry is developing ever deeper and more complex, lower-grade ore bodies as demand for metals continues to increase and near surface resources become exhausted  the presence of higher stress conditions are more likely to lead to design challenges with respect to mitigating unexpected pillar failures during mining production  preventing failure means properly assessing the depth of stress-induced brittle fracture damage, together with the corresponding deformations (rock mass dilation/bulking) and loading of the rock support system  our understanding of these processes and means to assess them are relatively limited as most empirical design systems and failure criteria have been developed for shallower mines and tunnels  spalling is one of the more frequent pillar damage responses observed at greater depths  loss of cohesion under low-confinement due to spalling leads to reductions in the effective width of pillars, which results in reduction of their load carrying capacity  this study describes a 3-d extensional strain criterion for assessing spalling potential, and examines its application to the evaluation of a network of extraction-level pillars for a block caving operation  a 3-d numerical stress analysis is performed and the role of the intermediate principal stress on the extent and spatial distribution of spalling is also investigated  the influence of sequencing is illustrated using spalling potential hazard maps for a typical sequencing scenario  |introduction |woo et al  (2013) and eberhardt et al  (2015) report that over the last 20 years, block caving operations have increasingly moved towards larger footprint areas and greater mining depths, with the latter now exceeding 1200 m depth, double the historic trend  this move towards deeper caving operations will require that the higher stresses that will be encountered be accounted for in extraction level pillar design, both in terms of pillar dimensions and support  by mining deeper, not only can more energy be stored in the pillar in the form of elastic strain energy, but also there is more energy available for release through brittle fracture and failure  in the case of a block caving extraction level, failure of individual pillars can lead to closed drawpoints, or worse, might lead to failure of adjacent pillars and the loss of a large number of drawpoints resulting in lost production, sterilized ore, and ultimately hazards that may threaten the safety of personnel | 
2016-769 	 the interaction analysis of propagating opening mode fractures with veins using discrete element method |abstract: |veins generate mechanical discontinuities in shale formations due to their strength and stiffness contrast with the rock matrix  these heterogeneities in naturally fractured reservoirs can exert control on hydraulic fracture propagation path as demonstrated in experimental studies [1]  to investigate micromechanical fracture interaction behavior and to perform sensitivity analyses of vein properties on fracture diversion, we numerically modeled semi-circular bend (scb) tests of marcellus shale core samples containing calcite-filled veins using the particle flow code in three-dimensions (pfc3d)  the numerical results correlated with experimental fracture propagation and interaction results over a range of approach angles and vein thicknesses  further sensitivity analyses on vein properties indicated that veins with lower strength and higher stiffness contribute to more fracture diversion than veins with higher strength and lower stiffness  the vein thickness controlled the fracture travel distance inside the vein where thicker veins produced longer distance before kinking back into the rock matrix than thinner veins showing a weaker vein response  additionally, the model showed that intergranular bond failure created microcracks within the vein as the induced fracture approached (prior to intersection), and this effect was stronger for the veins with higher stiffness relative to the rock matrix  the bond failure mode inside the vein and for the induced fracture was predominantly tensile rather than shear  |introduction |natural fractures are ubiquitous structures in the earth's crust generated by geologic processes [2, 3]  based on structural characterization from subsurface oil and gas reservoirs, natural fractures can range from uncemented frictional interfaces or open fractures to fully or partially cemented cohesive fractures [2, 4, 5]  |cemented natural fractures (veins) not only have resistance against shear stress but also have tensile strength [6]  these filled natural fractures can have different mechanical properties than those of the host rock [7]  the mechanical discontinuity created by the cemented natural fracture generates stress heterogeneity in the reservoir which disturbs the hydraulic fracture path |

2016-779 	 experimental investigation on non-planar propagation of hydraulic fracture and proppant migration for directional well fracturing in coal seams |abstract: |true tri-axial test system was deployed for directional well fracturing simulation experiments of coal outcrops, and an ingenious method of proppant adding during fracturing was performed in laboratory  subsequently, the influence of in-situ stress, azimuth, cleats and proppant on the non-planar hydraulic fracture propagation rule in natural coal was studied  the results show that the propagation mode of non-planar hydraulic fracture is controlled by the combined effects of different factors: the coal cleats and well deviation determine the local fracture geometry, in-situ stress state dominates the main direction of fracture zone and bedding planes impede fracture height growth  as hydraulic fracture initiated along a direction skewed with wellbore, the extension path of hydraulic fracture near the wellbore would affected by cleats, and more complicated fracture geometry with many fracture branches would formed  moreover, adding proppant will increase propagation pressure significantly, and the increase of proppant diameter will result in a higher degree of complexity for the proppant migration in flexural fracture and higher fracture propagation pressure  therefore, the main factor, causing the difficulty of hydraulic fracture propagation, is the complex fracture geometry characterized by the twisting main fracture and the generation of secondary fractures near the wellbore  |introduction |unlike conventional gas reservoirs, the coal matrix permeability is extremely low  hydraulic fracturing treatments have become an indispensable part of stimulating in coal reservoirs  moreover, directional well fracturing technology is commonly utilized to enhance the drainage volume of single cbm well and economic yield  |during the process of directional well fracturing in coal seams, the double effects of disturbed stress field and cleats around the borehole were believed to have significant impact on both initiation pressure and fracture geometry  previous experimental studies [1-3] based on homogeneous concrete specimen neglected the influence of cleats  some authors [4-12] who conducted experimental researches of vertical well fracturing did not consider the effect of disturbed stress field on fracture geometry caused by the deviation of wellbore  therefore, the combination effects of well deviation and cleats around the wellbore on fracture initiation and propagation need to be further studied |

2016-786 	 laminar - turbulent transition in the propagation of heightcontained hydraulic fracture |abstract: |high injection rate hydraulic fracturing can have reynolds number as high as 104  for such high reynolds numbers, turbulent flow is likely to occur  in this paper, we investigate the effect of turbulence on the propagation of hight contained hydraulic fractures, commonly referred to as pkn fractures  we discuss different scalings for the fracture width, length and pressure under limiting laminar, turbulent smooth and turbulent rough flow regimes  we implement an explicit, central numerical scheme to solve the continuity and friction factor based momentum conservation equations, taking into account the full variation of friction factor with reynolds number and relative fracture roughness  the scheme is validated against the analytical solution of the pkn model  the results show that the local reynolds number evolves from a maximum value at the inlet to zero at the tip, with a transition from turbulent to laminar at some point along the fracture length, depending on the value of inlet reynolds number  results showing the effect of smooth and rough turbulence on the fracture length and fracture width depending on the reynolds number are finaly presented  |introduction |the usual approximation of laminar flow in a propagating hydraulic fracture sometimes breakdown  this is the case of fluid-driven fracture propagation at glacier beds where reynolds numbers above 105 are expected (tsai and rice (2010))  at such large reynolds numbers, the flow is well within the turbulent rough regime  recently, ames and bunger (2015) have investigated the effect of a fully rough turbulent flow on the propagation of height contained hydraulic fracture (nordgren (1972)) and derived scaling relationship for that flow regime  however, in practice for a hydraulic fracture treatment in an oil and gas reservoir using a low viscosity fluid injected at very large injection rate, the reynolds number for a height contained fracture are expected to be in the range 103 – 104 at most (see table 1 and 2), right in the transition between the laminar to the fully turbulent regime  we focus solely here on a height contained fracture as depicted in fig  1 (i e  the so-called pkn geometry)  in parallel to the problem formulation, we also review the available experimental data and models covering the complete flow conditions spanning the complete spectrum of reynolds numbers from laminar to fully turbulent  we notably discuss the use of an equivalent reynolds number proposed by jones (1976) to use the available data and models developed for flow in pipes to the case of elliptical cross-section encountered in the pkn geometry | 
2016-787 	 numerical modeling of heterogeneous asperity distributions controlling the growth of shear rupture on a frictional fault |abstract: |a better understanding of the strength distributions and the seismic response of asperities failing within a cohesive (or breakdown) region of the growing shear rupture is important in many engineering disciplines, such as, hydraulic fracture and induced seismicity  in the laboratory, a fault is experimentally modeled by a 400 mm x 80 mm x 12 mm pmma slider sheared across a large pmma base plate  a pressure-sensitive film was employed to localize and size, and measure normal stress upon contact junctions  moments prior to rapid sliding, multiple discrete and localized dynamic events (or foreshocks) were observed at a section of the fault that exhibited a sparse to dense transition in asperity distribution  experiments showed that foreshocks occurred as the crack (rupture front) moved into the resistive patch of densely distributed asperities  we use the results of pressure sensitive film asperity measurements to develop a heterogeneous finite element (fe) model that studies the effect of asperities within the cohesive region have on the expanding shear crack  slip accumulated heterogeneously during the loading cycle due to the non-uniform distribution of asperities  we study the constitutive behavior of a frictional interface where local slip is determined by the asperities and their ability to communicate elastically  a foreshock (mw ~ -7 4) was simulated in a quasi-static manner by instantaneoulsy removing an asperity contact during the loading cycle  the foreshock increased shear stress perturbations to neighboring regions up to distances of ~ 10 to 15 source radii  |introduction |our understanding of earthquakes is that they are produced when either intact rock fractures rapidly or fractured rock interfaces experience rapid slip  energy released from these processes is conveyed to frictional heating, wear of the faulting surfaces and seismic radiation  while seismic radiation is considered to be a small portion of the energy released during an earthquake (aki, 2002), these waves are what we feel and can cause tremendous damage to infrastructure and loss of human life  the unpredictable and devastating nature of earthquakes and our general lack of understanding of their physics has motivated this study and many other studies in the field of seismology and engineering  mechanisms surrounding this transition to rapid sliding are not well understood and insight could potentially lead to better estimates of seismic hazard and earthquake prediction | 
2016-790 	 investigation of the coupled mechanical-thermal evolution of passive continental margins incorporating flexural isostasy |abstract: |with the industry targeting exploration in deeper and more challenging environments, there is a strong desire to develop a more complete description of the structural and thermal evolution of sedimentary basins  current exploration workflows commonly involve analysis of the problem at the lithospheric scale where it is important to consider factors such as the flexural isostatic response of the lithosphere and thermal subsidence  this paper presents a methodology for addressing these issues in a combined mechanical-thermal analysis of passive continental margins  particular emphasis is accorded to the procedure for incorporating the flexural isostatic response  the model domain is assumed to overly a dense, inviscid fluid representing the upper portions of the mantle that, whilst not explicitly modelled, contributes to overall isostatic balance  simple test cases that validate the approach are demonstrated and the influence of the crustal rigidity in distributing loading via flexure is shown  the methodology is then used to address the evolution of realistic margin geometries  |introduction |as exploration moves to target deeper, more complex environments there is an increasing demand for tools that can provide a more complete description of the structural and thermal evolution of sedimentary basins  this is most obvious in regions where the structural style is predominantly controlled by halokinesis, or salt tectonics  notable examples include the gulf of mexico [1], offshore brazil [2] and angola [3], and the north sea [4]  hydrocarbon accumulations in these regions often benefit from the traps formed by movement of mobile and impermeable salt  |as the unique mechanical and thermal properties of salt facilitate the development of these convenient traps e g  four-way dipping structures above salt domes, understanding factors governing salt behavior over geological time is of paramount importance  controls on salt movement often focus on the inclination of the margin and the delivery of prograding sediment packages – both of which serve to drive salt towards deeper areas of the margin [5]  the control on both of these factors owes much to crustal scale processes such as flexural isostasy  the incorporation of such processes into a commercially available forward modeling package is the focus of this paper  some space is accorded to a description of isostatic processes and the underlying computational framework  benchmarks are presented that serve to validate the applicability and robustness of the implementation before it is used to address the two-dimensional development of a passive margin | 
2016-791 	 the influence of rock foliation on the correlation between the point load strength index and comminution indices at kinross tasiast mine |abstract: |a precise delineation of geometallurgical domains in an orebody can lead to improved production planning and comminution efficiency  this requires an accurate characterization of the variability of ore response to comminution and breakage force  experimental analyses have shown that simple inexpensive rock strength tests can be correlated with ore breakage characteristics, and could therefore reflect intrinsic comminution behaviour  establishing these correlations can reduce the number of expensive comminution tests required for orebody characterization  this study investigates the correlation between the point load strength test and comminution work indices at the kinross tasiast mine  the influence of rock microproperties and data measuring factors on this correlation is analyzed  composites with corresponding point load strength and comminution work index data were determined for correlation  point load data was averaged, and classified based on the failure types observed with respect to rock foliation  sampling program, location and type of point load failure were used as filters for the correlation  the results show that the procedure for testing across different programs and sampling location can affect the correlation between point load strength and comminution behaviour  sampling bias of mineralized units, and orientation bias of drill hole plunge were important for the correlation at tasiast  rock foliation is a microproperty found to significantly influence the point load strength behaviour  stronger correlation was observed for rock samples that were point loaded perpendicular to foliation, than the samples tested parallel to foliation  |introduction |accurate characterization of ore response to breakage and comminution (crushing and grinding) is essential for optimizing a mine operation  this requires the capturing of the different forms of rock heterogeneity, i e , material, structural and geometrical, at various scales (micro and macro) throughout an ore deposit  geometallurgical models are commonly used to quantify the heterogeneity of an orebody by delineating spatial domains of integrated geological, mineralogical, geotechnical, and mineral processing data [1]  the precise delineation of geometallurgical domains can lead to significant improvement in mine planning, comminution circuit efficiency, and overall energy consumption [2] | 
2016-792 	 application of state of the art hydraulic fracture modelling techniques for safe-optimized design and for enhanced production |abstract: |this paper presents a number of emerging applications of hydraulic fracture initiation, propagation and interaction models  in the oil industry fracture design engineers often model hydraulic fracturing using 2d approximations but the physical process is inherently 3d and some very important aspects are lost during the model simplification, such as the means to impose a full 3d initial stress state and the capability of the fracture to propagate and potentially curve in an evolving complex stress state  a mode-1 3d hydraulic fracturing methodology is developed within an adaptive finite element method (fem) and discrete element method (dem) framework for generic fracture shapes  the fracture insertion process is based on a geometry update procedure rather than the more traditional de approach of splitting elements along their edges or through the element itself  this leads to better control of the mesh quality and an improved performance of the numerical scheme  the applications include curving fracture paths and potentially connecting fractures from a multi-well stimulation stage  |introduction |hydraulic fracturing is a complex engineering process (economides and nolte, 2000) and understanding its key aspects are essential to a fracking design engineer whose main goal is to obtain a designed fracture complexity in the target reservoir (cipolla et al, 2010; economides and nolte, 2000)  a number of the complexities are inherent to hydraulic fracturing; such as material heterogeneity, local variations in stress and inadequacies in knowing the precise location of potentially several pre-existing fracture sets (king, 2010)  within a numerical framework (such as adaptive finite element (fe) (zienkiewicz et al, 2005; belytschko et al, 2000) and discrete element (de) (munjiza, 2004) methods) each of these knowledge gaps can be explored and their role in hydraulic fracturing better understood  in this paper enhanced production refers to the increase in fracture complexity  |the first attempts at quantifying hydraulic fracture almost exclusively centered on analytical schemes which provide a way of understanding some simple relationships between key variables such as fluid pressures and fracture widths (yew and weng, 2015)  this simplicity comes at the cost of ignoring some of the major complexities which are observed in many hydraulic fracture jobs | 
2016-794 	 hydraulic fracture well interconnections in anisotropic stress fields |abstract: |“simul-frac” and “zipper-frac” are hydraulic fracturing (hf) techniques for stimulation treatments that offer simultaneous and sequential fracturing at proximal wells with the intention of maximizing fracture zone complexity  the idea of these techniques is to deliberately redistribute stresses during active injection around the wells to create inter-well linkages, and extend the stimulated volume to create a far-reaching fracture network  |consider a two-well injection-production field case: if the rock mass natural fracture system is closely spaced and homogeneous at a large sampling volume, empirical homogenization functions could be developed to allow some modicum of consistent large-scale predictability of hf behavior  however, in a multi-well system in an anisotropic stress field, it seems more difficult to achieve this consistently because of the added complexity introduced by the deviatoric stress field and its orientation with respect to the existing rock mass fabric, as well as the induced changes in stresses caused by the injection/production activity (thm coupled)  at the scale where the inter-well distance is perhaps only one order of magnitude larger, there is no chance that a homogenization approach can succeed: the system must be simulated with a discrete, stress-dependent block model  the universal distinct element code (udectm), a distinct element stress-displacement method, appears to be the most realistic commercial tool at this time for this class of problems, and it allows the study of the effects of fracture geometries and properties in a naturally fractured rock at different stress field anisotropy values  |effects of simul-frac and zipper-frac along with effects of in-situ stresses on deformation and fluid flow are investigated in the context of hydraulic fracturing  coupled hydro-mechanical modeling was performed in two dimensional simulations using udectm  three scenarios of modified simul-frac were studied to see how offset between the stages affect inter-well connectivity, mechanical deformation and fluid distribution  these 2d simulations suggest that in-situ stresses have a significant impact on the re-initiation direction of fractures  zipper-frac offers a better inter-well connectivity than simul-frac  having an injection stages with offset leads to more deformation both in the inter-well and outer-well spaces | 
2016-800 	 evaluation of brittleness from spalling and bending tests |abstract: |brittleness, as a description of post-failure response, has a crucial role in understanding the behavior of rock under different structural conditions, including geometry and size  despite the importance of this concept, there is no standard testing method for measuring brittleness and many different definitions have been reported  it is known that in fracture of rock, brittleness depends on the rock type, geometry, and size of the structure, as well as loading conditions, as the ratio of stored elastic energy to dissipated fracture energy depends on rock, geometry, and size  to investigate brittleness, two different types of laboratory experiments are suggested  the surface instability test is used to study brittleness in compression and it is shown that the ratio of uniaxial compression strength to surface instability peak strength could be used as a brittleness index  in addition, three-point bending tests are advocated to evaluate brittleness in tension  since size effect is present because of the competition between stored energy per volume and dissipated energy per area, experiments performed in mode i fracture clearly demonstrate brittleness  as a consequence, as the size increases, the structural response becomes more brittle  |introduction |post-peak response, a common measure of structural failure and sometimes referred to as brittleness, is crucial in many rock engineering applications, such as identifying placement of fractures for stimulation of low permeability formations [1], predicting the stability of a borehole during drilling [2], and hydraulic fracturing [3]  |in a traditional sense, “brittle” means the inability of a material to undergo inelastic deformation without loss of load-bearing capacity [4]  thus, ductile behavior is characterized by the ability of the material to support an increasing load as it nonlinearly deforms  the term brittle is also used in the context of fracture, to describe the absence of inelastic energy dissipation in the creation of a new surface [5]  finally, brittle is often applied to the instability of a structure once peak load is reached [6] | 
2016-803 	 active ultrasonic imaging and interfacial characterization of stationary and evolving fractures in rock |abstract: |the objective of this study is to deploy ultrasonic waves toward better understanding of preexisting and evolving fractures in rock, with the dual focus on i) reconstructing the curvilinear fracture geometry, and ii) mapping the distribution of its heterogeneous specific (shear and normal) stiffness  this is accomplished via the 3d scanning laser doppler vibrometer (sldv) that is capable of monitoring the triaxial particle velocity at every scan point on the sample's surface  experiments are performed on slab-like granite specimens featuring either stationary or evolving fractures where the fracturing, in the latter case, occurs in 3- point bending configuration  the rock specimens are then excited, under the plane stress condition, by a piezoelectric transducer at 20-30khz, while the in-plane velocity response of the sample is monitored over a rectangular region covering the fracture  thus obtained full-field data are next used to recover both the fracture geometry, and to expose its nonlinear contact behavior  the latter is then approximated point-wise in terms of the linearized contact properties i e  specific (shear and normal) stiffness, whose recovered spatial variations for stationary and advancing fractures are found to conform with expected trends  |introduction |geometric and interfacial properties of fractures and related features (e g  faults) in rock and other like materials are the subject of critical importance to a wide spectrum of scientific and technological facets of our society including energy production from natural gas and geothermal resources (baird et al  2013, verdon and wustefeld 2013, taron and elsworth 2010), seismology (mclaskey et al  2012), hydrogeology (cook 1992), environmental protection (place et al  2014), and mining (gu et al  1993)  unfortunately, a direct access to fracture surfaces in rock is, in most field situations, either non-existent or extremely limited (e g  via isolated boreholes, shafts, or adits), which necessitate the use of remote sensing techniques where the contact law at the boundary of rock discontinuities is often assumed to be linear and represented in a parametric fashion via e g  the so-called (shear and normal) specific stiffness, relating the contact traction to the jump in displacements across the interface (schoenberg 1980)  despite its heuristic and simplistic nature, the fracture's interfacial stiffness matrix not only is proven to be immediately relevant to the stress and thus stability analyses in rock masses (eberhardt et al  2004), but also bears an intimate connection to the fracture's hydraulic properties (pyrak-nolte and nolte 2016, pyrak-nolte and morris 2000), and may serve as a precursor of progressive shear failure along rock discontinuities (hedayat et al 2014) | 
2016-809 	 the predictability of physico-mechanical properties of pyroclastic rocks from the needle penetration index |abstract: |smooth core samples for the laboratory tests cannot always be prepared particularly from weak rocks  although some simple indirect test methods have been developed to estimate the mechanical properties of rocks, the specimen preparation from soft rock for some indirect tests is still difficult  in order to close this gap, the needle penetration test has been used recently  this study investigates the predictability of physico-mechanical properties of pyroclastic rocks from the needle penetration index (npi)  the block samples of pyroclastic rocks were collected from six different locations of erciyes (kayseri) region of turkey  the needle penetration, the uniaxial compressive strength and tensile strength, density, and porosity tests were carried out on the specimens in the laboratory  the npi values were correlated to the physico-mechanical properties  very strong correlations were obtained between the npi values and rock properties  it was concluded that the physico-mechanical properties of pyroclastic rocks can be predicted from the needle penetration index  |introduction |the physico-mechanical properties of rocks are used for designing surface and underground structures in rock mass in mining and civil engineering projects  smooth core samples suggested by standards for the laboratory tests cannot always be prepared particularly from weak and clay-bearing rocks  some simple indirect test methods such as point load test and block punch index tests have been developed to estimate the mechanical properties of rocks  however, the specimen preparation from weak and clay-bearing rocks is still difficult for these indirect tests  in order to close this gap, the needle penetration test which is a simple and non-destructive index test was developed  |the needle penetration test is a non-destructive index test which is applicable both in the field and laboratory and does not require any special sample preparation [1]  the test has been used for the estimation of physical and mechanical properties of weak or soft rocks  although some researchers have suggested some correlations between the physico-mechanical rock properties and the needle penetration index (npi) for weak rocks, the studies are limited on this area  in this study, the predictability of physico-mechanical properties of pyroclastic rocks from the npi was investigated | 
2016-810 	 improved signature hole analysis for blast vibration control in open pit mines |abstract: |ground vibration is an undesired effect of blasting in mining  in some situations where geotechnical slope performance is of concern, blast design gains an increased relevance as a variable to consider in slope stability  several methods are available to assess the vibration levels produced by blasting in a mine operation (surface and underground)  the scaled distance approach is the most widely used methodology to control vibration, however it has several limitations including the need for a complete set of data to find the ground coefficients used in the governing equation  this paper proposes a new methodology using a case study to predict and control ground vibrations produced by mine blasts based on the concept of the traditional signature hole technique  in the new methodology, a monte carlo scheme is used to produce a histogram of the predicted peak particle velocity and acceleration in locations of interest of the slope, according to the geometry, the timing, and the sequence of the blast design  this methodology has been used in surface coal mines to protect important infrastructure (power structures, gas lines, etc ) and in metal mines to control vibration levels to minimize the impact of blasting on the performance of large open pit slopes  |introduction |in the mining production cycle, blasting is the most economical and efficient method to fracture and move the ground (rock material)  it is commonly accepted that blasting has less influence on slope stability than geology and ground water  however, in some situations of sensitive slope behavior or where needed to protect important infrastructure, blast design takes increased relevance as a variable to consider  |due to the nature of blasting, it is inevitable to damage, to some degree, the rock mass behind the slope face in an open pit operation  along with rock mass damage, ground vibrations are another undesirable consequence of blasting  however, there are practical procedures based on experience and trial and error that may be implemented to minimize both rock mass damage and potentially damaging ground vibrations  the use of presplit blastholes and control of the amount of explosive detonated per delay are typical techniques used to help mitigate such unwanted effects  recently, through the use of electronic initiation systems for mine blasting, timing and initiation sequence have become additional variables which allow for improvements in blast performance that warrant further study  several methodologies are currently available to assess the vibration levels generated by a production shot  the most commonly used approach by the mining industry to assess ground vibration levels is scaled distance  however, in this approach, timing between holes or explosives charges is not a variable that can be assessed by that method  moreover, there is no clear guideline as to what exactly constitutes a delay  this paper presents the application of a novel approach to predict and control ground vibration levels using improved signature hole technique or waveform superposition  the novel approach is semi-empirical, accounting for the vibration characteristics of the ground through the measurement of the signature waveform, including a monte carlo scheme, rendering a stochastic approach more preferable than a deterministic one | 
2016-811 	 experimental determination of the maximum indirect tensile stress parameters for dionysos marble |abstract: |in this study three series of indirect tensile tests, the brazilian test, the flattened brazilian (fb) test and the ring test, were performed in order to determine the indirect maximum tensile stress of dionysos marble  a number of circular disc specimens (d = 54 mm) was prepared by coring dionysos marble cubes normal to the plane of transverse isotropy  different sets of circular discs were prepared by varying the loading angle 2<u+03b1> and the internal diameter for the fb test and ring test respectively  all specimens were prepared by following the isrm suggested methods and the load was applied using a stiff 1600 kn mts hydraulic testing machine and a 500 kn load cell  this paper focuses on the comparison of the indirect maximum tensile stress resulting from the three different tests and the calculation of the theoretical and experimental coefficient k for the fb test and ring test  the coefficient k is a function of the loading angle 2<u+03b1> and the ratio q (internal to external diameter) for the fb test and the ring test respectively  |introduction |it is well known that tensile failure is an important phenomenon in the mechanical winning of minerals, drilling and blasting of rocks, rock failure of underground and surface works, as well as in structural engineering practice  therefore, the reliable experimental determination of the tensile strength of rocks is essential to the design of such systems  |conventionally, the tensile strength of rock should be determined using the direct tension test; however, this test presents experimental difficulties and is not commonly conducted in rock mechanics laboratories  these difficulties arise due to both the bending stresses or torsion moment (caused by the eccentricity of machine axial loads) and the localized concentrated stresses (caused by improper gripping of specimens) (barla and goffi, 1974, nova and zaninetti, 1990) | 
2016-814 	 predicting fracture intensity and measuring uncertainty from borehole data |abstract: |this paper presents a methodology to predict the fracture intensity and to measure the uncertainty associated with it, which could be expressed in terms of variance or probability intervals conditioned to the information of the fractures observed on boreholes  the methodology relies on the assumption that the fracture centers are distributed according to a poisson process and is applicable in case of lineic data (scanline) as well as cylindrical well data  the principle is to produce a set of realizations of a poisson-boolean model that honors the available data (conditional simulation) and to assess the fracture intensity on each realization  the conditioning to observed fractures can be made for the poisson-boolean model because the fractures and their locations are independent of each other, which agrees with many models that have been considered in recent researches  the numerical values obtained through the realizations can be combined to predict the fracture intensity and to measure the uncertainty in the actual values  |introduction |a comprehensive understanding of fracture systems is critical to the economic development of underground mining, open pit mining, tailing dam, oil and gas reservoirs, geothermal reservoirs, groundwater resources and underground nuclear wastes disposal  as a rock mass property, fractures must be characterized in the three-dimensional space, whereas observations are limited to 1d (boreholes) and 2d (outcrops, drift walls), moreover very often to rather short stations, so that the available data are subject to geometric, truncation and censoring biases  fracture characteristics include the number of fracture sets and, for each set, the number, orientation, spacing, location, shape and size of the fractures must be inferred from data sampling  some important parameters that are considered nearly in all models are the fracture intensity and fracture size  |many authors have shown how to estimate the fracture size distribution from outcrops, drifts and tunnel walls (baecher, 1980; laslett, 1982, lantuejoul et al , 2005) and microseismic data (tafti et al , 2011, 2012; aminzadeh et al , 2013)  in this study, we will focus on the fracture intensity, which is defined as the mean area of fractures per unit volume of rock masses and denoted as p32 (dershowitz and herda, 1992; chiles and de marsily, 1993)  fracture intensity is one of the preferred ways for describing the fracturing of a rock mass as, unlike other intensity descriptors, it is non-directional and gives an indication of the amount of fracturing of a rock mass  however, its value is derived from directionally biased methods, so, while it is a good indicator of overall fracturing, its estimation still depends on being able to compensate for known biases | 
2016-820 	 the combination of innovative completion hardware and 3d non-planar fracture/reservoir simulation in shale completion optimization |abstract: |in shale reservoirs, adequate completion and fracture designs have proven critical to well performance  changes in parameters such as number of clusters, cluster spacing, injection rate and injection volume have been shown to significantly affect both cluster efficiency and overall well productivity (cadwallader et al , 2015)  this study builds on previous work where multicluster cased & perforated completion designs were optimized using 3d frac and reservoir simulation (sebastian et al , 2015)  |this paper presents the results of an integrated completion optimization approach that combines the benefits and flexibility of using new completion hardware (coiled tubing activated sliding sleeves) and state-of-the-art 3d non-planar fracturing and reservoir modeling to optimize performance in a horizontal eagle ford shale well  the overall goals of this work were to determine the production potential related to 100% cluster efficiency through single point injection, to optimize completion/frac design via changes in design parameters (sleeve spacing, injection rate, and injection volume), and to further validate modeling capability  |this document focuses on the fracture and reservoir modelling prediction and validation efforts to optimize execution of the trial  the results shown here were generated with a coupled 3d non-planar hydraulic fracturing simulator that uses the discrete element method to simulate the hydromechanical processes governing hydraulic fracturing propagation  once the fracture geometry and associated conductivity were generated, they were exported to a 3d reservoir flow simulator, which in turn, generated curves for expected well productivity  field surveillance data, including microseismic and production decline analysis, was used to validate the modeling predictions  |introduction |this paper builds on previous work targeted at improving cluster efficiency and well productivity in plugged and perforated shale completions in the eagle ford (cadwallader et al , 2015)  at the time, changes in completion design such as cluster distance, number of clusters, injection rate and injection volume were successfully used to increase cluster efficiency and overall well productivity  however, despite achieving positive results, surveillance data (including fiber optics) showed that, even after changes were implemented, cluster efficiency could undergo further improvement | 
2016-825 	 3d analysis of thermo-poroelastic processes on fracture network deformation and induced micro-seismicity potential in egs |abstract: |this study presents three dimensional (3d) analyses of a fracture network in an enhanced geothermal system (egs) with special emphasis on the role of hydraulic fracture/natural mechanical interactions and coupled thermo-poromechanical processes  the behavior of the system is modeled by coupling a thermo-poroelastic displacement discontinuity (dd) method (for fracture opening and shear, fluid and heat diffusion in the reservoir matrix) with a finite element method (for fluid flow and heat transport inside the fractures)  the nonlinear characteristics of fracture opening and shear deformation are taken into account  the resulting method is then used to simulate an injection/production processes into/from a synthetic fracture network consisting of a major fracture intersected by a set of smaller natural fractures  injection/production into/from the fracture network results in gradual shearing of the fractures that impacts the thermo-hydro-mechanical characteristics of the fracture system  it is also shown that the early micro-seismic events can be associated with fracture slip on smaller connected fractures due to thermal perturbation  continued injection leads to stress intensity conditions favorable for fracture propagation in shear and tensile modes, which could increase the reservoir surface area and further contribute to seismicity  |introduction |design and management of enhanced geothermal system (egs) and hydrothermal reservoirs can benefit from simulation of coupled fracture deformation and fluid flow - since interactions among fluid and heat flow, and the mechanical response of the fracture and matrix impact reservoir permeability variations and occurrence of seismicity  the coupling between these processes during injection/extraction can be taken into account using linear theory of thermo-poroelasticity  often, heat transport in a reservoir is dominated by advection  however, when the rock matrix permeability is low (delaney, 1982) and fluid flows mainly within deformable fractures or a fault, conductive transport in the rock matrix leads to important phenomena related to coupling between temperature, pore pressure, and stress that may result in delayed rock matrix and/or natural fracture failure, potentially producing delayed seismicity  although the thermo-poroelastic constitutive equations are linear, analytical solutions can be found only for relatively simple geometries and processes (e g , tao and ghassemi, 2010; ghassemi et al  2008; li et al  1998; kurashige, 1989) and the solution of problems such as injection /extraction into a deformable fracture network requires numerical modeling even in two dimensions |

2016-829 	 shear reactivation of natural fractures in hydraulic fracturing |abstract: |fluid transport during hydraulic fracturing can be either proppant or asperity dominated  in the absence of proppants, dilatancy of the natural fractures during shear reactivation is required to provide sufficient aperture and hydraulic conductivity  if a hydraulic fracture intersects a natural fracture, the fracturing fluid enters the natural fractures, increasing pore pressure and decreasing the effective normal stress on the fracture plane  if the effective normal stress becomes low enough, the natural fracture may slip and dilate, resulting in increased aperture and hydraulic conductivity  to understand these processes, we conducted direct shear tests on rock fractures with constant normal load and examined the effect of slip and dilatancy of asperities on mechanical aperture  using 3d coordinates of the surface asperities and measuring shear displacement and dilation during shear testing, the evolution of the mechanical aperture was calculated as a function of slip and normal stress  the calculation suggested that when effective normal stress is low, small slip events along a rough surface can induce dilatancy along the fracture surface that will cause considerable increases in the hydraulic aperture of the fracture  |introduction |proppants are introduced during hydraulic fracturing to increase fracture transmissivity during well production (cipolla et al  2009)  but can fracture conductivity also be increased without proppant, for example, by water fracing? (mayerhofer et al 1997)  in contrast to conventional propped hydraulic fracture treatments, water fracs rely on reactivation of natural fractures to induce permanent shear induced dilation, which enhances reservoir permeability (chen et al 2000, weng et al 2015)  although the conductivity of un-propped shear-induced fractures is relatively low compared to that of the propped fractures, such conductivity can still play an important role in enhancing the productivity of ultra-low-permeability rocks like shale (zhang et al  2013, weng et al 2015, jansen et al  2015) |

2016-843 	 a novel approach to mapping hydraulic fractures using poromechanic principles |abstract: |hydraulic fracturing has been instrumental in commercializing ultra-tight unconventional resources  although hydraulic fracturing has been used for nearly half a century in more than a million wells, understanding and mapping hydraulic fracture growth remains a challenge for ultra-tight reservoirs  a number of approaches have been taken to better understand and characterize hydraulic fractures in the subsurface, but a technology which can accurately map hydraulic fractures with minimal operational interference and negligible cost remains elusive  this paper discusses the technical foundation for a novel hydraulic fracture and proppant mapping technology (image frac), which is technically robust, easy to use, and low cost  the technology is founded upon basic linear poromechanics theory, utilizing measurements from surface pressure gauges during the stimulation process to determine the geometry, orientation, and spatial location of hydraulic fractures with what is believed to be higher precision than other traditional techniques  an overview of the technical foundation of this technology is provided with an illustrative example showing how this technology can be applied  in addition, key sensitivity studies, examining the impact of fracture geometries, mesh size, formation properties, number and size of fractures per stage, and fracture symmetry are provided  these sensitivity studies illustrate the potential for a robust fracture mapping technique to be developed using the fundamental principles discussed herein  |introduction |recent advances in hydraulic fracturing, including multi-stage fracturing, novel completion tools, and use of slickwater & hybrid fluid systems (king 2010), have enabled economic production from north american shale reservoirs  well productivity in these ultra-low-permeability reservoirs is largely controlled by the stimulation effectiveness (i e , the ability to create a large matrix-fracture contact area with optimal conductivity distribution)  during field development, multiple horizontal wells are drilled on a pad, so identifying the optimum well spacing or pumped fluid/proppant volumes to maximize the value of a pad is critical  currently, well spacing is often optimized based on numerous well spacing field trials, which is a costly and inefficient approach  an improved understanding of hydraulic fracture geometry using systematic methods, therefore, has potential to significantly improve the value extracted from ultra-low-permeability plays |

2016-879 	 imaging fracture networks using joint seismic and electrical change detection techniques |abstract: |during the initial phase of this subter project, we conducted a series of high resolution seismic imaging campaigns designed to characterize induced fractures  fractures were emplaced using a novel explosive source that limits damage to the borehole  this work provided evidence that fracture locations could be imaged at inch scales using high-frequency seismic tomography but left many fracture properties (i e  permeability) unresolved  we present here the methodology for the second phase of the project, where we will develop and demonstrate emerging seismic and electrical geophysical imaging technologies that characterize 1) the 3d extent and distribution of fractures stimulated from the explosive source, 2) 3d fluid transport within the stimulated fracture network through use of a contrasting tracer, and 3) fracture attributes through advanced data analysis  focus will be placed upon advancing these technologies toward near real-time acquisition and processing in order to help provide the feedback mechanism necessary to understand and control fracture stimulation and fluid flow  |introduction |imaging fractures with geophysical techniques is a central focus for reservoir development, especially in tight shale gas formations and enhanced geothermal systems (egs), and for material storage applications such as co2 sequestration and deep nuclear repositories  an outstanding problem, however, is that imaging fractures and their evolution during production and/or storage is inherently complex, regardless of logistical and/or economic monitoring constraints  this difficulty arises primarily from two characteristics: 1) the tortuous and multi-scaled geometries of fracture networks (e g  extrinsic anisotropy), which at the smallest levels is unresolvable with far-field geophysical observations, and 2) the intrinsic anisotropy of the natural rock systems where targets are typically located (e g  volcanics, tight shales)  it has been shown, however, that imaging resolution can be improved by increasing two geophysical survey design parameters: 1) azimuthal and offset coverage (i e  surrounding the target at closer offsets) and 2) independent data measurements (i e  multi-physics large n approaches) (e g  neal and krohn 2012, bergmann et al  2016) | 
2016-880 	 geomechanical simulation of underground coal gasification |abstract: |a geomechanical analysis of underground coal gasification (ucg) requires integrated modeling in complex multidisciplinary areas of coupled fluid flow, rock and cavity mechanics  in this study, the results from an existing thermal and multi-phase fluid flow simulator are imported into a geomechanical module to solve for the vertical displacement and the stress variation around a propagating cavity induced by a coal gasification process  a controlled retracting injection point (crip) well configuration is applied in the thermal reservoir simulator to model chemical reactions and geochemistry  the high temperature nature of the ucg process as well as creation of void space within the rock mass continuum require the use of efficient rock constitutive models  three different constitutive models are investigated in this study: linear elastic, hyperbolic, and elasto-plastic  we have then applied these constitutive models on a case study to compare the results  the displacement of a coal layer and the surrounding blocks as well as stress arching in regions away from the cavity can efficiently be captured by the use of all the above constitutive models; however, a stress analysis around the induced cavity necessitates implementation of a constitutive model which can efficiently capture the shear softening after the rock failure  |introduction |coal accounts for almost 30% of global primary energy consumption, which makes it the second largest primary energy source in the world after oil  coal is also the largest provider of electricity  over 40% of global power production derives from coal [1]  coal's significant position in the global energy mix is mainly because it is abundant, low-cost, and the most wide-spread fossil fuel in the world [2]  despite a decline in the coal demand growth in 2014, international energy agency's forecast shows the growth of almost 1% per year through 2020 [1]  moreover, based on the 2013 survey of world energy council, coal consumption is forecast to increase over 50% to 2030  this rise will be mainly due to the escalating electricity rates in the developing countries [2]  therefore, more coal extraction is necessary to meet the global future energy demand | 
2016-882 	 dfn modelling of major structural instabilities in a large open pit for end of life planning purposes |abstract: |the chuquicamata open pit mine situated in northern chile is approaching the latter part of its surface mine life  with an excavated depth of close to 1000 m, maintenance of the pit slopes becomes increasingly challenging  one of the major controls on slope stability is the potential for large scale instabilities associated with major structures that can extend over hundreds of metres  some of these major structures are mapped and included in mine planning models as wireframe surfaces  however there are a high number of structures that are large enough to cause significant instability, whilst being too small and numerous to explicitly model  with various options being considered for the end of life of the pit in terms of slope push back, slope steepening and ramp trimming, how could the impact of these major and intermediate structures be considered upon the outcome of the various design options? |discrete fracture network (dfn) modelling was identified as the most practical way to assess the potential for major kinematic instabilities as a consequence of movement upon major structures  analysis of mapping, borehole and scanline geotechnical data, allows the spatial and geometrical properties of the fault network to be derived  thus the large scale wireframed structures can be supplemented by intermediate scale stochastically generated faults that honour the same spatial and geometric patterns and properties  of particular note was the fact that borehole fracture intensity data showed that fault intensity was strongly correlated to the distance to the nearest mapped major structures which enabled the distribution of stochastic intermediate faults to be controlled by a distance to fault property  |in addition to using the dfn model to probabilistically evaluate the volume of unstable material as a consequence of the three different closure options, a novel technique was developed for mapping areas of the slope that were prone to block formation and therefore potential instability  this involved stacking the kinematic results of multiple realisations of where blocks had been found within the dfn at the slope level and computing the probability of occurrence of these blocks within a 3d grid of the pit slope  the result being risk maps of kinematic block formation across the pit surface | 
2016-883 	 permeability evolution and proppant compaction in artificial fractures on green river shale |abstract: |through laboratory experiments with artificial propped fractures in green river shale, this paper compares the evolution of permeability for native ch4 and with those of sorbing co2, slightly sorbing n2 and non-sorbing he, as a function of pore pressure  the findings from these experiments help to understand proppant embedment and fracture diagenesis in shales  experiments were conducted on 1inch diameter, 2inch long split cylindrical samples sandwiched with proppant at a constant confining stress of 20 mpa and with varied pore pressure — increases in pore pressure represent concomitant decreases in effective stress  permeability and sorption characteristics are measured by pulse transient methods  to explore the effect of swelling and embedment on fracture surface geometry, we measure the evolution of transport characteristics for different proppant geometries (single layer vs  multi-layer), gas saturation, and sample variance  in order to simulate both production and enhanced gas recovery processes, both injection and depletion cases are investigated  for both strongly- (co2, ch4) and slightly-adsorptive gases (n2) the permeability first decreases when gas pressure increases because of swelling  it then increases beyond the langmuir threshold due to the over-riding influence of effective stresses  due to its highest adsorptive affinity, co2 returns the lowest permeability among these three gas permeants  compared to the case of a mono-layer propped sample, the sample with four layers exhibits less swelling as implied by its elevated k/k0 ratio  interestingly the duration of gas exposure and saturation tested here which is up to ~20hrs does not have a significant influence on permeability for either adsorptive or non-adsorptive gases  permeabilities recovered from both injection and depletion cycles generally overlap each other and are repeatable with little hysteresis  this suggests the dominant role of reversible swelling over irreversible embedment  permeability variance between different samples is of the order of ~1 5 - 2 times but with repeatable trends and order of magnitude parity  gas permeant composition and related swelling effects exert important influences on the permeability evolution of shales under nominally in situ conditions | 
2016-886 	 the combined influence of stress barriers and natural fractures upon hydraulic fracture height growth |abstract: |source rock reservoirs are heterogeneous at very fine scales as a consequence of depositional sequence and subsequent compaction  the resultant heterogeneity can potentially induce large variations in lateral stress from one narrow vertical interval to the next within a pay zone  consequently, hydraulic fracture height growth in source rocks can be strongly influenced by very narrow bands of closure stress contrast induced by this heterogeneity  in addition, many source rock reservoirs contain dense networks of natural fractures which can influence hydraulic fracture development  we present our recent studies of the influence of strong variations in closure stress interacting with natural fractures upon hydraulic fracture propagation  we observe that natural fractures can act both to aid and arrest fracture propagation depending upon their location relative to the hydraulic fracture and the stress barrier  |introduction |source rock reservoirs are heterogeneous at very fine scales as a consequence of depositional sequence and subsequent compaction  the resultant heterogeneity in elastic properties can potentially induce large variations in lateral stress from one narrow vertical interval to the next within a pay zone because the same tectonic strains will induce significantly different stress states within each layer (eaton, 1969)  when a hydraulic fracture reaches a horizon where the stress contrast is greater than the net pressure in the hydraulic fracture at that point, it will arrest (simonson et al , 1978)  for normal and strike-slip stress environments, the hydraulic fracture opens against the minimum horizontal stress and propagation is largely vertical with the minimum horizontal stress controlling vertical propagation  this phenomenon has been confirmed both through modeling and laboratory experiment (jeffrey and bunger, 2009)  consequently, hydraulic fracturing in source rocks can be strongly influenced by very narrow bands of closure stress contrast induced by heterogeneity  |many source rock plays have been observed to contain significant natural fractures that are believed to influence the propagation of hydraulic fractures  numerous studies have investigated the effect of vertical fractures upon hydraulic fracture growth  however, the bulk of these studies have considered the scenario where the vertical extents of the hydraulic fracture, pay zone and natural fractures are identical (for example, gu and weng, 2010; renshaw and pollard, 1995; zhang and jeffrey, 2008)  in doing so, the dimensionality of the problem is reduced to 2d, making both experiment and modeling simpler  such studies have demonstrated that provided the hydraulic and natural fractures have the same vertical extent, it is possible to observe conditions where a hydraulic fracture is expected to arrest at natural fractures of specific orientations during its lateral propagation  however, by assuming the same height for the hydraulic fracture, pay zone and natural fractures, the impact of the natural fractures upon hydraulic fracture evolution is potentially exaggerated | 
2016-887 	 use of unique database of good quality stress data to investigate theories of fracture initiation, fracture propagation and the stress state in the subsurface |abstract: |over the last few years statoil has performed more than 200 high quality extended leak-off tests  this data has been used for determination of minimum stress and quantification of “formation integrity” parameters wrt well barriers and injection control  however the database includes many other parameters related to the initiation and propagation of a fracture with drilling mud  this represents a unique opportunity to investigate various claims in the industry relating to fracture gradient (fg) and formation integrity  for example, it is possible to compare fracture propagation pressures and determine whether there are any differences between water based and oil based muds  actual formation breakdown pressure can be compared to theoretical models to determine the statistical validity of such models when used for fg generation  statistical analysis on fracture propagation pressure permits another type of analysis which can be useful in a risk based approach for the estimation of fg during drilling  the data is also interesting in that it suggests that the subsurface on the norwegian continental shelf (ncs) is not in fact in equilibrium state with frictional strength of faults  for the regions covered by the database, there appears to be other mechanisms that result in higher values of minimum stress than that which would be the case for frictional equilibrium  finally, and in contrast to many other works, the work shows that ncs sediment packages are primarily characterized by a normal faulting regime  |introduction |statoil has put significant effort in performing high quality stress determination tests during the last decade or so [1-4]  extended leak-off tests (xlot) with several cycles are typically performed with drilling mud at casing shoes, and both shut-in and flowback phases are standard  unlike earlier standard procedures, the flowback stage is performed on a constant choke and the volumes are measured  interpretation is based on system stiffness approach  the basic procedure calls for a minimum of two cycles [1, 5]: |pump-in followed by a shut-in period of typically 15 minutes, followed by a flowback phase with constant choke setting  |pump-in followed directly by a flowback phase with constant choke setting  |

2016-890 	 strength degradation approach (sda) for estimation of confined strength of micro-defected rocks |abstract: |it is known that heterogeneity at the grain scale, such as grain geometry and mineral stiffness, as well as grain and grain boundary micro-cracks (called micro-defects) reduces the unconfined compressive strength of rocks  however, how the confined strength of a rock specimen is influenced by the presence of such features is not well understood  in this study, pfc2d and its embedded grain-based model (gbm) is used to investigate the influence of micro-defects on rock strength under unconfined and confined conditions  previously calibrated gbms with respect to laboratory properties of intact and heat-treated wombeyan marble are used to simulate rock specimens with varying micro-defect densities  micro-defects are simulated in the form of grain boundary frictional cracks  the results of numerical simulations are then used to develop semi-empirical equations that relate the confined peak strength difference of intact and micro-defected specimens  the applicability of the proposed approach, called the strength degradation approach (sda) for estimating the confined peak strength of micro-defected rocks is demonstrated  |introduction |heterogeneity plays an important role in the failure process of rocks especially at low confinement  the presence of heterogeneities results in the generation of internal tensile stresses even in an overall compressive stress field  the tensile stresses result in the generation of tensile cracks before the peak stress is reached  figure 1 schematically shows various types of heterogeneity at different scales; from block forming joints in a jointed rockmass, to defects in rock blocks and laboratory scale rock specimens, to grain boundaries and to inter- and intra-grain micro-cracks  |as discussed by lan et al  (2010) and valley et al  (2010), grain scale heterogeneity in a non-defected, intact piece of rock can be divided into the following three forms: |grain geometric heterogeneity resulting from different shapes and sizes of grains; |grain property heterogeneity resulting from stiffness and strength contrast between different grains; and |grain contact heterogeneity due to varying grain boundary lengths, orientations and properties  | 
2016-aa 	 improved characterization of anisotropic elastic moduli and stress for unconventional reservoirs using laboratory mineralogy, toc, static, and dynamic geomechanical data |abstract |to fully characterize geomechanical properties of a vertically transverse isotropic (vti) medium, such as shale, five independent stiffness coefficients are required  however, only three can be measured through sonic log measurements  this gap has traditionally been filled by applying the annie model  one of the critical assumptions in the annie model causes vertical poisson's ratio to always be greater than horizontal poisson's ratio and predicts the anisotropic and isotropic stresses to be equal  however, these assumptions are usually not the case in unconventional reservoirs  |a modified-annie (m-annie 1) model helps overcome the limitations of the annie by introducing two empirical multipliers  however, both the annie and m-annie 1 models require stoneley wave velocity as input, which prevents their applicability in cased-hole conditions or conditions with no advanced sonic logging tools  |recently, two new methods, velocity regression (v-reg) model and a further modified annie model (m-annie 2), were proposed to predict the stiffness coefficients independent of the stoneley wave  it is observed that the simple generic relationships derived from core ultrasonic data are not sufficient for stiffness coefficients characterization  |ultrasonic velocities were measured on whole cores from a north american shale play in 0, 45, and 90° orientations to obtain direction-dependent compressional (vp) and shear waves (vs) velocities  different anisotropic acoustic models were applied to compare their prediction capacity and limits  this study includes more laboratory data, such as x-ray diffraction (xrd) mineralogy and total organic carbon (toc), to provide a lithological context  it was observed the shale has a large portion of carbonate (> 80v%), and its acoustic anisotropy indicator thomsen parameters, epsilon and gamma, are strongly related to clay and kerogen content  this paper discusses how the high carbonate content alters the previously established generic models for m-annie 1, 2, and v-reg  the paper also investigates the relationship between the dynamic and static elastic moduli interpreted from the ultrasonic and triaxial data, respectively  the dynamic and static data were used to fit widely used dynamic-to-static conversion equations: the canady and morales equations  the canady equation was extended to the “very hard” (greater than 70 gpa young's modulus) regime, while the morales equation was extended to the regime of less than 10% porosity  next, the calibrated dynamic young's modulus is also used to estimate the unconfined compressive strength (ucs)  the prediction qualities of different acoustic anisotropic models are investigated  |as compared with the conventional annie and isotropic models, the lithology-based anisotropic acoustic models (m-annie 1, 2, and v-reg) highly improve the predictions of the stiffness coefficients and elastic moduli; hence, they provide better predictions of the minimum horizontal stress  accurate predictions of elastic moduli and stress are crucial for selecting proper drilling mud, cement weights, and drilling/perforation locations | 
2016-ddd 	 understanding acoustic data in unconventional reservoirs |abstract  acoustic velocities are one of the key measurements for production enhancement and increased drilling efficiency in unconventional reservoirs, but the environment can present considerable complications to accurate data interpretation  because these reservoirs are often produced by way of horizontal boreholes through shales, the sonic logs respond to intrinsic shale anisotropy, natural fractures, drilling induced stress, and nearby beds above or below the target formation  these intertwined effects frequently lead to misinterpretations such as picking a compressional slowness from an approaching bed but the shear slowness from the current formation, leading to odd (and confusing) geomechanical results  other times, shale anisotropy is inadvertently assumed to be linked to natural fracture networks  interpretations from different vendors, and even different analysts within the same team might vary greatly due to different processing methods  thus, we need to consider the various aspects of sonic response in horizontal wellbore through unconventional reservoirs and proscribe a workflow and quality control regime to ensure consistent and valid results   we begin with a discussion of the unconventional reservoir applications which require sonic data as key inputs, followed by a brief review of 3d anisotropy  the remainder of the work focuses on understanding the complex sonic log responses in horizontal shale reservoirs  a workflow is described, with the goal of correctly determining the compressional and shear velocities for the bed in which the tool resides as well as the nearby beds  several field examples will be examined in detail, describing the correct methods for interpretation and the common pitfalls  examples of how incorrectly interpreted results impact formation evaluation calculations follow  finally, operational recommendations to optimise sonic data collection in shale reservoirs will round out the discussion | 
2016-eeee 	 comparative study of pulsed-neutron derived openhole and casedhole lithology, mineralogy and total organic carbon in unconventional reservoir |abstract  representative mineral characterization of the reservoir is a key element for accurate petrophysical evaluation  conventional cores are considered as the best option to obtain detailed lithology and mineralogy of the formation  but, it is impractical and costly to obtain conventional cores across the entire well interval  natural and pulsed-neutron induced gamma ray spectroscopy from openhole measurements have been widely used in conventional and unconventional reservoirs, for defining the lithology and mineralogy  in older wells or the wells where openhole data acquisition was prohibitive due to operational and/or financial considerations, lithology and mineralogy information may not be available  in the cased-hole environment, the casing and concrete cause attenuation and contribution effects on the spectral gamma rays, which increase the uncertainty in measurements, making cased-hole spectroscopy analysis extremely challenging   for the purpose of characterizing the attenuation and contribution effects of casing and concrete on spectral gamma ray measurements, proprietary correction algorithms are developed using a combination of lab experiments and modeled tool response standards  the natural and pulsed-neutron induced gamma ray measurements are processed using these correction algorithms to obtain elemental composition  this information feeds an interpretation system to determine lithology and mineralogy of the formation  a methodology to separate organic and inorganic carbon is utilized to identify the total organic carbon (toc) content of the formation  the pulsed-neutron generator and high density gamma ray scintillator detector instrument allow measurement of natural, inelastic and thermal capture gamma rays, enabling elemental deconvolution through spectroscopy analysis   this paper demonstrates the validity of this novel technique by comparing the results of cased-hole and open-hole mineralogy of the vaca muerta formation in the neuquen basin in argentina  the cased-hole results show successful lithological and mineralogical classification, highly agreeing with open-hole analysis in siliciclastic and carbonate formations of the basin  data from the cased-hole is also analyzed to obtain toc of the formation   this capability to determine lithology, mineralogy and toc of the formation through the casing is particularly important to identify any bypassed pay zones in older wells or to evaluate the impact of formation on the production, especially if the well doesn't have conventional cores  and particularly in this formation, one of the most important unconventional plays in the world, which originally was not the target, when the field was, and still is, developed as a conventional play  deployment through casing and usage of pulsedneutron generator, reduces health, safety and environment (hs&e) hazards and promotes environmentally friendly data acquisition  this innovative technology enables the operators to gather additional data, previously possible only in the openhole environment, to characterize the reservoir for maximizing the production | 
2016-fff 	 hazard avoidance and completion optimization by integration of reservoir navigation services and deep shear wave imaging |abstract  proper placement of the lateral section of a horizontal well in the reservoir is of fundamental importance to the success of the well  reservoir navigation (commonly known as real-time geosteering) plays a key role for drillers trying to maintain the well trajectory within the desired interval  however, various geologic features, either crossing the well-bore or present around it, can impact the well performance in a variety of ways that can affect operational efficiency and well productivity  as such, during the completion design phase, operators have to choose between the options to either avoid or target these features   recent enhancements in the processing techniques of wireline acoustic data have made it possible to locate and characterize the distribution of acoustic reflections and other wave-field attributes such as near-well fractures, faults and other structural features including bedding boundaries out to more than 100ft from the wellbore  this new deep shear wave imaging technique (dswi), in combination with the reservoir navigation analysis allows high-grading of completion design efforts, by helping to verify the correct well placement in the target formation, and in identifying precise location of geologic hazards, such as faults, thief zones and naturally fractured intervals along the lateral   the acoustic data for this application can be acquired in horizontal wells, both in open hole and through casing  in the studied well acoustic data was recorded inside of a cemented 5 5 in  casing and processed to identify reflected acoustic signal  deep shear wave imaging results and reservoir navigation analysis data were then integrated to design a multi-stage, plug-n-perf completion  this combination of data was used successfully to identify multiple through-going faults along the lateral, which were potential communication pathways with the underlying aquifer  the fracture stages and perforation placement strategy was designed to avoid hydraulic fracture in the faulted intervals, thereby limiting the risk of connecting to the water zone below the well   to better understand the reservoir's response to the hydraulic fracture treatment (hf) in this well, real-time microseismic monitoring was used, having this data made possible to make decisions on the fly, such as the identification of faults which could potentially create pathway to the edwards aquifer below the lateral  inadvertent connection to the edwards aquifer has occurred in all previous wells in the area, resulting in a corresponding loss of the investment  the combination of reservoir navigation, deep shear wave imaging and micro seismic monitoring allowed us to successfully treat this well, enhancing production while avoiding creation of a pathway into the underlying aquifer |

2016-gggg 	 an experimental multi-scale approach for assessment of uncertainty in elastic properties of organic-rich mudrocks |abstract  reliable evaluation of elastic properties is challenging in mudrocks, yet required for geomechanical modelling and successful fracture treatment  it is important to assimilate variable elastic properties and distribution of each matrix component, as well as rock fabric in evaluation of effective elastic properties of organic-rich mudrocks  although existing methods (e g , effective medium theories) for well-log-based assessment of elastic properties take into account stiffness and approximate shape of the rock components, they all assume that elastic properties of each rock component remain constant  however, these properties might vary depending on the distribution and size of that particular component, as well as its adjacent minerals  furthermore, there is a significant uncertainty in elastic properties of kerogen  the uncertainty associated with the aforementioned parameters on effective elastic properties of rocks has not been investigated in previous publications   in this paper, we quantify the uncertainties involved in the evaluation of effective elastic properties in mudrocks, by quantifying the variability in elastic properties of individual rock components caused by their spatial distribution, size, and rock fabric, at the micro-scale domain  we performed nanoindentation mechanical tests at identified locations on samples from the haynesville and lower eagle ford formations, to measure young's modulus of individual and mixtures of rock components  finally, we quantified the variability of young's modulus in the micro-scale domain and their impact on effective elastic properties at the micro-scale and well-log domains in organic-rich mudrocks  the uncertainties involved in the evaluation of effective elastic properties of the samples are quantified by taking into account the measured variability in elastic properties of each individual component  the estimated effective elastic properties are then compared against core-scale measurements of elastic properties, previously obtained via tri-axial mechanical tests   the results revealed significant uncertainties in measurements of elastic properties of soft rock components, such as clay minerals and kerogen  young's moduli of individual clay components when located adjacent to stiff rock components (e g  large quartz and calcite grains) are at least 15% higher, compared to the cases where they are located adjacent to other clay minerals  the uncertainty in measured young's moduli is smaller in the case of non-clay minerals  elastic properties of kerogen are also quantified, and the measured average variability in kerogen young's modulus is estimated to be 10%  the results showed that the impact of variabilities in individual elastic properties of rock components on estimates of effective elastic properties at the micro-scale and log-scale domains is less than 5%  we also estimated an average relative difference of less than 25% between estimates of effective vertical young's modulus estimated using the inputs from nanoindentation tests and vertical young's modulus measured from core samples | 
2016-kk 	 how can microfracturing improve reservoir management? |abstract  microfracturing is an excellent method of obtaining direct, in-situ stress measurements, not only in shales, but in conventional reservoirs as well  recent advances have shown that microfracturing can help improve reservoir management by guiding well placement, optimizing injection rates, and managing perforation strategy   microfracturing consists of isolating small test intervals in a well between inflatable packers, increasing the pressure until a small fracture forms and then by conducting a few injection and shut-in cycles, extend the fracture beyond the influence of the wellbore  results show that direct stress measurements can be successfully acquired at multiple intervals in a few hours and the vertical scale nearly corresponds to electric log resolution  therefore, microfracture testing (generally performed in a pilot / vertical well) is an appropriate choice for calibrating log derived geomechanical models and obtaining a complete, accurate, and precise vertical stress profile   this paper describes the microfracturing process and presents several examples that led to increased hydrocarbon recovery by efficient stimulation and/or completion design  case studies presented range from optimizing hydraulic fracturing in unconventional (delaware basin, usa), determining safe waterflood injection rates in brownfields (offshore uk), and helping improve perforation placement in ultra-deepwater reservoirs | 
2016-n 	 deploying a fit-for-purpose formation evaluation program to de-risk tight gas sand plays |abstract  unconventional reservoirs present several challenges for petrophysical analysis where uncertainties are often much larger when compared to the usual conventional reservoirs  these low porosity and permeability rocks are associated with complex mineralogical properties and require an integrated approach to better characterize the reservoir, starting from a fit-for-purpose logging suite, the acquisition of high quality core and the implementation of an optimised core analysis program   in this paper the authors discuss an approach used to de-risk a tight gas play, where they made particular use of nmr log and dean-stark analysis for porosity and water saturation model calibration  obm drilling fluids could not be used due to environmental restrictions consequently deuterium oxide (commonly known as d2o) was used to dope the water based drilling mud, to discriminate between the volumes of mud filtrate and formation water within the formation   the formations intercepted by the boreholes proved to have similarities from a stratigraphic/geological point of view, but showed significant differences when seeking to define producible water volumes using nmr estimates of irreducible water saturation (swi) and core derived water saturations  in well#1 resistivity derived water saturations were low and very close to nmr irreducible water saturations suggesting little or no formation water should be produced  in contrast in well#2, a much more conglomeratic rock, a discrepancy was observed between core derived water saturations and nmr irreducible water saturations suggesting that this formation was not a irreducible water saturation and would likely contain producible water  it was also noteworthy that there existed a salinity variation between the two wells, where in well #2 for formation water was more “fresh-brackish” then in well #1   well #1 was subsequently fracture stimulated and produced a mixture of gas, condensate and water (assumed to be frac fluid – based on salinity measurement) and well#2 was put on hold based on high water saturation indication and complex conglomeratic rock matrix  petrophysical analysis played a key role in enabling the business decision through the integration of advanced logging and core analysis | 
2016-nnnn 	 new acoustic acquisition and processing method assist in delineating structure in an exploration play in the gulf of mexico |abstract  understanding structural traps surrounding salt domes can be difficult where the surface seismic does not have sufficient penetration ability or resolution  the use of borehole acoustic data with its higher frequency, coupled with its source and receiver configuration, provides the potential to help resolve some of this ambiguity  recently, an improved borehole acoustic acquisition sequence provided the ability to see much deeper into the formation in a deviated well  this improved detection was achieved by utilizing all the information captured in the waveform in addition to the standard guided acoustic modes  the combination of this sequence with new processing methods produced a new directional capability to obtain key structural parameters for the exploration and development of an offshore resource in the gulf of mexico   this technology was developed to understand the well position in relation to structure in poorly consolidated sediments where the surface seismic resolution is compromised  although the acoustic data were acquired in unconsolidated formations, the method enabled evaluation more than 100 feet from the wellbore imaging beds and faults, resulting in refinement of the reservoir architecture and potential connectivity   this paper includes a case history that shows an integrated validation of the structural elements at the borehole wall with standard borehole images and induction resistivity-derived dips as well as the extension into the surrounding rock using acoustic body waves generated in the formation by a dipole acoustic source  it is well known that the dipole source generates a borehole-guided flexural mode that is utilized for borehole acoustic shear measurements  in addition to the borehole guided mode, the dipole source also creates acoustic compressional and shear body waves that radiate from the borehole into the formation  given the correct geometry, these body waves can be reflected back to the borehole, enabling structures and features to be imaged  by utilizing the azimuthal sensitivity of the dipole, the strike of the structure can be determined and further refined by the integration of additional information   future development of the service is being extended to a 3d volume, enabling visualization of the salt dome and associated structures  in horizontal wells, this 3d visualization enables detection of layers above and below the wellbore as well as reflectors often associated with natural fractures and faults, both intersecting and non-intersecting with the borehole | 
2016-oo 	 a new directional fracture indicator based on integrating differential energy analysis of cross dipole measurements with stoneley fracture analysis |abstract  a new workflow has been developed for an azimuthal fracture indicator that estimates fracture presence by using measurements of attenuation of dipole acoustic waveforms as a complement to the established stoneley fracture analysis  the new approach computes normalized differential energies (nde's) for the oriented dipole for subsequent integration with the traditional stoneley and image analysis of fractures  a combination of the two methods provides a more confident directional fracture indicator and an improved 3d acoustic characterization of the formation  the new workflow was successfully tested on field data, from both vertical and horizontal wells from unconventional and conventional plays  the results of the analysis done in the workflow were validated by comparison with borehole images | 
2016-pppp 	 dipole shear anisotropy using logging-while-drilling sonic tools |abstract  this paper describes new modeling capabilities and processing/inversion workflows to output dipole shear anisotropy answer products, such as the fast and slow dipole shear slownesses; and the fast-shear polarization direction  a major objective is to model the coupling between the drill-collar and formation flexural modes and invert either of these two modes for the formation dipole-shear slowness  a new dispersion extraction algorithm isolates and identifies both of these dispersive arrivals in the recorded wavetrain  this is followed by a model based inversion of either the drill-collar flexural or formation flexural dispersions to obtain the dipole shear slownesses either in a fast or slow formations  the inversion algorithm inverts a dipole flexural dispersion in a chosen bandwidth where the dispersion sensitivity to the formation shear is significant   in a fast formation, the modeling results reveal that the two coupled (drill-collar and formation) modes show complementary features in terms of the shear sensitivity and the signal strength  that is, at low frequencies, the formation flexural mode has high sensitivity to the shear slowness but weak signal strength  on the other hand, the drill-collar flexural mode at high frequencies exhibits less but still a considerable amount of shear sensitivity with strong signal strength  against the misconception that the drill-collar mode only interferes with the formation mode with no useful information, this paper shows that it is possible to use both dipole drill-collar and formation flexural modes to maximize the reliability of extracting the formation dipole-shear slowness from the coupled flexural dispersions   the proposed workflow is first validated with synthetic datasets in both the fast and slow formations and then applied to two field datasets  to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time in the industry to systematically output the fast and slow shear slownesses from a directional dipole firing that would enable complete anisotropy characterization in unconventional organic-shale resources | 
2016-q 	 comparison of organic matter correlations in north american shale plays |abstract  the goal of this study is to define a uniform organic matter (om) correlation for north american shales with fundamental petrophysical parameters taken into consideration  several log based methods to calculate volume of om have been developed over the past several decades  this paper compares three of the most common om correlation techniques in twelve different north american shales  the techniques evaluated are a density based approach similar to schmoker's relation, a gamma ray based approach similar to that used by boyce and schmoker, and passey's <u+0394>logr method  it has been hypothesized that thermal maturity, kerogen type, lithofacies, redox potential, sedimentation rate, age and organic source will have a large effect on the shape of the correlations  however, the data shows that despite both geologic and geographic differences, the apparent slope, intercept and lom values are very similar  in fact, one correlation can often be used in the absence of any additional data   the leco and rock-eval6® total organic carbon (toc) measurements in this paper are taken from a core consortium for north american shales and other public core data  for leco toc, the samples have been digested in hcl to remove inorganic carbon and in some cases run through a soxhlet extraction if oil based mud was present  for rock-eval6 toc, the samples have been submitted to pyrolysis and oxidation using a discrete temperature program  log data (density/gamma ray) was used to create correlations because it is more representative of subsurface conditions and less prone to alteration, although there are issues with vertical resolution and depth corrections  further the log data was normalized to remove any bias based on logging vendor and vintage  all values in this paper have been converted from weight% toc to volume% om | 
2016-v57n2a1 	 the reservoir producibility index: a metric to assess reservoir quality in tight-oil plays from logs |abstract |methods for formation evaluation in unconventional reservoirs are evolving quickly as improved logging methodologies are developed  in gas-producing shale reservoirs, reservoir quality (rq) is strongly correlated to the total organic carbon (toc) content, because the kerogen, composed largely of organic carbon, hosts the pore system necessary for storing and transporting gas  in tight-oil formations, however, toc alone is not as strongly correlated to rq because storage and transport through inorganic pores can also be significant  instead, the volume of oil—the only producible organic component in tight-oil plays—is considered a dominant factor impacting rq, whereas the immobile organic components (kerogen and bitumen) are typically neglected  it has also been argued that immobile components are not inconsequential, but are actually negative rq indicators in tight-oil plays because they can adsorb oil, swell, and clog pore throats  indeed, methods to assess rq in tight-oil formations based on cuttings and core analysis, where the oil content is considered a positive rq indicator and the immobile organic content is considered a negative rq indicator, have been proven valuable in many basins, such as the williston, where the organic-lean middle member of the bakken formation and three forks formation are generally completed instead of the organic-rich upper and lower members of the bakken formation  however, surface measurements alone are inherently limited because the oil content of cuttings and cores from tight-oil formations may be unrepresentative of reservoir conditions due to core alteration, evaporative losses, etc  here we present a new metric for evaluating rq in tight-oil formations, the reservoir productivity index (rpi)  the rpi accounts for the positive rq properties of oil and the negative rq properties of immobile organic carbon, and it avoids challenges regarding representativeness of surface analysis because the oil content and other measurements are based on in-situ logs, principally nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) and nuclear spectroscopy  a term representing richness is included in the rpi, making a single metric that captures many of the factors describing tight-oil rq without requiring extensive log interpretation  several examples of the use of the rpi for evaluating rq in tight-oil plays are shown | 
2016-v57n2a5 	 method for acoustic anisotropy interpretation in shales when the stoneley-wave velocity is missing |abstract |characterizing shale mechanical properties requires five independent stiffness coefficients: c33, c44, c66, c11, and c13  in vertical wells, c33 and c44 are determined from the vertically propagating p- and s-waves  because the commonly implemented models, such as the annie model and the modified annie (m-annie 1) model use the stoneley-wave velocity to interpret c66 and two other assumptions to predict c11 and c13, they are not applicable in cased-hole conditions when the stoneley-wave cannot be measured  |in this paper, three new models without the stoneley-wave as an input are introduced: the velocity regression model (v-reg), the further modified annie (m-annie 2), and the integration model combining both  the bases of the v-reg model are the observed near-linear relationships among measured 0°, 45°, and 90° p- and s-wave velocities  m-annie 2, which is based on m-annie 1, uses the linear relationship between the thomsen compressional-and- shear-wave anisotropy parameters to replace the stoneley-wave constraint to predict c66  |by applying the new models to the ultrasonic core data of multiple organic shales, their predictive power for the stiffness coefficients, elastic moduli, and closure stress are evaluated  generally, the new models provide predictions that are as good as the m-annie 1 and better predictions than the annie and isotropic models  they provide good estimates for c66, with a small bias of approximately 1%  they also reduce the underestimation bias of the annie and isotropic models  finally, the log examples show that the new models yield predictions consistent with the stoneley-wave models  |introduction |an accurate prediction of young’s modulus and poisson’s ratio is crucial for predicting fracture deformation, minimum horizontal stress (<u+03c3>hmin), and rock brittleness  hence, it is important for selecting where to drill and perforate or designing a fracturing pumping strategy (khan et al , 2012; gokaraju et al , 2015)  elastic moduli computed from measured or predicted sonic-wave velocities are referred to as the small-strain elastic properties or “dynamic moduli,” in contrast to those measured in a rock mechanics laboratory with triaxial tests, which are referred to as the large-strain deformational properties or “static moduli ” both the short-term brittle deformation during drilling/ fracturing and the long-term ductile deformation during production are related to the static moduli  so, all dynamic moduli must be transformed to static moduli based on the empirical relationships calibrated to laboratory data for their future use in drilling/completion designs |

2016-v57n6a1 	 shale fracturing characterization and optimization by using anisotropic acoustic interpretation, 3d fracture modeling, and supervised machine learning |abstract |elastic anisotropy resulting from shale lamination makes fracture prediction in shale more complex, and traditional methods to predict fracture geometry assuming isotropy frequently prove to be inadequate  common 3d fracture-modeling software is based on isotropic rock models, and models that account for anisotropy are computationally expensive, especially when numerous simulations must be performed by varying the input parameters for parametric study  |a new workflow was created that integrates anisotropic acoustic log interpretation, 3d fracture modeling, and neural networks to improve fracture prediction accuracy and efficiency for anisotropic shales  the workflow generates a neural network with a limited number of 3d fracture-modeling cases; the fracture modeling uses rock mechanical properties interpreted from sonic logs with properly selected anisotropic acoustic models  the neural network trained from a pilot/offset well can be applied to predict fracture geometries or to optimize fracturing design for other wells from the same geological basin in a timely and cost-effective manner  |the workflow is demonstrated by generating neural-network models for two shale reservoirs  the fracture geometry predicted from the anisotropic models is compared with the one predicted from the conventional isotropic simulator  the results show that ignoring shale anisotropy leads to overestimated fracture widths and underestimated fracture containments, lengths, and net-pressures  the neural-network models are run in large parametric studies to demonstrate how the effective propped length and fracture productivity varies with perforation position, injected volume, and pumping rate in the two shale formations  the results provide valuable insights of selecting perforation location and optimizing pumping strategy  |introduction |the combination of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling has made production from shale and tight formations commercially realistic  however, because of the laminated and platy nature intrinsic to shales, the isotropic acoustic model, which computes a single young’s modulus and a single poisson’s ratio from sonic and density logs, cannot fully describe their elastic behavior | 
2016-v57n6a2 	 geomechanics of orthorhombic media |abstract |we investigate the geomechanics of orthorhombic media for modeling fractured shales, using theoretical data, and present simplified equations for computing anisotropic stresses in orthorhombic media that yield accurate estimates (compared to the values computed using the exact equations) of the anisotropic stresses in heavily fractured media when shear-wave splitting (sws) is more than 10%  in terms of mechanical properties, i e , poisson’s ratios and young’s moduli, the simplified equations can be defined using three mechanical properties  we used two theoretical models to create data for fractured shales with two sets of vertical fractures (vti background + fractures)  different fracture densities were considered, which resulted in variable sws values  these data were used to investigate the mechanical behavior of media with orthorhombic symmetry  two possibilities were considered; case 1 is a horizontal well drilled perpendicular to natural fractures or along the minimum horizontal stress, and case 2 is a horizontal well drilled parallel to natural fractures or perpendicular to minimum horizontal stress  the values of poisson’s ratios and young’s moduli decrease with increasing fracture density, although a few moduli values will remain almost unchanged  for all fracture densities, the magnitude of stress anisotropy (<u+03b4>h - <u+03b4>h) can be accurately computed using the simplified orthorhombic model; for higher fracture densities, models converge to the exact values  for case 1, <u+03b4>h can be accurately computed using the simpler vertically transverse isotropic (vti) model, whereas the <u+03b4>h calculation using vti or isotropic models will result in significant errors  |introduction |in unconventional reservoirs, it is important to know the stress variations in different intervals for various applications, such as hydraulic fracturing, wellbore stability etc  in order to understand the variations of maximum and minimum horizontal stresses, engineers use poroelastic hooke’s law that can give an estimate of the horizontal stresses from moduli  moduli are usually computed from sonic log measurements  however, sonic measurements provide the dynamic moduli, which must be corrected to obtain the static moduli (e g , tutuncu, 2010) | 
2016-v57n6a3 	 macroscale young’s moduli of shale based on nanoindentations |abstract |it remains difficult to relate shale nanoscale measurements to core- and block-scale properties because of the heterogeneous structure of shale  one of the main reasons for this difficulty is the heterogeneity of natural nanogranular media, which is scale dependent  in this study, we propose a new conceptual model for the elastic deformation of a shale formation  the conceptual model accounts for the effective stiffness of small-scale constitutive entities at a large scale  we use the proposed model to determine macroscale young’s moduli by analyzing nanoindentations  independent macroscale measurements corroborate our model  |introduction |the petrophysical characterization of a shale formation, which can be considered to be a natural nanogranular composite, remains a challenging problem because of its heterogeneous structure  the heterogeneity exists at different scales, which makes it even more difficult for us to understand the pore space and the solid phases forming the matrix (gupta et al , 2013; sakhaee-pour and bryant, 2015)  |the elastic properties of shale play critical roles in formation stimulation, well-log interpretation, drilling design, and production estimation  determining these properties by conventional methods is time consuming and may even become impractical for shales  a large shale sample usually breaks into pieces during recovery due to the lack of mechanical stability  hence, the notion of finding large-scale (core-scale, block-scale, or log-scale) properties from relevant properties of forming entities, such as organic and clay minerals, has gained attention among researchers (bobko and ulm, 2008; kumar et al , 2012; bennett et al , 2015)  the key assumption is that knowing the elastic properties of the forming entities can enable us to predict the elastic properties of shale at a larger scale | 
2016-xx 	 quantitative mineral analysis of sedimentary formations using ftir spectroscopy |abstract  mineralogy is a key parameter in the description of sedimentary formations, and it influences decisions made in oilfield formation evaluation, drilling, completions, and production  fourier transform infrared (ftir) spectroscopy has become an alternative to commonly accepted x-ray diffraction (xrd) for quantitative mineral analysis  this study introduces two analytical improvements to previously published ftir procedures, provides a direct comparison of ftir and xrd mineral solutions, and demonstrates the higher accuracy of the ftir results  the improvements address two known challenges for ftir—cloudy pellets and the presence of adsorbed water on the potassium bromide (kbr) pellet and in the resulting infrared spectra  historically, most of the pellets that are produced are clear, but many are cloudy, which scatters the infrared light  with a modification to the pellet pressing technique, uniformly clear pellets are generally obtained  the second problem arises because kbr is hygroscopic and water adsorbed to the pellet absorbs infrared light in broad bands located between 3200 and 3600 cm–1, which overlap those of clay and mica minerals and interfere with qualitative and quantitative interpretation of the infrared spectrum  fortunately, a secondary absorbance region of the adsorbed water is not shared with that of the clay and mica hydroxyls, and the improved technique uses this region to effectively mitigate the measurement problem   the accuracy of the enhanced ftir technique for quantitative mineral analysis is validated and compared to that achievable by commercial xrd using independently measured elemental concentrations  in the quality control of mineralogy (qcmin) procedure, major element (si, ca, al, k, na, mg, fe, and s) concentrations are reconstructed from bulk mineralogy and compared with independently measured elemental concentrations on the same samples  the sum of the average absolute differences between reconstructed and measured concentrations of the eight elements is the qcmin score  for an assemblage of 84 oilfield samples, the qcmin score from ftir is 3 2—substantially better than a qcmin score of 10 from analysis of the same samples by multiple, commercial xrd laboratories   as oilfield exploration and production moves to increasingly complex sedimentary environments, accurate mineral analysis is ever more crucial in appraisal, drilling, completion, and production decisions  ftir provides this analysis, with an accuracy that is consistently superior to industry xrd | 
2423081-ms 	 effects of pore pressure and organic contents on the brittle-ductile transition in shale rock using geophysical method |abstract |the economic success of shale gas plays depends expansively on the brittle-ductile behavior of shale rock  the key parameter that separates the unconventional resources from conventional resources is the formation permeability, so all shale reservoirs need to be hydraulically fractured  successful hydraulic fracturing requires targeting the most brittle rocks, therefore it is worthwhile to classify the shale in terms of brittle, less brittle, less ductile, and ductile zones  to identify the brittle-ductile transitional zone in shale reservoir, we have correlated the mineralogy-based brittleness index to elastic parameters estimated from well logs  the petrophysical model of the study area were plotted to break a story between brittle mineral contents, organic matter, brittleness indices and pore pressure to differentiate the brittle, ductile and transitional zones  our results show that change in rock minerals distribution and brittleness index follow the trend in toc, in less brittle to less ductile zone  in addition, we plotted the data in the crossplot of young's modulus and poisson's ratio and <u+03bb><u+03c1>-<u+03bc><u+03c1> lithology templates, noticed that shale with high quartz and high clay contents fall in less ductile to less brittle zone while shale with high quartz and low clay contents fall in less brittle to brittle zone  the overall observations of our study will support the previous research idea by suggesting the zone of brittle-ductile transition to design the hydraulic fracturing  |introduction |for a successful shale gas play in a region, the following characteristics (last but not least) need to be considered before going to the exploitation: (a) organic richness (toc), (b) brittleness, (c) thickness, (d) gas-in-place, (e) permeability, (f) mineralogy, (g) maturation (ro%) and (h) pore pressure (i) pore geometry (zhu et al  2011)  among these characteristics, shale brittleness is more critical to identify the desirable fracturing intervals and propagation for successful shale gas play (wang and gale, 2009)  van dam et al  (2002) also documented in their research that brittleness is an important property that controls the failure process | 
2423206-ms 	 textural and mineralogical control on tensile strength of eagle ford and manco shales samples |abstract |unconventional shale poses many challenges for exploitation due to the complexity in mineralogy, the presence of kerogen, laminations, and the low permeability; thus in most cases, hydraulic fracturing is needed for economic recovery  one of the most important parameters for engineers is the tensile strength of the shale reservoir rocks, which is affected by the amount of ductile vs brittle minerals, the amount of kerogen, the textures of the rock, and the saturation states  in this study we investigate the effect on the tensile strength measured from brazilian tests of the lamination and mineral assemblage, using computed tomographic (ct) imaging and x-ray diffraction (xrd)  |a group of mancos and eagle ford samples from commercial sources were prescreened (to exclude samples with noticeable fractures) and tested for the brazilian tensile strength at different orientation relative to the bedding plane, in addition to ct scan and x ray diffraction; scanning electron microscopy (sem) is performed on a selected number of samples  bulk xrd analysis is performed on pulverized rock subsamples and also on polished rock samples; large scaled lamination analysis is carried out on ct images; sem images are used to evaluate whether fine scale fractures and mineral orientation has any effect on the tensile strength measured at different relative positions  |our results show that the amount of ductile clay minerals is the most important factor; overall the brittle-quartz-and-calcite-rich eagle ford samples have higher average tensile strength (~700psi) whereas the ductile, clay-rich mancos samples have a lower average tensile strength (~400psi)  within each group, the trend of the tensile strength and the relative amount of brittle minerals also exists  the sharply defined laminations of eagle ford shales results in a larger degree of anisotropy of tensile strength than these in mancos shale, and in the eagle ford samples there are more shear failures along the weak lamination planes  the failure along the laminations appears related to sedimentary features and not to mineralogy |

2447633-ms 	 geomechanical tools to bolster social license: quantifying the mechanical effects of faults on induced seismicity potential |introduction  |recent media coverage has highlighted a major shortcoming in the industry of unconventional resource production, inducement of seismic events  seismicity in certain areas of the midcontinent north america has increased drastically in the past few years  this has come to be understood as a result of pore pressure, and stress field perturbation due to water injection  water disposal and hydraulic fracturing practices both introduce quantities of water to the subsurface which may alter the mechanical quasi-equilibrium established through geologic time  such rapid perturbation of established stress fields can in some cases cause earthquakes  because many of these operations are based in historically seismically quiescent regions, even magnitude 3-5 earthquakes may cause significant damage that can no longer be ignored  the public’s perception, and media’s coverage, of this phenomena has produced a significant discussion topic, which impedes the economies of shale 2 0, which will seek to achieve a more efficient development of shale resources  it is clear that operators do not understand the mechanical impact of such injections, as unpredicted seismic events have been induced at an increasing rate and of increasing magnitude  regulators in oklahoma have taken steps to reduce the risk of operators inducing seismic events, however the lack of means to quantify induced seismicity potential has hindered deployment of effective policy  with the advent of induced seismicity, institutionalized trust is compromised once again, and this time during a serious shift in the economies of unconventional production, underpinning not just the importance of the social license to operate, but the effect such public support can have when attempting to deploy the vast infrastructure necessary to realize unconventional petroleum resources at half of the value which they were previously produced  |in order to address these concerns, a workflow is proposed, to combine advanced modeling techniques, with large geologically and geophysically constrained datasets  this workflow is applied to investigate the relationship between complex regional fault systems, and their collective impact on stress fields in a region  the outputs of this modeling workflow can be combined into proxies, and used to investigate areas of the model with stress fields more likely to be perturbed through high-volume injections  plotting these proxies on a map provides a tool that is simple to interpret, and which leverages large amounts of data and advanced modeling  this simple tool can be utilized by geoscientists, regulators, and the general public | 
2447719-ms 	 the role of natural fractures (joints) in the marcellus shale during hydraulic fracture stimulation using full 3d modeling |summary |we use a 3d, fully coupled, fracture and fluid flow simulator to investigate the interactions between hydraulic fractures (hf) and pre-existing joints (j1 & j2), with stresses and joint characteristics based on typical marcellus shale properties  we consider two modeling scenarios in which we vary the orientation of the maximum horizontal stress (shmax) with respect to the orientation of j1  multiple stochastic realizations of the discrete fracture network (dfn) describing these joint sets, and two fluid viscosities end-members, were considered  modeling results show that the fluid pressure perturbations extend to distances along j1 and j2 that are comparable to the microseismic (ms) event cloud, making joint shearing and “wet” events a probable consequence of the stimulation  furthermore, the tendency of the main hf to be captured and offset by j1 and the extent of the offset depends in part on the fluid viscosity, the orientation of j1 with respect to shmax, the length of j1, and the extent to which their height spans the zone of fracturable rock between the upper and lower fracture barriers  comparing model predictions to ms interpretations suggests that the most probable geometric scenario for the pad site requires that shmax and j1 are ~30 degrees apart  |introduction |the interactions between hydraulic fractures and geologic discontinuities, such as natural fractures, faults, and bedding that have been documented in sedimentary basins (e g  the appalachian basin), where unconventional reservoirs are usually exploited, are very relevant to fracture stimulation design to enhance oil/gas recovery (carlson and mercer, 1991)  an efficient fracture stimulation design, one that maximizes hydrocarbon recovery and reduces cost, should consider and possibly take advantage of these interactions, requiring a better understanding of the governing processes and the use of 3d fully-coupled reservoir simulators to effectively capture feedback mechanisms  fracturing fluid can be diverted or “loss” into the discontinuities, which reduced the hydraulically fractured volume, but those preexisting discontinuities could also be stimulated, increasing the permeability pathways | 
2448066-ms 	 fracture properties characterization of shale rocks |abstract |economic recovery from low permeability shale reservoirs depends on inducing new fractures and connecting preexisting fractures to generate a fracture networks through stimulation  the stimulation process often involves shear slip along fractures which enhances permeability  to investigate the impact of shear slip on fracture permeability variations, fractures mechanical properties such as shear strength, friction, normal stiffness and shear stiffness are needed  in this study, we performed laboratory experiments on several shale samples from the barnett, mancos and pierre, to characterize their geomechanical properties  a multistage triaxial testing strategy was applied on shale samples with saw-cut fractures to measure their shear strength and stiffness under multiple confining pressures  in addition, mohr-coulomb and barton's shear strength criteria were used to determine shear strength envelope and friction coefficient  the normal stiffness and shear stiffness of the saw-cut fractures were also estimated through stress and displacement measurements and test results were correlated with mineralogy composition  |introduction |rocks generally exists the form as an anisotropic discontinuum, which always moves, deforms and fails along natural discontinuities such as fractures, joints, beddings and faults, etc  as a result, fractures' properties such as shear strength and stiffness not only affect the reservoir stimulation, but also the wellbore stability and production performance  the fracture properties can be measured in two major experiments: direct shear test and triaxial shear test  direct shear test is widely used to measure the strength and stiffness properties of rock fractures (goodman, 1976; astm d5607-08, 2008), since it is easy to utilize large scale specimens at both laboratory and field site testing  however, the direct shear test has some disadvantages  for example, fractures are sheared without confinements, and the normal stress is limited by relatively low capacity of the shear apparatus, and displacement measurements are usually affected by grout deformation  the triaxial shear test can overcome some of these shortcomings as it can be conducted under confining pressure (jaeger, 1959; lane and heck, 1964; rosso, 1976; li et al , 2012)  in this test, a cylindrical specimen with an inclined fracture is subjected to a given confining pressure, and then the differential stress (<u+03c3>diff = <u+03c3>1- <u+03c3>3) is increased until slip on the weakness plane is initiated  thus, the fractures' deformation properties under confining pressure can be estimated from stress and displacement measurements |

2448745-ms 	 brittleness index - a parameter to embrace or avoid? |summary |“brittleness index” has become a popular parameter in unconventional plays, used in an attempt to describe the behavior of rocks under in-situ hydraulic stimulation  however, with a multitude of different definitions and more critical assessments of the brittleness index (bi) emerging in recent years, the shortcomings in the interpretation of the brittleness index as a fracability parameter are increasingly evident  calculating brittleness from both rock elastic properties and mineralogy has become commonplace due to the almost ubiquitous acquisition of those data in “shale” plays  the temptation is then to directly apply them in reservoir stimulation decisions  however, taking into account many shortcomings in the computation and physical interpretation of the brittleness index, questions arise about the meaning of rock brittleness when defined as a combination of different rock properties  in this paper we look into three different brittleness index definitions based on dynamic elastic moduli and mineral composition, and critically appraise their similarities, and potential for application in hydraulic fracture programs  |introduction |effective exploitation of tight oil and gas shale resources is possible due to a combination of horizontal drilling, and hydraulic fracturing with slick water  to enhance flow from these extremely low permeability reservoirs, pressurized water is pumped into a borehole initiating fractures that propagate away from the borehole into the reservoir  the right combination of treatment conditions, rock properties, and stress regime allows not only the propagation of new complex fractures that enhance permeability, but also results in cross-cutting and activation of pre-existing fractures  furthermore increased pore pressure in the reservoir induces slippage on pre-existing faults  as rock properties are an important part of this mix, a great amount of research has been focused on searching for the association between effective hydraulic fracturing and brittleness of rocks  |the concept of brittleness evolved as an idea of a rock's ability to fail in a brittle manner, i e  the point at which elastic strain that dominates a rocks deformation up to the point its strength is exceeded and the rock fractures (altindag, 2003)  brittle failure was therefore opposed to ductile failure, when inelastic strain prevails over elastic strain, causing rocks to deform irreversibly and ultimately fail  in an attempt to classify rocks based on their ability to undergo brittle failure, or conversely, showing varied degree of ductility, a brittleness index (bi) can be defined  today, three main groups of brittleness definitions exist, referring to different concepts of rock properties or behavior  the first group focuses on the static mechanical properties of rocks, by comparing different rock strength (compressive, tensile, residual, fracture toughness) and strain relations  in this paper we will not discuss these definitions, but they are reviewed elsewhere (hu et al , 2015a, yang et al , 2013, zhang et al , 2016))  the second group focuses on different aspects of rock composition, comparing weight or volume fraction of minerals that are supposed to favor brittle failure, to those that are supposed to be less favorable to brittle failure  the main concept behind mineralogy based brittleness is to highlight the right combination of mineralogy that would represent zones that require relatively low pumping pressures in order to overcome a fracture gradient and ensure that the propagated fractures remain open  brittleness indices based on mineralogy and proposed by different authors are not consistent, attributing varied importance to different rock components  for instant jarvie et al  (2007) introduced an index that would facilitate to identify the most quartzose and best producing intervals in the barnett shale, and therefore quartz is their most desired component as opposed to calcite and clays  wang and gale (2009) introduced a second desired parameter, dolomite, as another brittle component  the mineralogy concept of classifying rocks is very convenient to apply, as it only requires knowledge of rock's composition, accessible from logs or cuttings  even more convenient in producing continuous brittleness information is an idea of using elastic parameters calculated from pand s-wave sonic logs or seismic survey, forming a basis of the third group of brittleness definitions  rocks undergo elastic deformation when subject to sonic waves, but despite that, little information about inelastic deformations is generated in this manner  however with the right calibrations to static moduli, one can successfully calculate such parameters as young's modulus or poisson's ratio at the depth of interest  the application of elastic moduli in describing rock's brittleness is still regarded as lacking a physical meaning because they describe different rock characteristics, i e  deformation vs failure (see bai, 2016 and references therein)  moreover, there is an objection to treating brittleness as a rock property, but rather a rock's behavior, dependent on the stress regime in the reservoir (hu et al , 2015a), variability in the stress gradient, and an extent of time-dependent rock deformation and stress relaxation (sone and zoback, 2014)  the purpose of this paper is therefore to compare popular brittleness index definitions and reconcile any discrepancies between different approaches for the estimation of rocks brittleness | 
2449239-ms 	 discrete fracture network generation using microseismic data from a single monitoring well |abstract |the geometry of fractures, both natural and hydraulically induced, is commonly represented by a discrete fracture network (dfn) in reservoir simulations  although microseismic data underestimate the total fracture creation and deformation accompany hydraulic-fracturing, it is considered the best means of representing a dfn used as the initial input framework for modeling hydraulic-fracture stimulations  extracting a dfn from microseismic data requires both the source location and the corresponding fracture orientations determined from moment tensor inversion (mti)  however, although monitoring from a single array may be the most common geometry used for downhole microseismic, inverting for the full moment tensor is not generally applicable due to the ill-posed geometry  we therefore use a new multi-event mti approach applicable to single monitoring well geometry  this study presents a workflow to generate the dfn using a probabilistic approach applying the orientation constraints from the fault plane solutions estimated from the single-well microseismic data using a multi-event moment tensor inversion (me-mti) method  firstly, the events are grouped with similar source mechanisms from the p/sh and p/sv amplitude ratio patterns and the me-mti algorithm is applied to each event group to get the common moment tensor  secondly, a bi-axial potency decomposition is applied to the common moment tensors to estimate the fault plane solutions  finally, the dfn is extracted using a modified hough transform algorithm which searches for the most probable planar patterns from the event locations and the fault plane orientation distributions  we use a dual monitoring well data set, acquired in cardium sand formation in west alberta, canada, to demonstrate the feasibility of the workflow  the two-well monitor data provides a bench mark result by extracting the dfn from the population of individual-event moment tensor solutions results  using the workflow outlined above, we then compare the single-well dfn results with the benchmark  the results show that, 1) the multi-event moment tensor inversion from a single monitoring well provides results comparable with the dual-well derived population of individual-event solutions, with reduced the uncertainty, and 2) the dfn extracted from the single monitoring well sub-set data is comparable with the results from the dual-well data set  |introduction |with the development of microseismic monitoring to directly measure hydraulic fracture geometry, it has become evident that a complex fracture network is often activated or created instead of a single bi-wing planar fracture (cipolla, et al  2008, maxwell, et al  2002) due to the heterogeneity of the formation and the interaction of the existing natural fractures with the hydraulically induced fractures (cooke and underwood 2001)  accordingly, the prediction of reservoir performance requires models with more complex fracture geometries  as such, discrete fracture networks (dfn) is designed to represent the complex fracture geometries and flow paths created and affected by hydraulic fracturing and widely used as a framework for reservoir simulation (cipolla, et al  2010, xu, et al  2009, williams, et al  2013, williams, et al  2010)  a dfn is a collection of connected or disconnected fracture patches with certain orientation and density distribution representing the natural fractures and/or hydraulically induced fractures |

(2) what is the increase in permeability, production rate and cumulative production performance that can be expected from the refracturing job? (3) is it better to refracture the well or to drill an infill well? |this paper addresses those three questions by considering multi-porosities known to exist in shale reservoirs  this includes inorganic matrix porosity (<u+03d5>m), natural fractures (microfractures and slot porosity, <u+03d5>2), organic porosity (<u+03d5>org) and adsorbed porosity (<u+03d5>ads_c)  in addition, hydraulic fracturing generates porosity around the wellbore (<u+03d5>hf)  these porosities form a quintuple porosity system that is further fed by gas dissolved in solid kerogen  |the porosities mentioned above are included in a material balance that is combined with fracture closure for generating a model that calculates the optimum time for refracturing  production rates and ultimate recoveries from this model and observations of actual refracturing jobs are compared with results from infill drilling  by considering the same reservoir properties and exactly the same hydrocarbons in place the conclusion is reached that refracturing has the potential to be more cost effective as compared with infill drilling  |the novelty of the approach is the development of an easy to use production performance method that can be reproduced readily in a spread sheet for calculating optimum re-fracturing time, production rates, and cumulative recovery; and for making quick comparisons of the benefits of refracturing vs  infill drilling in shale reservoirs  results of the easy to use material balance are corroborated with a state of the art commercial reservoir simulator |

26446-ms 	 a critical investigation of optimization of steam-assisted gravity drainage sagd in naturally-fractured heavy oil carbonate reservoirs under uncertainty |abstract   advancing technology in thermal recovery and declining conventional oil resources are leading to the increased application of thermal heavy oil recovery processes  heavy oil resources in carbonate rock are estimated at 1 6 trillion bbl, one-third of which is in the middle east, making it a crucial part of the global energy supply  a thorough understanding of reservoir properties (including but not limited to natural fracture systems, fluid saturation, permeability and rock matrix) is fundamental to optimizing recoveries with existing uncertainties, where efficient optimization through simulation can lead to the application of optimum operational decision parameters combined with improved understanding of the significance of such uncertainty parameters    steam-assisted gravity drainage (sagd) provides many advantages compared to conventional surface mining extraction techniques and alternate thermal recovery methods  these advantages include significantly greater per-well production rates, greater reservoir recoveries, reduced water treating costs, and dramatic reductions in steam-oil ratios (sors)  however, carbonate reservoirs exhibit varying properties in terms of porosity, permeability, and flow mechanisms  many other engineering considerations exist for sagd, including recovery rate, thermal efficiency, capability and economics of drilling horizontal well pairs, steam quality, steam injection rate, steam pressure, sand production, reservoir pressure maintenance, and water intrusion  in this study, such parameters are simulated and optimized by coupling a numerical reservoir simulator with commercial optimization software featuring exploratory, gradient, and direct methods  a dual permeability approach to modeling naturally fractured reservoirs is used    the results are discussed and the significance of both uncertainty and decision parameters is outlined in addition to the added benefits of optimized solutions using various optimization techniques  the results and observations show significant improvement using the optimum combination of decision parameters, such as steam injection rate, pressure, and temperature, to improve recoveries with a good understanding of the significance of uncertainty parameters, including rock and formation properties, in addition to overburden conditions that can affect the sagd process  reservoir management requires effective risk management where a sound understanding of uncertainties is fundamental to success  this study outlines all of these parameters in a comparative way, which can be useful in future industry applications    modeling fractures in carbonates in heavy oil reservoirs is not an easy task because of the modeling and computational difficulties  it is important to have solid thorough examples, including building the model, setting up the optimization workflow of uncertainty, and outlining the results in a comparative manner to enhance understanding for more efficient reservoir management during sagd processes | 
26449-ms 	 large deformation finite element analysis of spudcan penetration in sand overlying clay profile |abstract   sand overlying clay soil profile is typically associated with punch-through risk during preloading  computation of load-penetration response is usually performed in accordance with methods detailed in sname (2008) and iso (2012)  these methods are based on "wished-in-place" simplification that neglects the changes in soil stratigraphy during spudcan penetration  it has been demonstrated in both physical modelling experiments and large deformation finite element analysis (ldfe) that a sand plug is extruded as the spudcan penetrates through the upper sand layer  the presence of this sand plug beneath an advancing spudcan significantly alters the load-penetration response  this paper presents a case study on the application of ldfe analysis as recourse to compute the load-penetration response of a spudcan in sand overlying clay profile    the ldfe analysis is performed using the coupled eulerian-lagrangian functionality in abaqus  in an eulerian analysis, the spatial position of the nodes is fixed and materials are allowed to flow from one element to another element  owing to the large deformation characteristic of the spudcan penetration problem, the eulerian approach is an attractive solution strategy  in order to simulate the phenomena of progressive strength degradation with increasing accumulation of plastic deformation in the clay layers, a modified tresca material model with strain-softening is implemented via a user-defined subroutine  the installation of the spudcan is modelled as a continuous spudcan penetration problem ("pushed-in-place") with the spudcan initially positioned at the mudline and progressively pushed downward to the final penetration    when compared against the spudcan penetration curves based on conventional methods, the numerically simulated load-penetration response is different in three important aspects  firstly, the ldfe model indicates that rapid leg penetration will occur over a distance of approximately 8m as compared to 20m computed based on conventional methods  secondly, the ldfe model shows a modest 10% reduction in bearing capacity over the depths at which rapid leg penetration is expected to occur while calculations based on conventional methods indicates a 45% reduction  lastly, the ldfe model predicted a final penetration depth that is significantly shallower than that computed using conventional methods    with a ldfe model, it is not necessary to prescribe the failure mechanisms a-priori  the governing failure mechanism, which is a manifestation of the natural tendency for failure planes to develop along the weakest admissible path, is an output from the simulation  in contrast, a conventional spudcan penetration analysis is performed based on a "wished-in-place" approach without taking into account of the occurrence and effect of the composite footing formed by the spudcan and the sand plug  in the conventional approach, the sand layer is assumed to diminish as the spudcan penetrates beyond the clay-sand interface | 
26652-ms 	 geomechanical forward modelling to optimise well trajectories and avoid pre-existing fractures in a malay basin producing field, offshore malaysia  |abstract   objectives/scope: when drilling a micro fractured formation, the fluid differential pressure for wellbore support can be lost and the unsupported formation may fail, causing losses, pack-off and instability  this may be minimized or resolved if the zones of pre-existing fractures are known and the trajectory is optimized to avoid them    in the malay basin, one structure of interest has undergone several periods of stress and faulting, at times, strike-slip in nature  wrench faults in the area are causing compression and extension  this strain causes micro fractures and voids to be generated  the formation has a secondary porosity but seismic resolution does not allow the pre-existing fractures to be seen  by using a technique known as geomechanical forward modelling (gfm), it is possible to determine natural fracture distribution and avoid these zones, thereby decreasing the risk of encountering instability caused by secondary porosity    the problems of borehole instability encountered in the area are demonstrated in wells, a1, a2 and a3  the most problematic well was a3  it had many incidents of pack off causing side tracks  in each case, the hole condition was better on side-tracks made higher up the well  it was considered that there is a 3 dimensional extent to the presence of micro fractures  the fracture intensity may have a vertical as well as areal extent  sometimes wells crossing above or below a zone are not as difficult as through it    on wells that experienced pack off, cavings at the shaker had an abundance of linear breaks oblique to shale bedding surfaces and suggests the probability of pre-existing fractures  pre-existing fractures were also seen on image logs    during planning for an appraisal well, zones with lower plastic shear strain were identified to the north and west of the planned well trajectory by applying gfm  the plastic shear strain profile along the planned trajectory suggested that the target depth will intersect a potential fractured zone  by moving the surface location by only 500 meters, the chances of encountering pre-existing fractures was significantly diminished    by applying geomechanical forward modelling, (gfm), it is possible to determine distribution and possible locations of secondary fractures, too small to be determined from seismic  this allows for the selection of well trajectories to avoid these naturally fractured zones, thereby decreasing the risk of encountering instability from secondary porosity (pre-existing shear fractures) |

i-16-417 	 alternative numerical pile foundation models for integrated analyses of monopile-based offshore wind turbines |abstract  lowering the cost for offshore wind energy remains a major challenge  increasing the accuracy of analysis tools used in the design and optimization process can strengthen the reliability and reduce conservatism, thereby leading to a more cost-efficient design  although considerable development has been made on representing the interaction between wind, waves and structural aspects in integrated analyses of offshore wind turbines, the modelling of the foundation remains unrefined  the assumptions and shortcomings of the existing models are identified, and alternatives for a better representation of the foundation response are presented and discussed   introduction  offshore wind energy plays a central role in sustainability-focused international policies and shows one of the fastest growth rates of all renewable energy sources (e&y, 2015)  a higher energy production due to stronger and more frequent winds at the sea and fewer problems with noise production and visual impact are the main advantages over onshore wind turbines  however, the costs for offshore wind energy are around 80% higher compared to onshore wind (fraunhofer, 2013) and are one of the highest among renewable energy sources  lowering costs for offshore wind energy will be crucial for its further success (the crown estate, 2012)  up to date, costs for offshore wind energy were mainly reduced by improved supply chain integration and larger capacity turbines (ore catapult, 2015)  a future key area for lowering costs is more cost-efficient designs for offshore wind turbines (owts)  in particular, the support structure has high potential for cost reduction, since it contributes up to 20% of total capital costs (ewea, 2015) |

i-16-534 	 a new method for characterizing particle crushing of cobalt crust based on fractal theory |abstract  fractal dimension is one of the physical parameters that can reflect ore and rock fragmentation degrees  by summarizing the inherent law of particle breakage, this paper proposed a new method for characterizing the particle crushing of cobalt crust  linear slope and correlation coefficient for particle size distribution in log-log coordinate are chosen as the key parameters  to verify the applicability of the method, a large amount of laboratory test were conducted  in the tests, cutting depth, rotating frequency, traveling speed were controlled  test result show that the granularity of crushed cobalt-rich crust has clear fractal property, a quite good linear fitting can be obtained by the proposed model  thereafter, the relations among fractal dimension and cutting depth, rotating frequency, traveling speed were analyzed  the outcome of this paper may have significant meaning in application    introduction|cobalt crust grows on smooth seamount slope from 500 to 3000 meters depth (yamazaki and sharma, 2000), is multi-metal ore that is rich in cobalt, nickel, silver, copper, gold, platinum, and rare-earth element  now the cobalt crust is an emphasis of researching on deep sea mineral resources both in the home and foreign (manheim, 1986; glasby, 2003)  because of the complicated environment of deep-sea mining, cobalt crust cut and broken should be lifted to the supporting ship by the collection and lift system (chung, 1994; liang et al , 2002)  undersized granularity will pollute seabed environment seriously, yet oversized one will block the collector and lift system, so the granularity should be controlled strictly in a required range  the collective rate, mullock interfusion rate, energy consumption and the rule of granularity distribution are not only related to the structural parameters of spiral mining head, but also related to the different work parameters (penetration depth, walking speed, cutting frequency) in different tiny topography of deep sea bed  so it is necessary to develop an appropriate model of crushing cobalt crust with mining head and to investigate the influence of cutting depth on crushing process | 
i-16-569 	 describing six-degree-of-freedom response of foundations supporting owec jacket structures |abstract  a great potential for optimization of pile and bucket-based multi-footed foundations is the adequate incorporation of the non-linear foundation response in the overall structural model of the offshore wind energy converter (owec)  currently, this soil-structure interaction problem is treated by a costly and time-consuming iterative procedure between the geotechnical and the structural model  the paper presents a more sophisticated approach which makes the iterative procedure dispensable  basic idea is to pre-define foundation responses for arbitrary loading conditions by less than twenty load-controlled numerical simulations  the foundation responses are implemented as non-linear macro-elements in the structural model enabling the incorporation of the soil-structure interaction in the equilibrium iteration of the structural model  the basic principle of the proposed approach can be used for all design purposes, i e  ultimate limit state (uls), serviceability limit state (sls) and fatigue limit state (fls) design   introduction  economical pressure forces the installation of larger offshore wind energy converters (owec) located in deeper waters in a more cost effective manner  due to the limitations of the currently dominating monopile foundations with regard to the economically feasible water depths, pile and bucket-based multi-foundations will probably become of increasing importance in the future offshore wind industry  a great potential for optimization of these structures is the adequate incorporation of the non-linear foundation response in the overall owec models  this regards likewise the consideration of the foundation response for the ultimate limit state (uls), the serviceability limit state (sls) and the fatigue limit state (fls) design    for pile-based multi-foundations (cf  fig  1, left) the soil-structure interaction may be treated by the integration of spring-bedded beam models, i e  the p-y method for the lateral and moment response and the t-z method for the axial response  however, interaction effects between the lateral and vertical response are nevertheless disregarded by this approach  anyhow, the soil-structure interaction problem becomes more serious for bucket-based multi-foundations (cf  fig  1, right) due to the missing of analytical spring approaches for the determination of the bucket behaviour  due to the complex interaction mechanism between the single bucket components (lid, tip and skirt) the authors assume that such simplified approaches with sufficient accuracy will be hardly reached in near future even for buckets installed in homogenous soil conditions (cf  achmus et al  2013) | 
i-16-594 	 investigation of contribution of high modulus columns on liquefaction mitigation based on effective stress approach by 3d finite difference method |abstract  high modulus columns have become general engineering practice in terms of liquefaction mitigation although their effectiveness has not been validated thoroughly by both case and numerical analyses  besides, only total stress analyses that do not take excess pore water pressure into account widely form numerical studies  thus, in this study, role of high modulus columns as a precaution are investigated parametrically with intensive numerical analyses scheme adopting effective stress approach  it is indicated that high modulus columns can prevent liquefaction by decreasing pore pressure ratio  their effectiveness increases with decrease of stiffness   introduction  liquefaction is one of the extraordinary phenomena that could indicate the damage or effect caused by dynamic motion  the reason why liquefaction is an important issue is its strength oriented relationship with soil deposit  during liquefaction, especially in saturated loose granular soils, shear strength and stiffness are significantly reduced resulting in loss of selfstability and therefore, soil acts like fluid (terzaghi & peck, 1948)  in other words, excess pore water pressure induced by a dynamic motion diminish shear strength of soil by means of dramatically reduced effective stress under undrained conditions    in order to prevent liquefaction hazard, there exists certain amount of mitigation strategies  among them, adalier (2003) was able to indicate that stone columns as high modulus columns are beneficial as a mitigation strategy in non-plastic silty sands according to his findings by means of centrifuge tests  based on composite shear behavior of improved soil by means of high modulus columns, ozsoy & durgunoglu (2003) was able to relate effectiveness of high modulus columns as liquefaction mitigator with ratio of shear modulus of jet grout columns to soil deposit, theoretically  apart from mentioned theoretical and experimental point of view, contribution of high modulus columns as a remediation against liquefaction were also verified by few numerical analyses  while some of analyses were performed by using “total stress approach”, few of them were based on “effective stress approach” related with pore pressure ratio (almani et al , 2013)  based on total stress approach combining with probabilistic approach, unutmaz (2012) proposed that effectiveness of high modulus columns are directly related with by decreasing column spacing and by increasing column modulus  in terms of effective stress approach, almani et al  (2013) showed that liquefaction induced settlements can be reduced with the help of high modulus columns by controlling development of excess pore pressures | 
i-16-599 	 a new study on the behavior of pile groups using settlement based design approach |abstract  in this study, effects of pile length and number of piles on settlement behaviour of pile groups are investigated  it is shown that the settlement of a pile group becomes independent from the number of piles beyond a certain point  effect of pile length on settlement behaviour of the example foundation is also investigated  it is indicated that the settlement behaviour is becoming more effective in case the pile is longer  besides, a relationship for group efficiency coefficient is suggested for estimating stiffness of a pile group using single pile stiffness by considering the interaction among piles and non-linear behaviour   introduction  settlement behaviour of a pile group highly depends on the number of piles and pile length  in general, settlements are reduced by inclusion of piles (randolph, 1994)  however, interaction among piles cause a reduction in the stiffness of pile groups (fleming et al , 2009)  stiffness reduction in a pile group due to the closely spaced piles is known as group effect  beneficial effects of piles vanish beyond a certain number of piles due to the group effect (poulos, 2001)  one of the aims of this study is to show how the number of piles affects settlement behaviour of pile groups  this aim is achieved by introducing an example foundation  several analyses are done for this purpose and variation of settlement with the number of piles is shown    effects of pile length were investigated by keeping the total quantity of piles constant  second aim of the study is to reach the most effective solution by keeping the total cost of the construction to be constant which may be regarded as optimization  the first stage in the analysis was to decide the number of piles and pile length using capacity based design approach  after determining the pile length and number of piles for the first analysis stage, total quantity of pile by meter (<u+03a3> nl) was kept constant by changing both the number of piles and pile length  the reason of using different number of piles for the different pile length is to reach the most economical design with satisfactory foundation behaviour  optimum design may be obtained by investigating the settlement behaviour without changing the cost of the construction  several analyses need to be done to capture the variation of settlements with varying pile length  finite element analysis was used for investigation of the effect of pile length  eight different pile layouts and six different pile length were used in order to capture the variation | 
i-16-642 	 mpm modelling of seepage flow through embankments |abstract  an accurate knowledge of seepage flows through embankments is necessary for the stability analysis and drainage computation  in this paper, a particle-based mpm model with two sets of material points is used to study the phenomenon  before simulating the seepage flow through an embankment, the proposed numerical model is first applied to a flow through porous dam problem as model validation  subsequently, the numerical method is employed to simulate the seepage flow through an embankment with different permeability  taking the analytical solution under the dupuit’s approximation as the reference, the mpm model gives good predictions of the shape of the seepage water table   introduction  the seepage through embankment is not only important for minimizing the water loss, but also critical to ensuring the safety of the embankments  when the embankment is wide and the seepage flow discharge is small, dupuit derived that the water table roughly follows a parabolic shape (keady 1990)   recently, the particle-based material point method (mpm) has drawn more and more attentions due to the capability of modelling large deformations  the mpm can be categorized as a more general class of particle-in-cell methods  the method was developed by harlow in the 1950s for applications in fluid mechanics (mackenzie-helnwein et al  2010)  however, not until brackbill et al  (1988) addressed the energy dissipation problem, the mpm implementation was developed at a quite moderate pace  later the mpm was applied to solid mechanics (sulsky et al  1995) and dry granular materials (wieckowski 1998; wieckowski et al  1999; wieckowski 2003)  later on, this method was extended to handle saturated soils (jassim et al  2013) with a numerical approach following the so called v-w formulation (zienkiewicz et al  1999)  this formulation, which uses the velocity of both solid and liquid constituents as the primary unknowns, was applied to several small and large deformation problems and is able to capture the physical response of saturated soil under dynamic loading  however, only one set of material points was used for the solid and liquid mixture; therefore groundwater flow and the transition between free water and ground water could not be captured, as well as fluid-like behavior of the soil | 
jfes-2016-k 	 advanced electrofacies modelling and permeability prediction: a case study incorporating multi-resolution core, nmr and image log textural information into a carbonate facies study |abstract |this study covers a methodology applied by pdvsa-intevep in collaboration with paradigm geophysical to evaluate a carbonate gas and condensate reservoir, located offshore in west venezuela  the main goal of this study is to effectively account for the high heterogeneity of the rock fabric and associated high variability in permeability encounter on the reservoir, despite of showing porosity values uniformly distributed  |this carbonate reservoir is clearly subdivided in two different sections: a lower section, comprise of mostly rudstone and floatstone, preserving micro-porosities in some bioclasts and carbonate mud, defining a unimodal pore distribution and size, with a small pore throat radius  the upper section presents primarily coarse-grained limestones(rudstone) preserving primary and secondary porosities, causing a variable distribution of pores and a heterogeneous pore throat radius associated with the particle micro-fracturing contribution (criollo and marin, 2015)  |for this study, a reference well with a comprehensive dataset was selected, that included core data (sedimentological facies, porosity and permeability), micro-resistivity images and nmr data  the images were used to quantify with high resolution the rock fabric changes seen on the formation  similarly, the whole nmr t2 distribution was used to account for changes in the pore system  this information was then combined with standard petrophysical logs and core facies using the multi resolution graph-based clustering method, to produce detailed electrofacies models, focusing on honouring the rock fabric and pore distribution in the reservoir  |these detailed electrofacies models constructed were then calibrated with core data, allowing to predict permeabilities on sections of the well not covered by the original core, as well as on neighbouring wells, where no core data was available | 
jfes-2016-p 	 understanding lwd quadrupole shear in anisotropic environments |abstract |quadrupole shear is now a ubiquitous measurement from logging while drilling (lwd) acoustic tools and offers a robust and reliable method of delivering formation shear information in slow formations  the general increase in the use of lwd measurements worldwide has meant that lwd acoustics measurements are being made in a greater variety of hole sizes, borehole conditions and formation types than ever before  these include a variety of anisotropic formations such as those encountered in unconventional operations  where anisotropy is present then its correct characterization can be critically important for a variety of applications including seismic processing, geomechanics and wellbore stability, completions design and production management  |the non-uniquely directional nature of the quadrupole mode means that it is not yet possible to reliably extract the fast and slow shear anisotropy information from quadrupole data  dipole tools are commonly used as solutions when this information is needed  dipole measurements are currently only routinely available on wireline devices due to the large coupling of the dipole mode with the collar mode  unipole devices are also used in certain situations  however in many cases quadrupole and/or monopole may be the only shear measurement methods used on a particular well  this brings up the question – what does the quadrupole actually measure in anisotropic formations and how is the data sensitive to such an environment? |this paper explores the effect of anisotropy on the quadrupole mode, its azimuthal sensitivity, what it measures and its limitations in anisotropic formations  the effects of anisotropy on the quadrupole dispersions are discussed along with ways to determine the presence of anisotropy based upon the results of the quadrupole inversion processing  numerical modeling in anisotropic formations coupled with data examples are presented, including dispersion plots, that demonstrate these effects and explain the techniques used | 
p-16-155 	 discrete element numerical analysis on keying characteristics of suction embedded plate anchor |abstract |suction embedded plate anchors (sepla) are used increasingly in deep water  the keying process of sepla is investigated by using discrete element method  the numerical model is validated by the centrifuge model test  the results show there is a strong dependence on loss in embedment with loading eccentricity (e/b), at e/b=1 0 the loss in embedment is almost negligible, whereas at a small e/b the loss of embedment is large; the horizontal displacement of the anchor is far less than its vertical displacement  the loading velocity of keying process has impacts on embedment loss  |introduction |the research effort, concerning anchoring systems suitable for deep water environments, has been mainly focusing on three sorts of anchors: suction embedded plate anchors (sepla), vertical loaded anchors (vla) and suction caissons  the typical configuration of sepla is shown in fig  1  the common feature of sepla system is the utilization of a suction caisson, called follower', to embed an initially vertical plate anchor, typically inserted in a vertical slot at the follower base  when the system has reached the designed penetration depth, the plate anchor mooring line is disengaged from the follower, leaving the follower free to be retrieved and reused for the next installation  at this point, the plate anchor is embedded vertically in the seabed and mooring line attached to the embedded plate anchor is tensioned, causing the plate anchor to rotate or key' to the designed orientation that is perpendicular to the direction of mooring line  the concept of sepla (dove et al , 1998), including installation and keying stages, is shown schematically in fig  2 | 
p-16-170 	 finite element analyses of soil squeezing and its application to offshore foundations in multi-layer stratigraphies |abstract |for typical soft over strong soil stratigraphies such as soft clay overlying relatively stronger sand layer, the squeezing solution developed by meyerhof and chaplin (1953) is generally recommended in industry guidelines  the solution was developed primarily for flat circular foundation resting in clay underlain by an infinitely stiff rigid layer  its application to offshore  jackup  foundations  operating  in  multi-layer stratigraphies needs to be examined from two aspects  firstly, to improve positioning and extraction jackup foundations are typically conical in shape and secondly, soil is of finite stiffness  to investigate the squeezing mechanism in more detail an extensive centrifuge testing program has been conducted utilising the uwa drum centrifuge in clay with interbedded sand  high-resolution digital images are captured in flight and analysed using the piv (particle image velocimetry) technique providing insight into the soil failure mechanisms  the centrifuge tests indicated that the bearing resistance in the top clay layer is not independent of the underlying sand and clay layers as assumed in the squeezing theory and also observed consistently in field cpt tests  it was consistently shown that the resistance of the top clay layer strongly correlates with the peak bearing capacity (qpeak) in the underlying sand layer  complementary large deformation finite element (ldfe) analyses are conducted in soft clay overlying a rigid stratum improving on the squeezing factors adopted in meyerhof's theory  the ldfe analyses revealed that the conical tip of spudcan foundation precludes the generation of higher resistance near the rigid base predicted by the squeezing theory  the performance of the squeezing approach shows poor performance when compared with carefully controlled centrifuge experiments  a new approach is suggested in which the bearing capacity in the top clay layer can be adequately predicted by successfully overcoming the limitations of the squeezing theory |
