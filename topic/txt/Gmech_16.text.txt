quite possibly next decade |stephen rassenfoss, jpt emerging technology senior editor |the biggest unconventional oil producers have revolutionized global oil markets and driven down prices  still on the list of things to do: consistently turn in strong profits  |by the next decade, that is likely to change according to a report by wood mackenzie, which predicts margins will grow for the biggest, most efficient independents around 2020  |the actual prediction is “the five leading tight-oil specialists will start to deliver significant positive free cash flow in three years’ time, based on our usd 66/bbl brent oil price assumption for 2020 ” |which would mean that five companies whose business depends on producing liquids and gas from ultratight formations—continental, devon, eog, newfield, and pioneer—would begin generating considerably more cash than they are spending to produce far more barrels of oil per day than they are now  |“they will be transitioning out of the capital-intensive phase and moving into the harvest phase” as these enormous, long-term developments reach critical mass, said benjamin shattuck, principal upstream analyst for wood mackenzie, who was part of the team that produced the recent report: when will tight oil make money? |three alternative paths to maximizing unconventional resources |stephen whitfield, senior staff writer |as pioneering shale gas plays and tight oil formations mature and decline in production, operators are trying to find emerging formations and resources to replace them, enabling continued growth in us production  while the industry will continue identifying new domestic unconventional shale and tight sand resources, an expert said that the methods of discovery may differ from traditional approaches  |at the 2017 unconventional resources technology conference, vello kuuskraa discussed the alternative pathways companies may take to discover unconventional resources while maximizing existing plays in the near future  kuuskraa is president of advanced resources international  |kuuskraa’s presentation focused on three such pathways  he defined the first, “looking in your own backyard,” as the search for additional productive horizons in existing basins, either above or below already developed target formations  an example of such a strategy is the meramec formation, located approximately 1,000 ft above the cana-woodford shale in the northern portion of the anadarko basin  |a typical well is hard to define |stephen rassenfoss, jpt emerging technology senior editor |a type curve is a quick way to answer a critical question—what does a typical well produce over time in a given place? |on the plus side this simple calculation can be done using only basic math skills  “the conventional approach is to determine the arithmetic average of production during a given month from different wells in a reservoir of interest to create a type well,” according to spe 178525  |on the downside, the next sentence is: “this method is deeply flawed ” |the flaws include “different results by different evaluators” that are “overestimates or underestimates (usually overestimates” of future production, according to the paper, whose authors include john lee, a professor at texas a&m university who is well known for his work on reservoir production analysis  |the negatives have become all the more pronounced by the rise of unconventional oil and gas developments, where the output varies, and is unpredictable from well to well, with decline curves that do not fit conventional norms  |“the problems are simply different (and usually harder to solve) in unconventionals,” lee said  |validating the smooth success of heal system |trent jacobs, jpt digital editor |it has apparently taken one emerging technology to help validate another  |heal systems is a joint-venture with schlumberger which manufactures a downhole flow-regulating device by the same name  the innovation promises to remedy one of the unconventional sector’s most common problems: slug flow  |pipefractionalflow is a spinoff startup from the university of texas at austin that is using new theories and equations to make modeling complex multiphase more affordable  |together, the two technology developers completed a simulation and history matching study on four horizontal wells in the us and canada that shed light on how the heal system works  the research is detailed in an spe paper published at the unconventional resources technology conference (urtec 2670789)  |study provides guidelines for community input in unconventional development |stephen whitfield, senior staff writer |a lack of community input can have a destructive impact on new unconventional energy projects, particularly in environmentally sensitive areas  however, a recent study conducted by texas a&m university and the houston advanced research center (harc) showed that while negative community opinion can be difficult for owners and operators to overcome, engaging in a dialogue with communities pre-development could have significant economic, social, and environmental benefits and should be a factor in any evaluation of a new project  |speaking on the second day of the unconventional resources technology conference, clark adams, a professor emeritus in the wildlife and fisheries sciences department at texas a&m, outlined some of the steps companies could take to address community anxieties over new energy development  these steps were explained in a paper (urtec 2664652) written by marian higgins, david burnett, urs kreuter, and richard haut |

181459-pa 	 the vector approach to safety factors for tubular design |summary |traditionally, the collapse safety factor (sf) is the ratio of tubular-collapse resistance to collapse load  the collapse resistance is usually calculated by use of formulas suggested by api tr 5c3 (2008) or iso/tr 10400 (2007)  if the collapse load is very small, whereas the tension stress and/or internal pressure are high, the collapse sf could be very large, which is unrealistic because the load point is close to the collapse envelope  this paper presents a vector approach for the collapse-sf calculation to overcome this problem  moreover, the application of this vector approach can be properly extended to the calculation of international organization for standardization (iso) connector sf for arbitrary load combinations  |the new sf is named the vector sf  it is the multiplier that would scale the load-point vector to reach the strength envelope in stress space  it must meet the following requirement: when all the tubular loads (axial force, internal pressure, and external pressure) are scaled by this sf, the load point must fall exactly on the failure envelope  therefore, for american petroleum institute (api) collapse, the new sf must simultaneously satisfy the api tr 5c3 (2008) collapse formulas and the through-load-point radial-line equation  ridders’ method (ridders 1979) is used to solve the sf for a specific load case  the algorithm has been implemented in a casing-design computer program (landmark 2017) and integrated with commercial software  this vector approach has been applied to both pipe body and connectors  |example cases are used to study the effect of the vector approach on the collapse-sf values  the collapse-sf value is observed to become much smaller when the effective axial stress (actual axial stress plus internal pressure) is very high, which is expected because of the much-smaller vector collapse resistance (at the cross point of the radial line with the collapse curve)  when the effective axial stress is not positive, the collapse sf slightly changes  a north sea high-pressure/high-temperature well is also presented  the results indicate that the vector collapse sf is more realistic  in particular, it is most conservative in load cases with high effective axial stresses  |in summary, it is shown that the vector approach to calculate the sf is equivalent to the current method of comparing the von mises equivalent stress with the material yield strength (ys)  the vector sf has critical safety implications for load cases in which high effective axial stresses exist  its software implementation can certainly assist well engineers with more-conservative and more-straightforward tubular design | 
181585-pa 	 experimental and theoretical study of water and solute transport in organic-rich carbonate mudrocks |summary |the objective of this research is to determine the physicochemical processes underlying water and solute transport in organic-rich source rocks  to achieve this goal, a custom-designed experimental apparatus was constructed to conduct flow tests, founded on a high-pressure triaxial assembly  the apparatus is capable of maintaining core samples at reservoir pressure, temperature, and confining stress  we conducted several 120-day low-salinity osmotic tests in low-clay, organic-rich eagle ford carbonate-shale samples  test results showed gradual, slow increase of pressure within the samples  because this pressure behavior could not be explained properly with classical models, we formulated a mass-transport mathematical model that relies on fundamental chemical osmosis principles driving low-salinity brine into high-salinity core samples  |our mathematical model was articulated to simulate flow into the core as a 3d porous medium rather than transport across a thin, molecule-selective membrane  the model is dependent on the following principles: the low-salinity brine selectively enters the pores by diffusion mass transport, and the pre-existing, ionized dissolved salt molecules within the core are restrained by internal electrostatic forces to counterdiffuse in the direction opposite to that of the low-salinity-brine molecules entering the pore network  critical model input data, such as permeability, porosity, and rock compressibility, were obtained from flow experiments on twin cores, and the diffusion coefficient was chosen by history matching  the strengths of the numerical simulation include reliance on mass-transport fundamental principles; not requiring the use of an ambiguously defined membrane-efficiency term; and relying on chemical-potential gradient as the driving force for the low-salinity brine to enter the high-salinity core, generating osmotic pressure within the pore network  the latter implies that osmotic pressure is the consequence of water entering the cores, not the cause  results of this research have provided a more plausible explanation of pore-scale mass transport in organic-rich shales, and provide useful insights for design of effective enhanced-oil-recovery (eor) processes |

185805-ms 	 development of a parallel simulator utilizing multiple interacting continua and embedded discrete fracture models in fractured unconventional reservoirs |abstract   unconventional petroleum reservoirs, such as shale gas and tight oil reservoirs, have changed the entire energy equation in the world  an accurate and efficient reservoir simulator is essential for the development and management of these reservoirs and the optimization of their production schedules  however, the gas storage and transport mechanisms in ultra-tight matrix, including gas adsorption/desorption, non-darcy flow, and surface diffusion, are different from those in conventional petroleum reservoirs  in addition, hydraulic fracturing techniques are often required to achieve their economical production, which leads to existence of complex fracture networks in the unconventional reservoirs  these features of unconventional reservoirs make their accurate numerical simulations a big challenge  in this paper, we develop a simulator for fractured unconventional reservoirs, which takes the specific gas storage and transport mechanisms into consideration, employs a multiple interacting continua (minc) model to handle well connected natural fractures, utilizes an embedded discrete fracture model to simulate large-scale disconnected hydraulic fractures, and uses a coupled model to efficiently describe multi-scale fractures with irregular geometries  to reduce the computational time, parallel computing techniques are also employed, with which large-scale reservoir simulation cases can be finished in practical time  from the numerical experiments, we can see that reasonable physical phenomena is captured and accurate predictions are performed by this simulator | 
185809-ms 	 shale gas well total fracture surface area calculation re-visited for a dynamic formation permeability |abstract   shale gas wells exhibit formation linear flow, which is in most cases the only transient flow regime available for engineering analysis  production rate transient analysis (rta) methods have been developed to analyze the transient flow into shale gas well  these methods often assume homogeneous reservoir properties and neglect the dynamic nature of the formation  in shale gas reservoirs, however, the properties could change; in particular, the permeability due to stress-dependence of the formation and non-darcian effects  in this work, a theoretical study is conducted to show the range of errors on the predicted total fracture surface area caused by the constant permeability assumption  the study proposes a modified rta model, which accounts for dynamic permeability to eliminate the error in calculated area    results from the sensitivity analysis show that the error on surface area calculation ranges from 1% – 323% due to the constant permeability assumption  the total fracture surface area calculation is most sensitive to the geomechanical (stress-sensitive) parameters, which affect the permeability in the region away from fractures  results show that the error in area is reduced when the initial value of the dynamic permeability is large  sorption parameters are the second most influential category affecting the surface area calculation  molecular diffusion of the adsorbed and free gas molecules enhance permeability near the fractures, wherein the slightest variations in dynamic permeability can cause the error in area to change significantly  for these parameters, higher permeability near the fractures translates to higher error in area | 
185811-ms 	 drilling risk migration based on borehole failure mechanism analysis from oil-base mud images: a case study from west of shetland, north sea |abstract   drilling risk can be migrated based on borehole failure mechanism analysis, which provides valuable information for wellbore stability and formation damage protection  it is very challenging to identify the borehole failure in oilbase mud environment because of lacking of high resolution borehole image although we can get some information from cutting shape or sonic data with high uncertainty    a new photorealistic micro-electrical imager for oil-based mud provides rich information on borehole failure and related formation damage from 3 different images (resistivity, permittivity and stand-off)  the different borehole failure mode including tensile, compressional or shear are easily identified from resistivity or permittivity image    the multiple arm radius data of this imager was also used to for borehole failure identification complementing with image feature interpretation  the special stand-off image was integrated for borehole failure identification as well    one case study from clair field, west of shetlands north sea was presented to demonstrate the borehole failure identification  the horizontal incipient breakout in horizontal well provides the consistent extensional stress regime; the breakout from vertical well show the new understanding of minimum horizontal stress and the mixture of drilling induced fracture and incipient breakout indicate the small ratio of two horizontal stress  the one dimensional mechanical earth model (mem) of a horizontal well was updated based on borehole failure mechanism  the new mem is more consistent with field leak of testing in other wells and provide valuable information for mud optimization to improve drilling efficiency in different risk intervals    the new high-definition obm-adapted micro-electrical imagesenabled confident identification and quantification of borehole tensile orshear failures and provides direct evidence for single well geomechanics earth model calibration | 
185833-ms 	 reservoir rock and fluid characterization using distributed temperature sensing dts systems data |abstract   the variation of temperature profile of the sandface and wellbore offers important indicators for the occurrence of various downhole phenomena, as functions of reservoir formation and fluid properties  this paper aims to investigate the assimilation of temperature and production data for robust and efficient estimation of reservoir formation properties and fluid characterization  very few previous work in the literature used distributed temperature sensing (dts) data for the characterization of the reservoir fluid and geostatistical description  the main contribution of this work lies in the proposed methodology for integration of temperature data from dts systems to obtain a robust estimation of the reservoir fluid description, as well as introducing the integration of temperature data as an alternative and/or complementary data for integrative reservoir characterization  two synthetic reservoir examples are investigated  in the first example, we focus on resolving the geostatistical description of a 3d multi-phase reservoir under water flooding  an ensemble-based data assimilation algorithm is used to compare the characterization of reservoir formation porosity and permeability by integration of temperature profile and well production data as opposed to the integration of production logging tool (plt) data  our results show that the dts temperature data shows good potential as an alternative to the plt data for reservoir rock characterization, although there may be a risk of model overfitting due to the large amount of data  in the second example, we attempt to estimate the original composition of the reservoir fluid as well as reservoir rock properties using downhole temperature profile data  a relatively simple multi-layer radial reservoir model is considered in this case  however, in order to honor the physical bounds on the various model parameters, a constrained ensemble-based data assimilation algorithm based on lagrange multipliers is adopted  the computational results show that the original reservoir fluid composition could be excellently estimated for a case with known reservoir properties  presence of uncertainty in the reservoir formation properties resulted in an poor estimation of the original reservoir fluid composition | 
185851-ms 	 compaction and dilation effects on polymer flood performance |abstract   during recent field applications of polymer flooding in unconsolidated reservoirs, questions have arisen concerning the role of compaction and/or dilation on flood performance  the primary goal for this paper was to assess the extent to which the compressible nature of a formation affects polymer flooding  the tambaredjo field in suriname (with in-situ oil viscosity ~600 cp) was used as a model for this study  comparisons were made during simulations where formation compressibility was 5 6 <u+00d7> 10-4 psi-1 versus 1 <u+00d7> 10-6 psi-1  during a simulated 17-year compaction drive with compressibility of 5 6 <u+00d7> 10-4 psi-1, water cut gradually increased to average 20% (consistent with the actual field performance)—compared to 2% if compressibility was 1 <u+00d7> 10-6 psi-1  oil recovery during this period was 18% ooip for the highcompressibility case versus 3% ooip for the low-compressibility case  subsequent to the above compaction drive, incremental oil recoveries from waterflooding and polymer flooding were significantly less (about half in our case) when compressibility was 5 6 <u+00d7> 10-4 psi-1 than when compressibility was 1 <u+00d7> 10-6 psi-1—simply because the oil recovery target was less  for the many waterflooding and polymer flooding cases, most incremental oil was recovered within five years of starting injection—regardless of formation compressibility  water cuts rose to high values within five years of injection, regardless of the viscosity of the injected fluid and the compressibility value  consistent with the actual field application, the response to polymer injection varied greatly from well to well  however, our analysis indicated that these variations were due to existing heterogeneities within the pattern—not to the high compressibility of the formation  during simulation, polymer injection increased porosity by factors up to 1 5 and permeability by factors up to 2 3  nevertheless, compaction or dilation had a fairly even (proportionate) effect on porosity and permeability throughout the pattern  if polymer injection was stopped after the simulated peak in porosity was reached (after 4-6 years of injection) and compaction was allowed to resume, a modest level of oil recovery resulted from this second compaction period (25%-38% of the incremental oil during polymer injection)  however, substantially longer was required for the recovery (15-17 years versus 4-6 years for polymer flooding)  consequently, relying on re-compaction during this period of low oil prices may not be as profitable as one might hope  our work suggests that there is an optimum rate, viscosity, and pressure for polymer flooding compressible formations  flooding too rapidly results in pressures that waste much of the injection energy on dilating the formation—thereby detracting from efficient displacement of the oil  these constraints restrict injection rate, viscosity, and pressure to a greater degree for very compressible formations than for incompressible formations | 
185852-ms 	 initiation of stimulation treatments depends on wellbore mechanical responses during drilling |abstract   a stimulation treatment follows from, and is affected by, the set of processes that occur during well construction  the creation of the opening causes a major change in stress state, and may involve permanent rock deformations affecting the wall of the wellbore  drilling practices seek to avoid such failures because of the immediate consequences associated with rock debris loading the well, but also because deformations provide pathways for fluids to invade the rocks where they may lead to further de-stabilisation via chemical interactions  a hydraulic stimulation treatment uses the pressures of injected fluids to cause rock breakage over a short period of time, creating new flow pathways  the mechanics of the stimulation process, at the moment of its initiation, is very like the condition of mud overbalance while drilling, where the wellbore is inflated to a larger-diameter condition  in stimulation treatments, this wellbore inflation and the resulting rock deformation responses, occur in a situation that already has been modified by the drilling actions    we describe numerical simulations of these near-well geomechanical processes, relating both to drilling and to stimulation activities, using a method that is based on a combined finite-discrete element formulation  the 2d numerical method treats the model domain initially as a continuum, but allows fractures to develop along any of the faces of the finite elements, with composite fractures able to grow into large and complex configurations  we show that an important factor is the removal of the rock mass from the drilled hole, which leads to a very different stress state around the opening compared to mathematical models that have a pre-existing hole in them  depending on the far-field stress state and the material properties, the simulations of drilling often develop fracture arrays that are associated with borehole elongation in the far-field minimum stress direction (which is compatible with standard knowledge)  those arrays alter the near-well stress state in major ways  the numerical simulations also reveal the characteristics of deformation processes, involving fracturing and consequent strain changes, and thus their stress changes, which affect the part of the wellbore wall that is broadly aligned with the maximum far field stress  except with the strongest and stiffest rocks, the fractures in this region initiate and develop mainly as shears, which contrasts sharply with the received wisdom for what is expected  this response also applies when we impose a stimulation loading inside the wellbore (fluid injection) | 
185854-ms 	 a new practical method for predicting equivalent drainage area of well in tight gas reservoirs |abstract   the tight gas is one of the main types of the unconventional gas  typically the tight gas reservoirs consist of highly heterogeneous low permeability reservoir  the economic evaluation for the production from tight gas production is very challenging task because of prevailing uncertainties associated with key reservoir properties, such as porosity, permeability as well as drainage boundary  however one of the important parameters requiring in this economic evaluation is the equivalent drainage area of the well, which relates the actual volume of fluids (e g gas) produced or withdrawn from the reservoir at a certain moment that changes with time  it is difficult to predict this equivalent drainage area of well in tight gas reservoir as it takes utterly long time for reservoir pressure to reach to the impermeable physical boundary of the reservoir  the effective drainage area, which grows with time during the transient period; and consequently it is much smaller than the physical drainage arear over the transient flow period in case of tight gas reservoir because of the low permeability  consequently the production forecasting using physical drainage area (as generally considered for conventional reservoir) can results not only significant error in estimation but also mislead the decision making process    in this paper however, a practical method for predicting the equivalent drainage area of a fractured well in tight gas reservoir is proposed  this method is based upon combined gas material balance equation and decline curve analysis  the developed method is validated against reservoir simulation results, which demonstrates that the proposed method is accurate enough to predict the equivalent drainage area, and may be considered as a practical tool for production forecasting for tight gas reservoir  sensitivity analyses are carried out to investigate various factors, such as porosity, permeability, facture length on equivalent drainage area for fractured vertical well in tight gas reservoir  based on the sensitivity study it is observed that the fracture half-length and the porosity have strong impact on the equivalent drainage area, and propagation of equivalent drainage area with time | 
185861-ms 	 pressure transient analysis in advanced wells completed with flow control devices |abstract   inflow control devices (icds) modify the inflow profile of a multi-zone well completion  their imposition of an extra pressure drop at the sandface has proven to be particularly effective at delaying the breakthrough of (unwanted) water or gas in wells with long completion lengths  it is widely accepted that an icd completion improves the field's economics; but the question of whether and why an icd completion affects the accuracy of standard pressure transient analysis (pta) workflows has not been addressed    a typical icd completion is designed to create an extra pressure drop of a similar magnitude to the well's expected reservoir drawdown when producing at its target rate  this paper shows why this extra pressure drop cannot always be treated as an additional skin value during pta  this is because the icd's pressure drop is a time dependent variable, varying with both fluid's viscosity and flowrate through the device  a nonlinear pressure loss can, sometimes, distort the pressure response and render conventional pta methods inaccurate    the study presented in this paper uses an integrated, dynamically coupled, wellbore and reservoir model to define the limits within which treating the icd pressure drop as an additional skin is a valid assumption and when its nonlinear nature will result in an inaccurately estimated value of skin and reservoir permeability  a general workflow for the analysis of pta data measured in liquid producing wells completed with icds is proposed for the derivation of realistic values of the formation damage skin  the workflow has also been adapted for routine monitoring of wells completed with icds    the value of this study is illustrated by its application to two data sets from the north sea's golden eagle field  this is an ideal field to test the validity of our theoretical analysis due to well completions with multiple levels of inflow control together with "state-of-the-art", downhole sensors  the results of this work allows reservoir and production engineers to differentiate between deteriorating well performance due to increasing watercut and that due to an increasing formation damage skin |

186392-ms 	 enhancing well construction for more efficient well abandonment |abstract   the lack of planning for well plug and abandonment (p&a) during the well-construction phase can significantly contribute to the extended operational time and associated high cost of p&a  the impact on time and cost is mainly due to insufficient well data, uncertain casing cement integrity, and lack of information on competent formation for permanent barrier placement  undocumented pressure and stress evolution, and well events also can contribute to increased time and cost of p&a    although new technologies can reduce plug and abandonment cost, another approach is to effectively plan for well abandonment during the front end engineering design (feed) and well-construction phases and during drilling of new wells    this paper examines recommendations for improvement and requirements that should be addressed by the industry, regulators, and operators to introduce clear well-abandonment requirements into feed and well-construction phases for new drilled wells   –  requirement for planning for well integrity for the entire well life cycle of the well from well construction to well abandonment and after well abandonment –  identify number and position of required barriers for abandonments –  requirement to identify and document competent formation during well-construction phase –  requirement to demonstrate there is cement with good bond / isolation between the casing and the formation in the areas where internal cement plugs are to be set  –  qualification of the formation as possible well barrier –  well monitoring: consider introducing sensors or instrument in cement (cement behind casing) to continuously monitor and track any pressure build-up in the casing annulus  –  completion design: avoid control lines at the intended well-barrier depth(s) and install production packer(s) in a location enables through-tubing well-abandonment methodologies  |other considerations to be addressed in this paper are the change of regulations between the time the well is constructed, and its final p&a    the novelty of addressing well abandonment requirements in the feed and well-construction phases will significantly simplify the abandonment phase reducing risks and cost while improving well barrier integrity |

187055-ms 	 the role of pore pressure depletion in propagation of new hydraulic fractures during refracturing of horizontal wells |abstract   refracturing of a horizontal well is a method to restore the productivity of the well in unconventional reservoirs after the expected production decline  placement of new fractures in a system that has been already depleted poses new challenges for operators  these challenges are due to the altered stress zones resulting from the expected pore volume depletion and corresponding pressure decline  in this study, refracturing propagation issues in a horizontal well are studied    a fully coupled poroelastic displacement discontinuity model has been developed to study refrac propagation in horizontal wells  displacement discontinuity is a powerful numerical method for studying hydraulic fracture problems  the model has been verified using available analytical solutions for undrained and drained fracture behaviors  maximum horizontal stress criterion is used to account for the fracture propagation  several cases are analyzed using the model  for each set, scenarios that increase the chance of successful refracturing are suggested    results of this study show that pore pressure depletion is the key factor in defining extent and severity of stress redistribution zones in the reservoir  the effect of pore pressure is shown to be asymmetric in horizontal wells between two parallel fractures  it is observed that the stress anisotropy between two parallel fractures decreases and it increases between the tips of two fractures  after a certain time, stress anisotropy in the area between two fractures becomes negative which means that the horizontal stresses orientation is reversed in that area  placing any new fracture in the stress-reversed area causes an unwanted change in direction of fracture propagation and eventually an intersection between new and old fractures  in addition, because of the stress redistribution, new fracture tends to propagate toward the nearest old fracture in a single well  this tendency increases as pore pressure depletion becomes greater, increasing risk of refracturing failure  a sensitivity analysis is performed on spacing and length of the old fractures to investigate the best possible treatment plan in terms of these variables    results that are obtained by this study give better understanding about propagation of new fractures as well as old fractures in refracturing process  moreover, it introduces a very efficient method that aids in the design of refracturing processes in depleted horizontal wells |

187191-ms 	 new model for dfit fracture injection and falloff pressure match |abstract   analysts regard the fracture injection and falloff test known as the diagnostic fracture injection test (dfit) as a reliable tool to quantify formation closure stress, leakoff coefficient, formation permeability, and pressure  the recent analytical dfit model for before and after closure enables matching the pressure falloff for abnormal leakoff behaviors, and quantification of many more formation parameters than traditional dfit models  however, the model design addressed only the falloff data after shut-in, and many express concerns that net pressure implied by the falloff is inconsistent with the injection pressure behavior  this paper provides a model capable of matching both injection and falloff pressure behavior    the pressure falloff model is capable of quantifying essential pressure values including, in order of occurrence, instantaneous shut-in pressure (isip), minimum fracture propagation pressure, one or more closure stress values, minimum stress, and pore pressure  the early pressure response represents the dissipation of three kinds of friction, wellbore, perforation, and near-wellbore friction, each of which are quantified, and which together comprise the difference between the pressure at the end of injection and the isip  presence of tip extension enables quantification of the minimum fracture propagation pressure  the minimum stress is consistent with the final closure stress  subtracting the closure pressure and friction pressure losses from the recorded or calculated bottomhole pressure provides the fracture net pressure  the model match for injection pressure behavior incorporates the same pressures and consistent values for 2d fracture geometry and leakoff coefficient    the global match confirms not only the estimation of formation and fracture properties from the pressure falloff analysis, but also the pressure distribution along the wellbore, through the perforations and the near wellbore, and in the fracture during and after injection  in particular, by matching both injection and falloff, the model incorporates friction pressure losses that can explain apparent excessive net pressure    the match with both injection and falloff pressure variation addresses concerns that the net pressure implied by the falloff model match cannot be consistent with observed injection behavior  when the pressure difference between the final dfit pick for closure stress and the pressure at the end of injection is very large, the reason may be large friction pressure losses and/or tip extension  design for the main fracture treatments could consider an altered perforation strategy to reduce friction losses and/or reduce cluster spacing to address very low effective permeability likely consistent with tip extension and confirmed by the after closure match | 
187224-ms 	 density changes and reservoir compaction from in-situ calibrated 4d gravity and subsidence measured at the seafloor |abstract   managing offshore hydrocarbon fields involves costly investments like drilling infill wells or installing compression facilities  a good understanding of the dynamical behavior of the reservoir is required for derisking such decisions  time-lapse seismic is a suitable monitoring technology, but it involves large operational costs  on the norwegian continental shelf (ncs), another geophysical method has been in use for two decades: 4d gravity and subsidence surveys, with a cost typically 15% of that of seismic surveys  field cases show that, in some cases, this technology provides information beyond the reach of seismic within the required timeliness    time-lapse gravity changes at the seafloor are sensitive to changes in mass within the reservoir  as an example, vertical movements of water-gas contacts smaller than a meter can be detected under some circumstances by studying this observable (ruiz et al , 2015)  that is possible because of the high accuracy of the time-lapse gravity measurements, which is at the level of a few <u+03bc>gal    seafloor subsidence monitoring uses water pressure measurements at the seafloor as a starting point  once the required tide corrections are applied, the method reaches accuracies of down to 2 mm, depending on the field conditions  this is much better than the accuracy specified by pressure sensor manufacturers, which amounts to typically 10 cm of water for a sensor qualified for 1000 m of water (ruiz et al , 2016b) | 
187225-ms 	 the role of elasto-plasticity in cavity shape and sand production in oil and gas wells |abstract   previous experimental observations have shown the formation of distinct failure patterns and cavity shapes under different stress and flow conditions  with isotropic stress, spiral failure patterns with localized shear bands are likely to form  on the other hand, under anisotropic stress, v-shape cavities, dog-ear cavities or slit mode cavities are usually observed  however, the mechanisms for the development of these sanding cavities remain unclear  in addition, in order to accurately predict the onset of sanding and predict the sand production rate, it is crucial to capture the physics of formation of these cavities during sand production    this paper presents a fully coupled poro-elasto-plastic, 3-d sand production model for sand production prediction around open-hole and perforated wellbores in a weakly consolidated formation  sanding criteria are based on a combination of shear failure, tensile failure and compressive failure from mohr-coulomb theory and strain-hardening/softening  once the failure criteria are met, an algorithm for entrainment of the sand based on the calculation of hydrodynamic forces is implemented to predict sand erosion and transport  dynamic mesh refinement has been implemented to effectively capture the strain localization regions    the model has been validated with multiple analytical solutions  in addition, it is applied to compare with previous sand production experiments that have explored the different cavity shapes formed under different conditions  the model is capable of not only explaining the mechanisms responsible for each type of cavity shape but also predicting what cavity shape will be formed under a specific set of conditions  parametric studies for these cases provide additional insight into the important role that the post-yield, poro-elasto-plastic properties of the sand play in controlling the sanding mechanisms and cavity development  this allows us to much more accurately predict the onset of sanding and the sanding rate | 
187236-ms 	 proposed refracturing methodology in the haynesville shale |abstract   during the downturn in the oil and gas industry, many operators have chosen to refracture their previously underperforming wells to boost economics with lower investment compared to drilling new wells  more than 100 horizontal wells have been refractured using chemical diverters across multiple basins in north america since the second half of 2013  many papers have been published discussing these case studies  however, the refracturing results have been inconsistent  one of the biggest challenges of refracturing with chemical diverters is not knowing what is actually happening down hole  to better understand what is happening, more refracture modeling should be performed to more reliably predict production results before spending the upfront capital for a refracturing treatment    a proposed refracture numerical simulation methodology was employed to take into account the historical production depletion using calculated pressure and stress measurements along the lateral and in the reservoir  the altered stress fields resulting from reservoir depletion are calculated through a comprehensive workflow coupling simulated 3d reservoir pressure with a geomechanical finite-element model (fem) described in a previous published paper  after the stress and pressure are updated, the new approach outlined in this paper is validated by production history matching real data from a previously refractured well in the haynesville basin to provide more confidence in the end results  the main uncertainty in the process is how much of the lateral was stimulated  this paper also provides a sensitivity example to show how the model can be altered to predict different lateral coverage percentages    refracture modeling still poses a major challenge for engineers because of the reservoir complexity and uncertainty downhole while refracturing (i e  reservoir heterogeneity, isolation efficiency, etc )  however, this proposed refracturing approach provides a basic guideline on how to model refracturing treatments in a numerical simulator with the help of altered stress fields caused by reservoir depletion  this can be used to better understand why previously refractured wells perform the way they do and to better predict the performance of future refractured wells | 
187250-ms 	 simulation of hydraulic fracturing-induced permeability stimulation using coupled flow and continuum damage mechanics |abstract   in hydraulic fracturing operations, permeability is enhanced when fractures are created and/or stimulated by injecting a highly pressurized fluid  in addition, mechanical response of the rock changes because of permanent modifications in the structure and properties of the rock after failure  in order for engineers to accurately predict results of hydraulic stimulation projects, mathematically rigorous and numerically efficient models of fluid flow and geomechanical deformation in fractured porous media must be used in computer simulations  some of the earlier approaches address the problem of fluid flow through fractured media with mathematical models that are either too simplistic or too expensive computationally and are not compatible with the available petroleum reservoir simulation platforms  in this work, a reservoir simulation framework is developed using a sequentially coupled numerical scheme of flow, deformation and poromechanical damage to study variations occurring in the fractured rock properties and state variables as a result of hydraulic stimulation  we numerically simulate injection-induced permeability enhancement and plastic deformation as well as post-stimulation softening behavior of the rock by considering the stimulated rock as a mechanically damaged configuration, the properties of which are modeled using an effective continuum model  we study how the flow and mechanical properties of fractured rock, namely permeability and stiffness, change by virtue of hydraulic fracturing, and we investigate the dynamics of pressure distribution and stress state with time  the sequential nature of the proposed coupling framework lends itself to easy integration with reservoir simulation and prediction tools | 
187255-ms 	 settling velocity of particles in viscoelastic fluids: a comparison of the shear viscosity vs elasticity effect |abstract   the objective of this paper is to determine how the fluid shear viscosity and the elasticity would influence the particle settling velocity and even more so to answer the question of which one of these two rheological properties is more dominant in controlling the particle settling velocity when viscoelastic drilling fluids are used    the settling velocities of the spherical particles (diameters: 1 18, 1 5, 2 and 3mm) in partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (hpam) polymer fluids were measured by using particle image shadowgraph (pis) technique  two sets of test fluids were formulated by mixing three different grades of hpam (molecular weights of 500,000; 8,000,000; and 20,000,000) at polymer concentrations 0 09%, 0 05% and 0 03% wt  the shear viscosity and elasticity characteristics of test fluids were determined by performing shear viscosity and frequency sweep oscillatory measurements, respectively  the first set of fluids had almost identical shear viscosity characteristics while showing significantly different elastic properties (quantified in terms of relaxation time)  the second set of fluids had similar elastic properties but different shear viscosity characteristics  in addition, the effect of the particle size on the settling velocities in these test fluids was also investigated    experimental results showed that: (i) when the fluids having similar shear viscosity profile were used, the settling velocity of spherical particles decreased significantly with the increasing fluid elasticity  the experimentally measured settling velocities were also compared against the values calculated from shah et al  (2007) model developed for predicting the settling velocity of spherical particles in power law (visco-inelastic) fluids  results have shown that the settling velocity values can be 14 to 50 times over-estimated if the effect of the elasticity is not considered; (ii) at constant elasticity, the settling velocity of spherical particles also decreased significantly when the fluid shear viscosity was increased; (iii) the spherical particles settling velocity increased pronouncedly as their diameter increased from 1 18mm to 3mm  but the magnitude of the increase in settling velocity with the increasing particle diameter is less for the samples having higher elasticity and similar shear viscosity characteristics  the fluid shear viscosity and the elasticity both seem to have significant effect on the particle settling velocity  however, from the field operational point of view, fluids with high shear viscosity values are not always practical to use as the high shear viscosity increases the parasitic pressure losses and potentially has a negative effect on the drilling rate  hence, in such cases increasing the fluid elasticity can help to reduce the particle settling velocity even at lower shear viscosity values    by conducting experiments under controlled conditions, for the first time in drilling literature, we were able to quantify the individual effects of fluid shear viscosity and elasticity on the particle settling velocity | 
187263-ms 	 modeling of production decline caused by fines migration in deep water reservoirs |abstract   many deep water wells experience steep productivity declines  some field observations indicate that this decline is partly attributed to fines migration effects  this paper presents a numerical workflow to simulate the effect of flow induced fines migration on production decline over time in deep water reservoirs  a permeability reduction function is extracted from long-term core flood tests and implemented into a reservoir simulator  using the permeability reduction function, production degradation caused by fines migration is simulated in a detailed single well model  from previous research, it is understood that fines migration won't start until the flow velocity is greater than the critical velocity  through many long-term core flood tests (extended fines migration test), we conclude that the permeability damage induced by fines migration is a function of the pore volume throughput  to address these observations the numerical model is updated such that the interstitial flow velocity is tracked in each individual cell  when the interstitial velocity is greater than the critical velocity, the cell's permeability follows the permeability reduction trend obtained from laboratory data  if the flow direction is reversed, fines migration damage will be recovered  a detailed 3d model is constructed to study the fines migration effect in each part of the wellbore (perforation, fracture etc ) and reservoir  as expected, fines migration starts near the perforation where flow velocity is highest  depending on the permeability decline rate, the production asymptotes to a constant value after a certain period of time  both the decline rate and the ultimate residual permeability have a strong effect on the final production  sensitivities were run to study the effect of fines migration in different completions  as the author's understanding this is the first time that laboratory-based fines migration data is incorporated into a reservoir simulator to predict the production decline using experiment-based fines migration functions  this workflow will help reservoir engineers to predict the damage caused by fines migration, predict production decline and plan remediation | 
187265-ms 	 drilling mud loss in naturally fractured reservoirs: theoretical modelling and field data analysis |abstract   real-time analysis of drilling mud loss data is an effective tool to characterize the size, distribution and permeability of natural fractures  the estimated properties of natural fractures can then be used to modify the drilling fluid properties and design remedial mud loss treatment to stop further drilling fluid loss  moreover, characterization of natural fracture provides crucial information for the design and application of reservoir stimulation operations    in this paper, we present a theoretical model to simulate the invasion of the drilling fluid into natural fractures  mathematical modelling was performed for two types of rheology constitutive models which are commonly used for drilling fluids, namely bingham plastic and herschel-bulkley  the fluid leak-off into the formation is modelled using carter's model  moreover, a simplified local elasticity equation is used for the fracture width variation due to fluid pressure  a forward finite-difference numerical scheme is used to solve the pressure drop equation  the developed model is then validated against well-known analytical solutions and numerical simulations  parametric studies were conducted to evaluate the impact of the fracture deformability, formation leak-off properties, drilling fluid rheology, and the pore fluid contribution  finally, the output of the developed model is compared with the field data of a welldocumented mud loss incident    the obtained results indicate that the incorporating the effect of the fluid leak-off may significantly increase the rate of mud loss volume  therefore, for highly permeable formations (such as carbonates), considering the impact of the fluid leak-off effect seems necessary for a realistic characterization of the mud loss problem  fracture deformability affects the mud loss volume, with higher deformability leading to a larger mud loss volume  also, the numerical results confirmed that the rate and magnitude of mud loss volume is significantly affected by the rheological properties of the drilling fluid, in particular the yield stress  in contrast, the effect of pore fluid seems relatively negligible for typical formation fluid types  comparing the results of our simulation with mud loss field data shows that the developed model can accurately predict the rate and total volume of mud loss into the fractures  moreover, it shows that incorporating the impact of the fluid leak-off and the fracture stiffness may significantly affect the fracture width prediction  therefore, these factors should be considered to obtain an accurate estimate of the natural fracture aperture |

187336-ms 	 stress-induced damage evolution in unconventional shale monitored by acoustic emission |abstract   this paper experimentally investigates the damage evolution (or the deformation process) induced by externally applied stress on unconventional shale samples  the focus is to understand the physics behind the complex failure process occurring at the micro-scale, and thus provide useful information on the macro-fracture mechanisms of unconventional shales  we perform the compression tests along with the acoustic emission (ae) measurement on cylindrical rock samples selected from berea sandstone (bs), eagle ford (ef) and marcellus formation  tests are conducted under the same stress condition: uniaxial unconfined compression test and triaxial compression test with a confining pressure of 10 mpa  aes are continuously collected to characterize the progressive damage process  the axial stress, axial and radial displacement are also recorded during experiments  shale samples are drilled perpendicular or parallel to the beddings  the x-ray diffraction (xrd) analysis is used to measure the mineralogy and clay content  prior to geomechanical testing, the high-resolution micro-ct imaging system is used for quality assessment of rock samples and characterization of microstructure and fracture presence    all samples studied exhibit distinct characteristics of ae counts  in berea sandstone, ae counts initially increase slowly with the axial strain, and then surge dramatically after reaching the yield stress point  this is consistent with the observed stress-strain behavior: a linear elastic part followed by the inelastic deformation till the rock fails  compared to berea sandstone, shale samples show a different characteristics of ae counts  aes resulting from ef vertical sample monotonically increase until the sample fails, while three stages of ae activity are observed in the horizontal sample: initial increase followed by a stage of quiet period (no ae events), and increase again  marcellus samples behave just the opposite: three stages of ae events are observed in the vertical sample, while monotonically increase in the horizontal sample  aes are also observed to be affected by the test condition: different from the triaxial compression test, marcellus vertical and horizontal samples have a similar trend in ae counts during the uniaxial compression test  both initially increase in ae activity with the axial stress, and after a certain stress, a surge in ae activity is observed  the observed discrepancy of aes can be due to the complexity of shale mineralogical compositions, pore geometry and thin layer structure  more detailed laboratory experiments are necessary to understand the physics behind the complex failure process and aes occurring at the micro-scale in unconventional shales | 
187348-ms 	 new variable compliance method for estimating in-situ stress and leak-off from dfit data |abstract   over the past two decades, diagnostic fracture injection tests (dfit) or injection-fall-off fracture calibration tests have evolved into a commonly used and reliable technique to evaluate reservoir properties, fracturing parameters and obtain in-situ stresses  since the introduction of dfit analysis based on g-function and its derivative, this method has become standard practice for quantifying minimum in-situ stress and leak-off coefficient  however, the pressure decline model that underlies the g-function plot makes two distinct and important assumptions: (1) leak-off is not pressure-dependent and, (2) fracture stiffness (or compliance) is assumed to be constant during fracture closure  fracture closure is a gradual process that starts when asperities at the fracture tip first come into contact with each other  as pressure declines due to leak-off, more and more of the fracture wall comes into contact  it is important to model this process quantitatively to obtain good estimates of in-situ stresses and leak-off  in this paper, we present a model that accounts for changes in fracture stiffness/compliance as the fracture closes, with leak-off that is dependent on fracture pressure  the model is, therefore, capable of analyzing dfit data from the end of pumping to days or even weeks after shut-in    we first review nolte's original g-function model and examine the assumptions inherent in the model  we then present a new global pressure transient model for pressure decline after shut-in which not only preserves the physics of unsteady-state reservoir flow behavior, elastic fracture mechanics and material balance, but also incorporates the gradual changes of fracture stiffness/compliance due to the contact of rough fracture walls during closure  this global model allows us to analyze the whole spectrum of dfit data by bridging before closure and after closure data seamlessly  analysis of synthetic cases, along with field data are presented to demonstrate how the coupled effects of fracture geometry, fracture surface asperities, formation properties, pore pressure and wellbore storage can impact fracturing pressure decline and the estimation of minimum in-situ stress    it is shown that so-called "normal leak-off" behavior that is modeled using carter leak-off is an oversimplification that leads to significant errors in the interpretation of the data  all the before closure analysis conducted under a "normal leak-off" assumption should be reexamined cautiously  most importantly, this article reveals that previous methods of estimating minimum in-situ stress often lead to significant over or underestimates, because of their failure to account for changes in fracture stiffness/compliance correctly as the fracture closes progressively from the edge to the center  based on our modeling and simulation results, we propose a much more accurate and reliable method to estimate the minimum in-situ stress, fracture pressure dependent leak-off rate and evaluate the compliance of the un-propped fracture |

188055-ms 	 understanding the true stimulated reservoir volume in shale reservoirs |abstract |successful exploitation of shale reservoirs largely depends on the effectiveness of hydraulic fracturing stimulation program  favorable results have been attributed to intersection and reactivation of pre-existing fractures by hydraulically-induced fractures that connect the wellbore to a larger fracture surface area within the reservoir rock volume  thus, accurate estimation of the stimulated reservoir volume (srv) becomes critical for the reservoir performance simulation and production analysis  micro-seismic events (ms) have been commonly used as a proxy to map out the srv geometry, which could be erroneous because not all ms events are related to hydraulic fracture propagation  the case studies discussed here utilized a fully 3-d simulation approach to estimate the srv  |the simulation approach presented in this paper takes into account the real-time changes in the reservoir's geomechanics as a function of fluid pressures  it is consisted of four separate coupled modules: geomechanics, hydrodynamics, a geomechanical joint model for interfacial resolution, and an adaptive re-meshing  reservoir stress condition, rock mechanical properties, and injected fluid pressure dictate how fracture elements could open or slide  critical stress intensity factor was used as a fracture criterion governing the generation of new fractures or propagation of existing fractures and their directions  our simulations were run on a cray xc-40 hpc system  |the studies outcomes proved the approach of using ms data as a proxy for srv to be significantly flawed  many of the observed stimulated natural fractures are stress related and very few that are closer to the injection field are connected  the situation is worsened in a highly laminated shale reservoir as the hydraulic fracture propagation is significantly hampered  high contrast in the in-situ stresses related strike-slip developed thereby shortens the extent of srv  however, far field nature fractures that were not connected to hydraulic fracture were observed being stimulated  |these results show the beginning of new understanding into the physical mechanisms responsible for greater disparity in stimulation results within the same shale reservoir and hence the srv  using the appropriate methodology, stimulation design can be controlled to optimize the responses of in-situ stresses and reservoir rock itself |

188338-ms 	 an experimental study on interactions between imbibed fracturing fluid and organic-rich tight carbonate source rocks |abstract   carbonate reservoirs dominate 70% of oil and 90% of gas reserves in middle east region, and imbibition is the main mechanism for fracturing fluid up-take during hydraulic fracturing stimulation process  due to highly heterogeneous nature of tight carbonate source rocks, it is crucial to understand effects of the imbibed fluid on the mechanical, morphological and flow properties of the carbonate rocks  while the influence of imbibed fluids on the wettability of carbonate reservoir has been studied intensively, the research on effects of imbibed fluids on the texture and mineralogy of the carbonate rocks is very limited  this paper aims to provide a conceptual approach and workflow to characterize and quantify microstructure and mineralogy changes resulting from the imbibed fluids    a thin-section of low permeability organic-rich carbonate rock sample with a dimension of 7mm <u+00d7> 7mm <u+00d7> 0 3mm (length <u+00d7> width <u+00d7> thickness) was used in the study  the sample was submerged into 2% kcl (ph = 7 1) fluid from one end to simulate the spontaneous imbibition process  scanning electron microscope (sem) was used to capture the sample’s morphological change before and after spontaneous imbibition  energy dispersive spectroscopy (eds) mapping was used to study mineralogy changes (dissolution and precipitation) before and after fluid treatment  inductively coupled plasma (icp) equipped with optical emission spectrometer (oes) detector has been used to quantify dissolved ion concentrations in the treatment fluid  permeability and porosity were measured using core plugs (1" in diameter <u+00d7> 1 5" in length) before and after imbibition process with half-length of the sample submerged into the treatment fluid    the sem images for the thin-section sample show three zones with distinct fluid up-take characters  in zone i, which was submerged into the testing fluid, considerable mineral dissolution has been observed  in zone iii, which was above the testing fluid level, considerable mineral precipitation was detected  while in the transition zone (zone ii, which was between the above two zones around the water-air level), minor amount of mineral dissolution was observed  the mineralogy changes resulting from the dissolution and precipitation have been identified by eds analysis in all three zones  gypsum and calcite were found to be dissolved in the imbibed fluids, while gypsum was found to be deposited on the rock surface in zones above fluid level  the observed gypsum deposition might result from the dissolution of the gypsum and calcite and re-precipitaion later from the imbibition experiment due to water evaporation and/or from sample drying process  absolute permeability and porosity measurements for core plug samples show that both increased after the imbibition process |

188683-ms 	 improved recovery of carbonate reservoir by optimizing acidizing strategy; coupled wellbore, reservoir, and geomechanical analysis |abstract   one of the sources of damage in stimulated carbonate rock is the loss of near wellbore formation compressive strength which may results in casing collapse under extreme conditions  field studies have shown that the failure of acidized rock may cause damage and thereby negatively impact production  in this work, an integrated analysis workflow is presented to simulate acid placement in carbonate reservoirs and model stimulated rock behavior during the productive lifetime of the well  the workflow is utilized to design a unique approach to horizontal wellbore acidizing and optimize the strategy to maximize hydrocarbon recovery    the presented workflow is based on the interaction between the distributions of reactive fluid along a wellbore, a two scale continuum model to simulate porosity evolution during stimulation, and stimulated rock performance during production time  the model first simulates stimulation fluid movement in the wellbore and couples it with transient reservoir flow  the primary analysis provides the distribution of reactive fluid along the well  the rock dissolution at each section of reservoir is then analyzed by continuum two-scale model (pore-scale and darcy scale)  this analysis presents porosity evolution at different locations along the well and at different radial distance from the wellbore center  then, the developed geomechanical engine simulates the weakened rock under the in-situ stresses and bottom-hole pressure and predicts any possible compressional or shear failure  the effect of rock failure is then considered on the production prediction    the workflow is best used to analyze and optimize acid stimulation for a horizontal well  the analysis results show that the induced wormholes are stable and open since reservoir depletion increases the effective mean stress  at the elevated mean effective stress, wormholes or pores start to collapse and the failure extended away from near wellbore region and neutralized the stimulation effects  since in the acid treated zone the rock is softened, the stress concentration around the wellbore might extended more into the reservoir  analyzing this phenomenon showed that at a certain level of lowered stress concentration extension, in other words at certain strength and volume of acid, the wormhole can be stable and open during expected production time  furthermore, the coupled analysis also demonstrates that at specific environment, the wormholes penetrated further into the rock, longer than possible   induced failure  the workflow can be used to determine how weak or strong the acid should be at specific environmental condition to have longer life for the induced wormholes and hence extra hydrocarbon recovery |

188873-ms 	 an integrated numerical simulation scheme to predict shale gas production of a multi-fractured horizontal well |abstract   the application of horizontal well drilling coupled with the multistage fracturing technology enables commercial development of shale gas formations  to optimize the shale gas development, the transient gas flow in a shale formation is of great research interest  due to anano-scale pore radius, the gas flow in shale matrix may fall in flow regimes which include viscous flow, slip flow and knudsen diffusion  on top of that, gas adsorption/desorption and stress-sensitivity are some other important phenomena in shales  in this paper, we introduce a novel numerical simulation scheme to depict the above phenomena and predict the gas production from a multi-stage fractured horizontal well, which is crucial for the shale gas development    instead of darcy's equation, we implement the apparent permeability in the continuity equation to depict the gas flow (viscous flow, slip flow and knudsen diffusion) in shale matrix  an adsorption/desorption term is included in the continuity equation as an accumulation term  a sink which is based on peaceman's well model is placed at the center of the fracture cell  uniform fluid flow from matrix to fractures is assumed  only viscous flow is considered in the fractures and the permeability of the fractures doesnot change with pressure  the model is validated via comparing with an infinity-conductivity fracture model  moreover, the lab data of eagle ford shale which provides the relationship between matrix permeability and the effective stress is integrated into the two-way coupling geomechanical process to simulate a stress-sensitive shale formation  furthermore, the langmuir and bet models will be compared to investigate the detailed adsorption/desorption process    this methodology examines the influence of each mechanism for the transient shale gas flow  instead of conventional pressure-independent darcy permeability, the apparent permeability increases with the development of a shale gas reservoir, which leads to higher productivity  with the gas adsorption/desorption, the reservoir pressure is maintained via the supply of released gas from nano-scale pore wall surfaces, which also leads to higher gas production  in addition, it yields a 5% difference for the cumulative production for one yearbetween the langmuir and bet models  with the consideration of geomechanics, the apparent permeability is decreased due to the compaction of nano-scale pores, which leads to a decrease in productivity  due to the difference of compaction magnitude for each grid block, geomechanics creates additional heterogeneity for anano-pore network in a shale formation, which we should pay more attention to    a novel methodology is introduced to examine the crucial phenomena in a shale formation, which simultaneously takes into account the influence of flow regimes, gas adsorption/desorption and stresssensitivity  on top of that, the productivity of a multi-stage fractured horizontal well is quantified  we provide an effective way to quantify the above effects for the transient gas flow in shale formations |

188891-ms 	 advanced fracture modeling: lab experiments to field applications |abstract   this article describes the development, validation, and application of a fully coupled finite element (fe) framework for modeling of hydraulic fractures in the context of a diverse set of oil & gas (o&g) problems  the models have been developed within a fully-implicit non-linear fe solver, and comprise two widely established fracture modeling methods: cohesive zone method or czm (mesh conforms to a pre-defined fracture path) and extended finite element method or xfem (fracture geometry evolves independent of the finite element mesh)    the models were verified by comparing simulation results with analytical solutions for the four asymptotic regimes of fracture propagation  the models were also experimentally validated, which involved comparing simulations with carefully conducted polyaxial fracturing experiments  for this purpose, a comprehensive set of laboratory-scale polyaxial fracturing experiments were conducted  then, the finite element models were used to simulate these experiments, and the simulation results were compared with the experimental results    the applicability of these models spans conventional as well unconventional fracturing problems, including 3d multi-zone injection, diagnostic fracture injection tests, and multi-stage hydraulic fracturing  to demonstrate this, a number of field-scale models are constructed and applied to a broad range of o&g problems involving fracture propagation at large length and time scales  these include a step rate test (srt), a produced water re-injection (pwri) problem, and a cuttings re-injection (cri) simulation  these large length- and time-scale simulations were enabled by a high-performance, massively parallel computing system    through the various validation exercises and the field examples discussed in this work, we intend to demonstrate the applicability of the newly developed fracture modeling capabilities in successfully simulating real problems ranging from laboratory-scale to field-scale | 
188927-ms 	 design transformation of hydraulically powered coiled tubing tractors for matrix acidizing stimulations in extended reach carbonate reservoirs |abstract   the deployment of hydraulically powered coiled tubing (ct) tractors for matrix acidizing stimulations in extended reach carbonate reservoirs have provided critical benefits to well productivity  the technology allows for uniform placement of the matrix acid treatment while ensuring good zonal coverage  there have been several innovative tractor technologies developed over the last few years and the latest advances in design required an ‘out of the box' solution  for oil producers with electrical submersible pumps (esp) completions including bypass sections, the 2 4" restriction in tubing size requires a large expansion ratio once the tractor enters the 7" cased and 6-1/8" open hole sections  the slim size of the tractor and expansion ratio were the main challenges to overcome in designing a tractor capable of delivering a high enough pull force to reach deeper target depths  it was recognized that a radical change in slim tractor design was required if these goals were to be met    although 2-1/8" slim ct tractors have been used extensively in this field, the results were not always consistent, leading to reduced coverage during the acid stimulation of the well which resulted in lower production and reservoir optimization  these previous tractors relied upon wheel sections to transfer the pulling force to the casing or open hole  although these tractors performed well in the cased hole environment, they were less effective once the wheels came in contact with the reservoir rock  to overcome this deficiency, a completely new approach was taken in designing a slim tractor that could deliver a much higher pull force with improved grip in the open hole section  the new design uses a synchronized gripper system to enable the tractor to have continuous traction in the open hole section  this new compact design, while less than <u+00bd> the length, produces almost double the pulling force of the previous wheel based slim ct tractors    during the trial test, the tractor delivered a pulling force of up to 3500 lbs to overcome friction and helical buckling forces to reach the target depth (td)  this resulted in an increase in the stimulation coverage from the original lock up depth of around 50% of the open hole, to increase the coverage to 100% of the open hole    this new design opens a window to ultimately meet the goals of improved well treatment in long horizontals resulting in better productivity and uniform flow distribution in extended reach oil wells  new generations of the tractor are planned for development with increased pull force, higher expansion ratios for larger oh sizes and also to allow real time production logging on coil tubing | 
188931-ms 	 looking beyond the wellbore: formation evaluation mitigates risk and reduces uncertainty in multi-stage unconventional completions |abstract   is there a proven methodology for designing optimum multi-stage completions in unconventional reservoirs? where to place frac stages, perforation clusters, and how to avoid geo-hazards? this paper attempts to cover some of the fundamental aspects of stage placement and hydraulic fracturing designs by discussing lessons learned from several major us basins    a holistic data-driven approach to completion optimization is based on the analysis of the production potential, favorable rock mechanical properties, and geological features along the entire wellbore  lateral reservoir characterization, including advanced cuttings and gas analysis, high-definition imaging technologies of logging while drilling (lwd), and wireline (wl) deep shear wave imaging (dswi) is used to optimize completion and stimulation designs  the suggested methodology goes beyond the wellbore proximity and provides insight to practical application of advanced formation evaluation (fe) technologies    to address the challenges of lithological and horizontal stress heterogeneity of unconventional reservoirs and to optimize multi-stage completions, a combination of three primary categories of reservoir characteristics are considered: "producibility", "fracability", and geofeatures  deep shear wave imaging technique identifies spatial natural fractures, faults, and other structural features up to 100 ft from the wellbore  this technology in combination with advanced cuttings and gas analysis helped identify and avoid faults, as well as target natural fractures for greater productivity and maximized economic return in several us basins  the analysis of field data suggests that geomechanical, petrophysical, and geochemistry data should be reviewed holistically  the post treatment analysis reveals a direct correlation of microseismic activity with the density of natural fractures obtained from dswi processing  the strong correlation between surface treating pressure, breakdown pressure, and the fracture intensity was also observed  this information allows characterization of complex fracture networks, qualification of near-wellbore tortuosity, and estimation and modification of the hydraulic fracture design prior to the stimulation treatment  the intervals with lower horizontal stress and higher brittleness indexes are treated with lower pressure, and achieve the target pumping rates significantly faster than "ductile" stages  case studies demonstrate up to 45% production increase compared to offset wells    as opposed to geometric stage placement, the suggested integrated completion strategy ensures targeted stimulation with the optimum reservoir contact at the maximum operational efficiency  advanced formation evaluation techniques provide insight to mitigate risk and reduce uncertainty, therefore maximizing return on investment in multi-stage completions | 
188938-ms 	 comparison of the diagenetic and reservoir quality evolution between the anticline crest and flank of an upper jurassic carbonate reservoir, abu dhabi, united arab emirates |abstract   this petrographic, stable isotopic and fluid inclusion microthermometric study revealed that the diagenetic and related reservoir quality evolution of the upper jurassic limestones across the studied field onshore abu dhabi, uae, occurred during three phases, including: (i) near-surface to burial diagenesis, during which reservoir quality across the field was either deteriorated or preserved by calcite cementation presumably derived from marine or evolved marine pore waters  improvement of reservoir quality was due to the formation of micropores by micritization of ooids and skeletal fragments and moldic/intragranular pores by subsequent dissolution of the peloids  (ii) obduction of oman ophiolites and formation of the anticline, which included gas migration and cementation of the crest and flank limestones by saddle dolomite and coarse calcite spar  high homogenization temperatures and salinity of the fluid inclusions, negative <u+03b4>18ovpdb values, saddle shape of dolomite, and the presence of exotic cements suggest that these carbonates were formed by flux of hot basinal brines, possibly related to the tectonic compression event  (iii) rapid subsidence subsequent to the obduction, which resulted in extensive stylolitization and cementation by calcite  this calcite cement occluded most of the remaining pores of the flank limestones (water zone)  the results suggest that gas emplacement: (i) halts deep-burial diagenesis but less diagenesis related to flux of hot basinal brines, and (ii) accounts for the better carbonate reservoir quality in the crest than flanks of the anticline  these findings, which have important implications for the fluid flow and hydrocarbon migration, relates for first time diagenesis and reservoir quality evolution to the burial and tectonic events of foreland basins in the arabian gulf area | 
188944-ms 	 link between microporous limestones and elastic properties in tight carbonates  a case study from the lower arab formation upper jurassic, onshore united arab emirates |abstract   the lower arab d member (kimmeridgian) in onshore uae is typically characterised by a thick succession of homogeneous mudstones with local cm-scale interbedded bivalve-rich floatstones, which are thought to have been deposited in a low-energy mid-ramp setting  this sedimentological unit is located at the base of a sour gas reservoir that includes the oolitic grainstones of the upper arab d member    the pore system in these micritic deposits is dominated by matrix-hosted microporosity, along with open to partially cemented fractures, primary intraparticle macropores and rare biomoulds in the shell beds, hence a poor to very good porosity and extremely poor to rarely excellent permeability  variations in porosity and permeability values appear to be strongly related to variations in the micritic fabric: both porosity and permeability increase when the micritic fabric evolves from anhedral compact with coalescent intercrystalline contacts (associated with very little and poorly connected micropores) to subrounded with facial to subpunctic intercrystalline contacts (with locally well-developed micropores)  micritic fabrics also clearly impact the elastic properties of the rock  through analysis of elastic moduli calculated from standard density, and shear/compressional sonic wireline logs, the relationship between micritic fabric, porosity, permeability and geomechanical properties has been explored  with the evolution of micritic fabric from anhedral compact to subrounded, young's modulus decreases with increasing porosity and permeability, indicating a decrease in the overall stiffness of the mudstones  the implication of this observation is fundamental for the development of natural fractures within the arab d, which are used as conduits for the vertical fluid flow  indeed, stylolites with associated partially cemented tension gashes are commonly observed at the rheological boundaries, providing further secondary macroporosity and permeability anisotropy within the reservoir    in this study, the observed link between micritic fabrics, log-derived porosity and elastic moduli within cored intervals has been used to predict micron-scale micritic fabric distribution in uncored wells from wireline logs only |

189070-ms 	 overpressure analysis in hpht environments: lessons learned from the central north sea |abstract   the uncertainties of overpressure estimation are among the major challenges to the development of deep and hot reservoirs in many sedimentary basins especially with regards to drilling safety and well economics  however, because of the anticipated huge economic benefits of hpht geological environments, stakeholders in the oil and gas industry consistently seek to have a good understanding of subsurface pressure systems in order to promote safe and sustainable investments therein  accordingly, information is required to improve the regional knowledge of geopressures and for the calibration of functions aimed at optimising pre-drill pore pressure estimates for future wells  the central north sea, with its vast number of hpht wells, pressure data, drilling information and documented operational experiences in exploration, drilling, development and production activities stands in a good stead as a "geopressure laboratory" for the fine-tuning of pore pressure prediction concepts, improvement of current geopressure practices and ultimately guide investment and operational decisions in the unexplored areas of the basin itself and elsewhere as geological realities could permit  for this reason, this study utilised downhole pressure-related data and wireline logs to evaluate the pressure regimes in the central north sea  the approach involved the quantification of overpressures using standard pore pressure prediction methods that make use of the density and velocity logs of mudstones  the results show that the estimated pore pressure profiles are consistent with measured pressure data in the cenozoic formations, which makes it reasonable to assume that disequilibrium compaction is the cause of overpressure in this shallow section of the wells  going deeper into the wells, within the sub-chalk section, typical calibration parameters from log data could not be used to achieve reliable estimates of overpressures as was the case in the cenozoic section  remarkably, while it is possible to adjust the eaton exponents in order to match estimates with measured data, a wide range of exponent values of between 4 0 and 7 0 is however required  the implication is that there is no systematic variation of the eaton exponents with the amount of overpressure or depth of burial of the sub-chalk strata | 
189113-ms 	 an unconventional approach to gas injection - a niger delta field case study |abstract   the use of gas injection and storage approach in enhanced oil recovery (eor) is receiving increasing attention as an efficient solution to mitigate the effects of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere, improve production by means of increasing static reservoir pressure, and allow optimized utilization of produced hydrocarbons as a function of actual consumption    during gas injection a geological trap (i e  active or abandoned reservoir) is used to store excess gas that can be eventually produced for future utilization  this process generates changes in pore pressure within the rock's porous space, affecting simultaneously the state of stress inside the reservoir and in its surroundings  these changes of the state of stress can be at the origin of instability mechanisms associated with fracturing inside and outside the reservoir and of reactivation of existing discontinuities (faults and fractures)  if reactivation occurs within the caprock, this could lead to possible reservoir sealing failure and thus leakage of the stored gas at surface  therefore, deformation of caprock and fault integrity must be assessed to properly manage containment performance and leakage-related risks  given the intrinsic 3d nature of the problem, to ascertain the feasibility of injecting and/or re-injecting natural gas back into producing formations, it is essential to perform numerical simulations to capture the link between concomitant pressurization and /or depletion  the modelling is done with a 3d reservoir simulator and in-situ stresses changes are obtained by means of a 3d coupled reservoir geomechanics simulator    a feasibility study of gas injection and storage in a producing reservoir was performed using coupled geomechanics modeling within an e&p software platform  the process started from single-well geomechanics analysis and then passed through 3d structural characterization and properties modeling, in-situ preproduction stress modeling, dynamic simulation, and, finally, injection modeling  analyses were carried out using injection pressure modeled dynamically in an industry-standard reservoir simulator  this allowed various injection scenarios to be explored, providing a 4d characterization at various time steps in the future of the state of stress within the reservoir and its surroundings  results highlighted the main risks, which are related to loss of sealing for the caprock and reactivation of induced faults, as well as uncertainties associated with input parameters | 
189118-ms 	 prediction of sand production from oil and gas reservoirs in the niger delta using support vector machines svms: a binary classification approach |abstract   sand production is one of the critical research subjects in the petroleum industry  in the oil and gas industry, the production of sand particles associated with the reservoir hydrocarbons has become one of the most common problems a well may experience during reservoir lifetime    sand production occurs in many fields across the world  this is easily seen in wells in the niger delta, gulf of mexico, oman, canada, venezuela, indonesia, egypt, trinidad and myriads of other places prolific to sanding  managing sand production and ultimately its control in the oil and gas industry has been more or less a recurring problem  to fully understand the nature of sanding in an ingenuous way for sand control strategy, it is necessary to predict the conditions at which sanding occurs  because so much have not been done in the implementation of the support vector machines for the prediction of the sanding onset in petroleum reservoirs, we are, for the first time, applying a robust approach, a binary classification problem approach for the prediction of sanding onset in petroleum reservoirs in the niger delta region  by and large, for the first time, the support vector machines (svms) classification approach, is used to identify whether sand will be produced or not in a hydrocarbon reservoir  the model presented in this paper takes into account different parameters (rock, fluid, geotechnical and other data) that may play a role in sanding  the performance of the proposed svm model is verified using field data    it is shown that the developed model can accurately predict the sand production in actual field conditions  the results of this study indicate that the implementation of svm methodology can effectively help engineers to make a proactive sand control plan with insignificant impairment to hydrocarbon production from subsurface reservoirs | 
189128-ms 	 effective real-time pore pressure monitoring using well events: case study of deepwater west africa - nigeria |abstract   geomechanical related drilling problems have always been the major cause of geologic non-productive time (gnpt) in drilling operations (complex and conventional wells) especially in deepwater basins, where billions of dollars are being spent while searching for solutions to drilling problems and developing remediation plans  thus, real-time pore pressure monitoring is critical to ensuring safe and successful drilling operations  typically, the only information available to the drilling engineer prior to well spudding are offset wells and predrill models (1d or 3d) built from offset wells data and other sources (regional, sub-regional, seismic etc ) and no two (2) wells are ever the same in terms of behavior, then the need for real time pore pressure (pp), fracture gradient (fg) and wellbore stability (wbs) monitoring in ground-truthing and calibrating the predrill model cannot be overemphasized  this paper describes how modern technology, innovative approaches, monitoring well behavior and effective communication helped in meeting the challenges of real time pore pressure and fracture gradient surveillance while drilling in environments with very narrow drilling mud weight windows, and where there is limited information on the formation pore pressure, subsurface rock properties, in-situ stresses and basins with little to no offset well information  integration of multiple data sets [appropriate logging while drilling data (lwd), drill cuttings, drilling parameters, gas in mud, equivalent circulating density (ecd) and equivalent static density (esd)] and well behavior/events to support and calibrate predrill petrophysical log-based pore pressure prediction models significantly aided in drilling two complex wells safely and successfully to the target reservoirs in cost effective manner in the study area  mechanical cavings and reamer affected cuttings were easily differentiated from normal drill cuttings, and potential kick predicted even in the absence of pipe connection gas; where there is no sign of underbalanced drilling using predrill pore pressure/ fracture gradient/wellbore stability (ppfg/wbs) petrophysical logs-based model  the model formed the basis for the critical drilling operations decisions taken in these case studies; mud weight increase, setting intermediate casing shallower than planned, and well deepening  factors such as abnormal high rate of penetration (rop), drilling mud properties, high temperature, salinity and calcite cementation affect petrophysical data, thus relying only on the logging while drilling (lwd) data such as gamma ray, resistivity, and sonic logs for real-time pore pressure and fracture gradient analysis, especially when drilling deep wells is not recommended  the innovative approaches presented in this paper via its workflow compensate for potential limitations of lwd data | 
189135-ms 	 performance analysis of gas cycling operation in retrograde gas condensate reservoir- a niger delta case study |abstract   retrograde gas condensate reservoirs are economically valuable assets but constitute a complex system in its management and development  condensate banking due to liquid condensation below the dew point pressure raises technical and economic concerns in unlocking reservoir potentials  as pressure decreases with production below the dew point, liquid drop out phenomena is inevitable  this has two major consequences for an operator  first, the condensation of liquid/condensates which are immobile and remains trapped in the reservoir pores due to capillary-induced interfacial tension creates a permanent formation damage/impairment signified by a reduction in gas relative permeability and productivity  secondly, the bulk of heavier and valuable components are lost to the pores of the reservoir rock  in this study, the interactions among fluid flow and reservoir rock properties were integrated in modeling and simulation of a retrograde gas condensate reservoir undergoing gas cycling  economic evaluations based on reservoir performance indicate that, with gas cycling, a 70% and 90% recovery in condensate and gas respectively with an internal rate of return (irr) of 41% is feasible |

189177-ms 	 use of petro-elastic analysis to evaluate potential for sand production in petroleum reservoirs |abstract   sandstone formations that have potential to produce sand during the life of the well account for a significant fraction of global recoverable volumes of oil and gas resources  the economics, environmental and safety implications of sand problems are critical enough to justify good knowledge of the potential for sand failure and production  reliable evaluation of potential sand production is required to identify the needs for and the specification of sand-exclusion equipment during the project execution phase    to address these challenges, this paper presents a simple workflow that is premised on the petro-elasticity of the formation  specifically, the proposed workflow uses cross plots of compressional sonic logs and density logs on reservoir-by-reservoir and well-by-well basis  from a petro-elastic standpoint, compressional sonic logs contain information on travel time required for sound waves to travel through the subject formation  the fundamental relationship between formation compaction (strength) and porosity has been explored to establish the trend of compaction, hence vulnerability of a sandstone formation to failure    in illustrating the applicability of the proposed concepts and workflow, some field examples from the niger delta are presented  using wells with known history of sand failure and production, the workflow has been applied retroactively  the methodology presented is very useful for establishment of a quick screening sand control requirement  from a qualitative standpoint, it is found that the performances of the proposed workflow are in reasonable agreement with the history of sand failure and production in the example wells | 
189199-ms 	 a novel integrated numerical simulation scheme for transient gas flow in shale matrix |abstract   the gas flow in shale matrix is of great research interest for optimizing shale gas reservoir development  due to a nano-scale pore radius, the gas flow in the shale matrix may fall in flow regimes which include viscous flow, slip flow and knudsen diffusion  on top of that, the adsorbed and free gas is stored in nano-scale organic pores  the gas molecules are attached as a monolayer to pore walls to form a film of gas which is the thickness of the adsorbed layer  when a reservoir is depleted, the attached gas molecules will be released so that the radius of organic pores in which the free gas flows is changeable  thus a sorption-dependent radius will be introduced to the apparent permeability which represents the flow regimes  stress sensitivity will also be investigated via a two-way coupling geomechanics process  in this paper, we introduce a novel integrated numerical simulation scheme to quantify the above phenomena which is crucial for the shale gas reservoir development    instead of darcy's equation, we implement the sorption-dependent apparent permeability in the continuity equation to depict the gas flow (viscous flow, slip flow and knudsen diffusion) in shale matrix  the methodology which was developed by vasina et al  and validated through comparing with molecular simulation will be implemented to determine the thickness of an adsorbed layer at each time step  the langmuir adsorption/desorption term is included in the continuity equation as an accumulation term  in addition, lab data for a bakken reservoir which provides a relationship between a matrix pore radius reduction and the effective stress is integrated into the two-way coupling geomechanical process to simulate a stress-sensitive shale formation    this methodology examines the influence of each mechanism for the shale gas flow in the matrix  overall, the sorption-dependent apparent permeability is smaller than the sorption-independent apparent permeability, which leads to the pressure maintenance for the sorption-dependent apparent permeability case  the sorption-dependent apparent permeability will lead to additional heterogeneity  the apparent permeability near a wellbore is bigger than the one far away from the wellbore, which causes the pressure transmit more easily around the production side  with the consideration of geomechanics, the apparent permeability is decreased due to the compaction of a nano-scale pore radius, which leads to the maintenance of reservoir pressure  due to the difference of compaction magnitude for each grid block, geomechanics also creates additional heterogeneity for a nano-pore network in shale matrix, which we should pay more attention to    the sorption-dependent radius is incorporated into the apparent permeability model to depict the sorption-dependent apparent permeability of shale matrix  we provide a novel integrated methodology to quantify the crucial transient phenomena in the shale matrix, which includes flow regimes, gas adsorption/desorption and stress sensitivity | 
189205-ms 	 decline curve analysis for production forecasting based on machine learning |abstract   a new method is developed by using machine learning technique to forecast single well production in both conventional and unconventional reservoirs  unlike investigating and analyzing existing wells production rate and decline curve, this method predicts new well production rate according to reservoir properties such as matrix permeability, porosity, formation pressure and temperature, as well as hydraulic fracture parameters including fracture half length, fracture width and fracture conductivity    in this paper, an inversion scheme is coupled with decline curve model, logistic growth model (lgm), to obtain a set of decline curve parameters by fitting with production data  both the principal component analysis (pca) and sensitivity study are applied to analyze the variance and identify key factors that influence production rate from reservoir and hydraulic fracture parameters  the sensitivity analysis results and scree plot from pca serve as references to select key factors  lastly, neural network (nn) technology is applied to investigate the pattern and correlation of selected reservoir and hydraulic fracture parameters and decline curve parameters  therefore, the nn model can be applied to forecast production rate for a new well according to given reservoir and hydraulic information    there is a good agreement between the available production data and decline curve model predicated production data based on the inverted decline curve model parameters  the scree plot and bi-plot generated by pca provide the weight percentage of each component and help to identify factors that should be considered  field production data is used to verify the feasibility of this method  this field case study is conducted by fitting the predicted production data (decline curve) based on nn model with field production data  the mean squared estimation (mse) of nn model is 0 013 mscf/d and the overall r value is 0 917  this indicates that nn model is reliable to study the dataset and provide proper production (decline curve) prediction  the results illustrate that the predicted production data (decline curve) has good accuracy    this paper proposes a statistical way for production forecasting based on machine learning  instead of forecasting future production of existing wells, it provides meaningful reference for the evaluation of a new well and decision making | 
189213-ms 	 the 7 sins of managing acoustic sand monitoring systems |abstract   it is a common misconception, upon installation of an acoustic sand monitoring system, that the acoustic systems should provide an accurate measurement of sand volumes and that all sand detection issues are immediately solved  the truth is there is more to that than just installing a piece of equipment and hoping that it would provide us a crystal ball insight to the sand produced  therefore, the aim of this paper is to share the top 7 learnings our asset has experienced on managing acoustic sand monitoring systems    the 7 sins that would be discussed are: |knowing if it is sand and underestimating external noise   lack of continuous calibration of the acoustic systems   trusting solely the calculated sand volumes   lack of data correlation with other available field data   understanding trends from acoustic systems does not happen overnight, practice makes perfect   not acknowledging undetected sand (fines)   not realising that acoustic systems are just a small part of the bigger sand management picture |in each learning, field example cases will be presented where both positive and negative results will be described and discussed  this paper will touch upon the agreed sand management philosophy and procedures and how it has worked out for us so far  the philosophy we have adapted into the asset considers the field as a matured asset, showcasing a multidisciplinary approach    this paper will be concluded with future work moving forward on how we can perform better with our existing knowledge on the acoustic sand monitoring systems | 
189216-ms 	 stress dependent capillary dominated flow in matrix around hydraulic fractures in shale reservoirs and its impact on well deliverability |abstract   understanding the mechanisms of fluid flow in unconventional shale reservoirs is of great interest as these mechanisms have significant impacts on long term economic development of such reservoirs  in shale rocks, the average size of pore/throat is much smaller than the average pore size in conventional rocks which results in higher capillary pressures  such high capillary pressures can strongly influence the two-phase flow specifically around the wellbore by preventing the fluid flow from matrix to hydraulic fractures and resulting in liquid holdup  in addition, the pronounced poroelastic properties of shale matrix make the flow properties to be extremely sensitive to the effective stress  as a result, the production rate and well deliverability of shale reservoirs can be severely affected by stress dependent capillary pressure around the wellbore area while this impact has not been investigated yet  in this study, a numerical approach was adapted to solve the analytical formulation of two-phase flow considering the capillary and viscous forces in matrix around hydraulic fractures  to evaluate the integrity of the simulation results, the predicted liquid saturation profiles were compared with some experimental data reported in the literature where liquid saturation profiles were measured by ct scanner under both viscous and capillary dominated flow conditions  then, the two phase flow in tight formations were simulated and the obtained liquid saturation profiles were used to estimate the equivalent relative permeability curves at different stress conditions  the results showed that the liquid holdup in the matrix around the hydraulic fractures can be accumulated even up to a meter that significantly reduces the relative permeability values in this zone  this liquid holdup (or capillary end effects) depends on several parameters including effective stress applied to the formations  in addition, the effects of viscous forces on liquid holdup were investigated in terms of fluid velocity  it is found that, a higher fluid velocity(or flow rate) which can be achieved by increasing drawdown pressure (reduction of bottom hole pressure) can cause a significant damage to the matrix permeability around the hydraulic fractures  this damage also adversely affects flow and can promote the capillary dominated flow  the results of this study improve our understanding of flow mechanisms in unconventional reservoir rocks  this knowledge is required for shale reservoir simulation and cost effective production from hydraulic fractured wells in shale reservoirs |

189279-stu 	 a robust finite element simulator for black-oil and fully compositional compressible flow in hydrocarbon reservoirs |abstract   we present a unified numerical simulator for reservoir engineering problems of the highest complexity: fully compositional and black-oil, three-phase, compressible flow on three-dimensional unstructured grid    in the context of black-oil modeling, where hydrocarbon components are lumped into a gas and an oil component with only the gas component being allowed to transfer between oil and gas phases, study cases may involve treating a variable bubble point pressure throughout the reservoir (e g , in water flooding into saturated reservoirs, or introducing gas into an undersaturated grid cell)  traditionally, a primary variable switching strategy for phase appearance or disappearance has been proposed, which inherits convergence and phase identification issues  in this study, we adopt an overall molar composition-based framework that can self-consistently take care of such complications  we compute the black-oil properties from tables initially constructed through fully compositional phase split calculations  phase properties across a broad range of pressures for different black-oil compositions are interpolated to correctly model the transitions between saturated and undersaturated states  while maintaining the accuracy, we are able to gain considerable speed-up in black-oil model -more pronounced in saturated reservoirs- as compared to the fully compositional model    in addition, previous black-oil models are mostly limited to low order numerical schemes  here finite element (fe) methods are adopted, which are well suited to parallelization and provide flexibility in discretizing the geometry  mass transport is updated explicitly by a locally mass conserving discontinuous galerkin method  globally continuous pressure and velocity fields are obtained through an implicit mixed hybrid fe scheme  the robustness and accuracy of our fe simulator are demonstrated in several complex problems, where we have attained considerable speed-up and maintained the accuracy by means of the new black-oil model, specifically for phase split computations | 
189282-stu 	 an enhanced pseudo-3d model of hydraulic fracture in multi-layered formation |abstract   the manuscript presents the development of hydraulic fracturing simulation tool based on cell-based pseudo-3d model  the model was upgraded up to enhanced p3d model that accounts for viscous dissipation in lateral growth implicitly  in addition to p3d model enhancement the aim of present paper is to explore crucial effects and processes taking place during hydraulic fracturing simulation: proppant particles settling, tip-screen out, interaction between several fractures in multi-stage treatment  to achieve the goal we developed the mathematical model that is able to simulate the fracture growth in highly non-uniform geological lithology, the flow of non-newtonian liquid and proppant particles in the fracture channel, interaction between fractures  all of these effects are investigated separately, the impact of each process on the fracture shape is discussed, possible solutions are suggested | 
189289-stu 	 a new approach for predicting drillstring vibration impact on wellbore stability |abstract   many studies attributed wellbore instability problems to physical and chemical interactions between rocks and drilling fluids; however the impact of drillstring vibration was neglected  this study aims to investigate the effect of drillstring vibration on wellbore stability; and determine major factors lead to drillstring collision with wellbore    drillstring vibration mechanisms are reviewed and correlated with wellbore instability field case to identify type of drillstring vibration responsible for wellbore failure  then, drillstring equations of motion are solved utilizing runga-kutta numerical scheme; and sensitivity analysis is done to assess the effect of each variable (inputs) on drillstring radial displacement  moreover, new model is developed to predict critical ranges of drillstring vibration that collapse wellbore  model bases on rock mechanics principles, whirl vibration mechanism and newton second law    results show a direct relation between whirl vibration initiation and wellbore instability; however axial and torsional vibrations have negligible effect  wellbore failures resulted from drillstring vibration are more likely to happen in small hole sizes (6 in) than bigger holes  drill collar length and drillstring revolutions per minutes are the primary factors aggravate drillstring collision with wellbore, while wellbore inclination and mud weight have minor impact  when drillstring vibrates and hits wellbore wall, hole collapse happens due rock compressive failure, rock fatigue, and reduction in rock strength  the innovated model estimates values of drillstring accelerations that collapse wellbore, and predicts optimum mud weight needed for safe drilling before and after reduction in rock strength due to drillstring vibration    research findings reduce risks of wellbore collapse and drillstring failure resulted from drillstring vibration by: presenting recommendations in drillstring design and drilling optimization; and utilizing model outputs to compute critical limits of drillstring vibration and optimum mud weight to prevent drillstring collision with wellbore | 
189436-pa 	 history matching of stimulated reservoir volume of shale-gas reservoirs using an iterative ensemble smoother |summary |economic production from shale-gas reservoirs typically relies on the drilling of horizontal wells and hydraulic fracturing in multiple stages  in addition to the creation of hydraulic fractures, hydraulic-fracturing treatment can also reopen existing natural fractures, which can create a complex-fracture network  the area that is covered by the fracture network is usually termed the stimulated reservoir volume (srv), and the spatial extent and properties of the srv are crucial for shale-gas-production behavior  in this work, we propose a method for history matching of the srv of shale-gas reservoirs using production data  for each hydraulic-fracturing stage, the fracture network is parameterized with one major fracture of the hydraulic fractures and the srv that represents minor hydraulic fractures and reopened natural fractures  the major fracture is modeled explicitly, whereas the srv is modeled by the dual-permeability/dual-porosity (dp/dp) model  moreover, the spatial extent of the srv is parameterized by the level-set-function values on a predefined representing-node system  after parameterization, an iterative ensemble smoother is used to perform history matching  both single-stage-fracturing cases and multistage-fracturing cases are set up to test the performance of the proposed method  numerical results demonstrate that by use of the proposed method, the srv can be well-recognized by assimilating production data | 
189440-pa 	 development of a powerful data-analysis tool using nonparametric smoothing models to identify drillsites in tight shale reservoirs with high economic potential |summary |the oil-and-gas industry is entering an era of “big data” because of the huge number of wells drilled with the rapid development of unconventional oil-and-gas reservoirs during the past decade  the massive amount of data generated presents a great opportunity for the industry to use data-analysis tools to help make informed decisions  the main challenge is the lack of the application of effective and efficient data-analysis tools to analyze and extract useful information for the decision-making process from the enormous amount of data available  in developing tight shale reservoirs, it is critical to have an optimal drilling strategy, thereby minimizing the risk of drilling in areas that would result in low-yield wells  the objective of this study is to develop an effective data-analysis tool capable of dealing with big and complicated data sets to identify hot zones in tight shale reservoirs with the potential to yield highly productive wells  the proposed tool is developed on the basis of nonparametric smoothing models, which are superior to the traditional multiple-linear-regression (mlr) models in both the predictive power and the ability to deal with nonlinear, higher-order variable interactions  this data-analysis tool is capable of handling one response variable and multiple predictor variables  to validate our tool, we used two real data sets—one with 249 tight oil horizontal wells from the middle bakken and the other with 2,064 shale gas horizontal wells from the marcellus shale  results from the two case studies revealed that our tool not only can achieve much better predictive power than the traditional mlr models on identifying hot zones in the tight shale reservoirs but also can provide guidance on developing the optimal drilling and completion strategies (e g , well length and depth, amount of proppant and water injected)  by comparing results from the two data sets, we found that our tool can achieve model performance with the big data set (2,064 marcellus wells) with only four predictor variables that is similar to that with the small data set (249 bakken wells) with six predictor variables  this implies that, for big data sets, even with a limited number of available predictor variables, our tool can still be very effective in identifying hot zones that would yield highly productive wells  the data sets that we have access to in this study contain very limited completion, geological, and petrophysical information  results from this study clearly demonstrated that the data-analysis tool is certainly powerful and flexible enough to take advantage of any additional engineering and geology data to allow the operators to gain insights on the impact of these factors on well performance |

191287-ms 	 fracture evaluation & design system (feds): integration of nodal analysis with frac model to better predict post frac production |abstract |a workflow is presented in this study named fracture evaluation & design system (feds) that couples established technique of nodal analysis (well performance evaluation) and quasi-3d (type of pseudo-3d) hydraulic frac models  this methodology of hydraulic frac simulation is more robust in predicting post-frac production rates from fractured wells specifically in unconventional reservoirs like shales and has several advantages over utilizing frac models in isolation  the results from feds are compared with commercial frac simulators and discrepancies are noted  this workflow is divided in two segments, flow in frac (or reservoir) and flow in wellbore  the frac element is calculated through quasi-3d frac model, a published hydraulic frac model that calculates frac geometry (frac length, width & height) in asymmetric multilayer formations such as pakistan’s shales  this calculation is used to estimate the dimensionless fracture conductivity (fcd) which is a measure of effectiveness of the frac  these calculations are combined with reservoir parameters such as pressure, permeability and skin to generate deliverability profile or inflow performance relationship (ipr)  this ipr generated from calculated fracture geometry & conductivity inherently accounts for uncertainty of formation stresses, frac height implications, effect of permeability variation etc  this is a numerically calculated ipr, while fracture growth is being modelled; ipr is constantly updated based on fracture model results in a fully coupled setting  second element of wellbore hydraulics or vertical lift performance (vlp) is calculated using several published correlations such as gray et al  the idea behind incorporating vlp in frac simulation is to model effects of water holdup, slippage, multiphase flow etc  most commercial frac simulators utilize correlations of fcd to estimate post frac production, such as cinco-ley et al correlation  however, often production at surface is hampered due to wellbore effects such as water slippage  this is one of the major reason, despite having reliable input data, design post frac profile is much higher than realized production  the working of this workflow is validated by applying on two field fracture treatments  one of this treatment is in conventional sandstone reservoir while other is unconventional  the design & post frac production prediction is conducted in published frac models (that are used by commercial simulators) and using quasi-3d frac model in feds  in all cases, production predicted by feds is significantly lower than commercial simulators  main frac treatment is conducted as per design in these two reservoirs and actual post frac production is measured  the instantaneous gas production from both reservoirs is in better agreement with production predicted by feds validating the calculations of this workflow | 
2017-0004 	 understanding the role of reservoir dilation on solvent assisted sagd (sa-sagd) performance in oil sands reservoirs; a semi-analytical study  |abstract: solvent steam co-injection in oil sands reservoirs is generally understood to be superior to sagd in terms of oil recovery rate, ultimate oil recovery and steam oil ratio  in solvent assisted sagd (sa-sagd), the combination of temperature distribution and solvent concentration profiles ahead of the steam chamber edge reduces the virgin bitumen viscosity and therefore has major control over oil drainage rate in the mobile zone  recent coupled reservoir-geomechanical simulation results from abbasi asl and chalaturnyk (2016) revealed that these profiles could be significantly influenced by the shear dilation/volume change that is induced around the chamber edge  a complete understanding of the interplay between solvent transport, heat transfer, solvent-oil phase behavior and shear induced volume change and associated sensitivities requires an analytical study which is currently lacking in the literature   this research presents the result of a semi-analytical study to examine the conditions under which the induced volume change beyond the steam chamber edge could impact sa-sagd performance and process design such as: optimum solvent selection and required injection volumes  simplifications had to be made in order to allow us to solve the complex interaction of energy, mass transfer and rock property alterations around the steam chamber edge, while preserving the fundamental physics   single component solvent co-injection cases were considered and the corresponding phase behavior calculations were performed to yield solvent concentration and temperature at the steam chamber edge  assuming 1-d heat conduction and pressure diffusion perpendicular to the interface, stress and volume changes were calculated beyond the chamber edge  the resulting enhancements in compressibility and effective permeability were consequently utilized to account for the heat convection and solvent dispersion, generating the ultimate temperature and solvent concentration profiles  darcy’s law and mass balance were eventually applied to derive oil drainage rate  sensitivity analyses were performed on injection pressure and solvent molar concentrations at the edge   the semi-analytical modeling results demonstrated case studies where geomechanically induced volume changes improved effective permeability, convective heat transfer and solvent dispersion inside the mobile zone  consequently, oil drainage rate was improved and it was found out that optimum injection scenarios shifted towards solvents with reduced concentrations  it was also shown that geomechanical processes favor heavier solvents  these findings have significant implications with regards to the economy of the process  this modeling approach provides us with an inexpensive tool to identify the reservoir and operational conditions where sa-sagd performance could be heavily influenced by geomechanics | 
2017-0008 	 a new model for failure and yield envelopes of anisotropic porous sandstone |abstract: the objective of this paper is to provide an overview of a new data-based approach to understanding and modeling strength anisotropy in porous sandstone with potential application to a wider range of geomaterials  the rationale for the contribution is the interest in quantifying the impact of mechanical anisotropy in practical industrial applications such as the prediction of mechanical behavior of hydrocarbon reservoirs during depletion or injection  the onset of yielding can have profound impact on flow and elastic properties, and it is still unclear to what extent anisotropy may affect those predictions  after recalling an extensive mechanical data set obtained previously on samples of rothbach sandstone, we define our modeling strategy using other experimental and theoretical work from the literature  this results in the necessity of determining what an appropriate isotropic yield envelope might be  we propose an approach whereby isotropic and anisotropic models are defined and parametrized sequentially  we obtain a consistent framework where the microstructural controls on strength, including anisotropy, may be understood better than previously, allowing the revisiting of legacy data sets as well as the designing of better informed geomechanical testing programs in core analysis   1  introduction  mechanical anisotropy is known to adversely affect strength predictions, especially when associated with the presence of weak layers [1-3], which can result in unexpected borehole failure  in homogeneous materials, anisotropy has been showed to directly affect the shape of yield surfaces [4-7] and can also cause the strain field to be oblique to the macroscopic stress tensor  in this latter case, an important question to be answered is to what extent mechanical anisotropy should be incorporated into geomechanical models, and how does it ultimately compare with work that has been done on the effect of true triaxial states of stress [8]   the present paper builds on an extended petrophysical and mechanical data set that was acquired over the years in the rothbach sandstone, a triassic 20% porosity cross-bedded fluvial sandstone belonging to the buntsandstein formation in northern europe [4; 9-16]  the rothbach sandstone is anisotropic with respect to key physical properties such as permeability, acoustic velocities and mechanical strength  as far as mechanical strength is concerned, this sandstone presents the particularity of being stronger when loaded perpendicular to the bedding, and its bedding plane does not appear to constitute a plane of weakness when favorably oriented with respect to the maximum compressive stress  samples cored at 45 degrees to the bedding exhibit intermediate strength with respect to the ones cored parallel and perpendicular to it [4] | 
2017-0009 	 improving hard rock pillar design by including rock mass classification and failure mechanisms |abstract: the limitations of the current pillar strength formulas, empirical design charts, and continuum numerical modelling is that these methods do not consider discontinuity driven failure mechanisms (i e  jointing at critical angles)  strength formulas have been very effective within the coal industry because they have a better representation of the rock mass strength (sample sizes > standard sizes) and large databases of case histories providing sufficient statistical representation of both stable and failed cases  additionally, coal pillars generally have larger width to height ratio (>1) which decreases the influence of through going structure  this is opposite for hard rock mine where the width to height ratio is generally <2 and as small as 0 3, were structure can have a major influence on the stability  additionally, the small size of hard rock unconfined compressive strength samples does not represent the strength of the rock mass, without additional considerations  therefore, an improved strength formula is proposed that includes the influences of rock mass strength and discontinuities  this proposed strength formula, and its associated factors (length effect, and discontinuity dip and properties) can be used to create site specific empirical design charts   1  introduction  following the coalbrook colliery pillar collapse disaster in 1960, there has been an increased need to improve pillar design  since the disaster, many authors have contributed to developing/improving strength formulas (eq  1) and empirical design charts  martin and maybee (2000) and oke and kalenchuk (2017) provide excellent summaries of these empirical strength formulas and design charts  martin and maybee (2000) also provide some insight on pillar strength through their result of continuum numerical modelling however, these methods, do not consider specific failure mechanisms (i e  structural vs  stress) or do not have the same failure definition (i e  functional/serviceability vs  collapse)  the need to consider structural failure mechanisms was addressed in a strength formula for limestone pillars (esterhuizen et  al 2008a), but the empirically based procedure is applicable to limestone mines in the united states only (based on the dataset)  continuum numerical modelling can capture structural failure mechanisms by ubiquitous joint constitutive behaviour, however, individual governing structures (e g  discrete joints) are not explicitly simulated  continuum models can provide insight into the amount of expected yield  depending on the amount (depth) of yield, the pillar may be expected to collapse or it may be expected to meet serviceability thresholds  even though an empirical technique may work for the given case with very similar situations, oke and kalenchuk (2017), and malan and napier (2011)) conclude that neither empirical techniques nor numerical modelling can be used solely to provide a solid basis to predict pillar strength, <u+03c3>p | 
2017-0010 	 selecting the most applicable hard rock pillar design method |abstract: empirical design methods are derived from statistical analysis of observations and the application of these methods is therefore limited to conditions similar to the underlying data base  practitioners must have a full appreciation of an empirical design method’s limitations and the case studies that populate it  when selecting an empirical pillar design method consideration must be given to the type of pillar, the rock type and strength, location (or source) of the dataset, and the method used for analyzing or estimating stress  when empirical observations do not exist for a particular scenario, numerical results may provide insight into pillar behaviour  the focus of this paper will be on the various empirical design charts and equations available in literature, however numerical results will also be shown  the limitations of these methods will be discussed to illustrate the importance of understanding how certain methods were created  this discussion will ultimately provide guidelines to aid practitioners in selecting the most applicable pillar design chart or equation for their specific application  by doing so, the practitioner will also understand the limitations of the selected design chart or equation and can adjust their design factors accordingly   1  introduction  empirical methods are derived from statistical analysis of observations, and the application of these methods is therefore limited to conditions similar to the underlying data base  practitioners must have a full appreciation for empirical design method’s limitations and the case studies that populate it  when it comes to pillar design for underground workings, the current state of practice is still empirical, complemented by numerical models where empirical results are lacking or conditions are too complex  researchers have found that the strength of a pillar is dependent on the slenderness ratio, the pillar width (w) to pillar height (h) ratio  the directions of measure for the width and height dimensions are determined by the orientation of the minor and maximum principal stresses within the pillar |

2017-0028 	 micromechanical modeling of impact of temperature on salt rock creep behavior |abstract: subjected to long-term mechanical and thermal loads, salt rocks where many underground gas storages (ugs) are excavated usually demonstrate strong time-dependent creep behaviors  in this study, the micro-mechanisms of thermal effect on salt creep behavior is investigated in a discrete element method (dem) based micro-mechanism system  a novel hybrid model is proposed to describe the thermal-mechanical-creep behavior  this model combines burger’s model and linear parallel model at the contacts between particles  creep behavior is described by burger’s contact model, while thermal transfer is approached by linear parallel contact model via active thermal pipes  the validation of this dem numerical model is verified by the laboratory creep test, and the model is capable of capturing the development of micro-fractures during creep test subjected to different temperatures  the results indicate that temperature make significant contributions to axial strain rate  the induced thermal cracks account for the higher creep strain rate with elevated temperature in micro-mechanism  incorporation with creep experiments, the dem modeling provides an alternative and promising method to explore the micro-mechanical response to temperature influence, can help us improve the understanding of creep behavior of salt rock in ugs during thermal loading   1  introduction  salt rock in underground cavern is considered as an ideal rock material for natural gas storage due to its favorable creep properties of halite (berest et al  2001; berest et al  2007; zhu and arson 2014)  drilling and completing wells through salt formations leads to technical challenges, and high costs (lao et al  2012)  both of the situations are required to explore or resist long-term creep, induced by stress difference and temperature variation during operations   it is very challenging to predict long-term behavior of rock salt, and many-year operational performance of the ugs (berest and brouard, 2003; cole 2002)  therefore, numerous analytical creep models and experimental work have been conducted to study the creep behaviors, with many affecting factors such as loading rate, temperature, and other complicated in-situ conditions considered  cristescu (1993) developed a general constitutive equation for transient and stationary creep pf rock salt, which can be used for varying stress states  zhou et al  (2010) proposed a creep constitutive model on the basis of time-based fractional derivative to describe the nonlinear creep strain of salt rock  this model replaces a newtonian dashpot in classical nishihara model with the fractional derivative abel dashpot; and the results predicted by this model were in better agreement with experimental data  in other studies, sheinin and blokhin (2012) and wisetsaen et al  (2014) found that the elevated temperature decreases the tensile elastic modulus and increases the creep rate | 
2017-0031 	 fracture-initiation pressure analysis of horizontal well in anisotropic formations |abstract: lost circulation is a classical wellbore instability problem that is encountered during drilling  in order to minimize or avoid lost circulation, the best measure is to prevent the initiation of fracture  however, due to rocks are naturally anisotropic, the classical fracture pressure model is not applicable for anisotropic formations  some researchers had therefore investigated the influence of transverse isotropic material parameters, but the influence of anisotropic tensile strength was ignored  the present work is to propose a novel fracture-initiation pressure model of horizontal well to investigate the influence of anisotropy on fracture-initiation pressure  the present method predicting the fracture-initiation pressure was verified by a laboratory hydraulic fracturing test  the results indicated that both anisotropic modulus and tensile strength have very distinct influence on the fracture-initiation pressure  fracture-initiation pressure declines obviously under the influence of anisotropic modulus and anisotropic tensile strength, thus the anisotropy of modulus and tensile strength cannot be ignored  the present model can provide a more accurate method for the predicting of fracture-initiation pressure for horizontal well in anisotropic formations   1  introduction  due to the exhaustion of conventional petroleum resources, some unconventional petroleum resources, such as tight gas, shale gas, and coal-bed gas, gradually be paid more attention  to develop these unconventional petroleum resources, more and more complicated structure wells, such as directional well, horizontal well, and extended reach well, are used to enlarge the drainage area and enhance oil and gas recovery (ma et al , 2015)  however, drilling horizontal wells usually bring out some new problems, such as wellbore collapse, lost circulation, cuttings transport, the excessive drag and torque (ma and chen, 2015; ma et al , 2015, 2016)  thereinto, lost circulation is a classical wellbore instability problem encountered during drilling (zoback, 2007; fjar et al , 2008; chen et al , 2008; aadnoy and looyeh, 2011), consequently, not only lose a lot of materials and costs, but also increase the non-productive time (npt) | 
2017-0033 	 stress redistribution in stope-and-fill mining operations with respect to cemented paste backfill material |abstract: over the past decade, the mining industry has seen an increase in the application of the stope-and-fill mining method as conventional underground deposits have been depleted and operations have been forced to produce at deeper depths and in more challenging ground conditions  through the utilization of cemented paste backfill (cpb) material for localized ground support, modern stope-and-fill mining operations have been able to increase productivity, effectively manage mine waste costs, as well as provide a safer mining environment  while the application of cpb has allowed for an increase in ore recovery, it is important that engineering and operations personnel have a clear understanding of the fill material as well as the limitations of the fill design to provide the most efficient, cost-effective, and safe extraction of underground reserves  despite extensive use of cpb in mines around the world, many fundamental factors affecting the design of safe and economical fill structures are still not well understood  a critical issue in the design of backfilled stopes is the determination of the stress state within the fill material and surrounding rock mass   recently work has been conducted further investigating stress distributions within engineered fill material as well as the stress interactions between the fill and the rock mass  while these works, as well as past research, have provided a wealth of knowledge on stress developments within the fill material itself, there is much room for further development of a more accurate understanding of the ability and mechanism of which the material is able to redistribute the stress around the excavation and through the fill material  this paper provides and overview of current research with respect to stress distributions for stope-and-fill mining operations and suggests areas in which further research is needed to fully comprehend the effectiveness of this newly developing ground support material   1  introduction & background| 
2017-0037 	 improving a deep metal mining-induced-seismicity catalog using numerical optimization |abstract: in burst-prone mines, seismic monitoring is a central component of risk analysis and mitigation efforts  in order to maximize the effectiveness of such analyses, event magnitude and location errors should be minimized  however, minimizing location errors can be difficult due to unknowns in the geologic media through which the seismic energy propagates  the national institute for occupational safety and health (niosh) is conducting research to improve the quality of the event locations contained in a seismic catalog produced by a surface network monitoring a deep underground silver mine in northern idaho  travel times of several events with relatively well-known locations, as determined by an in-mine network, were modeled using the fast marching method  the nelder-mead simplex method was then employed, in conjunction with global monte carlo sampling, to determine a suitable 1-d layered p-velocity model  using the new model with station delays on the surface network, epicentral location errors were reduced by approximately a factor of three and depth errors were reduced by more than a factor of ten  significantly lower location errors can support higher-quality analyses to help improve safety in deep underground mines  planned development of a 3-d model and additional instrument deployments will further increase location quality   1  introduction  seismic monitoring has been conducted in hardrock mines since the early 1900s, when mining-induced tremors in south africa were recognized as hazards to mine workers and nearby communities (durrheim, 2010)  since that time, monitoring and analysis of mining- induced seismicity (mis, see gibowicz and kijko, 1994, for review) has become an important aspect of ground control strategy for many seismically active mines  seismic event monitoring can be used to identify potentially hazardous geological features (e g,, spottiswoode and milev, 1998), provide information for quantifying and mitigating seismic hazards (potvin, 2009; hudyma and potvin, 2010), relate damage to operational parameters (hodgson and joughin, 1966), and determine failure mechanisms (mcgarr, 1992; trifu et al , 2000), among other important research areas that can have significant impacts on mine safety | 
2017-0042 	 effect of fluid type and composition on changes in reservoir stresses due to production: implications for refracturing |abstract: the effect of different fluid types and compositions on stress changes around fractured production wells has been studied in detail in this work  a compositional reservoir simulator which is fully coupled with geomechanics was used for this study  both mechanical effects due to propped fractures and poroelastic effects due to production are considered while calculating stress changes  it was found that highly compressible, low viscosity fluids such as gases result in a lower stress reversal than lesser compressible fluids such as oils  for a volatile oil, the appearance of gas phase when pressure falls below the bubble point, reduces the stress reorientation as compared to not accounting for phase change and assuming a single hydrocarbon phase  the higher the fraction of the most volatile component, the lower is the resulting stress reversal  similar conclusions are obtained for vertical wells with a single fracture and horizontal wells with multiple fractures  these findings highlight the importance of considering fluid type and composition while designing refracturing jobs based on the modified stress field due to prior production   1  introduction  the key to achieving a successful refracturing treatment is stimulating new reservoir volume that has not been drained effectively  considerable efforts have been made recently to achieve predictable and repeatable results from refracturing due to high decline rates from horizontal wells and low oil prices  some of these include, identifying role of diverting agents (fragachan et al , 2015; leonard et al , 2015), improving candidate well selection (barree et al , 2017) and modifying the design of the refracture based on stress changes  stress changes happen around candidate refrac-wells because of (a) mechanical effects due to propped fractures and (b) poroelastic effects due to prior production from the stimulated rock volume  the in-situ stresses, which govern the subsequent fracture growth during refracturing, are thus modified in both magnitude and direction  it has been well established in both modeling (liu et al , 2008; gupta et al , 2012; weng and siebrits, 2007) and field case studies (wright and connant, 1995; ajani and kelkar, 2012; warpinski and branagan, 1989) that mechanical and poroelastic effects modify the insitu stresses and thus determine the direction and geometry of subsequent fracture growth | 
2017-0047 	 application of response surface methodology to geotechnical parameter estimation in tunneling |abstract: the present study proposes a back analysis method for estimating the geotechnical parameters of the surrounding rock mass in tunneling  this method takes a direct search approach based on a successive response surface method, where the size of the region of interest is adjusted to facilitate a fast convergence of the parameter estimation process  using a software tool developed in this study, the response surface method is combined with a numerical code, flac2d, which has been popularly used in numerical simulations of underground problems  based on a railway tunnel example, the computational accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method are investigated  the back-calculations between the algorithm, which considers the adjustment of the region of interest, and the non-adjustment algorithm are compared to understand how the adjustment affects the back analysis results  in addition, the effect of different locations of measurement points at the tunnel roof and sidewalls on parameter estimation is investigated  the results of these investigations show that the adjustment algorithm can produce better results in computational accuracy and efficiency than the non-adjustment algorithm  back-calculated solutions for different locations of measurement points agree well with the exact solution, suggesting there are no significant differences between converged parameter values   1  introduction  a fundamental element of the observational method in tunneling is the use of monitored data to assess the adequacy of the employed design and to predict the behavior of rock mass during future construction stages  in situ ground movement or convergence of a tunnel is often used as input data to calibrate numerical or analytical models, so that the predicted values of rock mass responses match the corresponding values of measured data  from this calibration, i e , back analysis, the geotechnical parameters of the surrounding rock mass can be estimated  these estimated parameters can be compared with those determined in the design phase or obtained from previous field tests to improve and modify the material properties of the rock mass | 
2017-0048 	 new technique for determining geomechanical properties of highly heterogeneous samples with the help of uniaxial compression stage and micro-computed tomography  |abstract: this study represents a newly developed technique for the determination of geomechanical properties that can find its best application in studies of highly heterogeneous formations like shales  the main purpose of the study was to estimate the technique’s applicability for determining young’s modulus and poisson’s ratio for the set of shale samples, measure geomechanical properties of these samples and the change of these properties due to the heating exposure  a number of laboratory experiments were conducted with the help of uncommon equipment combination: micro-computed tomography scanner, uniaxial compression stage, pyrolysis workstation and special computer software for image processing and analyzing  initial experimental results affirm that it is possible to retrieve static geomechanical properties of very tiny core samples with the designed experimental workflow  this combination of equipment truly allowed us to observe the change in geomechanical properties due to the kerogen decomposition for each of the tested samples  the technique’s applicability was proved by measuring geomechanical properties of shale samples and we also determined the change in geomechanical properties due to the change of toc content in the shale’s samples   1  introduction  the declining rate of conventional oil production and technological development in petroleum industry revealed an enormous interest in unconventional hydrocarbon exploitation from tight formations for petroleum companies  the amount of risked shale oil in-place can be up to 4 times bigger than the amount of conventional oil (kuuskraa et al , 2013) and because of that unconventional resources have a big potential in the foreseeable to be widely developed   today, geomechanical engineering plays a big role in unconventional resource development that is based mainly on enhanced oil recovery (eor) techniques for hydrocarbon production  these eor techniques basically change the rock matrix sufficiently and this change should be taken in its step into considerations of the drilling program, drilling fluid design, well design, completion, in production and modeling operations | 
2017-0049 	 a novel approach to the laboratory testing of replica discontinuities: 3d printing representative morphologies |abstract: the preparation of identical synthetic samples with the same morphological and mechanical characteristics allows for repeatable and reliable testing of discontinuities under varying conditions  studies on the behavior of replica discontinuities to date have mostly been undertaken on laboratory shearbox apparatus, allowing for the characterization of discontinuity mechanics at low stresses  this study presents a new methodology for creating representative replica discontinuities suitable for testing under triaxial conditions, allowing for characterization at elevated stresses and temperatures  the advancement of computer aided design (cad), three dimensional (3d) scanning and 3d printing has been used to design and create 3d printed molds in acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (abs) plastic  synthetic materials are then cast in to the molds creating cylindrical samples with a pre-existing discontinuity of quantifiable morphology suitable for triaxial testing  statistical and visual analyses show the morphological characteristics of the synthetic discontinuities to be highly repeatable  in addition, the mechanical behavior of different synthetic compositions in unconfined compressive strength and triaxial is compared to the behavior of natural lower strength sedimentary lithologies  the behavior of the tested synthetic materials is found to not be representative of lower strength sedimentary lithologies, with stress-strain behavior showing failure in a quasi-brittle manner   1  introduction  all rock masses contain discontinuities such as fractures, faults, joints, bedding planes and shear zones  failure through intact rock is uncommon unless stresses are extremely high  the behavior and strength of the rock mass is instead commonly controlled by the behavior and strength of the discontinuities (hoek, 1983)  triaxial testing of discontinuities was first undertaken by (jaeger, 1959) and was used for testing discontinuity mechanics throughout the 1960s on synthetic replica discontinuities, artificially created discontinuities and real discontinuities (raleigh and paterson, 1965; byerlee, 1967; heuze and goodman, 1967)  raleigh and paterson (1965) also carried out some of the earliest work of testing discontinuities at elevated temperatures | 
2017-0050 	 numerical modeling of hydraulic fracture containment of tight sandstone gas reservoir |abstract: during the process of fracturing the layered tight gas reservoirs with shale barriers, the propagation of hydraulic fractures can be significantly affected by the geological factors and operation parameters  in this paper, a three-dimensional fracture height model of layered tight gas reservoirs is presented to investigate how these factors influence the geometries of hydraulic fractures  a typical hydraulic fracturing process of a vertical well in ordos basin, china is simulated with this model  the result shows that vertical fractures are mainly formed during the treatment, and the fracture height is dominated by in-situ stress  stress difference higher than 4mpa shows great effectiveness in fracture height containment  in addition, the result indicates that lower elastic modulus is favorable for fracture height containment while possion’s ratio has almost no effect  fracture propagation is strongly inhibited with injection rates lower than 6m3/min under stress difference higher than 4mpa  when stress difference is no more than 2mpa, the fracture height grows well with increasing injection rates  fluid viscosity lower than 10mpa•s has negligible impact  perforation location plays an important role in the fracture initiation stage  fracture geometries differ distinctly with varied perforation locations   1  introduction  recently, massive hydraulic fracturing(mhf) has been widely used to stimulate tight gas reservoirs with an effort to produce commercial quantities of natural gas(economides and nolte 2000)  mhf is designed to contain the fractures within the pay zone  if a fracture crosses into the adjacent rock layers, an excessive amount of material and effort can be wasted when fracturing the unproductive zones(abbas et al  2014)  in contrast, if the designed height of the hydraulic fractures is not achieved, a large area of the productive zone cannot be stimulated, which affects the production rates  estimation or determination of fracture height has been the most difficult technical problem and an important issue in hydraulic fracturing researches  (chuprakov and prioul 2015) | 
2017-0053 	 characterization of rock mass fragmentation for cave mining |abstract: block cave mining is a capital intensive mining method, which requires reliable models to cope with the risks and to build trust for investors  caving operations are typically influenced by the heterogeneous nature of the rock mass; in particular, the spatial variability of the natural fracture network holds significant implications with respect to rock mass fragmentation  in the current paper, an in-situ fragmentation model is generated for an operational block cave mine using discrete fracture network (dfn) models  major structures were included in the model in a deterministic manner and the spatial variability of fracture intensity was analysed to generate a geostatistical block model  the block model of volumetric fracture intensity value (p32) was then used an indicator of the rock mass structural character and fragmentation  finally, the in-situ fragmentation curves were compared to secondary fragmentation curves using field measurements of secondary fragmentation to investigate the possible links between in-situ fragmentation, secondary fragmentation, height of draw and observed hang-ups   1  introduction  block caving is a cost effective underground mining techniques that largely relies on gravity to extract the ore  as large open-pit operations approach the end of their mine life, block caving methods are increasingly becoming the method of choice for the mining industry, since they have the potential to yield extraction rates on a scale comparable to open pit mining (e g  in excess of 100,000 tpd); caving methods also allow for high efficiency and low production costs (vyazmensky et al , 2009)  however, both the scale of the problem and the lack of direct access to the rock mass at project evaluation and design stages makes the characterization and accurate prediction of rock mass fragmentation a very difficult task  in this context, caving geomechanics is still largely an empirically based discipline (vyazmenzky et al , 2010)   a general block caving mine layout is shown in figure 1  broken ore falls into the production level through the drawpoints  as the ore is removed, the ore above continues to break and cave in by gravity | 
2017-0055 	 history matching, sensitivity and uncertainty analysis to improve wellbore stability model predictions |abstract: wellbore instability problems are often encountered during drilling processes of highly deviated wells, although a comprehensive geomechanical model is conducted  the low quality of the input data for the geomechnics models is the root cause of the vast majority of the drilling events  therefore, the quality control is strongly required to ensure problems-free wellbore  in this regard, uncertainty and sensitivity analysis to the stresses and rock strength parameters are carried out in this study to improve preciseness of the geomechanical model  the tornado chart is constructed to present the high sensitive parameters of the geomechanical model, while the monte carlo simulator is used to determine the less certain parameters  furthermore, history matching procedure is introduced to validate some key variables in the model  data from twenty-seven wells in an oil field in southern iraq is implemented to maintain the wellbore integrity for the upcoming wells  thus, this work can be presented as decision-making guideline not only to mitigate the drilling problems but also to reduce the unplanned costs   1  introduction  stability of the wellbore is crucially considered by operators during the exploration and development stages of an oil/gas field and it requires a high-quality data to ensure safe drilling operations  however, there is always a certain level of uncertainty in the data of a design based on the estimation approach (morita, 1995; mostafavi et al , 2011)  ideally, the upper and lower limits of the drilling fluid density design are typically estimated by the implementation of the geomechanical model  the uncertainty in wellbore stability analysis can lead to the increase of nonproductive time of the drilling operations or, in some cases, to induce catastrophic consequences (savari and kumar, 2012)  the main causes of the uncertainty belong to the ways of the measurement or the estimation of the input parameters of the model (aadnoy, 2011)  generally, some variables can be measured directly with a high degree of confidence such as pore pressure, while others are estimated indirectly such as in-situ stresses  the rock strength parameters have a noticeable contribution, to some degree, to the uncertainty regardless the various approaches of estimation  in this study, a geomechanical model has been investigated to reduce the uncertainty in the input data based on history matching, sensitivity, and uncertainty approaches  initially, the calibration of the input data has been conducted, then the sensitivity analysis by tornado chart is established  the history matching is performed to obtain the most sensitive parameters based on data from twenty-seven wells in an oil-field in southern iraq  the uncertainty analysis is utilized by mean of monte carlo simulation to quantitative risk assessment (qas) in order to mitigate the associate error in the input data  the main purpose of the analysis is to design a high confidence model to prevent shear failure in shale layers of tunama formation and the consequences such as pipe sticking, tight hole, and hole enlargement  the severity of drilling incidents in this zone were reviewed extensively by alusbaih and nygaard (2016), and it worth to mention that a considerable time was consumed during directional drilling within tanuma as can be noticed in figure (1)  caliber logs of three wells have shown the hole enlargement in those wells while drilling tanuma formation due to the shear failure as illustrate in figure (2)  therefore, a reliable prediction to the drilling fluid density, to mechanically hold back the well-bore, can be served as decision making option to mitigate such kind of problems | 
2017-0056 	 molecular dynamic model applications in reservoir geomechanics and fracture propagation in pure calcium carbonate |abstract: fracture initiation and propagation are important research topics in reservoir geomechanics  a high proportion of the oil and gas reservoirs around the world are carbonate reservoirs, dominated by brittle and fractured carbonate rocks such as calcium carbonate (caco3) and dolomite (camg(co3)2)  investigation of fracture behavior has been extensively carried out by different approaches but usually involving macro-scale continuum-based methods  such methods have limitations for analyzing discontinuous porous media like carbonate rocks  dis-continuum based methods are needed for understanding fracture complexity challenges in naturally fractured strata  micro-scale dis-continuum methods such as molecular dynamic (md) modelling have been widely used in physics and mechanics, but much less so in rock mechanics  this article contains a literature review of md modeling and dis-continuum methods for fracture simulation, addressing their advantages and disadvantages  subsequently, the context of md as a micro-scale dis-continuum method is described  then, a md model of pure calcium carbonate (calcite) is developed and a numerical simulation of a uniaxial test is carried out  results are compared to simple uniaxial experiments, and results showed fair agreement  this preliminary application of md at a small scale may aid in understanding and implementing fracture initiation and small-scale fracture propagation during early stages of the fracture stimulation process   1  introduction  over half of the oil reservoirs in the world are carbonate reservoirs (payne et al, 2014)  especially, a large proportion of the oil and gas reservoirs in the middle east are fractured carbonate reservoirs (manrique et al , 2004)  enhancement of oil and gas recovery (eor) in such reservoirs due to the continued energy demand and limited resources of fossil fuels (zhao, 2010) will likely entail hydraulic fracturing (hf) methods  to develop an optimum eor plan, hf in a carbonate reservoir should be modelled in a physically reasonable manner (zhao, 2012) at an appropriate scale  this may involve different hf modelling approaches for different scales because natural discontinuities are not distributed in a consistent fractal dimension  hf propagation modelling in carbonate rocks is also influenced by parameters such as the initial pressure distribution, reservoir heterogeneity (at various scales), tensile strength of geo-materials, and external stress conditions (kim and moridis, 2015) | 
2017-0061 	 fracture toughness measurement of shales using nano-indentation: the bakken case study |abstract: hydraulic fracturing has been used as a stimulation technique to improve the total oil and gas production from unconventional plays during the past decades  one of the key parameters affecting the performance of the hydraulic stimulation is the mechanical properties of the rocks i e  fracture toughness  this parameter is a measure of material resistance to extension of a crack  for conventional reservoirs like sandstone, it is relatively straightforward to obtain cores or large samples to do the standard fracture toughness tests to measure this parameter  however, for the unconventional reservoirs like shales, due to the unstable chemical and mechanical properties, it is very expensive and sometimes impossible to get the cores and suitable sample sizes to perform the standard toughness test  determining how to quantify the fracture toughness of shale formation remains a challenge  nano-indentation, which can eliminate the need for large samples, shows a potential application in estimating the fracture toughness of shales  in this paper, samples from upper bakken formation or middle bakken formation were collected and analyzed  after sample preparation, a nano-indenter was applied to estimate young’s modulus and hardness  finally, based on the energy theory, the fracture toughness of each sample was calculated and compared   1  introduction  as the increasing demand for the oil and gas energy along with the decline production of the conventional oil and gas reservoir, unconventional resources such as the shale reservoir energy has become an important part (youns, et al , 2014)  hydraulic fracturing is one of the major tools that industry applied nowadays to increase the production  rock’s elastic and mechanical properties such as elastic modulus, fracture toughness, and poisson’s ratio are important design parameters in hydraulic fracturing (liu et al , 2016)  elastic modulus can influence the stability of fractures while fracture toughness – a generic term for analyzing material resistance to the extension of a crack – can influence the geometry of the fractures | 
2017-0064 	 frictional properties of rocks as a function of rock type, specimen size and confining pressure |abstract: a series of compression tests were carried out in the laboratory on twelve (12) specimen groups of three (3) rock types, i e  stanstead grey granite, indian buff limestone and danby/olympia white marble, and four (4) different sizes, i e  51, 63, 81 and 99 mm outer diameter, to determine their nominal strength and investigate scale effects in regards of test configuration and size of test specimens  specimens were loaded either diametrically to determine their splitting tensile strength using the brazilian test configuration, either axially at five (5) levels of confinement, i e  unconfined, 2, 4, 8 and 15 mpa, to determine their peak compressive strength and compute the parameters of the strength envelope  triaxial confined tests were continued beyond the peak to determine the residual strength of formerly intact rock specimens  test specimens were then slowly unconfined at a rate of 0 02 mpa/sec, while keeping the specimen into a continuous failing mode and recording both axial and confining pressures  both sets of properties, i e  peak and residual, are represented using the mohr-coulomb strength criterion for modelling rock behavior, expressed in terms of cohesion and friction angle  results show very minimal if any scale effect when specimens were tested under axial and/or triaxial compression, for the size of specimen tested  however, a well-defined scale effect is observed with specimens tested in tension, confirming the importance of both the rock fabric and the mode of loading on the behavior of homogeneous rock materials at failure, as pointed out by most of the authors in literature  testing methods are described and results are presented  in most cases, results are showing a very high degree of linearity and very low variability, leading to very consistent observations regarding all aspects of the testing program  © 2017 copyright reserved, natural resources canada   1  introduction  a sound knowledge of intact rock and rock mass properties is required to proceed with the design and ensure the performance of structures either founded on or built in rock  this statement applies to every stage of construction, starting with site investigation, sampling and testing rock materials, and asserting that the set of properties then determined is properly suited for the application foreseen  the main objective of all testing carried out over the last two decades at the canmet rock mechanics laboratory of natural resources canada, located in ottawa, ontario, within the capital region, was to satisfy the needs of two large groups of clients, which are the mine industry and the energy sector  however large the range of applications foreseen might have been, the laboratory has focused its effort on highly specialized services in relation with first the properties of intact rocks at failure, i e  material strength and rock deformation, and second, their evolution once the material has failed and properties are reaching their minimal, residual value [1-7]  applications foreseen for such properties include short and long term stability of drillholes, wellbores, shafts, tunnels, caverns, mine openings, etc, used by both mine and energy sectors, to proceed either to mineral, oil and/or gas extraction (and/or storage), or to nuclear waste disposal, where stability is most suited to ensure the safety and serviceability of excavations [8-12]  a second category of applications requiring a good knowledge of laboratory rock properties concerns the capacity of the rock to either collapse and/or to flow naturally, as required with operations using mine caving and/or stoping as their main extraction method [13-15] | 
2017-0067 	 the influence of rock-mechanical properties on fracture characteristics in finely-layered reservoirs |abstract: heterogeneities in finely-layered reservoirs complicate predictions on the fracture behavior  understanding the controls on fracture behavior in these unconventional reservoirs is important for their successful production  this research examines the influence of rock-mechanical properties on fracture characteristics in finely-layered reservoirs  rock-mechanical laboratory experiments have been performed on layered shale-sandstone samples and layered granite-sandstone samples, in order to investigate the rock-mechanical parameters and fracture geometry  fracture characterization, including fracture initiation, propagation, orientation, and interaction between the multiple layers was performed using x-ray micro-computed tomography scans  predictions of the rock-mechanical properties of a layered material can be made using the reuss-bound averaging each individual layer  the strength, however, cannot be averaged  fracture initiation is highly dependent on rock strength: fractures initiate at the failure point of the weakest layer, after which they do propagate at low average stress levels through stronger layers due to local stress amplification at the fracture tip  the fractures change their orientation through layers with different mechanical properties  the results show that the variability in rock-mechanical properties influences the fracture behavior in a finely-layered reservoir   1  introduction  the development of low-permeability reservoirs generally requires hydraulic fracturing  fracture geometry is an important concern for the successful development of unconventional reservoirs (teufel and clark, 1984)  these reservoirs often consist of many lithological units, which create significant variation in lithology and therefore in mechanical properties (passey et al , 2010; sone and zoback, 2013)  this heterogeneity complicates predictions on the fracture behavior within the rock succession and on the fracture geometry developed during stimulation  fractures might stop at the interface in a layered reservoir  in this case, the fracture might not fully cover the target zone  on the other hand, when the fracture propagates through stronger rocks, the fracture may rupture the cap rock and create reservoir leakage  therefore, understanding the controls on fracture behavior and fracture geometry is important for the successful development of low-permeability reservoirs | 
2017-0068 	 pore structure heterogeneity in middle bakken formation |abstract: pore structure is one of the most important parameters affecting the properties of reservoir formations such as mechanical properties  the existence of the pores in the rocks will cause stress concentrations where isolated pores or cracks may nucleate favorably and crack growth will be strongly affected during hydraulic fracturing, as an enhanced production technique in unconventional reservoirs  unlike the more homogeneous pores in sandstones, the pore structures in the shale formations are heterogeneous and complex to quantify due to the diagenesis and geological processes that the shale has undergone  formations with heterogeneous microstructures may introduce a heterogeneous stress field during the fracturing stimulation, which can influence the crack growth and continuity  therefore, quantifying the microstructural heterogeneity of the shale formations is essential in stimulation performance and production analysis from unconventional reservoirs  in this paper, samples from the middle bakken formation, which is a typical unconventional reservoir in north america, were collected  field-emission scanning electron microscope (fesem) was used to produce the images from the samples  after the segmentation of these images, the lacunarity method was applied to analyze the heterogeneous of the pore structures  finally, based on the choosing of the rea (representative elementary area) using the porosity indicator, we calculated the heterogeneity of pore structures of different samples and compared the values   1  introduction  unconventional reservoir play nowadays has been an important part in the world oil and gas total production  unlike the more homogeneous pores in sandstones, pores in unconventional reservoirs such as shale formations are always heterogeneous due to the diagenesis and geological processes  the heterogeneities, which can be identified over the various scale from nanometers to meters, will result in the difference in the properties of the rocks such as flow and mechanical properties (vasseur et al , 2015)  thus, it is important to characterize and quantify the heterogeneities of the pore structures of shale formations | 
2017-0070 	 application of differential evolution to predict wellbore strengthening from drilling fluid containing nanoparticles hpht filtration test results |abstract: a proper wellbore stability analysis is necessary to avoid trespassing the limits of mud weight window especially in off-shore drilling  wellbore strengthening is a mechanism to enable safe and cost-effective drilling operation by means of increasing the fracture pressure of the rock  this paper presents a model illustrating the relationship between wellbore strengthening and hpht filtration for different permeabilities  data were collected from previous experiments on shale and sandstone cores to increase fracture pressure by utilizing calcium-based, iron-based nanoparticles (nps) and graphite in oil based mud  a differential evolution algorithm was used to find a poly-variate, polynomial model for breakdown pressure increase and hpht fluid loss reductions for different permeable media  sensitivity analysis were done to test the robustness of the results of the model and to reduce uncertainty  based on the results, filtration reduction is dominant parameter on wellbore strengthening  the correlation shows permeability has a limited influence on increasing fracture pressure  by decreasing filtration using calcium-based and iron-based nps in drilling fluid, fracture pressure increase in both high and low permeable formations   1  introduction  exceeding the formation fracture pressure during drilling operations can result in high fluid losses, lost circulation, loss in mud hydrostatic pressure potentially resulting in a kick which could lead to a blowout  as a well deepens, the mud safe window range narrows due to the convergence of the pore and formation fracture gradient  therefore, it is crucial to choose a mud weight to stay in the safe mud weight window  the process of increasing the wellbore pressure containment using engineered drilling fluids is called wellbore strengthening (ws)  ws can be achieved by avoiding drilling fluid penetrating the formation and limiting the local increase in formation pressure around the wellbore as a result of the drilling fluid entering the formation  ws has been studied by many researchers and different procedures and techniques have been suggested  ws is applied to prevent or treat lost circulation with the goal of decreasing or limit the drilling fluid from entering the formation  ws methods include use of different additives in drilling fluids, heating the wellbore to change in situ rock stresses around borehole, and use of pills for temporarily isolating troublesome zones | 
2017-0072 	 bifurcation theory applied to granite under general states of stress |abstract: a series of tests have been performed on sierra white granite subjected to general (true triaxial) states of stress  tests were performed under constant lode angle conditions at lode angles of 23 4, 16 1 and 0°  the constant lode angle condition was maintained by holding the minimum principal stress constant while increasing the maximum and intermediate principal stress at a predetermined ratio  tests were performed at minimum principal stresses of 5, 17 and 30 mpa  all of the specimens failed in a brittle manner, with significant dilatant volume strain accumulated, and failure showed a strong dependence on lode angle  specimens behaved in a nearly linear elastic manner until approximately 75% of the peak stress was reached  the angle of the failure feature (shear band) was compared to predictions developed by using the rudnicki and rice (1975) localization criterion  it was found that there was good agreement (within 7°) between the experimental results and theoretical predictions   1  introduction  recently there has been a renewed interest in the united states regarding the utilization of deep igneous rock formations for nuclear waste disposal (brady et al  2009)  the idea behind this is that by utilizing the deep formations that have little hydrologic exchange with higher strata due to the high pressure and low permeability in these regions  the high lithostatic pressure would preclude hydraulic fracture of the rock thereby preventing the drilling and emplacement operations from further fracturing the rock and providing a pathway for radionuclides to migrate upwards  in order to ensure that this operation, should it be undertaken, is a safe and secure repository for nuclear waste, regardless of the type or quantity of radioactive material, the rocks being used for emplacement must be well understood  therefore, we have undertaken an experimental investigation into the failure of granitic rock under general (true triaxial) states of stress to determine the mode of failure and have compared that mode to an established localization theory to determine its applicability to predicting failure features in this rock | 
2017-0075 	 proppant effect on rock shear resistance and its corresponding influence on proppant embedment behavior |abstract: proppant takes an essential role in propping the fracture open after pumping ceases in the horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing process for unconventional reservoir  however, the relatively smooth proppant may degrade the surface roughness, and alter the friction type from sliding to rolling, both of which may largely reduce the rock shear resistance  the experimental results show that there is a large decrease on both rock peak shear strength and shear stiffness with addition of proppant  the rock with reducing shear resistance has less ability to resist the horizontal shear stress due to gas transportation in the horizontal direction, making it more possible for the rock to induce relative movement  based on the experimental data, there is a huge increase in proppant embedment rate with shear stress once obvious relative movement (like dilation) appears  therefore, it is worth to investigate the change of rock shear resistance with the addition of proppant and keep the actual shear stress within the limit by controlling gas flow rate to prevent the relative movement of rock and maintain better proppant embedment behavior   1  introduction  unconventional nature gas, mainly shale gas, is recognized as potential replacing energy resource to solve the current energy shortage problem with its high capacity  with the development of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, economic commercial production of nature gas can finally be achieved (olaoye, bouazza et al  2009)  in the process, proppants, small spherical particles with high strength, play an essential role in propping fractures open after pumping ceases to permit gas flow  however, proppant degradation mechanisms of diagenesis, embedment and fine generation and migration, inevitably happen due to the extreme conditions, including high temperature and stress (alramahi and sundberg 2012, ghosh, rai et al  2014)  these mechanisms greatly reduce fracture width and conductivity and eventually gas production  of all those mechanisms, proppant embedment is recognized as the most common and severe one  under deep reservoir with high vertical stress, the proppant particle tends to indent into the rock mass, causing the fracture reduction or even closure (volk, raible et al  1981) | 
2017-0077 	 geomechanical stratification in a shale reservoir and its correlation with natural fractures: case from pomeranian basin (poland)  |abstract: mechanical stratification of shale complexes is an important feature of tight reservoir that controls both: the pattern of natural tectonic strata-bound fractures and propagation of technological hydraulic fractures  in our study we are looking for factors controlling the mechanical properties of a shale complex and define parameters crucial to distinguish geomechanically consistent units based on core and borehole geophysical data  we describe the hierarchic system of consistent lithological units (clus) to ease compilation and extrapolation of analyses at different scales and resolution  higher level member (clu3) are traceable from well to well at distances of tens of kilometers across the baltic basin  the dependence between mineralogical composition and elastic modulus with emphasis on the role of calcite is analyzed  the results show that carbonates may have had a stronger impact on the young’s modulus and brittleness index growth than quartz  these observations led us to modify the conventionally used mineralogical brittleness index by incorporation of toc factor and determination of the calcite placement in the formula numerator  we also compare the intensity of vertical and horizontal fractures with the calculated brittleness index and conclude that the natural fracture density is not a direct function of shale brittleness  |1  introduction |unconventional shale reservoirs have become significant source of u s  natural gas in the past decade  promising geology and mining perspectives prompted oil companies to search for shale gas in poland  the ordovician and silurian shales located in the baltic basin have emerged as one of the most promising targets for shale gas exploration  the companies drilled several tens of exploration boreholes which provided wealth of information about petrophysical and mechanical properties of the shales  increasing demand to understand the structure and behavior of these rocks led us to commence our geomechanical research  geomechanical study in a shale reservoir is crucial to understand rock behavior during hydraulic fracturing treatment and to solve borehole stability problems | 
2017-0079 	 tectonic structures in shale that you do not include in your reservoir model |abstract: we have investigated tectonic structures in several hundred meters of continuous core from five boreholes located in the ordovician/silurian shale formations of the baltic basin in poland  detail core examination of the natural tectonic structures and mechanically significant features comprised: mineral veins, fractured veins, bare fractures, slickensides, fault zones and bedding planes  all of our observations were compared with available, geophysical logging data  the most common tectonic structures are steep, rather small strata-bound fractures and veins with very low kinematic aperture  they create an orthogonal joint system locally disturbed by minor faults  for these regular joints, we have calculated average fracture intensity parameter by averaging fracture area per cubic meter of rock  we also constructed rose diagrams of fractures orientation weighted with height, aperture or percentage of cracked veins and also taking into account an orientation error  obtained weighted diagrams enhance dominant sets of fractures and are more relevant for reservoir characterization than common diagrams considering only numbers of fractures  finally, we compared results received from core with those from borehole scanner interpretation  this comparison reveals some interesting discrepancy between fracture profiles based on borehole scanner logs and direct borehole core profiles  |1  introduction |natural discontinuities occurring in low permeable shale reservoir are important for borehole completion and hydrocarbon exploitation  natural fractures and other tectonic structures control effective reservoir properties, such as: permeability and anisotropy (hennings, 2009, odling, 1992, pijush et al , 2007), behavior of induced hydraulic fracture during fracturing treatment (gale et al , 2006, warpinski and teufel, 1987) and size and shape of stimulated reservoir volume (greenwood, 2015)  open minor- and moderate-scale penetrative fractures increase reservoir drainage and create additional space for free hydrocarbon accumulation  in contrast, large tectonic structures like seismic-scale faults can be harmful for exploitation, as they may capture fracking fluid, cause hydrocarbons escape or brine invasion into reservoir (bratton et al , 2006) | 
2017-0080 	 pattern recognition applicability of artificial neural networks in rock abrasiveness determination using rock strength and brittleness data |abstract: cerchar abrasion index (cai) is commonly used to represent rock abrasion for estimation of bit life and wear in various mining and tunneling applications  the test is simple and fast, but there have been some discrepancies in the test results which are related to the type of equipment, condition of the rock surface, operator skills, testing procedures, and measuring the wear flat  this paper focuses on the estimation of cai and investigates the impact of various parameters on that  results of a limited cerchar tests on a set of rock samples from different laboratories are analyzed to correlate rock properties data to cia value, which every value indicate an abrasiveness classification  as a result of a literature review, it is concluded that the abrasiveness of a rock sample based on the cai value is strongly correlated with uniaxial compressive strength (ucs) and brittleness of rock samples  rock brittleness is a function of ucs and brazilian tensile strength (bts)  thus, collected data of these parameters were hired to develop and train artificial neural networks (ann) as an artificial intelligence (ai) method for estimation of drilling tool wear using data of rock strength and brittleness as inputs  it is pursued by the application of pattern recognition which is achieved by anns   1  introduction  in this research, artificial neural networks (ann) are applied to predict drilling bit wear using collected and calculated data of rock abrasiveness, including uniaxial compressive strength, brazilian tensile strength and rock brittleness   this purpose is pursued by performance of pattern recognition as it is one of the major applications of anns  the final proposed neural networks produces the abrasiveness classification by receiving data of ucs, bts and brittleness   1 1  wear and rock abrasiveness the wear is in many ways similar to the effect of harder minerals on softer ones and is easily represented by the scratch that the hard objects engrave in soft minerals  plinninger et al , 2002, depicted that “abrasive wear” is the predominant wear process in most rock types | 
2017-0082 	 multichannel analysis of surface waves: estimating depth to bedrock and acoustic properties in karst terrain |abstract: conventional techniques such as boreholes and test pits have been used for geotechnical site investigation purposes for many years  these conventional techniques are invasive, time-consuming and expensive  to minimize costs and to complement intrusive investigation techniques, geophysical methods are now commonly employed for geotechnical investigations in karst terrain  one relatively new non-invasive geophysical technique is the active multichannel analysis of surface waves (masw) tool  this paper explores the utility of using the active masw tool in karst terrain  a 20-pound sledge hammer was used as an acoustic source; a seistronix ras-24 channel seismograph was used to record the masw field data  masw field data were processed with surfseis4 software; the output at each test location was a 10-layer shear-wave velocity profile of the subsurface  borehole control and 2-d electrical resistivity tomography (ert) data were used to verify and constrain the interpretations of the output 1-d shear-wave velocity profiles  the results show that masw can reliably be utilized to map variations in the engineering properties of soil/rock and to estimate depth to top of rock in karst terrain   1  introduction  conventional methods such as drilling and trenching have been utilized for subsurface investigations for many years  however, geophysical techniques are now being increasingly used to investigate construction sites in karst terrain  geophysical surveys typically complement intrusive geotechnical investigations  they are also non-invasive, less expensive and more rapid  geophysical techniques that have been utilized for investigating karst terrain include electrical resistivity tomography (ert), ground penetrating radar (gpr), gravity, electromagnetic (em), and seismic methods (obi, 2012; yassin, 2013; nouioua et al , 2013; martinez-moreno et al , 2014; giorgi and leucci, 2014)  the choice of a particular geophysical method for imaging the subsurface is dependent on the physical characteristics of the target   active multichannel analysis of surface waves (masw), a geophysical technique for determining the accoustic properties of soil/rock and estimating the top of rock is being increasingly employed to investigate complex karst terrain  this study is aimed at exploring the utility of the geophysical technique in karst terrain  the active masw tool consists of a seismograph, an active acoustic source (e g sledge hammer) and an array of receivers (geophones)  the active masw tool records acoustic energy generated by the active source and calculates surface wave phase velocities  the phase velocity data are analyzed; the output at each test location is a 10-layered 1-d shear-wave velocity profile that typically extends to a depth of about 100 feet (30 m)  shear-wave velocity is a function of soil and/or rock rigidity | 
2017-0083 	 co2 and n2 injection to enhance shale gas recovery |abstract: we investigate the potential benefits of injecting the mixtures of co2 and n2 into shale reservoirs to both optimize recovery of natural gas and to sequester co2  in this work, we develop dual-porosity, dual-permeability finite element models to simulate multicomponent gas flow in porous media coupled with shale deformation and sorption behavior  we use this model to explore the injection of pure co2, pure n2, and mixtures of co2 and n2 in different ratios to enhance shale gas recovery (esgr)  this behavior necessarily includes the evolution sorption-induced strain by competitive adsorption and its influence on permeability of matrix and fractures to ultimately define cumulative production history of ch4  the results show that injecting pure co2 can increase shale gas recovery by <u+02dc>20%  injection of n2 works as an esgr agent and can increase shale gas recovery by <u+02dc>80%  injecting a mixture of n2 and co2 of different gas ratios results in recovery ranging between <u+02dc>20% and <u+02dc>80% (pure component end-member cases)  moreover, injecting n2 in higher proportions relative to co2 is more beneficial since n2 shows higher recovery in esgr  therefore, increasing injection pressure is not the only means to achieve higher production, instead, increasing n2-co2 gas ratio can achieve the same goal  the observations also show that although co2 is not sensitive to pressure in performing esgr, it is sensitive to pressure when accounting for sequestered co2  furthermore, the sequestration of co2 by injecting co2-n2 mixtures does not simply increase as co2-n2 gas ratio increases  since higher co2-n2 ratio results in a decrease in shale gas recovery, which leads to more ch4 left in the reservoir to compete with co2 for sorption sites, this also results in reduced co2 sequestration   1  introduction  shale gas has become an increasingly important source of natural gas in the united states  in 2000, shale gas provided only 1% of u s  natural gas production, but this increased to 20% by 2010 (stevens 2012)  the u s  energy information administration predicts that, by 2035, 46% of natural gas supply in the united states will come from shale gas  shale gas comes from gas shales, which are organic-rich formations that are both source rock and reservoir (cipolla, lolon et al  2009)  unlike other conventional reservoirs, whose high permeability enables vertical wells to extract gas, the ultra-low permeability of shale traps the source methane within the shale  vertical wells are only able to drain gas from a small tributary volume  this prevents vertical wells from producing sufficient gas to be economical (zoback, kitasei et al  2010)  over the past decade, however, the application of two techniques, horizontal drilling, and hydraulic fracturing, has made it possible to extract gas economically from shale formations at significant depth  their use in the barnett shale near fort worth, texas, demonstrated that these techniques could be key to producing trillions of cubic feet of natural gas estimated to exist in shale gas plays throughout the united states (soeder 2012)  however, field production data of shale gas wells show a rapid decline in gas flow rate after a few years of production  this drawback has focused attention on finding other ways to enhance shale gas recovery | 
2017-0095 	 laboratory observations of the effect of pore pressure on hydraulic fracture growth |abstract: hydraulic fracture initiation and propagation in the presence of multiple fluid injection sources and under far-field stresses is investigated experimentally utilizing a novel fracturing cell  porous test specimens with injection points in different configurations are placed between two transparent plates  experiments are conducted to examine hydraulic fracture growth in proximity to a constant pressure injection source as well as propagation of multiple neighboring fractures under different injection conditions  the fracturing process is recorded using a high resolution digital camera  a variety of fracture behavior is observed in these experiments that demonstrate the interplay between high pore pressure regions, the applied contrast in far-field stresses, and fluid injection scheme and configuration of injectors   1  inroduction  changes in pore pressure by fluid injection or production in oil and gas reservoirs can have a significant influence on the magnitude and orientation of in-situ stresses  initiation and propagation of hydraulic fractures can, therefore, be affected by a perturbation of pore pressure field   bruno and nakagawa (1991) performed laboratory experiments in which a hydraulic fracture was propagated from an injection port in thin sandstone slabs under the influence of a nearby fluid injection source maintained at constant pressure  the experiments reported by the authors were performed without applying far-field stresses, i e  under isotropic far-field stress state  bouteca et al  (1983) reported an experimental result showing hydraulic linkage between two injection ports that were offset by 10 degrees from an applied maximum far-field stress without reporting the specifics of the experiment  analytical and numerical evaluation of similar problems were reported by berchenko and detournay (1997) and wang et al  (2013)   in this work, we performed an experimental study that examines the effect of pore pressure on hydraulic fracture growth using novel experimental capabilities  a series of tests were performed in a systematic manner under various fluid injection schemes and configurations and varying contrast in the applied far-field stresses | 
2017-0096 	 geomechanics-based wellbore trajectory optimization for tight formation with natural fractures |abstract: the selection of an optimized wellbore trajectory is one of the key factors that determine the success of hydraulic fracturing  geomechanics-based wellbore trajectory optimization uses a geomechanics analysis solution, such as geostress components values  for calculation convenience, the concept of f<u+03b2> -potential which is defined on the surfaces of natural fractures with inclination angle <u+03b2> is proposed as an index for selecting the optimized wellbore trajectory  in the simplest case, the wellbore trajectory of a tight formation should be taken in the direction of maximum horizontal stress (sh) to maximize the stimulated reservoir volume  in this case, the injection-induced fracture will propagate in the direction that is perpendicular to the axis of wellbore trajectory  when a natural fracture exists in the tight formation, injection-induced fractures are believed to be determined by those natural fractures that can open under hydraulic injection stimulation  consequently, the task of trajectory optimization is to locate those natural fractures that are easy to open with injection  these fractures are also known as critically stressed fractures (csf)  the workflow for selecting the optimized wellbore trajectory based on geomechanics solutions and the concept of csf is presented in this paper  for trajectory optimization focused on the primary fracturing design, the workflow is performed with the initial geostress  for the optimization focused on the fracturing design in a field that is disturbed by primary fracturing from offset wells, the workflow is performed with the stress field disturbed by primary fracturing   1  introduction  tight formation refers to shale gas/oil formations and tight sand gas/oil formations  hydraulic fracturing is essential for production in tight formations  trajectory optimization is a fundamental aspect of a wellbore design in a tight formation with natural fractures (bond et al , 2006; himmerlberg and eckert, 2013; manchanda et al , 2012)  a deliberately optimized wellbore trajectory enables maximum efficiency of hydraulic fracturing; the value of stimulated reservoir volume (srv) will reach its maximum if the trajectory is selected to go through the right place (sweet spot) and is in right direction | 
2017-0097 	 numerical simulation on steam fingering in steam assisted gravity drainage of heavy oil |abstract: steam-assisted gravity drainage (sagd) is a popular practice for enhanced production of heavy oil  steam fingering is an important characteristic of steam chamber expansion in the process of sagd a set of fully coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical constitutive models are adopted in the calculation  this simplified multiphase and multiphysics-coupled model consists of two phases of materials (mixture fluid and solid) and three types of physics: thermal (temperature), hydro (pore pressure), and mechanical (deformation)  this paper proposes a mathematical relationship for the dependency of permeability on both temperature and values of strain components  this model is implemented into a set of commercial software through its open-platform of user subroutines  a validation example was performed with a heavy oil field in north america  through this field-scale example, this work shows variation of major mechanical variables including stress, strain, and deformation along with temperature and pore pressure contour in a full process of sagd  a set of numerical results, including contours of temperature, pore-pressure, etc  are presented for the purpose of model validation  the steam fingering is obvious in the process of steam chamber expansion   1  introduction  aim of this work is to build a simplified fully coupled thermal-hydro-mechanical model for steam penetration in heavy oil formation  application of the model to analysis of steam penetration in a process of steam-assisted gravity drainage (sagd) and steam flooding are presented for the purpose of model validation and principle illustration  it can also be used for the analysis of cyclic steam stimulation (css)   the process of steam penetration in enhanced heavy oil production is complicated (yang, 1992; al-hadhrami, 2014; boone, 1995; settari, 2001; zhao, 2013)  in this process, over-heated steam whose temperature can be as high as 350°c is injected into the heavy oil formation  as the steam flow contacts the formation, heat transfer begins between the steam and formation along with the porous flow of steam within the formation | 
2017-0098 	 the effect of variable fluid injection rate on the stability of seismogenic faults |abstract: fault reactivation in response to fluid injection into the subsurface is controlled by a number of site-specific and operational parameters  we investigate the effects of variable fluid injection rate on the stability of a nearby fault using three-dimensional fully coupled poroelastic finite element simulations for injection into a multi-layer sequence containing a favorably orientated normal fault that extends from the injection reservoir into underlying crystalline basement  we consider three injection scenarios with constant, increasing, and decreasing injection rates but same overall injection duration and same total injection volume  our simulations demonstrate that maximum excess pore pressure and coulomb failure stress are highly dependent on the injection strategy  increasing and constant injection rates always result in increasing excess pore pressure and coulomb failure stress along the fault  an initially high injection rate followed by a decrease in injection rate results in lower maximum excess pore pressure and coulomb failure stress compared to constant or increasing injection rate cases  these results suggest that fault reactivation potential associated with wastewater injection can be reduced with a site-specific assessment of geologic, reservoir geomechanical, and operational conditions including injection duration, rate, and overall injection volume prior to the start of injection   1  introduction  fluid injection into sedimentary reservoirs underlying the crystalline basement is considered a routine practice for the disposal of formation water produced during oil and gas extraction and of flowback after hydraulic fracture stimulation of unconventional reservoirs  fluid injections have been known to induce seismic fault reactivation since the 1960s (healy et al , 1968)  the recent increase of seismic events in areas of active fluid injection and low natural seismicity has generated renewed interests in the coupled phenomena of fluid migration, poroelastic stress changes, and induced seismicity (ellsworth, 2013; mcgarr et al , 2015; segall and lu, 2015; fan et al , 2016)   in addition to site-specific factors (e g , fault size, fault orientation and distribution, in-situ stress state, initial pore fluid pressure, permeability of injection reservoir), the potential of fault reactivation in response to subsurface fluid injection is also affected by operational parameters (e g , injection rate, cumulative injected volume, wellhead injection pressure, depth of injection, distance above crystalline basement, distance to known faults) (ellsworth, 2013; mcgarr, 2014; weingarten et al , 2015)  the excess pressure above the background pore fluid pressure generated by injection decreases the effective normal stress on the fault and potentially leads to fault reactivation (kim, 2013; block et al , 2014)  however, previous studies on variable injection rate focus on average injection rate or cumulative injection volume at larger time domain and overlook the influence of injection history on fault reactivation (e g , kim, 2013; segall and lu, 2015; fan et al , 2016)  reported injection activities reveal significant temporal variations of injection rate, which may result in distinct site responses  reported trends of injection include increasing (e g , site j-a in barnett shale, texas, frohlich, 2012), decreasing (e g , “south well” near timpson, texas, frohlich et al , 2014), and constant rates (e g , “north well” near timpson, texas, frohlich et al , 2014)  moreover, many previous numerical simulations on fault reactivation by fluid injection resort to a critical pore pressure by solving the standard fluid diffusion equation and neglect the effect of fault orientation and in-situ stress state (shapiro et al  2013; keranen et al , 2014)  to evaluate the stress changes and pore pressure perturbations at the fault, numerical analysis that uses reliable geological information and accounts for coupled geomechanical and reservoir flow processes is desired (fan et al , 2016) | 
2017-0099 	 investigation of flow behavior through hydraulic fractures in unconventional gas reservoirs under tri-axial drained conditions |abstract: water-based fracking fluids are currently used to enhance the gas production from unconventional gas reservoirs, while the formation damage due to the interaction between rock matrix and residual water significantly reduce the pore space available for gas movement  in this paper, the effect of different fracturing fluids on fracture permeability is investigated using the same fractured siltstone sample in five rounds of cycling test (co2-co2-co2-water-co2)  the experimental results reveal that the maximum confining pressure dominated fracture permeability  the fracture permeability for co2 at 10mpa confining pressure decreased by around 75% after applying 40mpa confining pressure  after water flooding in the fourth round, the fracture permeability for co2 was considerably reduced by around 70-85% compared with that in the second cycling test, and the influence of water flooding was much stronger at lower co2 injection pressure  the experimental results showed that the fracture permeability for gas reduced significantly after water flooding due to formation damage  thus, liquid co2 is much more suitable than water as fracturing fluid for clay-abundant unconventional gas reservoirs   1  introduction  as an efficient and greener source of energy, shale gases currently attracting more interest (conti et al , 2014), however, the ultralow permeability (<0 001md) of shale matrix is the major barrier to shale gas commercial production (daigle and screaton, 2015, kumar et al , 2015)  the development of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling has been therefore used to enhance the shale formation productivity, and water-based fracturing fluids has been commonly used (johnson and johnson, 2012, nicot and scanlon, 2012, boz and pe, 2014, ghahremani and clapp, 2014)   while the interaction between water and rock minerals, especially clay minerals, can lead to severe formation damage and long clean time (arnold, 1998, lal and amoco, 1999)  many experimental investigations have been carried out on the effect of water saturation on the mechanical behavior of reservoir rock (shukla et al , 2013, rathnaweera et al , 2014, dyke and dobereiner, 1991, erguler and ulusay, 2009)  for example, according to shukla et al , (2013) and rathnaweera et al , (2014), water sensitivity or softening of rock samples due to the saturation effect can greatly reduce the mechanical strength of dry reservoir rock  while the soften effect can induce a decrease of propped fracture conductivity because the deformation squeezes the fracture width, and strong absorption of rock matrix to water will block the gas flow channel in fractures, so the presence of water in formation can greatly reduce the gas production, especially for water sensitive formations (cheng, 2012) | 
2017-0101 	 advances in geomechanics of coal-gas interactions |abstract: although coal-gas interactions have been comprehensively investigated, majority of these studies usually assume that these interactions are under conditions of invariant total stress where effective stresses scale inversely with applied pore pressures and under the assumption of equal gas sorption effect on both matrix and fracture in coal  permeability models with such assumptions fail to explain results from stress-controlled laboratory tests and are limited in their ability to explain and match in situ data  through our persistent efforts of almost a decade, we have removed all of these constrained conditions, proposed the local impact of coal-gas interactions on permeability, and developed new relations between coal porosity and volumetric strains under conditions of variable stress  the cubic relation between porosity and permeability is then introduced to relate coal storage capability (porosity) to coal transport characteristics (permeability) also under variable stress conditions  we implement these two relations into a sequence of finite element models to represent the geomechanics of coal-gas interactions including single through dual poroelastic models  these models couple the transport and sorption of a compressible fluid within a deformable medium where the effects of deformation are rigorously accommodated  this paper reports our novel framework on geomechanics of coal-gas interactions   1  introduction  from the 1970s onwards there has been a growing interest to produce coalbed methane (cbm) as a fuel (ayer, 2002)  now it has developed dramatically and can be the energy resource solution for the next few decades (hamawand et al , 2013)  at the end of the 1980s, this industry searched for methods to enhance production  the successes of enhanced oil recovery (eor) gave the cbm industry the idea that gas injection could also be successfully applied in unmineable coalbeds to enhance coalbed methane (ecbm) recovery (bergen et al , 2006)  two main benefits can be obtained from ecbm with gas injection  one is to increase production rates of methane and to shorten the time to return on investment; the other is to mitigate increasing concentrations of co2 in the atmosphere to thereby reduce effects of global climate change (gunter et al , 1997; reichle et al , 1999) | 
2017-0104 	 hydraulic fracture geometry and geomechanical characteristics of carbonate reservoir rock |abstract: hydraulic fracturing (hf) to enhance ultimate hydrocarbon recovery factor – rf – is becoming a more common reservoir stimulation method in higher permeability reservoirs, extending its perceived use beyond merely accelerating production  hf is a complex engineering process with large capital costs; a rational and effective design process is the key step to mitigate the potential economic risks and increase the efficiency of the hf treatment  there are several numerical and analytical methods to simulate hf treatments and estimate the geometry of the induced fracture  in this study, the target reservoir formation, a conventional carbonate gas field, was divided into 5 geomechanical units (gmus)  each gmu has different permeability values, which range from 3 5 to 300 md  geomechanical characteristics of each gmu were defined by laboratory tests to obtain fracture toughness (kic), hydraulic tensile strength (thf), unconfined compression strength (ucs), young’s modulus (e), poisson’s ratio (v), cohesion (c<u+2032>) and internal friction angle (<u+03a6><u+2032>)  then, using the finite element method (fem), hf treatment was simulated in each gmu as continuous fluid (water) injection for 20 minutes at a rate of 20 bbl/min  a cohesive zone model (czm) was assumed for all units as a behavioral rock failure model  the fracture aperture was compared with geomechanical characteristics of each gmu, showing that aperture is strongly related to e, kic, and thf rather than v, c<u+2032>, <u+03a6><u+2032>  incidentally, as each of these five parameters (except v) increases, aperture decreases  because slip and shear dilatancy of induced shear fractures was not addressed in this study, no meaningful relation between fracture aperture and c<u+2032> or <u+03a6><u+2032> exists  for a given volume of injection, fracture length is necessarily in an inverse relationship with the five parameters (except v)   1  introduction  improving hydrocarbon production, considering the global growing demand for hydrocarbon, is essential  reservoir stimulation, particularly hydraulic fracturing (hf), is one of the main methods which seek to enhance hydrocarbon recovery by the faster delivery of the petroleum fluid  basically, hf treatment works by improving the connections of the wellbore with the reservoir, aiding wells to produce fluids more quickly (economides and nolte, 2000, daneshy, 2010) | 
2017-0105 	 numerical simulation and experimental study on novel rock-breaking concept—layered spalling |abstract: cutter, the fundamental cutting element of pdc (polycrystalline diamond compact) bit, directly determines the overall performance of pdc bit and thus influences rate of penetration (rop), drilling efficiency and drilling cost  bit scrapped caused by cutter failure accounts for about 90% of all the failure in field operations  a majority of researches have been conducted on pdc cutter design, which were mainly concentrated on structure itself, such as stress state, self-sharpening and interface bonding strength, while neglecting the closely related factor of the rock-breaking method  this paper presents a novel pdc cutter which is designed based on the bionics theory to illustrate the layered spalling concept of rock-breaking  this paper has paid much attention to studying the numerical simulation of dynamic rock-breaking process under new bionic pdc cutter to illustrate the rock-breaking mechanism  meanwhile, the corresponding experiments have been performed with a single cutter to validate the theory  the results indicate that: (a) the process of rock-breaking under the new bionic pdc cutter is characterized as “layered spalling” with slight oscillation comparing to the property-“block dropping” of conventional cutter  (b) the cutting process of bionic cutter is more stable with minor impact vibration, which contributes to improving the cutter’s life to some extent  the amplitude of cutting force reduces by 42% and the average value of the new bionic pdc cutter is 460n while the conventional pdc cutter is 790n   1  introduction  pdc bit is the most important tool for oil drilling  a large number of field tests and laboratory studies (kaitkay and lei 2005, gouda et al  2011) have shown that the cutting teeth are easy to fail, such as cutter chipped and broken, diamond layer peel off and wear (lin et al  1992)  so the quality of the cutter directly affects the performance and life of the drill bit (yahiaoui et al  2013)  there were many studies focused on the comprehensive performance of pdc cutter (martinez et al  2013)  most of their researches prone to ameliorate the stress condition of pdc cutter, improve cutters’ self-sharpening performance and enhance the interface bonding strength, etc (tammineni et al  2013, azar et al  2013, raghav et al  2013)  meanwhile, through many new design methods have been proposed and some good effects were obtained (zhang et al  2013), but the problem still exists  the designs merely pay attention to the design of the cutter itself, ignoring the impact of rock breaking modes on the cutters’ performance (gerbaud 2011) | 
2017-0106 	 temperature effects on stiffness moduli of reservoir sandstone from the deep north sea |abstract: we investigate effect of testing temperature on the dynamic frame stiffness of quartz-bearing north sea sandstone from depths of 5 km  we show that at low stress levels, the rock frame stiffens with increasing temperature and we propose an explanation for the controlling mechanisms  while equilibrating to atmospheric conditions, cooling and stress release of reservoir material can induce tensional forces in the rock frame leading to ruptures of the contact cement in the weakest grain contacts  the frame stiffness hence reduces, as the ruptures are permanent  however, a fraction of the in-situ stiffness can be restored by reestablishment of reservoir stress or temperature, but only as recovery of contact between ruptures and not as re-cementation  in literature, ruptures of contact cement are denoted as micro-cracks, strictly posing a bulk term, without distinguishing effects of stress from temperature  this is unfortunate and hence, we designed a testing program with the intension of separating and quantifying effects of temperature and stress, specifically for the sandstone material subject to this study   1  introduction  increasing interest in high pressure, high temperature (hpht) petroleum reservoirs, increases demand for theories and supporting experimental data, capable of describing effects of testing temperature on properties of reservoir material   as the north sea is geologically undergoing subsidence, sampled material has never experienced higher stress and temperature conditions than its in-situ conditions  in-situ stress and temperature conditions hence represent a physical boundary when testing, and higher or lower temperatures and stresses may not affect material properties in identical ways or to the same extent   contemplating the materials geological history, we designed a testing program for sandstone samples, collected in a north sea hpht reservoir with the intension of investigating effects of testing temperature on the materials dynamic poroelastic properties  thus, in the effective hydrostatic stress regime from 2 to 15 mpa, corresponding to a maximum effective stress approximately 1/3 of in-situ we measured p- and s-wave moduli at temperature conditions below and equal to in-situ (165°c) | 
2017-0108 	 modeling of tensile and compressive damage in layered sedimentary rock: a direction dependent non-local model |abstract: this paper presents the theoretical formulation and numerical implementation of an anisotropic damage model for materials with intrinsic transverse isotropy, e g  sedimentary rocks with a bedding plane  the direction dependent mechanical response is captured by utilizing four types of equivalent strains, for tension and compression, parallel and perpendicular to the bedding plane  the model is calibrated against triaxial compression test data, for different confinement and loading orientations  the variations of uniaxial tensile and compressive strengths with the orientation of the loading relative to the bedding follow the trends and magnitudes noted in experiments  anisotropic non-local equivalent strains were used in the formulation to avoid localization and mesh dependence encountered with strain softening  two different internal length parameters are used to distinguish the non-local effects along and perpendicular to the bedding  an arc length control algorithm is used to avoid convergence issues  results of three-point bending tests confirm that the nonlocal approach indeed eliminates mesh dependency  results show that the orientation and size of the damage process zone are direction dependent, and that materials with intrinsic transverse isotropy exhibit mixed fracture propagation modes except when the bedding aligns with the loading direction  further research towards a multiscale hydro-mechanical fracture propagation scheme is undergoing   1  introduction  modeling fracture propagation in sedimentary rocks requires complex coupled constitutive equations to account for both intrinsic and stress-induced anisotropy, and regularized numerical methods to avoid mesh size dependence due to strain softening  experiments revealed that rock maximum axial compressive strength is reached when weak planes are either parallel or perpendicular to the loading direction, and minimum strength is reached when weak planes are orientated 30° –60° with respect to the loading direction (donath, 1961; niandou et al , 1997; pietruszczak and mroz, 2001)  in indirect tensile tests, the tensile strength is maximum when tensile stress is applied within the weak plane, and gradually decreases as the orientation angle between the tensile stress direction and the bedding plane increases (mahjoub et al , 2015)  state-of-the-art constitutive models are either based on continuum damage mechanics (cdm) or micromechanics  in cdm, damage criteria and evolution laws for anisotropic materials depend on a second order fabric tensor to account for the direction dependency (pietruszczak et al , 2007)  in micromechanics models, the expression of the free energy is obtained by solving a matrix-inclusion problem for a given set of crack families  depending on the homogenization scheme, crack interaction may or may not be accounted for  intrinsic anisotropy is accounted for by attributing different properties to crack families of different orientations (chen et al , 2012)  once implemented in a finite element (fe) code, both cdm and micromechanics models suffer from mesh dependence if strain softening is considered for compression/tension  several localization limiters can be used, e g  the crack band theory, a non-local integration- based formulation or non-local differentiation-based formulation  however, the non-local effects of intrinsic anisotropy are usually not accounted for | 
2017-0110 	 experimental study of radial drilling-fracturing for coalbed methane |abstract: radial drilling-fracturing, the integration of radial drilling and hydraulic fracturing, is an innovative approach to develop coalbed methane (cbm)  the objective of this article is to investigate fracture initiation and propagation characteristics for different radial borehole parameters  we conducted experiments using a true tri-axial fracturing simulation system under different lateral lengths, counts and azimuths  high-rank coals from the outcrop were used as the raw samples for the experiments  results show that: the best effect is achieved when it initiates from the bedding plane where the laterals lie and forms a fracture network with one main horizontal fracture connecting multiple vertical fractures; the breakdown and injection pressure decrease with the lateral length and count increasing; increasing the lateral length enlarges the horizontal fracture area; and the optimal lateral design for horizontal initiation is four laterals with the phase of 90° and each lateral is at 45° from the horizontal in-situ stress  the key findings of this work could provide critical insights into understanding radial drilling-fracturing characteristics   1  introduction  radial drilling is a technology that is able to make a right turn in a cased wellbore (vertical, slanted, or horizontal well) and then penetrate some distance out into the formation (balch et al , 2016; w dickinson and dickinson, 1985; wade dickinson et al , 1993)  the drilling tools can be high-pressure water jet, called radial-jet-drilling (rjd) (wang et al , 2016), as well as mechanical drill bit (balch et al , 2016)  the formed radial laterals, with radius of 20–50 mm and length of 10–100 m, distributing in one layer or multiple layers, can penetrate the near well damage zone, communicate with the formation far from the main well (cinelli and kamel, 2013; ragab, 2013), avoid fluid invasion damage during hydraulic fracturing (ren et al , 2016) and increase productivity with low cost   radial drilling-fracturing, the integration of radial drilling and hydraulic fracturing, is an innovative approach to develop low permeability, thin target layer, naturally fractured reservoir, water flooded “dead oil area” and lithological trap reservoir, etc (guo et al , 2016; megorden et al , 2013)  as illustrated in fig  1, 8 radial laterals, distributing in two layers, are drilled from the main vertical well, and then hydraulic fracturing are operated with various fractures initiating and propagating from these radial boreholes | 
2017-0111 	 non-local micromechanical anisotropic damage modeling for quasi-brittle materials: formulation and implementation |abstract: a nonlocal anisotropic damage model is proposed for quasi-brittle materials, such as concrete and rock  the local anisotropic damage model is formulated by combining a free energy derived from micromechanics with phenomenological yield criteria and damage potentials  the trace of the total strain is used to distinguish tensile and compressive loading paths, and to account for the influence of the confining pressure on the propagation of compression cracks  yield criteria in tension and compression are expressed in terms of equivalent strains, which depend on the difference between principal strain components  a non-local measure of strain is used to avoid localization  constitutive parameters are calibrated against published experimental data for concrete and shale  simulations of three-point bending tests show that non-local enhancement is necessary and efficient to avoid mesh dependency upon strain softening  simulations of borehole excavation damage zone show that the damage model is not mesh dependent upon stress hardening  numerical predictions are in agreement with experimental observations and the model can capture unilateral effects, tensile softening, compressive hardening and confinement dependent compressive behavior   1  introduction  it is still a challenge to formulate a constitutive model that captures damage induced anisotropy and stiffness reduction, unilateral effects due to crack closure and a transition from brittle to ductile behavior at increasing confining stress (krajcinovic et al , 1991; chiarelli et al , 2003)  what is the most appropriate way to express the free energy so that the direction dependence of crack inception and propagation can be captured? how to define the anisotropic damage variable to ensure straightforward physical interpretation and efficient computation: a second order or fourth order damage tensor (leckie et al , 1981), or discrete crack densities (jin & arson, 2017)? how to address the salient material behavior differences between compressive and tensile loading (lubarda et al , 1994; comi & perego, 2001)? in the case of stain softening behavior, what are the best techniques to regularize localization problems: the crack band theory (bazant & oh, 1983), the strain gradient (geers et al , 1998) or an integration based nonlocal approach (pijaudier-cabot & bazant, 1987)?| 
2017-0119 	 cutting forces estimation with non-euclidean model of inelastic deformations applied to rock cutting |abstract: in cases where stresses are as high as the tensile strength, rock behaviour cannot be explained by the classical theory of continuum in a heterogeneous rock structure  in particular, rock fracturing may be accompanied by zonal disintegration of the formation   the key to building the non-classic model of rock fracturing is a structure with grain boundaries  deformations of solid bodies with microscopic flaws can be described within the scope of non-euclidean geometry, where non-trivial deformation incompatibility can be referred to as a fracture parameter   the new continuum model [1, 2] presented in this paper enables prediction of the fractured zones that are initializing and developing as a periodic structure  the non-euclidean description of the phenomenon leads to the appearance of two unusual material constants that, by analogy with classic model, can be called “inelastic” moduli  the coupled model must comprise the fourth-order parabolic equation on disintegration thermodynamic parameter to be solved with the classical hyperbolic system of equations for the continuous medium dynamics   in the classic approach to the rock cutting problem, it is difficult to predict a chip size because the failure criterion is beyond the model, while the suggested non-euclidean model enables such a prediction [3]   in this paper, a dynamic non-euclidean model of zonal disintegration is applied to rock cutting analysis to determine the lateral and axial cutting forces and their dependence on cutter velocity and depth of cut   1  introduction  an important aspect of rock fracturing while drilling with pdc bits is the distance from a bit center to the center of a cutter  a slight change in this distance significantly affects the linear velocities for the cutter  figure 1 shows that the cutters’ linear velocities vary greatly for a given bit profile   this reality raises the issue of how the cutter velocity affects the cutting forces and how the cutter velocity differences affect bit dynamics  under the common approach, the force applied to a single cutter depends on its area of cut and back rake as well as the material parameters of rock and environment conditions such as pressure [4]  the factor of linear velocity, when calculating axial and lateral cutting forces, is neglected | 
2017-0122 	 3d finite element modeling of thermally-induced stress during a cryogenic fracturing experiment |abstract: in this study, 3d finite element models are developed to investigate thermally induced stress fields during cryogenic thermal stimulation using liquid nitrogen (ln2)  laboratory tests using ln2 as a fracturing fluid were carried out on concrete, sandstone, and shale samples under confined and unconfined conditions  these tests indicated different fracturing patterns  3d finite element modeling of the laboratory tests was conducted to predict and analyze the stress behaviors around the wellbore  the combination of laboratory experiments and the 3d finite element modeling provided insight into the potential for cryogenic thermal fracturing in unconventional reservoirs  three different types of specimen blocks were modeled  these concrete, sandstone, and multi-layer shale blocks were subjected to cryogenic thermal treatments to obtain the temperature and stress profiles and how they are influenced by the formation stiffness  results show that model developed was successful in simulating the experimental outcomes and observations indicating distribution of high tensile stresses in tangential and longitudinal directions around the wellbore at <u+2212>321° f  the results of this paper help in understanding the mechanisms of complex fractures created by thermal shock around the wellbore in reservoirs settings   1  introduction  cryogenic fracturing is the act of creating fractures by introducing very low temperature liquids into a warmer formation rock under reservoir conditions  this sudden heat transfer will cause the face of the rock to shrink, which will eventually cause the rock to fail in tension (wang et  al, 2016 and cha et al, 2014)   king (1983) examined the use of gelled liquid carbon dioxide to stimulate dry gas sand formations  king notes that carbon dioxide returns to the gaseous phase at formation conditions and does not cause sloughing or swelling effects in low permeable water-sensitive formations  in another study, grundmann et al  (1998) treated a devonian shale well with cryogenic nitrogen and observed an initial production rate 8% higher than the rate in an offset well that had been stimulated with nitrogen gas  although the increased initial production rate in this research suggests the efficacy of cryogenic fracturing, there could be a number of reasons why an offset well in a shale formation might produce differentially including anisotropic stress conditions and heterogeneous reservoir conditions over short distances  mcdaniel et al  (1997) conducted simple laboratory studies where coal samples were immersed in cryogenic nitrogen  the coal samples experienced significant shrinkage and fractured into smaller cubicle units, with the creation of microfractures orthogonal to the surface exposed to the cold fluid  the researchers found that repeated exposure cycles to the cryogen caused the coal to break into smaller and smaller pieces, becoming rubblelized  if the creation of fractures due to thermal stresses can occur in coal bed formations, it may have the potential to occur in other types of rock as well | 
2017-0123 	 study of the influence of pre-existing bedding planes and faults on hydraulically induced fracture propagation in shale-gas reservoirs |abstract: the focus of the present study is how existing pre-existing bedding planes and faults influence fracture propagation during a hydraulic fracturing operation  hydraulic fracturing is studied by water injection into a 2 m vertical fracture, which will be called the injection fracture  three scenarios were considered: in scenario 1, a shale-gas reservoir with a thickness of 20 m located between two confining formations each with 15 m thickness, is considered; in scenario 2, in addition to previous scenario, a horizontal bedding plane located above the injection fracture tip, is considered; in scenario 3, in addition to scenario 1, a pre-existing fault with a dip angle of 60°, located near the injection fracture, is considered  changes in pore pressure and permeability caused by the interaction between the propagating fracture and those pre-existing geological structures, were evaluated  results show that the fracture propagation is not influenced by the bedding plane because the slip displacement is not enough to lead to a significant pore pressure decrease and interrupt the propagating fracture  consequently, at the injection fracture, changes in pore pressure and permeability are very similar to those obtained without the bedding plane  the pre-existing fault was found to limit the fracture propagation because of fault reactivation with shear failure  this led to a smaller increase in injection fracture permeability and a slight higher injection pressure than that observed in scenario 1   1  introduction  the complexity in the shale-gas formation, such as anisotropic in situ stress state, the spatial variability of rock mass properties (e g , permeability, porosity and elastic modulus, density) (gu et al , 2008; hanson et al , 1980), the existence of multi-layers (lamont and jessen, 1963), the existence of layer interfaces (teufel and clark, 2010), may significantly influence the propagation of fractures in shale-gas reservoirs  undesirable hydraulic fracturing results will not only cause economic loss but may also increase the risk of environment pollution, such as water contamination caused by the hydraulically induced fractures penetrating into groundwater layer  thus, it is important to be able to predict the initiation and propagation of hydraulic fractures with complex geological structures and stress conditions | 
2017-0125 	 an estimated method of intact rock strength using gaussian process regression |abstract: during excavation of rock tunnels or construction of underground openings, estimating and determining the intact rock strength is of vital importance  theoretical and practical methods for estimating intact rock strength were developed during past rock engineering practices, for example, determining <u+03c3>1 from <u+03c3>2 and <u+03c3>3  while, random uncertainty inherently exists in intact rock strength  the existing methods for estimating intact rock strength seldom take this kind uncertainty into consideration  in the paper an estimated method of intact rock strength using gaussian process regression (gpr) is proposed to consider the uncertainty  gpr is a nonparametric probabilistic modeling approach  and the parameter determined from given data sets obeys gaussian distribution  the capability of gpr for estimating <u+03c3>1 from given <u+03c3>2 and <u+03c3>3 is examined  variance and 95 percent confidence interval of the predicted intact rock strength are obtained from the proposed estimated method using gpr  to validate the efficiency of the proposed estimated method using gpr modelling approach, comparative studies have been conducted with the predicted results from the four isrm suggested three-dimensional failure criteria  the results show that the proposed estimated method using gpr modelling approach is a promising and reliable tool for estimating the strength of intact rocks   1  introduction  a concerned problem regarding to excavation of rock tunnels, open pit excavation and construction of underground openings in the rocks, is to keep the surrounding rock stable  among the factors associated with the stability of surrounding rocks is the strength of intact rocks under the confining pressures, especially for the rock engineering practices conducted in deep buried depth  when it comes to determining strength of the rock masses, the intact rock strength is usually indispensable as well  therefore, the prediction of the intact rock strength under different confining stresses is of vital importance (asadi et al , 2011)  quick and precise estimation of the intact rock strength, partially instead of the time-consuming direct measurement, is always desired  theoretical and practical methods for estimating the intact rock strength are developed during the preceding rock engineering practices (edelbro, 2003) | 
2017-0129 	 the effect of mechanically and chemically generated barite nanoparticles on the reduction of fluid filtrate |abstract: this paper investigates the effect of using barite nanoparticles (nps) in water based mud (wbm) on fluid loss reduction  experimental testing at different concentrations and at various permeable media sizes was performed with chemically synthesized and mechanically generated nps to determine the effect on decreasing fluid loss  all experiments were conducted using a standard api fluid loss apparatus  it was observed that increasing the nanoparticle concentration results in a significant decrease in fluid loss for both mechanically generated and chemically synthesized nanoparticles  the results show that chemical nanoparticles have a greater effect at reducing fluid loss than the mechanically generated nanoparticles  the observations realized are critical in application, both operationally and environmentally  maximizing the filtration reduction of wbm into shale intervals while drilling can reduce swelling and sloughing of the formation, preventing drilling operations from being hindered  likewise, this is mutually beneficial for the environment by preventing shallow water contamination through drilling fluid loss or filtration  the novelty of this research is a further understanding of the ability to use barite nps in wbm, whether chemically or mechanically generated, and how each delivers a reduction in fluid filtrate for a given permeable media   1  introduction  the use of nanotechnology within the oil and gas industry has become more widespread over the last decade  in recent years, nano-science was predominantly employed within other industries outside of oil and gas  with beneficial properties that enhance durability, repelling effects, drug delivery and electronics (hoelscher 2012 & bell 2004), numerous businesses such as healthcare, defense, and coating industries realized the advantages of utilizing this technology  the fundamental benefits of utilizing nanotechnology within the oil and gas industry became of great interest as more and more hydrocarbon plays transitioned to unconventional areas  most of these locations were found at deeper depths, increased pressures, and higher temperatures  all of these factors contribute to the hostility that the drilling and production equipment encounter, which in return, increases the cost of operating and extends the need to push these materials to their functional limitations  nanotechnology has proven in many years past to be a great material additive in operational fluids (i e  drilling, production and workover fluids) to deal with such conditions  the ability to engineer nanoparticles to a certain particle size, shape, size distribution, crystalline structure and composition provides the features needed to evaluate the various ways nanoparticles can be implemented into drilling and production operations (horikoshi 2013)  moreover, the ability for nanoparticle based fluids to be tailored in regards to rheology, while remaining stable at higher temperatures and pressures, permits optimization for a rampant amount of applications (abdo 2013 & kasiralvalad 2014) | 
2017-0132 	 stress-dependent permeability of sorptive reservoirs incorporating postfailure behavior |abstract: increased coal permeability with continued gas production from coalbed methane reservoirs, typically encountered in the san juan basin, has been explained by the phenomenon of matrix shrinkage, which results in opening up the fracture system and promoting flow  recently, sudden permeability jumps have been observed in the deeper part of the basin after significant drawdown  the behavior has been explained by the desorption induced loss of horizontal stress, resulting in stress anisotropy and shear failure of coal  the permeability models currently used are capable of predicting coal permeability prior to failure, that is, in the elastic zone, but not beyond that  this paper is an attempt towards developing a permeability model beyond the linear elastic behavior of coal in the reservoir  the model is able to predict the sudden uptick in permeability with increased dilatancy and coal failure  at this time, the permeability model is empirical, and piece-wise for the three zones: elastic, dilatancy and post-failure  the model is able to match experimental data available for san juan coal well  advancing the model would not only enable prediction of coal permeability over the entire life of a producing reservoir but it can be extended to shale gas formations as well   1  introduction and background  the performance of a reservoir depends largely on its permeability, which, in turn, changes dynamically over the life of a reservoir  the permeability change in sorptive rocks, like coal and shale formations, is even more significant compared to conventional reservoirs given their unique gas storage characteristics, where a significant portion of the gas is in adsorbed state  in coalbed methane (cbm) reservoirs, it is well accepted that permeability is dependent on two different dynamics affecting the reservoir simultaneously  first, the mean effective stress increases with depletion, inducing compaction in the reservoir and leading to a decrease in the permeability  second, with depletion in cbm reservoirs, coal matrix shrinks, resulting in relaxation of the matrix and, hence, increased permeability  these two processes are dominant in the elastic deformation of the reservoir  there have been several studies and permeability models published in the literature, coupling the two phenomena for elastic deformation in cbm reservoirs (cui and bustin, 2005; liu et al , 2012; palmer et al , 2009; sawyer et al , 1990; shi and durucan, 2010, 2005, 2004) | 
2017-0133 	 modeling of a clay-rock repository for nuclear waste with a coupled chemo-mechanical approach |abstract: in order to understand and to predict the response of ebs, we simulate a clay-rock repository case considering chemo-mechanical coupling, in which chemical changes affect the mechanical behavior of the bentonite through the evolution of volume fraction of smectite, exchangeable cation concentration, and ionic strength (via osmotic suction)  the mechanical model for the buffer is based on an existing double-structure formulation that accounts for the deformations at two structure levels, microstructure and macrostructure  chemical effects are defined and coupled with the mechanical model at the microstructural level  this new model is implemented into a numerical simulator based on sequential coupling of the reactive transport simulator toughreact and the geomechanical simulator flac3d  the simulator denoted toughreact-flac is used to model the ebs behavior to predict the effects of chemical reactions on the stress evolution for generic case of a repository in a clay host rock  the simulation results illustrate the phenomenon of chemical-mechanical interactions and geomechanical performance of the repository to evaluate the potential deterioration of ebs bentonite, and to support the decision making in the design of a nuclear waste repository   1  introduction  engineered barrier systems (ebs) are designed to isolate the high-level radioactive waste emplaced in tunnels in deep geological formations  the heat emanated from the waste can drive the moisture flow transport, induce coupled chemo-mechanical processes within the system, and may also impact the evolution of the excavation disturbed zone and the sealing between the buffer and walls of an emplacement tunnel  rocks with low permeability and low diffusion coefficient are considered as host rock for geological disposal  potential host rocks include granite (gens et al , 2009), salt rock (blanco-martin et al , 2015; zhu and arson, 2014) and clay/shale formations (gens et al , 2007; rutqvist et al , 2014)  bentonite-based clays are chosen as the buffer in ebs because of several favorable properties such as its swelling capability when hydrating  this characteristic of bentonite can provide a swelling stress and support on the wall of emplacement tunnels that reduces the effects of fractures on bulk permeability and is of particular importance for the sealing and healing of disturbed rock zones  however, the induced chemical alteration of bentonite-based buffer through illitization may compromise the function of these ebs components by reducing their plasticity and capability to swell under wetting | 
2017-0135 	 development of a slope-monitoring 3d-ict system using construction information modeling/management concepts and the introduction to construction sites |abstract: in the construction of artificial slopes in landslide areas, soft-ground areas, and urban areas, it is important to place multiple surface and underground sensors in response to geology and displacement characteristics of the area and to identify the changes in the area over time  accordingly, we have developed a three-dimensional information and communication technology (3d-ict) system that shows various measurement data in real time on a website and determines the overall ground stability using a newly developed evaluation technique  this report outlines the system, the gives examples of application to open-cut excavation and tunnel construction, and presents details of the system using construction information modeling/management concepts   1  introduction  the deformation and failure of slopes are important considerations in excavation under difficult ground conditions such as in areas with soft ground, in areas prone to landslides, and in urban areas with neighboring constructions  therefore, to evaluate the stability of rock slopes and ensure the safety of a construction, many sensors are typically placed to monitor the condition of the ground as the construction progresses   however, it is difficult to integrate data processing with a variety of measuring instruments that are supplied by different manufacturers and placed on the ground and underground  furthermore, quick and comprehensive processing of measurement data is absolutely imperative for understanding the situation when slope deformation or failure occurs as a result of rain or an earthquake, but a problem with conventional systems is that they require a long time to comprehensively evaluate stability when data from different measuring instruments must be processed separately  to solve this problem, we have developed a slope-measuring three-dimensional information and communication technology (3d-ict) system, called the hazama ando automatic monitoring system (hamonis), that can handle various measuring instruments and that integrates the measurement data and provide them over the internet in real time (see fig  1) | 
2017-0136 	 stress perturbations and microseismicity induced by hydraulic fracturing |abstract: hydraulic fracturing induced microseismicity is often attributed to pore pressure changes alone thereby neglecting the role of elastic stress perturbations due to fracture opening  here we show how fracture opening affects the in situ elastic stresses and the pore pressure diffusion profiles, and subsequently potential of shear slippages along pre-existing fault planes  we compute the coulomb failure function for a stationary hydraulic fracture by combining the elastic stress perturbations due to opening of the fracture and the pore pressure changes due to fluid diffusion in the surrounding rock  results show that for a fixed length of hydraulic fracture, the first events in time occur near the crack tip region where the coulomb stress changes are positive due to elastic stress perturbations  the pore pressure diffusion subsequently leads to microseismic events near the fracture face where elastic stress perturbations have a stabilizing effect  thus the elastic stress changes ahead of the crack tip due to fracture opening facilitate failure and this process affects the spatio-temporal distributions of microseismicity   1  introduction  hydraulic fracturing in unconventional hydrocarbon reservoirs like shales and tight sands open cracks and fractures thereby enhancing permeability and subsequent hydrocarbon production  the creation/reactivation of a fracture network perturbs in situ stresses causing small energy release in the form of microseismic events  monitoring of these microseismic events helps in spatial mapping of the hydraulic fractures (rutledge and phillips, 2003; maxwell et al , 2002; cipolla et al , 2011)  the spatio-temporal patterns of microseismic clouds around hydraulic fractures can reveal features of the various physical processes active during hydraulic fracturing   most studies of injection induced seismicity assume that the changes in pore pressure alone are responsible for triggering seismicity (pearson, 1981; shapiro et al , 2002)  in this study we show the impact of the opening of a hydraulic fracture on in situ stresses and pore pressure diffusion profile and subsequently on the observed microseismicity  we compute the coulomb failure function on pre-existing faults due to a stationary hydraulic fracture modeled as a penny shaped (oblate spheroidal) cavity filled with fluid at uniform pressure  the elastic stress changes are computed using eshelby’s equivalent inclusion method whereas pore pressure diffusion profiles are generated by considering the fluid filled cavity as the source  for a stationary fracture we show that the first events occur close to the crack tip region  furthermore the microseismic cloud mimics the shape of the hydraulic fracture especially close to its surface | 
2017-0137 	 large-scale experimental investigation of refracture reorientation and field evaluation in sand reservoir |abstract: in situ stress disturbance due to initial fracture existing would make refracture propagation more complex  in this paper mechanics analysis and numerical simulation based on boundary element method have been done to caculate refracture morphology under the altered-stress condition and discusses related influencing factors  then both of large scale experiment in lab and tiltmeter monitoring in field confirmed fracture reorientation  it showed there were three possible refrac results: (a) a new fracture would initiate at some angles even orthogonal to the azimuth of the initial fracture which is closed  (b) the initial fracture would reopen firstly and a new fracture would initiate at some angles subsequently  (c) instead of new fracture initiation, the initial fracture would reopen and reorient along the direction of maximum stress  the initial and reversal stresses, rock tensile strength, young modulus, fracture toughness and pumping parameters determine refrac results together  field test also confirmed temporary plugging could make multiple fractures initiation to increase drainage area and enhance well production in refracturing  although a part of the experimental settings is prepared for the special oilfield in china, the conclusions drawn in this study are rather general for refracturing design   1  introduction  as the crude oil price is depressing in the recent years, refracturing is playing more and more important role in enhancing oil recovery and lowing development cost for many international oil companies[1-3]  especially for unconventional reservoirs, due to the ultra-low permeability, the well production keeping stable yield is difficult after first fracturing and it decreases severely in short term  in order to boost oil or gas flowing channels, improve the reservoir producing reserve, and enhance the oil or gas well ability of stable production for longer period, refracturing treatment is the first choice   elbel [4] proposed the mechanism of in situ stress field redistribution around refracturing wells  it said that the existence of initial fracture and the pore pressure decreasing due to production would cause the changing of the in situ stress direction and value around the wellbore  in extreme conditions, the reversal of the maximum and minimum horizontal principal stress direction could occur  then the initiation and propagation of refracture would become more complicated  siebrits [5] established a three-dimensional numerical model to simulate the disturbing in situ stress field and analyzed the sensitivity factors effecting on the disturbed stress caused by pore pressure  the optimization principles for refracturing wells were also discussed  wei-ping du [6], liu hong [7], yongquan hu [8], nicolas [9] established more advanced three-dimensional numerical model, and introduced the factor of initial fracture opening into the model  so much more comprehensive studies about the influence on the re-orientation stress field were conducted  liu[10], sieberits[11] have studied the refracture propagating path under changed in-situ stress conditions according to physical simulation experiment and field refracturing monitoring  through the analysis of well production, it confirmed the re-orientation of refractures could help enhancing the well performance | 
2017-0138 	 microstructural evolution of organic matter-rich shales by ionic solutions |abstract: despite the significant hydrocarbon production from unconventional shale resources in the last decade, hydration induced mechanical responses of shales especially at micro-scale level is not yet fully understood  such mechanical responses especially to hydraulic fracturing fluids control the leak-off rate and near fracture permeability evolution and therefore is crucial for hydrocarbon production  therefore, we ran a series of systematic experiments by exposing organic matter rich shale samples to ionic solutions (nacl, kcl, mgcl2 and cacl2) with different concentrations (0 2, 1 and 2m) at controlled temperature  images of the samples at their initial and wet states (exposed to ionic solutions for 7 hrs at 25 °c temperature) were taken using environmental electron microscope  the image processing was performed to register the images and extract the evolved features  digital image correlation was further employed to calculate the strain field developed by change in sample structure in order to investigate the likelihood of micro-fracture development  from the results of this study, it was found that a) the sample exposed to 0 2m nacl solution experienced the most significant micro-structural changes especially clay hydration while the sample exposed to 0 2m cacl2 solution almost showed no changes, b) the sample exposed to 0 2m kcl solution on the other hand showed no/little swelling but its pore space was increased, c) surprisingly the micro-structural changes were more pronounced at 1 0m concentration of all ionic solutions especially for those with divalent ions, d) digital image correlation analysis confirmed that micro-fracture development is more likely to occur when the sample is exposed to solutions of monovalent ions in particular nacl   1  introduction  despite long-time research carried out on clay rich sediments, the micro-structural evolution of these types of rocks when exposed to different ionic solutions has not been yet fully understood  understanding such micro-structural evolution has wide range of applications in many engineering disciplines such as petroleum engineering [1, 2], nuclear waste disposal [3] and groundwater investigation [4]  this is especially pronounced for hydraulic fracturing operation as one of the key requirements for development of many unconventional resources  among several examples, the low recovery of hydraulic fracturing fluid in unconventional shale reservoirs and its link to microstructural alteration is of great interest [5, 6] | 
2017-0139 	 key parameters controlling slotting operations to stimulate gas drainage performance in low permeability coal seams |abstract: coal mining is extending to deeper and deeper levels, facing ever increasing coal seam methane contents and much higher methane emissions at production districts  the low permeability nature of coal seams exacerbates with the stress increase at deeper levels  this growing challenge is often not addressed effectively by the current gas drainage methods applied in coal mines  in recent years, slotting via hydraulic or mechanical force along underground gas drainage boreholes, as a general solution to stimulate low permeability coal reservoirs, has attracted increasingly attention  however, the role of prevailing stress state, coal properties, and slot geometry are the critical parameters to be considered in slotting operations  there has been no systematic research on assessing these key parameters and understanding the sensitivity of individual parameters in affecting slotting performance  by quantitatively assessing a series of numerical modelling scenarios, this paper aims at identifying the key parameters controlling slotting operation, analysing the sensitivity of individual parameters, and optimising slotting operation  internal friction angle, slot diameter and the ratio of the maximum principal stress to minimum principal stress have been identified as the top three parameters affecting slotting performance   1  introduction  coal mining is extending to deeper and deeper levels, facing ever increasing coal seam methane contents and much higher methane emissions at production districts  increased gas content of coal seams with depth, and the introduction of concentrated coal exploitation within the last 15 years, has been the major reason for the increase of methane emissions  the increased release of methane observed with increasing depth is not only a serious safety risk, but also represents a problem for coal production, as it limits the advance rates of both headings and longwalls   it has been recognised that gas drainage boreholes deployed from the underground and/or surface to capture coal seam gas before it migrates into the ventilation air or atmosphere provide a feasible solution to the gas emission problem  the primary limitation of applying methane drainage systems to reduce emissions in coal mining comes from the low permeability nature of coal seam reservoirs  for example, except for the qinshui basin, coal permeability in china, the largest coal producer and consumer in the world, is generally very low (1<u+00d7>10<u+2212>19 – 1<u+00d7>10<u+2212>18 m2), about four orders of magnitude lower than that of some us coals (cheng et al , 2011)  in some european coal basins, the permeability is reported to be as low as 10<u+2212>21 m2, and normally in the range of 1<u+00d7>10<u+2212>17 – 1<u+00d7>10<u+2212>12 m2 (durucan and edwards, 1986)  gas pre-drainage from boreholes drilled into these low permeability coal seams becomes ineffective due to extremely low gas flow rates  this situation may be further exacerbated since the average low life-span of underground drainage boreholes seriously limits the drainage time | 
2017-0144 	 continued hydraulic fracture growth after well shut-in |abstract: a hydraulic fracture does not immediately stop and close at the time of well shut-in, but keeps growing and stays open for certain time after the end of the treatment  in this paper, we study the dynamics of continued hydraulic fracture propagation in rocks followed by subsequent fracture closure for different parametric regimes of fracture propagation  because of possible deviation from a viscosity-dominated regime, we revisit the classical pkn model of hydraulic fracture by including the influence of fracture toughness of rock  that allows us to keep track of the time interplay between all volume and energy components, including viscous and surface dissipation rates  depending on the parameters of fluid injection and rock, after the pumps are stopped, a hydraulic fracture continues to grow  after the termination of growth, the fracture stays statically open for a limited time, which is indicated by a specific signature in the wellbore pressure record  the final stage of fracture closing is associated with the heterogeneous fracture closure from the tip to inlet   1  introduction  hydraulic fracturing is widely used to increase transmissivity of reservoir fluids from rock to a fractured well (valko and economides, 1995; economides and nolte, 2000)  to create the hydraulic fractures, the fluids are pumped into a wellbore from surface using the high- pressure pumps  during the fluid injection, the hydraulic fracture is entirely mechanically open and readily transports the injected fluids and proppants along the fracturing path  after the injection is finished, the fracture aperture gradually decreases  rigorous fracture modeling shows that after shut-in the fracture does not close immediately but stays open for a noticeable amount of time (detournay et al , 1990; garagash, 2006; lakirouhani et al , 2016)  the duration of “open fracture life” is important for stimulation treatment because only in this period may the fracture continue propagating, keep and transport significant fluid volumes inside  such a transient fracture behavior is important for flowback operation too  the recovery of injected water may depend on the time of flowback, fracture length, opening and storage volume | 
2017-0147 	 the effect of barite nanoparticles on the friction coefficient and rheology of water based mud |abstract: complex directional and horizontal well trajectories result in high torque and drag forces  the increase in these forces decreases the transfer efficiency of energy, which limits the potential depth the drill string and tubulars can reach  this paper illustrates the benefit of incorporating barite nanoparticles (np) into water based mud (wbm)  two formulations of 10 ppg api standard barite wbm with different rheologies were utilized as base cases  chemical and mechanical methods of barite np generation were used  this facilitated a better understanding of the effect of each np generation mechanism on the friction coefficient (cof)  the experiment speculated that nano sized particles can generate a smooth film that coats the surfaces resulting in friction reduction  np also increase mud rheology by providing more individual particles for a given concentration  this research aims to continue understanding barite np performance, behavior, and their effect on the cof and mud rheology for wbm systems  an application will be discussed in this paper to highlight the potential benefits   1  introduction  wbm is gaining more popularity worldwide  it has started to overtake the oil based mud (obm) market share  this trend is influenced by the changing in environmental regulations, cost and more importantly the advancements in wbm technology  developing wbm systems that match the performance of obm is demanded now more than ever  lubrication additives, borehole stabilizers, and enhanced high temperature polymers are all being sought (sifferman et al  2003)   the successful application of nanotechnology in medicine, electronics, paints, coatings, and many other fields motivated the oil industry to take the same path  reservoir data has also been gathered utilizing nano-sensors and nano-markers (hoelscher et al  2013)  these achievements have inspired the investigation of nano additives in drilling fluids in an attempt to address existing difficulties; namely shale inhibition, rheology modification, wellbore strengthening, and lubricity   a clear illustration of the importance of developing such innovative np wbm drilling fluids is the mitigation of the frictional forces in horizontal or extended reach wells  it can substantially increase the rig and equipment reach limit by efficiently transferring energy  a finite element analysis (fea) approach, taken by hareland, indicated the benefits gained by lowering cof in complex directional wells  as a sample illustration, a 3,900 ft of lateral extension were obtained while keeping torque, buoyancy and downhole weight on bit constant (hareland et al  2012) | 
2017-0150 	 creep of unconsolidated sand due to delayed grain breakage |abstract: hydrocarbon production or other activities involving extraction of underground fluids often cause surface subsidence with a time-lag  such delay is often attributed to the rate-dependent rheological behavior of reservoir rocks  this paper proposes a thermomechanical model able to capture the rate-dependent behavior of unconsolidated sand while tracking grain breakage processes at the microscale  the energetics of subcritical crack propagation at grain scale is firstly investigated and the characteristics of its dissipation function are observed  a similar strategy is then used to generalize the dissipation function of a continuum breakage model  the extended model is characterized by a mathematical structure resembling perzyna-type viscoplastic formulations and only involves two additional parameters, one controlling the magnitude of rate effects, and another coincident with the intrinsic corrosion index of the grain-forming mineral which controls both the intensity of the rate effects and the shape of the creep curves  the model is benchmarked against oedometric compression data for quartz sand  the predicted creep responses at various stress levels agree well with recorded measurements  in addition, the stress corrosion index indirectly calibrated from macroscopic data falls within the range observed from fracture tests on typical rock-forming minerals, thus corroborating the validity of the selected approach   1  introduction  surface subsidence due to extraction of hydrocarbons has been shown to contribute significantly to the land loss of coastal areas, thus exacerbating the impact of natural subsidence associated with sediment supply  a notable example is coastal louisiana, where surface subsidence and sea level rise have caused severe loss of vegetated land  with more than 2 million residents living in the coastal zone, it has been estimated that the land loss projected for the next 50 years will cost louisiana more than $37 billion [1]  the primary cause of such significant subsidence has been actively investigated during the last few decades  natural processes include compaction of holocene sediments deposited in the mississippi delta, lithospheric flexure due to the sediment load, and faulting activities [2, 3]  however, these processes are estimated to cause rates of subsidence lower than 5 mm/yr, which is significantly less than the observed rate of 9<u+02dc>23 mm/yr [4]  therefore, such mismatch is often attributed to the extensive oil and gas production activities characterizing the area  from a geomechanical perspective, the primary cause of surface deformation caused by fluid withdrawal is reservoir compaction due to effective stress increase during depletion  to tackle this problem, poroelastic analytical solutions have been developed by assuming a simple disk-shaped reservoir [5]  recent studies, however showed that the viscous rheological behavior of the reservoir rocks needs to be taken into account in order to explain the observed accelerated subsidence rate which has followed the peak production rate in this region [4]  multiple mechanisms have been proposed to explain the physical origin of such time-dependent process [4, 6, 7]  among them, creep of weakly consolidated formations is has been identified as one of the primary causes [8, 9]  such behavior has often been modeled through empirical or phenomenological models, as power law functions [7, 8, 10], viscoelastic models [9, 11, 12], and viscoplastic models [6]  however, few of these approaches have taken account for the particle-scale mechanisms that govern the macro-scale time effect | 
2017-0154 	 fluid injection in weakly-consolidated reservoirs: geomechanical implications and threats to seal rock integrity |abstract: this paper presents a novel study on geomechanics of fluid injection from a fully penetrating vertical wellbore into a weakly consolidated formation confined with soft rocks  for the first time, impacts of vertical confinement are incorporated to evaluate: flow-induced poro-elasto-plastic stresses, failure mechanism/s, and failure planes  a new fully-coupled numerical model is developed where the response of the injection layer in the plane perpendicular to injection flow is simulated through adopting “interface” – a plane on which sliding or separation can occur – analogous to the winkler model  an assessment of pore pressures, stresses, and failure planes confirms two types of induced behaviors: dilation in the well vicinity; and compaction, a main cause of physical clogging which impacts competence of the operation  numerical results describe multiple distinct zones evolving with time around the injection well: (1) liquefied domain, (2) multiple plastic domains, (3) elastic region  inner plastic domains are prone to occur   1  introduction  the geo-environmental consequences of injecting large volumes of fluids into geological strata – a common practice in enhanced oil recovery, geothermal exploitation, aquifer storage and recovery, and deep waste disposal operations – remain a topic of dispute  the very essence of a safe and sustainable operation is to be able to quantify and control the induced subsurface flow and deformations, specifically to ensure preservation of sealing integrity of the confining rocks  this involves a realistic grasp of the interactions between the injection layer and the sealing strata, which entails a comprehensive understanding of the involved geomechanical processes   numerical computation of the injection problem in a confined weakly-consolidated formation is challenging due to the following: strong coupling between the diffusional-mechanical processes; high fluid-solid matrix stiffness contrast; plasticity and parting, where the strength and stiffness of the medium become effectively zero  this results in numerical instabilities and a considerably long run time of simulations  a common simplifying assumption in most available work in the literature is plane strain conditions perpendicular to the injection flow  this assumption is most appropriate for a case where a weakly consolidated reservoir formation is confined with stiff sealing rocks  in cases where the sealing rocks are of a softer nature, or when the stiffness of the reservoir layer increases over time during prolonged injection cycles, the plane strain assumption is no longer appropriate and the overall response of the injection layer is indeed governed by the behavior of the confining strata | 
2017-0156 	 evaluation of rock bridges through dfn models to improve pit slope design in the absence of joint persistence data |abstract: pit slope design relies on appropriate selection of design strength parameters  this selection is not trivial given the inherent heterogeneity of rock masses  in strong rocks, step-path failures may develop through combination of planar shear along joints and failure through intact rock  the presence of rock bridges between discontinuities increases shear strength along potential failure surfaces  however, estimating rock bridge percentages is challenging in the absence of mapping and joint persistence information  the lack of joint continuity data is common to many open pit projects until construction begins and the rock masses are exposed  this paper describes the rock bridge characterization approach used for the proposed jay pit area of the ekati diamond mine, for which joint persistence data are not currently available  the approach involved developing a discrete fracture network (dfn) model to estimate the amount of intact rock between discontinuities as a percentage of the total failure surface length  the model used discontinuity orientation and spacing data from borehole drilling at the site, and discontinuity persistence data from wall mapping in a nearby pit  possible stepped failure paths were determined for various dfn model realizations, and rock bridge percentages were calculated along these paths  rock bridge statistics were applied in the stability assessment to steepen the recommended pit slopes by up to 6°  |1  introduction |as indicated by call and nicholas, 1978, a potential slope failure mode in jointed rock masses is a stepped path where the failure surface follows a combination of rock discontinuities  where intact rock is present between discontinuities (i e , rock bridges), the step-path surface must fail through the intact rock  while relatively small rock bridges of intact rock between otherwise continuous joints substantially increase strength, mapping of each joint and rock bridge is impossible on a practical basis (einstein et al , 1983)  when information on joint continuity is absent, before construction begins and the rock mass is exposed in the pit walls, alternative approaches are required to characterize rock bridging  one alternative approach consists in developing a discrete fracture network (dfn) model to estimate the percentage of intact rock between discontinuities  this method was used in the feasibility study for the jay pit at the ekati diamond mine in canada’s northwest territories | 
2017-0157 	 a study on fracture toughness of rock using double cantilever |abstract: rock fracture toughness testing has been widely studied in the past forty years  most previous testing used pillar-shaped rock specimen as a result of the inconvenience and difficulties in processing rock into other geometry  the development of diamond-impregnated wire saw for rock processing provides us the opportunity to get large quantities of notch-precisely-machined specimens, whose shape are double-cantilever-beam planks  the study here used double cantilever beam (dcb) testing to obtain highly repeatable values of rock fracture toughness  particle flow code 5 0 2d (pfc 2d) was used to simulate the whole testing process, on the other hand, the testing results were used to calibrate the pfc parameters in turn  conclusion shows that model i fracture toughness of longmaxi formation outcrop is around 1 55mnm-3/2  critical tensile force has positive correlation with width of notch/crack tip  the study also indicates that in pfc simulation, micro tensile strength among balls (pb_ten) determines both model i fracture toughness and uniaxial compression strength  the study may guide the drilling process in recognizing the strength of rock fracture and provide experiment-based fracture toughness for the simulation of fracturing process   1  introduction  fracture toughness of rock was scholars’ highly concern as most issues of rock mechanics are closely related to failure process, such as mining process and hydraulic fracturing, etc   lots of work has been done since the first suggested method of international society for rock mechanics for rock fracture toughness testing1 was published  since then, the testing method mentioned above is regarded as the standard method for static fracture toughness testing of rock  as the availability of pillar-shaped rock specimen, almost all the suggested methods used rock pillar to conduct fracture toughness testing  the machined specimen is shown in fig  1 (atkinson 1987)  in order to obtain the intrinsic fracturing property of rock, the notch of the specimen is machined to the shape of v or chevron  displacement and force used to calculate fracture toughness is recorded after the fracture propagates a small distance to form a natural sharp crack, and that is what the shape of notch used to  this elaborate design eliminates the influence of machined notch width on fracture toughness because that the ‘natural sharp crack’ is thought to be a parameter merely related to rock property | 
2017-0158 	 an improvement to unified size effect law for intact rock |abstract: while rock strength is an important input parameter in geotechnical engineering, the size effect of intact rock samples on strength has long been recognised as an issue  conventionally, it has been believed that increase in size leads to decrease in strength  a few investigations have reported different trend to that consider conventionally where the uniaxial compressive strength (ucs) follows ascending and descending behaviour  masoumi et al  [1] investigated this behaviour from analytical and experimental viewpoints that resulted in the formulation of the unified size effect law (usel) which accounts for the reverse size effect behaviour of intact rocks  a limitation of the current usel is that at very large sizes, the ucs prediction by usel tends to zero  this paper outlines an improvement to usel to overcome this limitation based on the multifractal theory  attributes of the improved usel model were highlighted and verified using ucs data from different rock types  finally, it was demonstrated that there is a good agreement between the improved usel prediction and the experimental results   1  introduction  size effect has been an important research issue in the general area of geomechanics where some investigations have focused on the mechanical properties of intact rock at different sizes  in this paper, the influence of three dimensional volumetric changes on the mechanical characteristics of intact rock is defined as the size effect   uniaxial compressive strength (ucs) is one of the most important mechanical properties of an intact rock which has long been studied by different researchers from the size effect viewpoint ([2-18])  generally, it is believed that increase in size leads to decrease in strength  initially, the size effect was explained by weibull [19] as on a statistic phenomenon, whereby larger samples contain more micro-cracks than a smaller sample and thus the probability of failure at lower stress is higher with a larger sample  in other words, increase in size causes reduction in strength  this trend has been confirmed by other theories including fracture energy [20] and multifractals [21] | 
2017-0160 	 elasticity, electrical conductivity and permeability in digital rocks: a comparative study using simpleware, nist, comsol multiphysics and lattice-boltzmann algorithms |abstract: we compare different algorithms and boundary conditions for digital rock physics modeling  we report results of simpleware, comsol and nist for elasticity and electrical conductivity and simpleware and lattice-boltzmann for permeability  overall there is good consistency, though there are sample-to-sample differences  the comparison shows a good agreement between simpleware and comsol with a difference of <u+02dc>1% for effective elastic properties, <u+02dc>1-3% for permeability and 5% for effective conductivity  the simpleware physics modules allow a streamlined workflow to compute effective properties and is especially suitable for processing a large number of digital samples  comsol multiphysics on the other hand allows more multiphysics coupling and access to internal field variables useful for research purposes  the nist codes for elasticity and electrical conductivity are very efficient but are specifically only for those two physical properties   1  introduction  computation of physical properties on 3-d ct-scanned digital rocks is used in geosciences applications, and a number of different workflows and algorithms have become available  we discuss a comparative study on elasticity and electrical conductivity in different rock types (figure 1) using simpleware, nist (national institute of standards and technology) and comsol multiphysics codes  permeability is also investigated using simpleware and lattice-boltzmann permeability simulators  the 3d ct-scan images of different rock types are sandstone (s2), berea sandstone, fontainebleau sandstone, carbonate (c1) and carbonate (c2), as well as digitized version of finney pack with identical spheres (figure 1)  the materials for the grains and pore-fill assumed for the study were water, quartz, and calcite (for the carbonate rocks), with the following elastic properties and conductivities:  2  volume meshing  2 1  simpleware (sw)  we import the 3d scan volumes of each sample in simpleware scanip (synopsys, mountain view, usa) for image processing and segmentation  since all of our 3d scan volumes are 100<u+00d7>100<u+00d7>100, each stack has 100 images of 100<u+00d7>100 size  we perform meshing using the simpleware +fe-free meshing algorithm with tetrahedral elements  for permeability, the simpleware physics modules +solid, +flow and +laplace are used with different mesh coarseness since the rock model is based on a pre-segmented image (a binary image without any greyscale information reflecting the sub-voxel geometry of the sample), it is best to select the “binarise before smoothing” option  in this way the meshing algorithm in simpleware does not try to use any spurious greyscale information that might have been introduced into masks by thresholding, and the generated mesh has porosity closer to that of the original image | 
2017-0163 	 x-ray micro ct for structural and compositional analysis of cores at different scales (dm -> <u+03bc>m) |abstract: in recent years use of x-ray computed tomography (ct) has become more common for geoscientific applications and is used from the <u+03bc>m-scale (e g  for investigations of micro-fossils or pore scale structures) up to the dm-scale (full drill cores or soil columns)  in this paper we present results from ct imaging and mineralogical investigations of an opalinus clay core on different scales and different regions of interest, emphasizing especially the 3d evaluation and distribution of cracks and fractures and their impact upon mechanical testing of such material  enhanced knowledge of the behaviour of the opalinus clay as a result of these tests is of great interest, especially since this material is considered for a long term radioactive waste disposal and storage facility in switzerland  hence, results are compared regarding the mineral (i e  phase) contrast resolution, the spatial resolution, and the overall scanning speed   with this extensive interdisciplinary top-down approach it has been possible to characterize the general fracture propagation in comparison to mineralogical and textural features of the opalinus clay  additionally, and to the best of our knowledge, a so called mylonitic zone has been observed for the first time in an experimentally deformed opalinus sample  the multi-scale results are in good accordance with data from naturally deformed opalinus clay samples, which allows systematic analysis under controlled laboratory conditions  accompanying 3d imaging greatly enhances the capability of data interpretation and assessment of such material   1  introduction  in this study we present the investigations of an experimentally deformed opalinus clay (opa, kaufhold et al , 2016)  the aim is the visualization of the shear failure at various scales to get more information about the deformation process  enhanced knowledge of the testing behaviour of the opa is of great interest, especially since this material is considered for a long term radioactive waste disposal and storage facility in switzerland   x-ray ct equipment are now frequently used for sample analysis because almost all geoscientific samples show 3d features which would be missed if analysing 2d sections only (e g  by classical microscopy)  these features include, for example, the abundance of minerals, location of particular particles towards bedding (or texture in general), pore system, cracks, and veins  the 3d distribution of these features can be extracted and used for a variety of numerical modelling purposes (andra et al , 2013) | 
2017-0164 	 wellbore integrity assessment considering casing-cement-formation interaction based on a probabilistic approach |abstract: this work presents a probabilistic analysis of wellbore integrity using analytical and numerical (finite element method - fem) approaches  the safety of the wellbore is evaluated through a casing integrity criterion  to evaluate the stresses considering the construction and production phases, the analytical solution considers the main steps of the wellbore lifespan: initial stress state in the formation, drilling operation, casing construction, initial stress state in the cement, pressure changes inside the casing and pore pressure variation  for both approaches, plane strain conditions, continuous homogeneous isotropic media and linear elastic materials are considered  although the model hypotheses are similar, the fem modeling allows the construction of a wellbore model with imperfections such as a cement channel  the uncertainties in the elastic parameters of casing, cement and formation are incorporated into the analysis using the amv+ and lhs methods  the failure criterion to assess loss of wellbore integrity is given in terms of the cumulative distribution curve  in addition, the most important variables are identified  with this information, it is possible to define a risk scenario, mitigation strategies and procedures for better data acquisition and monitoring during wellbore operation lifetime   1  introduction and literature review  in the oil industry, several hazards, such as gas migration (ravi et al , 2006 and martins et al , 1997), are related to wellbore construction and production  to overcome these problems, simple solutions considering the relevant aspects of the engineering systems are a good tool for a preliminary design for everyday scenarios   many studies have investigated the wellbore stresses during the wellbore lifespan  analytical solutions can reach good results and can simplify the assessment of the interaction between variables and their impact on the results  xu et al , 2015 present a solution considering the thick walled cylinder theory for casing, cement and formation with internal pressure acting inside the casing  for the contact between materials, a fully sticky condition is adopted  in addition, an instantaneous uniform temperature increment is applied to all materials | 
2017-0167 	 a rock mechanics laboratory characterization of vaca muerta formation |abstract: the vaca muerta formation has been under study as a potential shale reservoir since approximately 2007; however, the first well, targeting this formation, was drilled in 2010  during the last few years, many works showing different discoveries about vaca muerta mechanical rock properties have been published  all of them are an invaluable piece of work; nevertheless, they do not give a full characterization of vaca muerta mechanical rock properties  until today, many meters of core samples were recovered from vaca muerta formation and a complete set of rock mechanics laboratory tests have been performed on core plugs to accurately characterize all the parameters that governs the mechanical behavior of the rock  in addition, to further understand the variability in the mechanical response of the rock, changes in the setting up of the laboratory tests were done in similar plugs on a same core sample (sister samples)  it is the aim of this paper to present an overview of recent vaca muerta research works which include mechanical laboratory characterization of the rock and discuss about how different laboratory test parameters such as temperature, confining pressure, time, and fluid saturation among others affects the mechanical response of the rock  to complete the understanding of the vaca muerta formation mechanical behavior, special laboratory studies like biot's coefficient and creep test were performed in some core shale gas samples; nevertheless, in this work, the quality and validity of these results are left as an open discussion  the most important conclusion of the analysis done in this work is that some elastic properties are not mainly controlled by the “rock families or facies”  as a result, a unique correlation between many elastic properties has been found and a simple workflow to fully characterize the rock mechanical properties of vaca muerta formation is proposed   1  introduction  during the exploration, delineation and development of the principal shale oil and gas reservoirs in argentina, several studies like petrophysics, geochemistry, biostratigraphy and geomechanics haves been done  in order to calibrate the parameters of different models many meters of core has been recovered from the vaca muerta formation in the neuquen basin, argentina  this core acquisition was fundamental for the correct characterization of the mechanical rock properties  these properties play a fundamental role in every stage in the life of a well i e  drilling process (wellbore stability), fracturing process and finally production forecasting | 
2017-0172 	 analysis of deformational behavior of circular underground opening in soft ground using three-dimensional physical model |abstract: in this paper, a scaled-down physical model of circular tunnel experiment was carried out to investigate the strata and mechanical deformational behavior of unsupported tunnel periphery in soft groundmass  the authors developed and performed a three-dimensional physical model experiment to understand these phenomena  in spite of having highly advanced computational techniques, researchers still heavily depend on physical model tests before constructing any underground excavation to understand the phenomenon’s like tunnel damage process, deformation pattern, subsidence and caving mechanism etc  a variety of distinct physical modelling techniques has already been developed and proposed by several researchers all over the world to study the ground response around the tunnel opening and monitoring the surface settlement  these techniques range from simple “base friction models” to highly advanced “manually controlled centrifuge models” that simulates the failure mechanism and distortion behavior of tunnel under variable engineering and geomechanical conditions  the present study shows a laboratory model conducted under the effect of gravity to study the deformational behavior, tunnel mechanical features, failure mode and ground settlement profile  the ground deformation was observed with the help of normal measuring tape attached on transparent acrylic wall and video recording of events  the outcome of these tests were then compared with empirical equations and well-established mathematical models   1  introduction  due to the rapid increase in the infrastructure development, there is a terrible need to understanding the behaviour of geotechnical structures before the collapse and during the failure of underground excavations  tunnelling has now become a common construction method for most of the design engineers all over the world as urban expansion surges and nonavailability of surficial land  hence, it is very important to have a proper understanding of tunnel induced stresses, movements and their influences on neighbouring civil constructions (meguid et al  2008)  in most of the cases, tunnels are built at shallow depth for comfortable access to the immediate vicinity to the existing infrastructure  so, in urban regions tunnels were often constructed in soft ground (idinger et al  2011)  in spite of having significant advancement in tunnelling technology in past few decades, the soft ground has always possessed some inherent difficulties associated with it to create problems during tunnelling  to study these issues, researchers have proposed several empirical, numerical methods along with some physical models  all these tools have some advantages and some disadvantages  the empirical methods, based on data collected in the field, is used by various researchers to investigate the lining stress or surface settlement profile (hoek and brown 1980; mair et al  1993; hoek and diederichs 2006; meguid et al  2008; ma et al  2014) | 
2017-0174 	 insight into hard rock pillar behavior from numerical simulation using a progressive s-shaped failure criterion |abstract: in recent decades, several researchers have found that the behavior of brittle rocks near excavation boundaries under intermediate to high stress conditions is best described by a cohesion-weakening-friction-strengthening (cwfs) model  the advantage of cwfs over conventional shear strength failure criterions in describing the process of extensile fracturing (spalling) makes it ideal for modelling damage processes in hard rock pillars  the majority of numerical studies of pillars to date, however, have focused on the application of strain-softening material models; while these models may be suitable for capturing mine-scale behavior of pillar systems, they provide little insight into the mechanisms governing pillar stability  recently, the concept of an s-shaped strength criterion was introduced which combined the cwfs strength model (at low confining stress) with the classical shear strength envelopes (at higher confining stress)  theoretically, such a model should better capture the brittle fracturing phenomenon along the ribs and the shear fracturing inside the pillar where confinement is high  in this study, the progressive s-shaped strength envelope has been implemented in flac3d using a bilinear strength model and has been demonstrated to exhibit some well-documented behavior seen in failing pillars  as a final step, a range of width/height ratios were tested and the results were compared against published field data, empirical strength envelopes, and previous modelling attempts presented in the literature   1  introduction  with underground mining extending to depths over 2 kms, it is essential to design stable pillars which can provide local as well as regional support [1]  pillar design is based on two important parameters – strength and applied stress, both of which are difficult to estimate analytically  numerical modelling offers a convenient alternative to estimate these quantities, and is often employed during the design phase of a project  the success of such modelling is governed by the selection of a proper constitutive model and associated input parameters   in this paper, an attempt is made to develop a local constitutive relationship that can account for micromechanical damage processes while exhibiting emergent macroscopic failure behavior in rock pillars  the developed constitutive relationship, termed as the progressive s-shaped failure criterion in this study, is first tested for its ability to qualitatively capture observed rock damage processes using a pillar model in flac3d, followed by comparison against an empirical pillar strength database from literature | 
2017-0176 	 discrete element modelling of wellbore integrity in high temperature geothermal reservoirs |abstract: geothermal drilling environments are often hostile to well materials, especially in magmatic settings where properties of well casing and cements may rapidly change as a result of high temperatures and chemically active formation fluids  prolonging the lifetime of such geothermal wells is one of the key challenges to achieve a commercially successful geothermal projects  this study aids analysis of critical stress conditions for well integrity and initiation of damage in wellbore cement during operation of geothermal wells using a combination of analytical and discrete element models  the analytical models are used to determine wellbore stresses that are applied to 3d discrete element models of typical well sections  wellbore models and boundary conditions are based on subsurface conditions encountered in well iddp-1 of the iceland deep drilling project  possibilities of using the discrete element models to test the behavior of well materials under realistic pressure and temperature conditions in this type of wells are explored  the workflow may be used to test novel well materials and designs at different depths   1  introduction  maintaining long term wellbore integrity in high temperature environments is one of the key challenges for the commercial success of geothermal projects  geothermal drilling environments are often hostile to well materials, especially in magmatic settings where properties of well casing and cements may rapidly change as a result of high temperatures and chemically active formation fluids  prevention and mitigation of well integrity problems under these conditions is aided by detailed knowledge of critical conditions for wellbore failure and by analysis of special requirements for well materials  the integrity of wellbore cement is particularly important in high temperature geothermal wells as cement damage promotes migration of reactive fluids along and through the cement sheath, and reduces thermal isolation of the casing by the cement sheath  the resulting reduction in zonal isolation, enhanced casing corrosion, and elevated thermo-mechanical stresses may significantly reduce the lifetime of geothermal wells | 
2017-0181 	 characterization of fracture conductivity of hydraulic fracturing in hot dry rock exploitation |abstract: recently, water injectivity index was found to be huge different between process of hydraulic fracturing and long-term water injection during enhanced geothermal energy development  this discrepancy is due to improving the conductivity of natural fractures in geothermal reservoirs is essentially different from traditional hydraulic fracturing in conventional oil and gas reservoirs  the effective conductivity aperture of natural fractures becomes an important parameter to characterize fracture conductivity in geothermal reservoirs, which is affected by initial fracture roughness, shear-induced dilation, thermoelasticity as well as chemistry of hot dry rocks  a coupled thermal-hydro-mechanical-chemistry model was developed to analyze the composition of the total hydraulic aperture and primary role in different fracture section  the result shows that thermal effect plays a major role in increasing the conductive aperture in the near borehole area, which is also an effective way to reduce the surface pumping pressure at the hydraulic fracturing site  however, relative to thermal induced aperture, shear dilation remains stable along the fracture and increases with the injection pressure  the effect of chemical dissolution/precipitation of short-term hydraulic fracturing on fracture aperture is too small to be negligible  therefore, long term high pressure injection is the best way to enhance the conductivity of several hundred meters of underground water circulation and heat exchange fracture network   1  introduction  geothermal energy is renewable, clean and green energy that is generated by the continuous decay of isotopes and stored in the earth  as of the end of 2015, there were 12 5 gw of potential capacity additions in 82 countries spread across 700 to 750 identifiable projects (barbier 2002; matek 2016)  there is about 42 7<u+00d7>106ej geothermal resource over a depth of 3km and 80% of them from hot dry rock reservoir, which is about 300 times the fossil energy (dickson and fanelli 2013; glassley 2014) the most important consideration for geothermal energy development in non-hydrothermal scenarios is the use of hydraulic fracturing technology to establish an effective network pathway to conduct fluid from injector(s) to producer(s)  most of the hot dry rock is base-crystalline rock and they are always a high mechanical strength, non-permeability in matrix and formed a large number of natural fractures under the action of tectonization  therefore, the high injection pressure gradient and low injectivity indices become the primary problem in the development of hydraulic fracturing in hot dry rock geothermal development (garnish 2002; norbeck et al  2015) | 
2017-0182 	 stress-dependent dynamic-static transforms of anisotropic mancos shale |abstract: layering-induced anisotropy of shale formations increases uncertainty in determining in-situ mechanical properties and stresses, thus increasing the risk associated with implementing advanced drilling and hydraulic stimulation in shales  we conduct simultaneous triaxial stress tests and ultrasonic wave propagation monitoring to quantify static and dynamic stiffness anisotropy in mancos shale  two case studies evidence the impacts of (1) confining stress and (2) presence of pre-existing fractures, on dynamic-static transforms of young’s moduli and poisson’s ratios with increasing deviatoric stress  the first case shows that confining stress more heavily impacts dynamic mechanical properties than static  the effect is most prominent at high deviatoric stresses, where stress-induced damage increases the difference between dynamic and static young’s moduli  the second case shows that samples with pre-existing fractures exhibit even higher differences between dynamic and static young’s moduli than non-fractured (intact) and damaged rocks  fractured samples exhibit ratios of edyn/est between 5:1 and 7:1, whereas intact samples generally remain near the 3:1 ratio  pre- and post-test x-ray microtomography imaging confirm that bedding planes and pre-existing fractures act as planes of weakness, while sample layering causes mechanical stratigraphy, where changes in lithology may cause fractures to reorient  results highlight the limitations of tangent linear elasticity moduli to explain complex deformational behavior in shales and the need for better models that address the strain-magnitude dependence of rock properties   1  introduction  shale layering causes bed-parallel differences in rock properties, a component of mechanical stratigraphy (laubach et al  2009)  stratigraphic variations in mechanical properties are known to influence the growth of engineered fractures (bosziak et al  2014)  a further element of bed-perpendicular anisotropy can be introduced by pre-existing fractures, which can impact rock stress-strain response (bergbauer and pollard 2004)  over geologic time, subsurface stresses may vary, which can cause natural fracturing  chemical alteration (diagenesis) might stiffen natural fractures, therefore their orientations might not be aligned with current stresses or layering (laubach et al  2004)  consequently, the attributes and orientation of layering and diagenetically altered open fractures can impact rock mechanical behavior, engineered fracture growth, and rock failure under a range of loading paths  layering and pre-existing fractures are suspected to influence the behavior of shales undergoing hydraulic fracture treatment (suarez-rivera et al  2013, gale et al  2014) | 
2017-0186 	 correlation between slab test and rock cutting modeling using 2d discrete element method |abstract: during the last decades, researches about tool/rock interaction of polycrystalline diamond compact (pdc) cutters have been focusing on numerical modeling aspect due to its time efficiency compared to the laboratory testing  among the different numerical methods, researchers commonly use discrete element method (dem) to study the rock cutting process  dem 2d models give good qualitative results  unfortunately, the calculated cutting forces are not in agreement with the ones measured in laboratory by cutting tests  to be able to compare correctly cutting modeling and cutting laboratory tests, we decided to use the geometric feature of 2d numerical models where the sample and the pdc cutter have the same unit width of one meter and adapted it for the laboratory tests  for this purpose, we prepared rock samples in order to have the same width than the pdc cutter used  using this method, we highlight the good quantitative correlation between laboratory slab tests and the results provided by the numerical models  indeed, the evolution of cutting forces depending on the depth of cut is comparable to laboratory tests and they are quite similar in terms of magnitude   1  introduction  during this low prices period for oil and gas on the market and the uncertainty about the evolution of these prices, it is important for the oil and gas industry to optimize its whole process costs  one of the aspect to optimize is the drilling operation, which requires a better understanding of the destruction mechanism of rock  for this work, we decided to focus on the specific rock cutting mechanism involved by polycrystalline diamond compact (pdc) drilling tools  we made this choice because these drilling tools are increasingly used due to the improvement of the mechanical properties of the pdc cutters   currently, two methods are essentially used to study the rock cutting mechanism: laboratory tests and numerical modeling  researchers increasingly used numerical modeling, which allows having a more precise comprehension of the mechanism and requires less laboratory instrumentations  among the different modeling methods, they often used discrete element method (dem) due to its capacity to take into account the granular aspect of the rock at a small scale and to represent the propagation of fractures into the rock materials | 
2017-0188 	 numerical investigations of thermally induced fractures in rock salt |abstract: for the storage of natural gas, compressed air or hydrogen in rock salt caverns it is necessary to carry out numerical calculations for the dimensioning of the relevant operation parameters  these are on the one hand the allowable maximum and necessary minimum internal pressure to ensure a gastight and stable cavern over decades and on the other hand the limitation of the withdrawal and refill rates between these geomechanical limits   during the withdrawal phases of the gas the temperature decreases which can lead to stress states in tensile regions at the cavern wall  because the tensile strength of rock salt is relatively low compared to its compressive strength it is likely that tensile stresses lead to discrete fractures orthogonal to the direction of the tensile stresses  if fractures of this kind are created - whether vertical or horizontal - the gas will penetrate into the fracture at the relevant pressure and further extend the length of the fractures under certain circumstances   there are currently research projects in work that can describe whether the fractures might propagate into the not by temperature changes influenced rock salt mass during repeated cyclic pressure changes   salt caverns cannot be entered but only explored by sonar measurements, with which it is not possible to detect tensile fractures at the cavern wall  within this paper examples from mining configurations will be shown where temperature changes lead to tensile fractures in the surrounding rock salt  these fractures have been well mapped while the temperature development is well documented   the paper deals with recalculations under consideration of different salt properties of the temperature distributions and the resulting stress state in the surrounding rock salt mass  the stress calculation results and the consequences for the dimensioning of natural gas caverns are going to be discussed and assessed  a special aspect within this topic is the cooling of the cavern surrounding rock salt mass after the leaching phase with relatively cool fresh water and the influence on the first operation period | 
2017-0191 	 the full-automatic recognition of structural plane parameters in borehole images from actual drilling engineering |abstract: borehole images have accurately recorded the geological information and the structure characteristics of rock mass, but structural plane parameters in borehole images are usually obtained by manual operation with large workload and affected results by human factors  to solve this problem, this paper presents a full-automatic recognition method of structural plane parameters in the obtained borehole image from borehole camera or imaging system  this method uses image gray, gradient values and projection method to distinguish the occurrence region of borehole structural planes, and then uses standard sine function matching method to search the structural plane in the region  results show that this method can automatically identify the structural planes in the borehole image continuously and quickly, and obtain the corresponding structural parameters, such as the central positions, orientations and dip angles of structural planes in borehole images  it is stable and reliable, and greatly improves the working efficiency  this full-automatic recognition method can realize the automatic features picking of structural planes and the analysis of geometric parameters in borehole images after drilling engineering  this paper has provided an effective and reliable solution for the improvement of drilling information acquisition technique and borehole image signal processing technique   1  introduction  knowledge of a rock body’s structural stability is often necessary in geotechnical, geological, oil extraction, and also geological disaster control projects  the reliability of a project can heavily depend on the structural planes found in rock bodies, such as joints, faults, weak planes, and bedding planes [1-3]  a digital panoramic borehole camera system can obtain the high-definition images of boreholes that offer an accurate representation of their structural planes characteristics  therefore, the accurate recognition of structural planes and rapid extraction of their parameters are highly valuable for actual drilling engineering [4-6]   present identification methods of structural planes in borehole images mostly rely heavily on human reading  generally, the structures identification and parameter extraction process may involve computer-aided preprocessing or characteristic curve fitting  through using human-assigned control points on the structural plane or other necessary parameters, the methods can obtain the sine curve’s parameters of structural planes in borehole images [7-9], which is a laborious and slow process that requires human intervention  and the obtained structural plane parameters are often vary depending on individual readers [10-12]  this kind of manual identification process can become a drain on time and human effort in engineering practice, particularly when the boreholes are deep or numerous  thus, the full-automatic recognition of structural plane parameters in borehole images for actual drilling engineering becomes urgent and very valuable | 
2017-0192 	 thermo- poro- elastic stressing and time-dependent earthquakes nucleation: a semi-analytical injection model |abstract: the understanding of geothermal fields requires coupling between heat flow through fractures and induced seismicity  in this context, we develop a semi-analytical approach for estimating (1) thermo-poro-elastic stresses in a fractured geothermal system, and (2) seismicity rates based on the model of dieterich (1994)  cold water is injected at constant rate into a single fracture surrounded by hot impermeable layers  heat flow is dominated by advection and conduction respectively inside and outside the fracture  poro- and thermo-elastic stresses are estimated separately following the nucleus-of-strain concept; and for any potential fault around the single fracture the induced coulomb stress rates are resolved  for this particular scenario, the thermal stresses are dominant  we show that thermal-stressing rates can induce an increase in the rate of seismicity of more than hundredfold at distance up to 200m from the single fracture  our fast forward model is suitable for data assimilation, and by predicting the spatio-temporal evolution of the locations of increase/decrease of seismicity rate one might optimize geothermal systems while keeping seismicity at a relatively low magnitude   1  introduction  the sustainability of geothermal fields is based on a paradox  on one side fractures are targeted for heat-flow improvement, and on the other side these same fractures are avoided because of induced-seismicity risk  more specifically, slip along fractures can enhance the heat flow but can also lead to large seismic events  the grail is to take advantage of fracture conductivity while keeping seismicity at a relatively low magnitude avoiding risks of large earthquakes (zang et al , 2013)  our present model contributes to a better understanding of this complex coupling between heat transfer, flow, fractures, and earthquakes   flow through a fractured geothermal system is often modelled with complex numerical approaches, taking into account the interaction between multiple fractures (taron et al , 2009; izadi and elsworth, 2010; mcclure and horne, 2010)  these models give detailed pictures of the thermo-hydro-mechanical couplings, but the drawback of this time-consuming model is that processes and physical parameters cannot be updated via a data assimilation scheme | 
2017-0194 	 abnormal formation pressure in the chukchi shelf, alaska |abstract: this study provides an improved interpretation and delineation of pore pressure in the chukchi shelf region  between 1989-91, five exploration wells were drilled on the chukchi shelf and an array of drilling performance and petrophysical data were acquired  resistivity, conductivity, sonic travel time, sonic porosity, and drilling exponent data were used to evaluate formation pore pressure  normal compaction trendlines were established using depth-dependent relationships then integrated with eaton and adapted eaton equations to estimate formation pressures  four of the five wells were found to contain significant overpressure at onset depths ranging from 1098 to 2317 meters subsea  the overpressure is mainly associated with organic-carbon-rich source rocks that have experienced thermal exposures sufficient for hydrocarbon generation  the driving mechanism for the origin and maintenance of the overpressure appears to be linked to hydrocarbon generation at the wellsites and access to hydrocarbons migrating from the regional generation center beneath the colville basin to the east   1  introduction  pore pressures in many deep sedimentary formations often exceed hydrostatic pressures, a condition termed “overpressure”  if not properly balanced by drilling fluids, an overpressured formation may cause a well to flow to the surface  overpressure thus forms a hazard to drilling operations if not anticipated in well planning   the purpose of this study was to develop an improved interpretation and delineation of pore pressure in the frontier chukchi shelf region  the chukchi shelf is located offshore northwestern alaska in water depths typically 50 meters (165 ft) or less  five exploration wells were drilled on the chukchi shelf during open water seasons from 1989-91 and an array of drilling performance and petrophysical data were acquired  in this study, resistivity, conductivity, sonic travel time, sonic porosity, and drilling exponent data are used to evaluate formation pore pressure  normal compaction trendlines are established using depth-dependent relationships then integrated with eaton and adapted eaton equations to calculate formation pressure  four of the five wells penetrated overpressure and hydrocarbon generation is suggested as the driving mechanism behind the origin and maintenance of formation overpressure in the chukchi shelf region | 
2017-0199 	 clay-rich rocks as barriers for geologic co2 storage |abstract: in geologic co2 storage, it is important to find a proper barrier material that will avoid or limit acidic fluid migration  shales that are ductile and have high capillary entry pressure and low permeability can be considered as good candidates for the caprock  faults may contain high percentage of clay and act as barriers for fluid flow in reservoirs  experimental techniques have been developed to characterize the behavior of clay-rich materials at elevated pressures  intact and remolded specimens of opalinus clay – a jurassic shale from switzerland – are brought to the conditions of deep (> 1 km depth) geologic storage and fully saturated with in-situ brine  poromechanical parameters and failure characteristics are measured in drained and undrained conventional triaxial compression experiments  co2 breaktrough pressure and permeability of shale are assessed in oedometric tests on thin (12 mm) samples  experimentally measured parameters are used in numerical simulations to assess fault stability and the shaly caprock integrity for the case of geologic carbon storage, where cooling is likely to occur around injection wells  it is found that clay-rich faults may induce microseismic events, but without leading to co2 leakage   1  introduction  safe long-term carbon dioxide (co2) geologic storage largely depends on caprock integrity (ieaghg, 2011)  the caprock may be especially altered at the early stages of injection, when the maximum overpressure is reached (vilarrasa et al , 2010)  as co2 is injected in the storage formation, it tends to advance through the top of it and below the caprock due to buoyancy (hesse et al , 2008)  furthermore, the injected co2 will reach the bottom of the well at a colder temperature than that of the storage formation (paterson et al , 2008)  as a result, a cold region is formed around the injection well, but the cooling front advances much behind than the co2 plume interface (vilarrasa and rutqvist, 2017)  thus, the lower boundary of the caprock is in contact with co2 saturated pore water or pore fluid that consists almost of pure co2, which may be cold (figure 1)  these thermal and chemical interactions between the pore fluid and the caprock may change its material properties and affect stability | 
2017-0200 	 impact of fluid acidity on the time-dependent initiation of hydraulic fractures in carbonate rocks |abstract: carbonate-rich rocks, such as limestones, comprise commonly-encountered reservoir rocks in the oil and gas industry  this paper shows the impact of acidic fluid on the hydraulic fracture initiation through laboratory experimentation  the results show that, compared to water injection, acid injection results in more rapid initiation of the hydraulic fractures under so-called static fatigue or pressure-delay conditions wherein a certain pressure, insufficient to instantaneously generate a hydraulic fracture, is maintained until a hydraulic fracture grows  acid injection also is shown to generate a dissolution cavity in the vicinity of the wellbore  the breakdown of the specimen is, in addition, observed to be explosive in the case of acid injection, probably due to the generation and the subsequent rapid expansion of carbon dioxide as a part of the dissolution reaction  finally, the time to breakdown, or specimen lifetime, is shown to be related not only to the magnitude of the wellbore pressure, but also to the apparent permeability of the specimen  altogether, the results indicate firstly that acid injection can be expected to improve the initiation of multiple hydraulic fractures within multistage hydraulic fracturing of horizontal wells by decreasing the time required for initiation at subcritical wellbore pressures  the results also show that the current theoretical framework can capture the overall negative exponential relationship between the time to breakdown and the wellbore pressure, but it is insufficient to account for the secondary dependence on rock permeability   1 introduction  hydraulic fracture initiation is classically considered to be governed by a binary criterion determining whether the wellbore pressure is sufficient to overcome the strength (or fracture toughness) of the rock  either the pressure is sufficient to generate a hydraulic fracture, or it is not  recent efforts have shown this to be an incomplete picture, that, in fact, the pressurization of a wellbore to a level insufficient for instantaneous initiation can instead lead to delayed initiation  this delayed initiation of hydraulic fractures was proposed based on theory by bunger and lu (2015)  the existence of time-dependent hydraulic fracture initiation has been confirmed experimentally in the laboratory for sandstone and granite (lu et al  2015; uwaifo 2015)  at the same time, there are still some open questions  first, while the specimen lifetime, referring to the time between the start of the pressurization and the loss of specimen integrity due to hydraulic fracturing, has been shown to be dependent on wellbore pressure with an exponential, as predicted by the theory, the scatter in the data indicates that the pressure is probably not the only critical characteristic of the initiation  second, all experiments to date have been conducted under conditions where no chemical interaction/reaction is expected between the rock and fluid  here we present laboratory research aimed at this second issue, addressing the question of how the pressure-delay initiation phenomenon occurs in an acidic environment in a carbonate rock  there are reasons to expect that acidic fluid will have an impact  past experimental analyses (e g , hill et al  2007; wu and sharma 2015) show that the erosion by acid can weaken the strength of the rock matrix and make the rock easier to break  that idea inspires us to hypothesize that the acidic fluid injection will reduce the breakdown period and accelerate the speed of the delayed initiation  we evaluate experimentally, for the first time, the potential for hydrochloric acid to reduce the delayed initiation time for hydraulic fractures | 
2017-0208 	 modeling scale effects on consequent slope deformation by model tests and the discrete element method |abstract: a consequent slope comprises weak planes in the same dip direction along a slope face  this study investigated scale effects on the gravitational deformation of consequent slopes  a series of centrifuge model tests under simplified environmental conditions were performed  particle image velocimetry was then adopted to evaluate the displacement distribution from the centrifuge model test results  subsequently, the discrete element method (dem) was used to execute simulations to provide detailed descriptions of the crack development and failure mechanisms associated with consequent slopes at different scales  the results of this study are summarized as follows  (1) the slopes exhibited similar deformation patterns in the centrifuge model tests  as the gravitational force increased, the magnitude of slope deformation increased significantly  (2) a modified dimensional relationship of material parameters was proposed for dem simulation  according to this relationship, the simulated deformation patterns were in strong agreement with the actual deformations at various slope scales  (3) according to the dem simulations, for the slopes with the same slope and weak plane angles, more cracks and displacements were generated in the higher slopes, leading to a greater sliding volume   1  introduction  a consequent slope, also called a dip slope, comprises weak planes in the same dip direction along a slope face  because of the ease with which rock masses slide along the direction of the weak planes, translational sliding is the typical motion type associated with the failure of consequent slopes, and sudden and rapid sliding commonly induces severe disasters (varnes 1978; hung 2002; wyllie and mah 2004; evans 2006; weng et al  2011)  for example, buildings in the region of ciao ling and chiufenerhshan in taiwan were destroyed by landslides during the chi-chi earthquake in 1999  in 2010, the translational slide of a consequent slope near the formosan freeway in northern taiwan buried a section of the freeway that was 190 m long and 35–43 m wide, killing four people  these landslides provided a reminder of the dangers associated with the development of consequent slopes  therefore, identifying potential sliding mechanisms is imperative, and establishing an early warning system is essential (hung 2010; wang et al  2013; lo et al  2015) | 
2017-0209 	 compression characteristics of resedimented nile silty clay |abstract: the nile sediments are characterized by its unique behavior where silt size particles exhibit significant plasticity  cohesive nile sediments are collected and resedimented in two different forms of consolidometers  the paper presents a standardized process of resedimenting the silty clay in the laboratory  this research aims at characterizing the physical and mechanical properties of silty clay samples obtained from mariouteya region in the nile valley  the experimental program investigates the index properties of the sediments and grain size distribution using hydrometer and laser scattering particle analysis techniques  results show how different classification approaches give different indications of sediment behavior  the compression behavior of the sediments is studied during resedimentation and by separate one-dimensional consolidation (oedometer) tests at pressures up to 3 2 mpa  the paper highlights and discusses the differences observed in compressibility during resedimentation and with conventional testing  the results show that the compressibility of resedimented nile silty clay (rnsc) at low pressures is within range measured from testing undisturbed samples from several locations along the nile valley and recorded in the literature  at high pressures the compression index decreases significantly and drops by 20% when pressure increases by an order of magnitude   1  introduction  cohesive sediments have been transported by the nile river to the river’s banks and off of the mediterranean egyptian shores for thousands of years  plans for deep drilling activities in offshore egypt and mega projects (factories, power plants, highways, etc ) onshore require a good understanding of the geomechanical behavior and geotechnical properties of these sediments  the paper discusses the classification; and the compression behavior of two series from these sediments taken from the mariouteya area in giza, egypt  the issue of classification presents a challenge because the paper shows that the nile silty clay comprises relatively large size and irregularly shaped particles  the paper also considers the compression behavior of the sediments at pressures higher than 3 mpa, which is beyond the typical range of pressures considered by geotechnical engineers   casey (2014) demonstrated the possible confusion resulting from adopting different classification methods and different definitions for fine grained (cohesive) materials  fine sediments are defined as clay according to the unified soil classification system (uscs) depending on how the atterberg limits fall on the casagrande plasticity chart, while according to another definition, when more than 50% of the particles are smaller than 0 002 mm | 
2017-0212 	 pore structure and mechanical property change of different rocks under nitrogen freezing |abstract: to better understand the liquid nitrogen freezing effect on different rocks, shale, coal, sandstone and carbonate were chosen to investigate the pore structure and mechanical properties damage before and after liquid nitrogen freezing  experimental study shows that an increase in the number and volume of pores for all rocks after freezing  however, the influence of nitrogen freezing on carbonate was not obvious because of intense mineral compaction and poor connectivity of pores  there was also an obvious reduction in young’s modulus and unconfined compressive strength for coal  especially, the average decrease ratio of young’s modulus was approximately 0 43 and the average decrease ratio of unconfined compressive strength was 0 63 after and before freezing for all coal samples, which reflected strong freezing damage capability of liquid nitrogen  the mechanical properties also clearly decreased after liquid nitrogen treatment for sandstone samples  unpronounced changes in shale, and carbonate correlate with tight mineral compaction  these conclusions reflect the characteristics variations of pore structure and mechanical properties were influenced directly by the type of rock during liquid nitrogen freezing  also, it can provide some insights for avoid wellbore instability during hydraulic fracturing process with liquid nitrogen   1  introduction  currently, hydraulic fracturing has become a common practice in the exploitation of low-permeability hydrocarbon reservoirs  however, large-scale hydraulic fracturing generally consumes a large amount of water and show some drawbacks such as mineral swelling in clay-rich formation and block oil and gas flow path, thus stimulation effectiveness and production is heavily affected [1-3]  meanwhile, the consume on water during fracturing is vast and most of water can be lost, the residual fracturing fluids with chemicals trapped in formations sometimes have the potential to contaminate groundwater, thus hydraulic fracturing technology is strictly prohibited by some states in u s a  and a few european countries [4,5]  accordingly, the application of water-less fracturing fluids like liquid nitrogen (ln2) is proposed for its great advantages of formation protection, less water demand and environmental impacts |

2017-0214 	 modelling the influence of heterogeneity on microseismic characteristics in longwall coal mining |abstract: mining-induced microseismicity has been extensively used to evaluate the potential for rock bursts and coal and gas outbursts in underground coal mines  in a research project completed a few years ago, it was observed that characteristics of microseismicity around a longwall working panel were fairly consistent over the monitoring period until a heterogeneous zone with a relatively high coal strength was reached  the current research presented in this paper aims at achieving a better understanding of the effect of heterogeneity on microseismic activity in longwall coal mining  a microseismicity modelling approach which combines deterministic stress and failure analysis together with a stochastic fracture slip evaluation was used to simulate the evolution of microseismicity induced by the progressive face advance passing through a heterogeneous zone  the heterogeneous zone was taken into account by varying the material strength of the elements within the high strength zone and the fracture attributes within this zone  results have shown that both the high rock strength of coal lithotype and low fracture intensity within this zone contribute to the decrease in seismic event counts, and that the increase in energy released results from the combined effects of increased stress drops and slipped fracture sizes when the high strength zone is approached   1  introduction  underground mining activities are usually accompanied by microseismic events  extraction of large volumes of rocks at depth brings about changes in stress conditions around mine openings and beyond  it has been widely accepted that microseismicity is predominantly caused by slip of pre-existing planes of weakness (e g  fractures) and geological discontinuities (e g  faults) (stiller et al , 1983; spottiswoode, 1984)   seismic events are typically characterised by the magnitude of released energy, event counts, and the scaling of microseismic event magnitude  energy released from a microseismic event is predominantly dependent on fracture size, stress drop along the fracture surface, and rock properties (salamon, 1993)  the stress drop is in turn affected by the prevailing stress conditions and rock properties | 
2017-0216 	 experimental study on rock failure of organic-rich shale caused by waterjet impinging |abstract: this paper presents an experimental study of waterjet drilling on the longmaxi shale rock to understand the fragmentation behaviors and their mechanics  the homogenous sandstone was the candidate of the control group  the macro fragmentation behaviors and their micro structures were acquired by the scanning electron microscope (sem) and computed tomography (ct) techniques  results show that there are big difference of fragmentation behaviors between shale and sandstone  the efficiency of shale waterjet drilling is ultralow, which the erosion rate and the ultimate drilling depth cannot reach the half of those of sandstone  for the initial crushing hole, the compression-shear failure does not happen since the static pressure of waterjet is lower than the compression strength  however, the tensile fracture occurs and makes the rock spallation  in the state of the deep hole producing, the waterjet impinging force is not able to make the rock tensile or shear failure  only the mineral particle erosion appears due to the high velocity erosion  this work provides the theoretical guide for improving the shale rock drilling efficiency by water jetting   1  introduction  drilling through the longmaxi shale formation is still time consuming and various approaches to achieve the cost efficient well plan have been attempted, involving the use of high pressure waterjet (chen mian et al , 2015; li gensheng et al , 2016)  the drilling fluid is pumped through surface equipment or downhole intensifier to be high pressure waterjet  the success of waterjet technology requires more insight into the rock failure mechanisms under waterjet impinging  until now, this topic still attracts much attention and many hypothesis and theoretical models were proposed to understand rock failure mechanics with the help of laboratory analysis, numerical simulation, and micro-structure analysis (x  liu, liu, & ji, 2015; y  liu, wei, & ren, 2016; lu, huang, liu, & ao, 2015; oh & cho, 2016)   previous studies have already demonstrated that the failure induced by waterjet is due to dynamic stress waves, static pressure loading, and abrasive erosion (momber and kovacevic 2012; dehkhoda and hood 2013; liu, wei et al  2016)  the degree of failure caused by each of the above depends on the rock properties and jet parameters  compared to the metal material, the failure mechanics of rock material is more complicated due to its being a porous medium and complex mineral structures (crow 1974)  the apparent features of waterjet drilling have been confirmed through experimental works (hashish 1988; hood, nordlund et al  1990; agus, bortolussi et al  1993)  particularly, the effects of waterjet parameters on drilling performance are fully recognized  for example, the key parameters that influence drilling performance involve the stand-off distance, jet pressure, jet impact angle and treating time  based on the experimental studies, several semi-empirical models were proposed to predict the cutting depth and quality and had a good agreement with available data (harris and mellor 1974; zeng and kim 1996; aydin, karakurt et al  2013; oh and cho 2016) | 
2017-0217 	 effect of humidity on tensile strength of rocks in selected underground coal mines in malawi |abstract: one of the major challenges facing coal mines in malawi is occurrence of hanging roof falls during the rainy season  following this, the effect of humidity on the tensile strength of coal bearing rocks, arkose sandstone and fine-grained sandstone from mchenga underground coal mine, was studied aiming to clarify the mechanism of roof fall in the underground mines and proposing countermeasures against the roof falls  rock samples from the mine were treated in varying humidity levels  some specimens were oven dried at 80°c and a desiccant was used to attain low humidity  moderate humidity was obtained using magnesium-nitrate-hexahydrate, high humidity was achieved by pure water and some specimens were vacuum saturated  subsequently, brazilian test was carried out to obtain indirect tensile strength along the sedimentary plane  for comparison, neogene tuffaceous kimachi sandstone from japan was also tested, following the same conditions  it was confirmed that indirect tensile strength of the rocks decreased with increase in humidity  the sensitivity of indirect tensile strength to humidity for arkose and fine grained sandstones was 12% or 29% larger than that for kimachi sandstone  the stronger sensitivity for mchenga roof rocks would be because the rocks contain illite, whose strength is very sensitive to water, while kimachi sandstone contains only less sensitive zeolite for clay minerals   1  introduction  historically, mining has been imperative to human and social development, and the industry will continue to make investments that meet the increasing needs of society (icmm, 2012)  moving from being an agrobased economy, malawi has ventured into mining as its alternative economic driver towards the future  coal offers an alternative for electrical energy in the country due to insufficient power generation from hydroelectric power stations along the shire river in malawi  this has put coal as the strategic commodity for the mining sector, focusing on the establishment of coal-fired power plants in the country  there are seven coalfields spread across the country, with four coalfields of bituminous coal in the northern region  currently, four underground coal mining operations are running with additional two open pit mines in these coalfields | 
2017-0220 	 mechanical properties of vaca muerta shales from nano-indentation tests |abstract: we performed nano-indentation experiments on samples of vaca muerta shale, argentina, taken from mature and immature outcrops, and reservoir cores, one from within the oil window  elements were mapped at the indentation sites using energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (edx)  the reduced elastic modulus, er, hardness, h, and contact creep modulus, c were similar to those reported previously for source rocks from the us, except that the vaca muerta shale had a population of indentations with very low er, h and c  high h was usually associated with pyrite, dolomite, calcite or quartz inclusions; the lowest values (h < 0 1 gpa) were found at sites within the clay matrix in oil-window samples, possibly owing to the presence of organic material  we could not use edx to verify this conjecture because the measurement sensitivity for c is low  volumetric averaging of elastic and contact creep moduli from indentation tests gave values consistent with short-term triaxial tests on inch-scale shale samples, but these values were inconsistent with those measured in the lab over longer durations   1  introduction  recent technological advances such as horizontal drilling and multi-stage hydraulic fracturing have greatly increased the economic importance of source rocks by allowing hydrocarbon production from ultra-low permeability shale reservoirs, but these processes also require better knowledge of mechanical properties  in particular, characterization of rock heterogeneity, anisotropy, and creep is needed to optimize resource utilization (sone and zoback, 2010, 2011, 2013a, b; ambrose, 2014; su et al , 2014; abedi et al , 2016ab; slim, 2016; yang and zoback, 2016)  the effect of organic matter on mechanical properties also needs to be understood (zargari et al , 2013, wilkinson et al , 2015, slim, 2016)  nano-indentation tests provide a convenient and quick way to characterize mechanical heterogeneity, using only small sample volumes  results for these tests may also be useful in assessing the time-dependent penetration of hard proppant particles into the rock, a process that could reduce the transmissivity of the hydrofractures (abedi et al , 2016ab, slim, 2016; alramahi and sundberg, 2012, zhang et al , 2015) | 
2017-0223 	 simulating perforation damage with a flat-jointed bonded-particle material |abstract: we explore the feasibility of using a bonded-particle model (bpm) to simulate the rock disaggregation process occurring near a wellbore perforation in sandstone by addressing the simpler question: can we construct a 2d bpm that produces surface fragments when subjected to boundary conditions similar to those around a wellbore perforation in dry sandstone? the answer to this question is yes  we can construct a 2d flat-jointed material to represent castlegate sandstone  our synthetic material matches much of the macroscopic response (including the direct-tension and unconfined-compressive strengths) and many of the mechanisms that occur during direct-tension and compression tests as well as the trends in the macroscopic response and the primary mechanism that occurs during thick-walled cylinder (twc) tests to produce a breakout failure type  the primary mechanism is termed “buckling-assisted fragmentation,” in which a buckling and spalling process produces thin fragments of rock similar to onion skins, and thereby produces a breakout failure type  the perforation-collapse behavior of our synthetic material is related to the hole resolution (defined as the number of grains across the borehole diameter), with twc strength decreasing as hole resolution increases  this observation suggests that perforation strength in a given material will decrease with increasing perforation size   1  introduction  the sand-production process that occurs near a wellbore perforation in competent sandstone in response to hydrocarbon production can be described by a two-stage conceptual model in which the perforation becomes filled with detached fragments during the first stage, and with further drawdown during the second stage, these fragments become smaller  the first stage of the process is characterized by properties obtained from laboratory tests (such as tensile, triaxial and thick-walled cylinder) and assessed by calibrated continuum-based sand-prediction models, but the second stage of the process is difficult to characterize and assess quantitatively  the second stage has been assessed via empirical equations linking the rock strength degradation to production conditions (xiao and vaziri, 2011)  a long-term goal of the present work is to quantify the entire rock strength degradation process by employing a bonded-particle model (bpm, potyondy and cundall (2004); potyondy [2015]) in which the relevant grain-scale processes are modeled directly so that the rock strength degradation becomes an emergent property of the model arising from the microstructural interactions of the grains and cement |

2017-0227 	 injection-driven shear slip and the coupled permeability evolution of granite fractures for egs stimulation |abstract: permeability enhancement through shear slip has been considered as standard treatment of engineered geothermal systems (egs)  the process reactivates pre-existing fractures, making them slip and dilate using fluid pressures below the minimum principal stress resulting in increased permeability  it can also cause fracture propagation in the shear and tensile modes creating secondary cracks  control and optimization of shear stimulation can be achieved by studying how fracture permeability evolves with shear slip and dilation  however, most experimental studies that have considered fracture slip and permeability evolution have used force-driven shear tests or have manually displaced the specimens to represent fracture slip  a few studies have considered fluid injection-driven slip but only using saw-cut smooth joints  in this work, we have conducted shear slip test by water injection on rough fractures  water was injected into a granite sample containing a single tensile rough fracture to induce shear slip under triaxial conditions  flow rate during shear slip was measured to investigate fractures’ permeability evolution  in addition, the effects of confining pressure, differential stress, and injection pressure on stress-dependent permeability of the granite fractures were characterized  we tested three separate samples using different methods  non-shear flow tests were conducted on a fractured sierra white granite sample (sw #1) under both hydrostatic and triaxial conditions to characterize stress-dependent fracture permeability  we observed a linear relationship between flow rate and injection pressure, and an exponential relationship between flow rate and confining pressure  in addition, fluid injection-driven shear tests were performed on fractured samples sw #2 and sw #3 using constant stress mode and constant displacement mode, respectively  shear rates observed during the constant stress test were <u+02dc>10<u+2212>3 m/s and yielded up to 3 orders of magnitude increases in flow rate while the constant displacement mode caused <u+02dc>10<u+2212>5 m/s sliding rate and 20 times increase in flow rate through the fracture  furthermore, permeability evolution during injection-driven shearing tends to linearly evolve with the shear slip and dilation  the irreversible behavior of shear slip was found to explain the permeability hysteresis during shear sliding   1  introduction  enhanced geothermal systems (egs) represent enormous renewable energy reserves (tester et al , 2006; brown et al , 2012)  field experiments have been carried out at sites such as newberry, desert peak, fenton hill, soultz-sous-foretz and rosemanowes  the primary objective of these field demonstrations has been to create flow paths through basement rock to facilitate heat transfer  various stimulation mechanisms have been tested at these sites depending on the geology of the host rock, fault structures, natural fractures etc  shear slip (pine and batchelor, 1984; willis-richards et al , 1996; baria et al , 1999; rahman et al , 2002; nygren and ghassemi, 2005; cheng and ghassemi, 2016) and the propagation of natural fractures are important mechanisms of permeability enhancement in egs reservoirs (min et al , 2010; ghassemi, 2011; huang et al , 2013; jung, 2013; mcclure and horne, 2013; kamali and ghassemi, 2016)  often, crystalline basement rocks have pre-existing sealed fracture networks that are activated prior to the creation of new fractures since the sealing material is usually much weaker than the surrounding rock  the objective of shear stimulation is to create a stimulated volume with increased permeability to circulate large volumes of water  this is carried out at pressures below the minimum principle stress to avoid excessive fracture growth and large surface area  fractures that are sheared tend to self-prop due to asperities | 
2017-0230 	 tensile strength calibration in dem modeling |abstract: tensile strengths from the direct tension test and the brazilian test are compared for the purpose of material property calibration for dem modeling  we show that size effect in direct tension is statistically insignificant  sample size is not critically important in calibrating the tensile strength  on the other hand, failure mechanisms in the brazilian test depend on not only the material properties but also sample size  in addition to the conventional diametrical splitting failure resulted from initiation and propagation of a center crack, alternative failure scenarios involving formation of damaged zones near the loading points are also possible  the brazilian tensile strength could either underestimate or overestimate the intrinsic tensile strength  direct tension instead of the brazilian test should therefore be conducted for material property calibration  we also show that a displacement-softening contact law can resolve the issue of low compressive over tensile strength ratio in dem modeling  by adjusting the softening coefficient, a realistic strength ratio can be obtained and the conventional diametrical failure pattern can be reproduced in the brazilian test   1  introduction  tensile strength of rocks is often measured indirectly through laboratory tests such as the brazilian test and three-point bending  these tests are indirect because the stress state at the location where failure initiates is not in uniaxial tension and the tensile stress along the failure plane could be non-uniform  nevertheless, compared with the direct tension test, these indirect tests are more robust to perform in the laboratory and are justified since experimental evidences indicate that failure in confined extension still occurs according to the uniaxial tensile strength, if the magnitude of the compressive principal stress in a biaxial stress state is no more than a few times of the tensile stress (brace, 1964; murrell, 1965; hoek and bieniawski, 1965; ramsey and chester, 2004; hoek and martin, 2014)   differences in the tensile strengths obtained from the indirect and direct tests are well recognized  an extensive survey of the experimental results (perras and diederichs, 2014) suggests that depending on the rock types, the brazilian tensile strength (bts) could both overestimate and underestimate the uniaxial tensile strength (uts)  the ratio of bts/uts was found to scatter in between 0 56 (trachyte) and 1 86 (sandstone) | 
2017-0231 	 a dem strategy for modeling fluid injection in an unconsolidated medium |abstract: fluid injection into an unconsolidated medium is modeled numerically using the dem code pfc2d®  the injection process is modeled with the simplification that fluid leakoff is negligible  the fluid can penetrate in between grains and fluid front advances only if the gap size between two neighboring grains exceed a threshold value  such a simplification can be considered as similar to taking into account of the effect of surface tension  dependence of the fluid-grain displacement patterns on the threshold gap size is analyzed for the cases of constant rate injection  a bifurcation analysis for cavity expansion of a thick-walled cylinder is performed to predict the borehole pressure versus volume relationship  the critical pressure corresponding to the onset of bifurcation is compared with the peak injection pressure obtained from the numerical simulations   1  introduction  failure mechanisms due to fluid injection in a nearly unconsolidated formation are not yet well understood due to the highly nonlinear and coupled nature of the problem  it is generally assumed that onset of failure may occur in a tensile or a shear mode, depending on whether cohesion is present or not  in a cohesive medium, fluid pressurization in a borehole is assumed to lead to tensile crack initiation and propagation  on the other hand, for a cohesionless material, a constitutive model of coulomb type predicts that the material must fail in shear and failure may be manifested in the formation of spiral-shaped shear bands   evidences of shear band development were observed in the cavity expansion experiments in dry sands in alsiny et al  (1992), where borehole pressurization is realized by inflating a membrane  in these experiments, the membrane does not penetrate into the sands  meanwhile, the experiments in chang (2004), performed by injecting a highly viscous fluid into dry sands or silica flour, demonstrate that planar features resembling an opening mode crack can be created in a purely frictional granular material  a major difference between these two experiments is the pressurization mechanism  we therefore conjecture that the action of fluid penetration to cause grain displacements is a critical element in producing the opening mode crack- or finger-like features   in this study, the effect of fluid penetration on the fluid-grain displacement patterns in a cohesionless medium is investigated using the discrete element method (dem) code pfc2d® (itasca, 2015)  a numerical scheme is devised to consider a particular case, where the injected fluid is highly viscous and can penetrate into open spaces in between grains if the gap size between two neighboring grains exceeds a threshold value  such an implementation could be considered analogous to taking into account the effect of surface tension without leakoff; the larger the critical gap size, the higher the surface tension or the fluid viscosity | 
2017-0233 	 application of pga fiber and fluid-loss materials to slick water fracturing |abstract: in recent years, service companies often use a low viscous, fiber-laden fracturing fluid  the added fibers not only assist in the transport of proppant based on mechanical suspension but also prevent proppant settling during fracture closure  although the chemical composition of the fibers used is not described, their characteristics suggest that they are made of pla materials  in our experiments, we tested both pga and pla fibrous materials using a small scale slotted equipment  the results showed that mixing fibers with a small amount of polymer significantly helped transporting proppant  from the preliminary tests, pla fibers crumbled and tended to induce proppant screen-out often; thus, only pga materials were used for the proppant transport experiments  since the pga materials were cost prohibitive, we determined the optimum concentration of pga fibers by changing the polymer concentration of frac fluid and injection rate  we concluded that the suitable amount of fibers is around 0 567 kg (1 25 lbs) / 3785 4 liters (1000 gallons) of slick water  this concentration is economically feasible given that the total fluid injection volume is large for hydraulic fracturing applications   1  introduction  we have been testing pga (polyglycolic acid) and pla (polylactic acid) materials for seven years as a fluid-loss control agent  since the combination of pga fibers and pga powder was proven an effective fluid-loss control agent, we further tested it for transporting proppant while minimizing fluid-loss for slick-water fracturing  the tests used a clear small scale proppant transport system  pga fibers and proppant were mixed with slick water and pumped through a slotted panel made of acrylic plastic to study proppant transport in an open fracture  we pumped the slurry at constant flow rates and observed the proppant distribution  the experiment demonstrated relatively uniform distributions of proppant flow without the formation of proppant bank near the inlet   a service company has documented the application of a low viscous, fiber-laden fluid that can transport proppant effectively  the fibers assist in the transportion of proppant based on a suspension mechanism and prevent proppant settling during fracture closure  the company mentions “degradable materials,” “biodegradable fiber” or “degradable divergent agents” without explicitly citing chemical names and their necessary properties for applications  however, the materials appear to be pla from the photos | 
2017-0235 	 biot’s effective stress coefficient of mudstone source rocks |abstract: biot’s effective stress law has been proved to be very useful in describing the effect of pore fluid pressure on the mechanical response of rocks and understanding the poroelastic effects in unconventional shale or mudstone formations  in this work, six mudstone source rock samples from unconventional reservoir wells have been tested for measuring their grain bulk moduli, bulk moduli, and the stress dependent biot’s effective stress coefficients  grain bulk moduli of these samples range from 60 gpa to 90 gpa  biot’s effective stress coefficients for all the samples decrease from 0 90 or higher to 0 70 or lower with increasing effective stress illustrating the stress dependency of biot’s coefficient  furthermore, the different values of biot’s coefficients along the vertical and horizontal directions indicate that biot’s coefficient is indeed a tensor quantity for anisotropic mudstone source rocks, so that pore pressure changes not only modify the normal stress but also induce shear stress changes  experiments also show that mudstone source rock samples expand when nitrogen gas is used as the testing fluid (gas absorption), and the degree of such expansion is related to the absorbed gas quantity and organic matter content   1  introduction  the behavior of rocks under the combined effects of confining stress and pore pressure is important for stability analysis, geotechnical and petroleum engineering, and sequestration of carbon dioxide, etc (chen, 2011; hunt, 1990; ghassemi et al , 2009; ma et al , 2016/7; rutqvist, 2012; warpinski and teufel, 1992; wu et al , 2010; zhou et al , 2010)  the concept of effective stress has been proved to be very useful in describing the effect of pore fluid pressure on the mechanical response of porous earth materials, and this effective stress concept was firstly introduced by terzaghi (1936) for soil, and then was modified by biot (1941) for rock  the biot’s effective stress law is usually given as:| 
2017-0236 	 characterizing brittle fracture induced rockfall in an open sub-level retreat excavation |abstract: in this study, terrestrial lidar is used to characterize the contribution of rock bridge fracturing and brittle damage to rockfall on the contact wall of an open-air glory hole at diavik diamond mine  rockfall scars are identified and isolated by comparing successive lidar point clouds  rock bridges are first characterized visually using 2d photographic trace mapping, and categorized as either coplanar with existing discontinuities or non-coplanar  using an automated facet detection technique, and comparing the results to known mapped structures, we estimate the proportion of non-coplanar rock bridge fracturing contributing to rockfalls of various sizes  roughness is used as an indicator of coplanar rock bridge fracturing, and roughness thresholds are estimated by comparing areas of highest roughness to damage trace maps  finally, intact rock bridge estimates are used in a time-dependent degradation udec model to simulate progressive damage over the life of the mine  modelling results show similar behavior to measured slope displacements, showing the importance of accounting for progressive intact rock fracturing over time  |1  introduction |the contact walls of a glory hole at diavik diamond mine present a challenge for predicting the magnitude and frequency of rockfall  on the southeast (se) contact wall of the a154s kimberlite pipe, steeply dipping, highly persistent discontinuities are observed  when rockfall does occur, it is due to a combination of failure along the surface of these discontinuities and progressive brittle fracturing in intact rock  as mining progresses downwards and ore rock is removed, progressive brittle fracturing in the exposed host rock occurs from a combination of loss of confinement and introduction of freeze-thaw cycles  previous studies have shown that a larger scale pit wall failure would require shearing through intact rock (elmo et al , 2009; moffitt et al , 2007), which appears to occur at smaller scales as well  |this study shows the potential for terrestrial lidar in understanding past rockfalls and evaluating future ones  terrestrial lidar can be used forensically to characterize failure surface morphology and estimate brittle fracture progression prior to rockfall  these findings can be used in anticipating future rockfalls | 
2017-0237 	 local linearization method for efficient solution of coupled fluid flow and geomechanics problem |abstract: boundary element methods such as the displacement discontinuity method (ddm) are promising for describing the geo-mechanics of growing fractures as they reduce the dimensionality of the problem by one  still, this advantage is overshadowed by the computational power required to model stage scale simulations of hydraulic fractures primarily due to the nonlinearity arising from fluid flow inside the fracture  typical assumptions to improve the computational efficiency lead to the inability of simulators to describe proppant transport which is critical to treatment design  in this paper, we present a novel algorithm to increase the speed of convergence of coupled geomechanics (ddm) and fluid flow problem  the algorithm employs an analytical, local linear approximation of the reynolds lubrication equation to solve the coupled non-linear system of equations  an initial solution is estimated through the linear system, and it is then used in the iterative solution approach for the non-linear system as an initial guess  this improvement has allowed us to use the algorithm to develop a fully three-dimensional hydraulic fracturing simulator which can run in an acceptable runtime using commonly available computational power   1  introduction  hydraulic fracturing has made economical recovery from low permeability shale reservoirs possible  with the advancement of hydraulic fracturing technology, multistage fracturing of horizontal wells has become ubiquitous  the complexity of the involved physical process, geological spatial variability and complexity, and limited access to the treated formation make it difficult to achieve reliable completion designs (damjanac and cundall, 2015)  to address this problem, the selection of crucial design parameters is commonly done by duplicating a completion design from successful analog fields and optimizing it by trial and error  as every shale is unique, this strategy is costly and has an associated learning curve for design engineers (leem and reyna, 2014)  also, the behavior of proppant transport inside multiple growing fractures adds additional complexity to the process, and hence it becomes too intricate to model without numerical and computational techniques  this generates the need for a comprehensive hydraulic fracturing simulator which can account for all the key factors and assist in the completion process, thus reducing the cost and time required for achieving optimum designs | 
2017-0238 	 verification of a calibrated longwall model with field measurements |abstract: a numerical-model-based approach was recently developed by researchers at the national institute for occupational safety and health (niosh) for estimating the changes in both the horizontal and vertical loading conditions induced by an approaching longwall face  in this approach, a systematic procedure is used to estimate the model’s inputs  shearing along the bedding planes is modeled with ubiquitous joint elements and interface elements  coal is modeled with a newly developed coal mass model at niosh’s pittsburgh mining research division (pmrd)  the response of the gob is calibrated with back analysis of subsidence data and the results of previously published laboratory tests on rock fragments  the model results were verified with the subsidence and stress data recently collected by pmrd from a longwall mine in the eastern united states, and with published cases studies from both eastern and western u s  mines   1  introduction  in 2015, there were 40 longwall mines operating in the united states, each producing an average of 4 5 million tons of coal per year  the largest concentrations of longwall faces are found in west virginia with 13 longwalls, followed by illinois (7), pennsylvania (5) and alabama (5) (fiskor, 2016)   in 2015, these forty longwall mines supplied 60% of the u s  underground coal production  this represents a substantial increase from 50% over the previous three years (sears et al , 2017)  during this period, reportable roof fall rates in u s  longwall mines also increased  large roof falls that can block the gateroads are not only a ground fall hazard; they disrupt the ventilation system, can block the escapeways, and can increase the potential for elevated methane levels in the gob  to address the recent increase in reportable roof falls, the national institute for occupational safety and health (niosh) pittsburgh mining research division (pmrd) started a research project to improve ground control in longwall gateroads | 
2017-0246 	 the use of specific energy for fault mapping in an open pit mine |abstract: this research presents a case study of the use of specific energy measurements to map and model pit-scale faults in the granite pit at gibraltar mine, an open pit metal mine in british columbia, canada  specific energy data were collected during drilling of over 100,000 blast holes  specific energy is affected not only by the geomechanical properties of the rock being drilled, but also by drilling parameters, equipment wear, and drilling depth  the influence of these factors is partly mitigated by adjusting the dataset for drilling depth and applying a bilateral smoothing filter  the specific energy dataset is compared to known pit-scale faults, uav photogrammetry, lidar models, and rock mass data from geotechnical drilling  planar concentrations of low specific energy data are seen to correspond to the location of major faults  this is evidenced further by showing that specific energy increases with distance from faults, similar to rock mass quality   1  introduction  understanding the spatial distribution of rock strength and the location of faults is important for open pit slope design  the spatial distribution of rock strength can indicate the location and size of faulting, weathering, and weaker geotechnical units  because of the cost of geotechnical drill holes, the spatial distribution of rock strength and the locations of faults are often interpreted from limited data  for example, the orientation of a fault intersected by a geotechnical drill hole might be measured using oriented drill core  this measurement may be representative of the fault at the intersection, but may not reflect the complex orientation or shape of the fault at the pit slope scale  a data set with broader spatial coverage is needed to improve fault interpretations   ’specific energy’ is defined as the energy required to excavate a unit volume of rock and when first introduced (teale, 1965) was noted to be a function of rock strength  given the spatial coverage of blast holes in open pit mines, specific energy has significant potential for the identification of zones of weak rock and in the interpretation of faults for open pit slope design | 
2017-0247 	 observation and quantification of fracture aperture in granite core using x-ray tomography and edge detection technique |abstract: in measuring rock fracture apertures from x-ray ct images, a binarization method has generally been used to separate the air void parts (fractures) from the rock parts  however, reasonable thresholding is often an essential problem in this method, especially for heterogeneous rock materials  this paper suggests a new method for detecting fracture surfaces from ct images using an edge detection algorithm that is known well in the field of image processing as canny edge detection  applying this edge detection method to the ct images of a single granite fracture, 15 mm in diameter and 30 mm in length, this study successfully measures the fracture surface geometry, the aperture distribution, and the contact ratio   1  introduction  taking precise measurements of the geometric characteristics of rock fractures, such as the elevation distribution of fracture walls, the distribution of apertures, and the contacting asperities within the fractures, is essential because of their significant influence on the mechanical and hydrological behaviors of rock fractures  on a laboratory scale, the elevation distribution of fracture walls can be measured with micrometer accuracy using a system that combines a laser displacement sensor and a high-precision automatic positioning stage (e g , [1])   however, the distribution of apertures and the contacting conditions within a fracture are rather difficult to measure experimentally  in previous researches, various techniques have been proposed, such as 1) the surface topography approach, in which the topography of a pair of fracture surfaces is measured separately by a laser beam profiler, while the aperture is computed indirectly as the distance between the two fracture surfaces [2, 3]; 2) the injection approach, in which the specimen containing the fracture is cut into slices after some resin has been injected, and the aperture is measured as the thickness of the injected resin [4, 5]; and 3) the casting approach, in which replicas of the fracture apertures are made by casting [6] | 
2017-0249 	 effective improvement of wellbore stability in shales with a novel nanocomposite |abstract: the main objective of this study was to investigate wellbore stability in shales after and before adding the conventional lcm particles in combination with a novel nanocomposite to a weighted water based drilling mud  a unique pore pressure transmission (ppt) apparatus was used to evaluate the plugging capabilities of the mixtures  results showed that the presence of nanocomposite was conductive to forming a thinner impermeable mud-cake to effectively reduce water invasion and prevent pore pressure transmission into the water-sensitive shales formation at an earlier stage of the shale-fluid interactions  however, the pore pressure would gradually increase over time if only lcm materials were in the existence of the drilling mud  when the test time went on for 8 hours, the downstream pressure increased to 80% of the upstream pressure  results also showed that the combination of nanocomposites and the conventional lcm materials in appropriate proportion could create a lasting and effective sealing during drilling in shales, but the combinational material was incapable of sealing the fracture seen by the naked eye  hence, the fast sealing developed through the combinational method was essential to resolve the problems of wellbore instability in shales   1  introduction  wellbore instability in shale is one of the most common and costly problems in drilling operations since shales with high clay content is high sensitivity to water-based muds (steiger and leung 1992)  according to the statistics, shales occupy over 75 % of drilled formations, and about 90% of borehole instability problems caused by shale formations (lal 1999)  meanwhile, the drilling problems also lead to annual expenditure of $700 million for oil and gas industry (tare et al  2000)  in the past, some research indicated that it was impossible to minimize drilling fluid loss effectively towards to shale formations with the conventional sealing-agent  this was because that the range of throats sizes in shales was in the range of 5-50nm that was much smaller than the size of conventional plugging materials (abrams 1977, al-bazali et al  2006, sensoy et al  2009, kuila and prasad 2013)  it was believed that traditional drilling fluids could not form mud cake in the vicinity of the borehole (hoelscher et al  2012)  notably, it was because of the low permeability and high capillary suction of the shale matrix that the drilling mud pressure in the borehole was easily transmitted to the pore fluid pressure, leading to wellbore instability when drilling in shale formations with overbalance pressure (al-arfaj et al  2014) | 
2017-0250 	 research on casing deformation failure mechanism during volume fracturing for tight oil reservoir of horizontal wells |abstract: volume fracturing has shown great promise in reconstructing unconventional oil/gas reservoirs effectively, while new problems of frequent casing deformation failure were triggered  in this paper, based on drilling and completion data, rock damage criterion and microseismic surveillance data, and previous studies about relevant influencing factors, 2d and 3d finite element model (fem) of casing-cement sheath-formation are established to study the mechanism of casing deformation during multi-stage volume fracturing of z1 tight oil horizontal well  the results show: a) those factors thought by most scholars just cause the cross-section of the casing smaller change, which do not block the bridge plugs pumped by elastic coiled tubing; b) influenced by in-situ stress, natural fractures tend to slip when the stress difference is large enough, and slippage is mostly likely to happen as the angle between the natural fracture and maximum horizontal stress reaches 30° and the shear displacement is usually several centimeters; c) natural fracture slip is accompanied by drastic local casing shrinkage, with slight deformation one side and severe another, as observed from the impression blocks in oilfields  the results demonstrated in this paper can provide the theoretical basis for the prevent treatment of casing deformation failure during the fracturing reconstruction of stimulated reservoir volume of tight oil horizontal well   1  introduction  hydraulic fracturing (hf) has long been used as a major technique for well stimulation  in recent years, the rapid development of unconventional resources has made the technique one step forward, especially the appearance of volume fracturing, which has produced a big influence on the increase of oil/gas production  in 2007, north america began to use the fracturing technology of muti-stage and muti-cluter in horizontal wells, and has made it become the main means of unconventional oil/gas development since then, the exploitation of barnett shale regarded as the most representative (parshall 2008)  in china, volume fracturing has been widely applied in sichuan’ shale area and has brought larger gas production than that by traditional fracturing technology in past several years (chen et al  2014)  recently, this technique also has played a great role in developing the tight oil/gas in some oilfield of shanxi, china | 
2017-0255 	 strength criteria for shale under true-triaxial stresses |abstract: current analytical methods to assess rock strength for borehole stability, stimulated volume calculations and fracture and faulting almost exclusively involve the use of the mohr-coulomb failure criteria, which does not account for the effect of the intermediate principal stress  conventional triaxial testing does not permit rock testing under anisotropic horizontal stresses  however, in-situ horizontal stresses are rarely isotropic, and a few studies on granitic and carbonate rocks have shown that the intermediate principal stress potentially has a very significant effect on rock strength and depends on rock type  in the case of shales and mudstones however, very little data exists on this topic due to experimental challenges involved in sample preparation and testing rock specimens under a true-triaxial state of stress  in this work, we present a series of true-triaxial tests on several shale specimens, and explore the effect of the intermediate principal stress on the failure properties of shale  results indicate that the intermediate principal stress has a measurable contribution to rock strength, and impacts rock brittleness during the fracturing process  failure laws of the mogi-coulomb form are used to predict rock strength under true-triaxial conditions, and methods to obtain true-triaxial strength parameters from conventional triaxial test data are discussed  rock brittleness is studied as a function of minimum and intermediate principal stresses, and results indicate that increasing the intermediate principal stress may have an embrittling effect on rock   1  introduction  failure criterion for rock plays an important role in analyses of various subsurface problems such as wellbore stability, stimulated volume calculations and faulting mechanics  to better understand the compressive failure behavior for rock, various failure criteria have been developed and documented in rock mechanics literature  the most famous and widely used of these is the mohr-coulomb failure criterion  however, the criterion suffers a major drawback in that it predicts rock failure solely based on the maximum and minimum principal stresses - with no strength dependency attributed to the intermediate principal stress  this is also in part due to the limitations of conventional triaxial rock testing, where the use of fluid pressure to apply a confining stress to a cylindrical test specimen inherently restricts the test conditions to the special case of equal intermediate and minimum principal stresses  consequently, the effect of the intermediate principal stress (<u+03c3>2) has largely been ignored | 
2017-0263 	 wellbore stability analysis based on the fully coupled non-linear chemo-thermo-poroelastic theory in shale formation |abstract: wellbore stability is a critical problem when drilling in shale formation particularly in presence of water based drilling fluid, this problem can be enhanced through optimizing mud weight and other drilling fluid parameters, such as temperature and solute concentration  a three-dimensional finite element model is developed to investigate the effect of chemical and thermal osmosis on pore pressure and stresses in the vicinity of the wellbore wall, the model is also available for inclined well drilled in transversely isotropic formation, the results indicate that temperature and solute concentration of drilling fluid present different influence on wellbore stability: though cooling effect of drilling fluid could reduce wellbore shear failure risk by decreasing pore pressure and effective stresses, tensile fracture is easier to form in maximum principle stress direction due to sharply decreased effective compressive tangential stress  lower solute concentration could increase pore pressure greatly by forcing drilling fluid flowing into formation under chemical potential difference, meanwhile, the developed model reveals that young’s modulus and permeability anisotropy ratios play an important role in the pore pressure and effective stresses distribution for the directional well in transversely isotropic formation, however, the effect of poisson’s ratio could be ignored   1  introduction  wellbore instability is a universal problem in drilling operation, especially in shale formations, the direct reason is that effective stresses redistribute after the hole is drilled and shear or tensile failure criterions are satisfied  effective stresses are determined by stresses and pore pressure according to biot’s (1941) theory  the interaction between shale and water based drilling fluid is studied a lot by many researchers, detournay and cheng (1988) introduced coupled poroelastic theory to analyze the pore pressure and stresses distribution around the wellbore and the first analytic solution is given, then poroelastic theory is extended by taking into consideration thermal and chemical effects of drilling fluid and pore fluid  palciauskas and domenico (1982) developed thermo-poroelastic constitutive equations, wang and papamichos (1994) gave analytical solutions  ekbote and abousleiman, (2006), ghassemi et al  (1999), ghassemi and diek (2003) investigated fully coupled chemo-poroelastic problem by extending detournay’s work and eventually obtained analytical solutions that are suitable for isotropic and transversely isotropic formations  combined thermal and chemical effects on wellbore stability were studied further, ekbote (2002), tao and ghassemi (2006) presented fully coupled thermo-chemo-poroelastic theory, though analytical solutions were given by researchers, the result is only suitable for isotropic formation or the hole that is vertical with the transverse formation plane, so numerical methods were used to analyze poroelastic problems, cui et al  (1996) used finite element method to analyze pore pressure and stress distribution around directional well in anisotropic formation based on poroelasticity  ghassemi and zhang (2004) applied the boundary element method to study poroelastic problem  gomar et al  (2014), roshan and aghighi (2012) established a 2d (two-dimensional) fem model based on the thermo-poroelastic and chemo-poroelastic theory separately, zhou and ghassemi (2009) presented a 2d finite element model based on nonlinear chemo-poro-thermoelasticity for isotropic formation | 
2017-0265 	 analysis of occurrences at underground fuel storage facilities and assessment of the main mechanisms leading to loss of storage integrity |abstract: unintentional releases of natural gas to the surface or subsurface environment are recognized as a challenge to the safe and reliable operation of underground fuel storage facilities, including for natural gas  previous studies have documented some of the occurrences at such facilities and assessed leakage or failure mechanisms along with their degree of severity, in part to inform risk-based assessments of subsurface geologic storage of fuels and wastes (such as carbon dioxide)  this paper summarizes the past occurrences and several hundred others of varying severity (from nuisance/non-hazardous to catastrophic), that have occurred or earlier ones that have come to light since a previous study of evans [1] was undertaken  worldwide, these have occurred at facilities developed in salt cavern (~320), porous rocks (aquifer and depleted hydrocarbon field – ~40 and ~600 respectively), mined hard-rock cavern (~50) and storage facilities of as-yet to be determined type (~7)  the present work includes categorizing the fuel type (natural gas, lpg, ngl’s, crude oil), type, nature and severity of any leakage for both above ground and subsurface incidents, all of which provide key parameters to risk probability assessments   worldwide, a total of 1023 occurrences at underground fuel storage facilities are documented, of which 706 involve natural gas facilities  of these, 63% can be attributed to subsurface causes (38% to well integrity, 25% to geological or subsurface integrity causes) and 36% to surface causes including pipeline and wellhead issues  it is important to note that not all involve product loss: only 588 occurrences are linked with migration or leakage of product, of which only 428 occurred to, or at, the surface  together, the 1023 occurrences provide evidence of problems that do occur and which could contribute to a more serious occurrence and thus their recognition informs risk assessments  in the us, a total of 817 occurrences are documented, of which 538 are linked to migration/leakage of product, with 397 occurrences to, or at, the surface  some 599 occurrences involved natural gas facilities  of these, 59% can be attributed to subsurface causes (33% to well integrity, 26% to geological or subsurface integrity causes) and 38% to surface causes  in the us, the highest numbers of occurrences are found in california, pennsylvania, and texas, with product losses and related issues occurring in depleted oil and gas fields and in solution-mined salt cavern facilities | 
2017-0267 	 efficient sequential coupling technique for the simulation of hydro-mechanical interaction in rock engineering |abstract: the coupling of fluid flow and deformation in deformable porous media has started to receive wide attention in rock engineering  acknowledging this hydro-mechanical (h-m) interaction is essential for the safe design of geo-engineering structures in saturated ground  explicit coupling techniques have been the most attractive approach to use for simulating the h-m interaction, yet, the techniques are conditionally stable and require small time steps, affecting their efficiency for long-term simulations  to remove these restrictions, an unconditionally stable alternating direction explicit (ade) scheme could be used to solve the flow problem  however, the standard ade scheme is only moderately accurate and is restricted to uniform grids, thus impractical for large-scale domains  this paper presents the derivation of a novel high-order ade scheme for non-uniform grids to solve the flow problem  the flow solutions are then sequentially coupled with a geomechanical simulator in the computer code fast lagrangian analysis of continua (flac)  validations based on terzaghi’s consolidation problems show that the new sequential coupling technique reduces simulation runtimes by 40% of flac’s basic scheme without numerical instability and with average errors of 0 5% for pore pressure and 0 4% for displacement  the new coupling technique also results in satisfactory h-m response of a permeable tunnel under surface loading and reduces the computer runtime by 24%   1  introduction  biot’s theory of poroelasticity (biot, 1941) has been prominently employed in rock mechanics to understand the coupled response of fluid flow and deformation in deformable porous media (i e , soils and rocks)  acknowledging this coupled hydro-mechanical (h-m) interaction is essential for the safe design of geo-engineering structures built above and under saturated ground such as embankment and tunnels  consolidation and subsidence are the most common examples of the two-way coupled interaction in which fluid flow affects deformation and vice versa (gutierrez and lewis, 2002; neuzil, 2003; wang, 2000) | 
2017-0269 	 grout flow in fracture channel considering fracture deformation |abstract: grouting of rock fractures is an effective way to reduce or prevent water inflow during rock excavation  prediction of the grouting process can greatly optimize the corresponding grouting progress and reduce the relevant cost  the theoretical model for grout flow between parallel plates is fundamental to 1d grouting simulation  however, large discrepancies are found between recent experimental data and results from traditional theoretical model for grouting simulation  one of the main reasons for the large discrepancy could be due to the deformation of the channel plates in the experiment  therefore, a new model considering the coupling between grout flow and deformation of fracture channel is derived, where the fracture deformation is updated during the whole grouting process  it is found out that grouting simulation considering fracture deformation can better describe the experimental data than traditional model not considering fracture deformation   1  introduction  rock masses in the field are commonly accompanied by faults, like rock fractures, which can provide perfect channels for water transportation, if they are connected to water bearing areas  water inflow can happen if these fractures are encountered during rock excavation, and can lead to delay of engineering project, thus leading to potential economic loss and endangering safety of workers on site  therefore, rock grouting has been long taken as an environmental friendly and cost effective method to control water seepage, compared with other methods  however, grouting design nowadays relies more on personal experiences of engineers due to lack of theoretical guidance  therefore, development of theoretical grouting models for grouting simulation is in great need   the first theoretical model for grout spread in fractured rock mass was proposed by wallner (wallner, 1976), which has been further developed by many other scholars in different aspects (hassler, 1992a; hassler, 1992b; gustafson, 1996; yang, 2002), including the consideration of filtration and bleeding during the grouting process (eriksson, 2000; eklund, 2008; draganovic, 2009), the research on the penetrability of fractured rock mass (miltiadou-fezans, 2013; saeidi, 2013; rafi, 2015), and the influence of properties of cement grout on grout penetration (eriksson, 2004; hakansoon, 1993)  recently, the influence of fracture deformation during grouting starts to attract the attention of scholars, gothall investigated the mechanism of fracture dilation in microscale and could explain some grouting phenomena that cannot be described by models without considering fracture deformation (gothall, 2009), and he further considered the influence of fracture deformation on nearby fractures (gothall, 2010)  fransson considered the influence of grout pressure directly as a form of stress, which, combined with the in-situ stress, could be used to calculate the corresponding fracture deformation, thus updating the relevant fracture aperture (fransson, 2010)  rafi also investigated the influence of aperture variation due to fluid flow on grout penetration (rafi, 2015)  however, these works did not present detailed coupling process of fracture deformation and grout penetration  therefore, the present work derived a new model considering the deformation of fracture channel under time varying distribution of grout pressure and the relevant characteristics of grout flow in various deformed fracture channel  the simulation results obtained from two models, with and without considering the influence of fracture deformation, were compared with the relevant experimental data conducted by fujita (fujita, 2012) | 
2017-0270 	 deciphering injection-induced seismicity: a conceptual model for explaining discrepancies between oklahoma and north dakota activities |abstract: this study proposes that a systematic comparison using integrated 3d visualization of all pertinent data (midplate seismicity, geological and geophysical variables) could help in identifying areas vulnerable to injection-induced seismicity in the north american plate  from similar studies of the south american plate in brazil’s potiguar basin, it is found that intraplate seismicity occurs at uplifted basin borders (areas over thin, hot, weaker lithosphere) where pre-existing faults are prone to be reactivated by small pressure perturbations  conversely, central basins (areas over thick, cold, strong lithosphere) are not prone to seismicity  with this model we investigate oklahoma (ok) and north dakota (nd), both intense areas of injection  nd activity, in the central basin, shows no induced seismicity  in contrast, ok activity, in a regional-scale ravine in the uplifted basin border, has seen a 62 5-fold increase in recent seismicity  modeling of the ok region shows reactivation of pre-existing faults with injection pressures of 1 75 mpa (254 psi; 0 7ppg) between 2000-2200m depths, values that agree with wellhead injection pressure field data   1  introduction: the problem  a huge increase of seismicity in the tectonically stable u s  is put into evidence, if we examine the usgs catalog, 2017 comparing the number of earthquakes of magnitude (mw) greater or equal to 4 that occurred during 2000-2010 and 2010-2016  for this area, see fig  1, we jumped from an average of 6 2 events/yr, during 2000-2010, to an average of 28 8 events/yr, during 2010-2016, roughly a 5-fold increase  for oklahoma, see fig  2, a 62 5-fold increase of seismicity has been observed when comparing these same two periods, including two major events (mw 5 7, 2011; mw 5 8, 2016)  these recent increases are contemporaneous with the increase in shale production as shown in figs  1 and 2  in the stable midcontinent, a roughly 5-fold increase is observed in seismicity during 2010-2016  again, the increase is contemporaneous with us shale production | 
2017-0271 	 a numerical study of pipe roofing umbrella arch pre-reinforcement method in tunnels (a case study: tunnel no 10 of the ghazvin-rasht railroad) |abstract: providing efficient support system which prevents failures and deformations is one of the most important issues during tunnel construction especially in weak grounds  when conventional support systems such as rock bolts, shotcrete, wire mesh, steel frames and lattice girders cannot provide sufficient support for tunnels, using pre-reinforcement systems becomes necessary in addition to main support systems  pre-reinforcement of weak ground is done before the excavation or ahead of advancing the tunnel  this will provide a safe and effective operation  pipe roofing umbrella arch pre-reinforcement method is one of the conventional pre-reinforcement systems that can be implemented in tunnels, caverns and other infrastructures construction  detailed 3d numerical simulations are useful tools to obtain a better understanding of the performance of a pre-reinforcement system  in this paper, sectional excavation of tunnel no 10 of the ghazvin-rasht railroad is simulated with flac3d code by using pipe roofing pre-reinforcement method, side bolts and pipes, and initial support system  the results of numerical simulations are analyzed by using tunnel support interaction charts  considering all technical parameters, pipes with 4 in diameter, 15 cm spacing and 5 degree installation angle is selected as the most appropriate pipe roofing method for this tunnel   1  introduction  tunneling in soft or weak ground may encounter many operational and safety problems  under these conditions extra attention and field investigations will be required  when rock mass cannot be self-supporting, or when conventional support systems such as rock bolt, shotcrete, wire mesh, steel frame or lattice girder cannot provide sufficient support for a tunnel, using secondary support systems or pre-reinforcing become necessary  furthermore, in urban areas shallow tunnels are often constructed adjacent to existing structures such as buildings, streets and railways (funatsu et al , 2008)  the possibility of tunnel induced displacements and subsidence that can damage the existing structures is very high  in order to minimize effects of tunneling on existing structures, engineers should pay special attention to ground displacements  therefore, using efficient and proper support system is necessary with considerations of the project requirements and constraints such as amounts of settlements and displacements  often, it is required to use secondary support systems or pre-reinforcing in addition to primary support system in order to ensure a safe working place during the tunnel excavation  it is obvious that if effective support system is not installed at proper time and place, tunnel will collapse and may cause extensive damage, resulting financial and human loss in the project | 
2017-0274 	 experimental and numerical investigation of the effect of inner and outer boundary dimensions on collapse of the sample in thick-walled cylinder test |abstract: it is well-known that the risk of sanding varies for different completion systems, i e  open hole versus cased and perforation, in a given wellbore and reservoir  part of this difference comes from the scale effect of the borehole  pragmatic approaches are usually taken to consider the borehole scale effect in the sand production prediction analysis  a more rigorous approach is needed to take this effect into account   experiments have been conducted by researchers on thick-walled cylinder (twc) samples with different inner to outer diameter ratios (id/od) for samples of standard dimensions (1 5 in id, and 3 in length) to investigate the scale effect on the borehole failure  however, the results partially suffer from the outer boundary effect of the tests and may not purely represent the effects of the inner borehole scale  here in this paper, the outer boundary effects of twc experiments were distinguished from the inner borehole scale effect using analytical approaches followed by extensive laboratory experiments  the methodology involves computation and comparison of failure from different criteria (i e  mohr-coulomb, drucker-prager, mogi and modified lade) from tehrani’s results (2016)  then, the volumetric strain was formulated against confining pressure to explain the elastic, elastic-plastic, and plastic behaviour of the rock   variation of the twc strength of samples with different inner borehole sizes may not be fully captured by the analytical approach, which only considers the effect of the id/od  hence, the differences between the analytical and experimental approaches can be considered as the inner borehole scale effect  as expected, the analysis showed that the size of the inner borehole and the outer boundaries significantly change the twc strength  surprisingly, the effect of the samples’ od was obvious, regardless of the corresponding id  after distinguishing the outer boundary effects, the results show a decreasing trend between the inner borehole size and the twc strength of the sample, which can be considered as the borehole scale effect | 
2017-0278 	 effects of fluid medium and temperature on bit-rock interaction parameters of hard sandstone drilling |abstract: temperature and fluid affect the rock properties is an unavoidable problem in drilling engineering  the objective of this study is to separate the effect of temperature and fluid medium on hard sandstone drilling parameters, which include the weight of bit (wob), torque and mechanical specific energy (mse)  a series of rock drilling experiments was carried out  the results was very interesting that liquid nitrogen (ln2) cause the sandstone more difficult to drill than air and water, which is contrary to the view that the differential temperature between low temperature fluid and the rock enhance the rock failure  ln2 caused the average mse to be increased by about 20 64%, water caused the average mse to be reduced by about 42 66%, compared with dry drilling  from the results, it can be concluded that the temperature has no significant effect on hard sandstone drilling parameters and fluid medium type affect the parameters remarkably in the range of 20-300°c  this phenomena maybe attribute to that water caused the surface free energy of new cuttings surface reduced and ln2 caused the surface energy increased compared with air   1  inreoduction  the effect of temperature and fluid medium on rock's failure and deformation is important in many engineering applications such as radioactive waste disposal, freezing and thawing cycles of rock, underground resource development, geotechnical engineering, rock weathering, and so on  temperature and fluid affect the rock properties is an unavoidable problem in drilling engineering  for instance, underbalanced drilling has been widely applied and researched by virtue of high drilling rate (george et al , 1956; cppper et al , 1977; negrao et al , 1997; fattah et al , 2011)  through field verification, the rate of gas drilling is usually over 10 times higher than conventional drilling with liquid fluid  the effect of bottom pressure on rock failure seems to explain the extremely high rate of penetration in drilling (sheffield and sitzman, 1985), but the effect of temperature and medium on rock's failure seemed also can’t be neglected (li et al , 2014)  drilling is a complex physical and chemical process involving multi-field and multi-media coupling, such as mechanical field, temperature field, flow field, etc  the thermal impact assisted rock failure has been a hot topic in the past decades  some scholars (zhang et al ,2014; guo and ghalambor, 2002) believe that the temperature difference between the gas and the formation causes tensile stress in the rock, promote the rock fragmentation in gas drilling  as the differential thermal expansion of mineral grains subjected to elevated temperature induced microcracks, which decrease drillability and enhance the penetration rate (karfakis, 1985)  but the research result of zhou (2003) indicated that the effect of formation temperature on the properties of reservoir rocks of this area should be neglected  due to underground invisibility and environmental complexity, the effect of temperature on rock failure at the well bottom is still not fully understood | 
2017-0279 	 experimental study on specific energy of thermal spallation drilling technology |abstract: thermal spallation is a non-contact rock-breaking method, in which the surface of the rock is rapidly heated to induce small flakes or spalls  specific energy is usually used to evaluate the drilling performance, which is defined as the amount of energy required to remove a unit volume of rock  in this paper, a mathematical model for specific energy of thermal spallation is proposed  thermal spallation experiments are carried out with granite, shale, and red sandstone  main parameters in proposed specific energy model are measured to calculate the corresponding specific energy  results show that under high temperature, the granite and shale can be induced to spall, while the red sandstone only fuses on the surface  for granite and shale, specific energy is small and close to their compressive strengths, which indicates that thermal spallation is suitable for heterogeneous hard rocks and is of high rock breaking efficiency  moreover, for granite, the specific energy of thermal spallation is much smaller than that of other rock breaking methods in previous work, including mechanical bit, high pressure water jet, supercritical carbon dioxide jet and high power laser, which reveals that rock thermal spallation method is of high energy utilization and drilling efficiency   1  introduction  the quantities of energy resources, including oil, gas and geothermal energy, are pretty large in the deep formations (dyman et al , 2002; tester et al , 2006), where the rocks are too hard and difficult to be broken  hence, it is necessary to develop a highly effective drilling method to promote the exploration and development of deep resources   high temperature thermal spallation may have been man's first non-manual mining method  however, thermal spallation was not be developed until the 1940s when the linde air products division of union carbide started developing it for use in mining taconite ore (williams, 1986)  thermal spallation is a non-contact rock-breaking method, in which the surface of a rock is rapidly heated to induce small flakes or spalls  it is expected to provide an alternative way for high efficiency drilling in deep formation  in recent years, the method has been developed rapidly, and become the research focus of most countries and research institutions  researchers of the massachusetts institute of technology (mit) and their partners proposed the fluid thermal spallation method, and applied for a patent (potter and tester, 1995)  swiss federal institute of technology in zurich (eth) began to research the flow field of fluid thermal spallation and develop the experimental device since 2000, and it made some progress in the field of temperature distribution characteristics (martin et al , 2013; stathopoulos et al , 2013; jackson, 2013; rothenfluh et al , 2013; rothenfluh et al , 2013; stathopoulos et al , 2012)  so far, the existing thermal spallation drilling experiments showed that the speed of the method could be up to 15ft/h-30ft/h (augustine, 2009), which was many times faster than conventional drilling methods  thus, thermal spallation drilling has broad application prospect and needs to be further studied | 
2017-0280 	 design of reciprocating valve equipment based on rapidly generating drilling fluid continuous wave signal |abstract: a novel reciprocating valve equipment used to rapidly transfer downhole information to the surface during drilling process is designed with the purpose of greatly improving the generation rate of the drilling fluid continuous wave signal  the research is primarily focused on the effect of valve ports on the generation frequency and characteristics of drilling fluid continuous wave signal  valve ports distribution is designed as multi-row along the axis and several along the circumference  furthermore, a mathematical model is built to calculate the parameters of the valve port distribution  the results show the correlation coefficient between the ideal sinusoidal pressure wave and the pressure wave generated by the designed valve ports (distributing 4 on per row and 3 rows along the axis) is 0 9983, and the generation frequency of the pressure wave is up to 20 bit/s  the research indicates that the reciprocating valve equipment can improve the frequency of the pressure wave signal and has a great advantage of improving drilling efficiency   1  introduction  in recent years, signal transmission technology of drilling fluid pressure wave is widely applied in the well drilling process (wu, 2016 and hou, 2016)  arps, 1964 proposed that reciprocating plunger valve device is used to generate pressure wave signal for transmitting downhole information  klotz designed a signal generator and its main valve was reciprocating swing-type with a transmission rate of 15 bit/s (klotz et al , 2008)  hutin introduced schlumberger company's mwd system which used rotary valves to generate continuous pressure waves and its transmission rate was up to 10 bit/s (hutin et al , 2001)  at present, only schlumberger company owns mature products that can generate continuous pressure waves and it has been successfully applied in field (su and dou, 2005)  fang has done a lot of research on the cone valve reciprocating signal generator and he designed a model of hydraulic pulser controlled by on-off pilot valve (fang et al , 2004 and 2016)  besides, the signal characteristics produced by the pulser are simulated and analysed  nevertheless, the pulser existed some technical problems such as low response frequency of the control valve and low frequency of positive pulse signal, leading a low drilling efficiency  the authors (jia et al , 2012 and wang et al , 2011) detailedly studied the mechanism of generating drilling fluid continuous pressure wave based on the rotary valve signal generator  however, the distribution space of the valve port was limited by the radial dimension of drill string on account of the through flow valve port of rotary valve formed on the stator and rotor blades  besides, the valve port resulted in insufficient supply capacity for the generator  furthermore, when the drilling fluid flow through the valve ports the main bearings bear a greater axial force, eventually seriously effecting the pulser's operation stability and service life  in order to solve the above problems, author design a novel reciprocating valve equipment which can rapidly generate drilling fluid continuous wave signal  according to build a mathematical model of calculating the valve port distribution which can produce drilling fluid continuous wave signal and design distribution of multi-row valve port on the wall of the tube, the transmission rate of drilling fluid continuous wave signal is expected to improve greatly | 
2017-0281 	 hydraulic fracture initiation from radial lateral borehole |abstract: radial drilling-fracturing, the integration of radial drilling and hydraulic fracturing, is an innovative approach to develop low permeability, thin target layer and naturally fractured reservoirs, etc  investigating fracture initiation process is essential for the successful design and operation of radial drilling-fracturing  we developed an analytical model for determining the fracture initiation pressure (fip), location of rock failure zones, and initial fracture direction from radial lateral borehole  then, we analyze effects of in-situ stress regime, lateral orientation and pre-existing weakness plane  results show that in-situ stress regime, lateral orientation and weakness plane greatly influence fip, location of rock failure zones, and initial fracture direction  for a given combination of in-situ stress regime and lateral orientation, when fracture initiates longitudinally, fip enlarges moderately with lateral orientation increasing; rock failure zones consist of two symmetric wings at the base of radial borehole on its top and bottom sides  when fracture initiates horizontally, fip declines moderately with lateral orientation increasing; rock failure zones consist of two symmetric wings on the remote region of radial borehole on its two lateral sides  fracture will firstly initiate from the weakness plane, if its tensile or shear failure pressure is less than that fip from rock matrix   1  introduction  radial drilling is a technology that is able to make a right turn in a cased wellbore (vertical, slanted, or horizontal well) and then penetrate some distance out into the formation (balch et al , 2016; w dickinson and dickinson, 1985; wade dickinson et al , 1993)  the drilling tools can be high-pressure water jet, called radial-jet-drilling (rjd) (wang et al , 2016), as well as mechanical drill bit (balch et al , 2016)  the formed radial laterals, with radius of 20-50 mm and length of 10-100 m, distributing in one layer or multiple layers, can penetrate the near well damage zone, communicate with the formation far from the main well (cinelli and kamel, 2013; ragab, 2013), avoid fluid invasion damage during hydraulic fracturing (ren et al , 2016) and increase productivity with low cost | 
2017-0282 	 experiment and sem analysis on rock breaking mechanism by swirling-round sc-co2 jet |abstract: swirling-round jet could highly improve rock erosion efficiency  besides, supercritical carbon dioxide (sc-co2) fluid is characterized by low rock breaking threshold pressure and high rock breaking rate  this paper proposes a new type of jet, called swirling-round sc-co2 jet  rock breaking mechanism of swirling-round sc-co2 jet is studied by means of rock-erosion experiment and scanning electron microscope (sem) observation  standard cylinder sandstone cores were used for rock erosion experiment  then, slices were cut off from these rock samples for sem observation  results show that the jet penetration efficiency of swirling-round sc-co2 jet is higher than that of round sc-co2 jet  sem observation presents: numerous crystal particles are snapped; inter-crystalline rupture occurs, generating large number of micro fractures; shear failure of crystal particles appear widely  therefore, the major rock breaking mechanisms of swirling-round sc-co2 jet are tensile and shear failure, while the breaking mechanism of round sc-co2 jet is tensile failure  for one thing, swirling-round sc-co2 breaks rock by combining axial impinging, radial tension and circumferential shear  for another, with characteristics of low viscosity, compressibility, strong diffusivity and permeability, numerous micro-fractures are caused by sc-co2, and the existed fractures are expanded, led to fractures joining together and massive rocks split off   1  introduction  when the temperature is above 304 k and the pressure is above 7 38 mpa, co2 will change into the supercritical state  it is a kind of non-gaseous, non-liquid, non-solid co2 with many unique physical and chemical properties (h wang et al , 2015)  supercritical co2 (sc-co2) is with density similar to that of a liquid and viscosity comparable to a gas (gupta et al , 2005)   a new drilling method by sc-co2 jet was proposed in recent years (j  j  kolle, 2000; j j kolle, 2002; shen et al , 2010)  sc-co2 jet has already been approved to reserve low rock threshold pressure and high penetration rate with comparison of water jet and has good application prospects (du et al , 2012; j  j  kolle, 2000; h wang et al , 2015)  r-h wang et al  (2014)r-h wang et al  (2014)r-h wang et al  (2014)r-h wang et al  (2014) experimentally simulated the distributions of pressure and temperature on the bottom of the hole during the sc-co2 jet drilling  results show that the bottom hole temperature and pressure increases with the increase of the nozzle diameter, the jet length has an optimum value, and the increase of the inlet pressure has a positive effect on the drilling rate  gupta et al  (2005) analyzed the feasibility of sc-co2 in deep underbalanced drilling operations  it shows that sc-co2 has the necessary density in the tubing to turn the downhole motor and the necessary density and viscosity to maintain underbalanced conditions in the annulus  long et al  (2016) numerically investigated the impinging flow field in the bottom hole during drilling with sc-co2  results show that the inlet temperature will increase the axial velocity but will slightly reduce both the mass flow rate and the impact of the carbon dioxide jet; an increase in the inlet pressure not only increase the mass flow rate and the dynamic pressure of the supercritical carbon dioxide jet but also increase both the pressure gradient and the temperature gradient along the impinging wall which are beneficial to the jet-assisted drilling process  z wang et al  (2016) established a phase state prediction model during carbon dioxide drilling, showing that variations in the flow work affect the temperature field of the sc-co2 fluid significantly | 
2017-0285 	 influence of shale creep behavior on the closure of non-propped fractures in shale gas reservoirs |abstract: slickwater fracturing has been widely utilized in the exploitation of shale gas reservoirs around the world  due to the difficulty of migrating proppant deep into the reservoir, a large number of fractures with little or no proppant placement would form after the treatment, acting as main flow paths for gas production  and the sharp production rate decline after a period of production is considered as the result of closure of this kind of fractures  first a summary of the research on the deformation of natural fractures and shale creep behavior is given  then a simplified numerical non-propped fracture model is established to simulate the fracture closure under normal stress, which consists of the elastic deformation caused by pressure drop in fractures and the deformation caused by formation creep behavior  the results of the simulation show that, the fracture closure caused by creep is too large to be ignored  the fracture deformation under the conditions of different normal stress and surface contact area is also studied in the paper   1  introduction  to achieve maximum stimulated reservoir volume, the fracturing technique which employs low-viscosity slickwater as fracturing fluid has been widely utilized in shale gas reservoirs around the world  the initial production rate of shale gas reservoirs is largely boosted benefiting from the complex fracture network created after the treatment  however, an unexpected production decline would usually occur at the early exploitation stage of the reservoir (almasoodi et al , 2014)  although the reason for this is still not fully understood, the closure of hydraulic fractures under the in-situ stress acting normal to the plane of fracture is believed to be one of the main causes (kamali and pournik, 2015)  on the other hand, due to the poor proppant migration ability of slickwater and the intrinsic tight characteristic of shale gas reservoirs, many fractures with no proppant placement would be created after the hydraulic fracturing treatment, acting as main flow paths for gas production (mayerhofer et al , 1997)  hence, the deformation and conductivity change of non-propped fractures under normal stress are studied in this paper | 
2017-0290 	 hydromechanical modelling of rock mass grouting |abstract: rock mass grouting is typically used to reduce leakage into underground structures and increase rock strength  it is costly in terms of both direct cost and the required time to achieve the desired result of grouting and is therefore a tractable process to optimize  here we describe how the non-newtonian grout material flows and behaves in thin fractures and fracture networks and how it can be solved numerically and efficiently with complexity beyond one-dimensional approximation  an immiscible two-phase flow formulation, describing the grout and (here) water in the fractures, is compared to a one-dimensional analytic solution  the geomechanical response to grouting is discussed and an efficient boundary condition (using the injectivity; the ratio of injection rate and pressure) to handle a complex fracture network in a numerical model is described and applied to a real-life grout injection data  |1  introduction |rock mass grouting is a common method to seal tunnel walls in hard rock to avoid water inflow  cementitious grout is injected into rock during excavation with the purpose of sealing major hydraulically conductive fractures  this grouting process can represent a significant part of the tunneling cost and therefore an increased knowledge on how to achieve cost- and time- efficient grouting methods while obtaining the desired reduction in permeability, is crucial  real-time grouting control (rtgc, kobayashi (2008)) is a method used to actively monitor the grouting process by analyzing the real-time pumping data to assess the penetration length of the grout  in addition to grout spread, it is important to avoid hydro-jacking (dilation of existing fractures) and hydro-fracturing (creation of new fractures) because it can lead to unnecessary and excessive use of grout material and potentially compromise the integrity of the rock mass  |besides the complexity of a fracture, or fracture network, which will be addressed later, one particular challenge in modelling the grouting process, with e g  finite element (fe), is the large aspect ratio of the fractures: the ratio between the thickness and the lateral extent of fracture planes  coupled problems (hydromechanical models) with complex processes (two distinctly different fluids flowing in thin fractures) of complex materials (non-newtonian bingham fluid) can lead to extremely computationally intensive models, making full 3d fe simulations both unfeasible and undesirable  for this reason, calculations are typically done using one-dimensional analytical and/or semi-analytical models with the inherit limitation of being approximate | 
2017-0292 	 effect of ponded water level on stability of a tailings dam |abstract: tailings dams are designed to handle large volumes of waste material from mining operations, thereby their stability has primary importance for sustainability of the mine environment  this paper investigates two-dimensional stability analysis of recently raised condition of eti copper mine tailings dam; located in kastamonu, turkey  to evaluate stability of the tailings dam, the most critical cross section of the dam was analyzed with finite element method  long-term stability analysis was performed with phase 2 v 8 01 finite element program and shear strength reduction method was utilized  dam behavior was examined under static loading conditions by considering the different ponded water levels and slime-sand boundary positions  the main reason for this comparative parametric analysis is that it is hard to define ponded water level and exact location of boundary between slime-sand materials within the pond  it was found that increased ponded water level resulted in lower safety factor below the acceptable levels  the location of slime-sand boundary effected the results only when the ponded water level is high, otherwise the results were nearly the same  |1  introduction |the stability of the recently increased tailings dam was analyzed under static loading conditions by considering the effects of ponded water level and slime-sand boundary position  as the tailing material has different settlement characteristics in the tailings pond, and ponded water level may change time to time, it is required to investigate the effects of these parameters on the safety of the dam  |long-term stability analysis of the tailings dam was evaluated using phase 2 v 8 01  shear strength reduction method was used with plane strain analysis  the most critical cross section (fig  1), which is the midsection of the dam, was analyzed with finite element method to evaluate the stability of the dam  |the embankment has approximately 126 m height  for the modeling phase, both the embankment and the tailings parts were divided into three layers according to their depth  each of the layers of the embankment is almost 40 m  for tailings and dam part, it was assumed that initial constructed part of dam and initial accumulated tailings had composed the first layer, and the remaining part was divided into two equal layers | 
2017-0293 	 non-elastic effects in static and dynamic rock stiffness |abstract: the static stiffness of a rock is generally smaller than its dynamic stiffness, which, for non-dispersive rocks, is due to a difference in strain amplitude in compaction tests (quasi-static) and wave-velocity measurements (dynamic)  while acoustic waves are purely elastic, quasi-static mechanical tests usually induce non-elastic deformations  a model introduced by fj<u+00e6>r et al , 2013 allows to quantify non-elastic contributions as a function of stress-variation amplitude and hence to determine the purely elastic stiffness from a standard rock mechanical test  however, due to experimental constraints it was not clear if the model would be valid down to strain amplitudes of acoustic waves  we have performed an experiment on undrained, water-saturated castlegate sandstone, combining a quasi-static triaxial test with force-oscillation measurements at seismic frequency in order to investigate stress/strain amplitude-related non-elastic effects  we have found that inelastic effects are activated for strains as small as 10<u+2212>6 (<u+03bc>strain), and that the compliance increases linearly with increasing stress amplitude   1  introduction  the stiffness of a material is given by the ratio between stress change and strain change for a given stress path  in quasi-static tests, stiffness is usually measured for strains in the order of 10<u+2212>3 (mstrain)  dynamic stiffness, on the other hand, is derived from acoustic wave velocities (at seismic, sonic, or ultrasonic frequencies), where strain amplitudes are usually smaller than 10<u+2212>6 (<u+03bc>strain)  the difference in strain amplitudes is believed to be the main cause of inconsistency between static and dynamic moduli in rocks with no (or small) velocity dispersion (hilbert jr et al , 1994; tutuncu et al , 1998)  in dispersive rocks like shales, strain rate (frequency) effects may in addition play a significant role (holt et al , 2012)   in this paper, we will focus on the strain amplitude effect  winkler et al , 1979 demonstrated that for strains greater than about 10<u+2212>6, grain boundary friction mechanisms are activated  strain amplitudes of the quasi-static stiffness measurements are much higher  therefore, non-elastic effects may take place  fj<u+00e6>r et al , 2011 identified two main non-elastic mechanisms during uniaxial loading/unloading paths  one mechanism - crushing of small asperities at grain contacts or crack faces - is irreversible and appears only during loading  the other mechanism - friction-controlled sliding of internal surfaces in contact - is reversible and observed during both loading and unloading  it causes hysteresis in the stress strain curve as schematically illustrated in fig  1 | 
2017-0294 	 coupled novel geomechanical, acoustic, and permeability measurements under true triaxial stress state in berea sandstone |abstract: a novel true triaxial testing apparatus was used that is equipped with flexible membranes pressurizing cylindrical core samples in the two orthogonal radial directions with independent stress magnitudes  we report the experimental investigation carried out to capture the true triaxial stress effect on the deformation and flow behavior in berea sandstone core samples utilizing coupled measurements of stress, deformation, ultrasonic wave propagation properties, and permeability  through octahedral normal stresses and shear stress cycling at various values of the nondimensional stress parameter b, defined as b = (<u+03c3>2 – <u+03c3>3)/(<u+03c3>1 – <u+03c3>3), the effects stress-induced anisotropy on deformation and permeability was observed to be consistent with expected microstructural changes related to the opening/closing of microfractures due to the change in shear stress magnitude  changes in b signify the relative magnitude of intermediate principal stress to maximum and minimum stresses, which was determined to influence the mechanical properties of the formation in both dry and water-saturated conditions  the permeability obtained the axial direction increases with increasing axial loading and decreases with radial loading   1  introduction  stress-induced anisotropy of reservoir geomechanical properties is essential from drilling risk reduction to wellpath and reservoir productivity optimization  borehole stability, completion type selection, hydraulic fracturing design and optimization, and production operations all require accurate determination of stress alterations and associated changes in geomechanical, acoustic and petrophysical properties of reservoir formations  current attempts to capture the effect of stress state on formation geomechanical characteristics typically consist of conventional triaxial testing of core samples that often cannot portray the true stress state around the wellbore and within the reservoir   there is very limited experimental research on the stress-induced anisotropy of various formation geomechanical properties under true triaxial stress state since in these tests, concentration is on exploring failure characteristics of rocks  sedimentary rocks have a wide range of variations in microstructure along with various minerals and organic matter  to obtain reliable data used for modeling hydromechanical behavior of rocks, rock samples need to be tested by simulating their in-situ conditions  structural anisotropy causes anisotropy in rock hydromechanical properties  further anisotropy is induced with anisotropic stress states  however, conventional triaxial testing is insufficient in terms of stress state reproducibility  true triaxial testing is the advancement of triaxial testing capable of simulating more realistic stress states by controlling the intermediate principal stress  with independent manipulation of three principal stresses and measurements of coupled changes in deformation, acoustic properties, permeability, resistivity, and other anisotropic properties as response to various stress scenarios using a single cylindrical core sample, it is possible to investigate the changes a formation will experience throughout the lifecycle of operations | 
2017-0296 	 hydro-mechanical-chemical effects on permeability evolution of fractures in longmaxi shale |abstract: hydraulic fracturing is an essential technology to stimulate shale reservoirs by creating massive fluid-conductive channels to improve access to reservoir  recently, supercritical carbon dioxide (sc-co2) has been considered as an alternative fracturing fluid to water  previous sc-co2 fracturing experiments suggest that, in the short-term during stimulation, sc-co2 may create rougher fracture surfaces and more complex fracture networks due to its low viscosity, high diffusivity and low interfacial tension  however, post-stimulation, the remnant co2 may react with native water in the shale to create carbonic acid  this in turn may impact long-term permeability evolution in the reservoir  we report experimental observations of permeation of carbonic acid of varied acidic potential (ph) to investigate hydro-mechanical-chemical effects on fracture permeability evolution under various stress states  surface profilometry and sem-eds are employed to quantify the evolution in both roughness on, and chemical constituents within, the fracture surface  results indicate that, after 12-hours of fluid flow, fracture apertures reduce by ~18 76% with distilled water (ph=7 0), ~9 80% at ph=6 0 and increase by between ~6 30% (ph=5 0) and ~23 64% (ph=4 0) as acidity is further increased  the evolution of roughness and transformation of chemical elements on the fracture surface are in accordance with the evolution of permeability  the experimental observations imply that, co2-rich aqueous fluids have significant impact on the evolution of fracture permeability and may influence (and increase) shale gas production  however, the observed response reflects the impact of both the removal of bridging asperities (low acidity) and in enhancing free-face dissolution (high acidity) in a complex and enigmatic fashion   1  introduction  as the main channels for gas and oil transport, hydraulic fracturing induced fracture characteristics directly affect gas or oil production (scanlon et al ,2014)  fracture surfaces with different fracture roughness and complexity are induced by different fracturing fluids (water, sc-co2) in longmaxi shale (zhang et al , 2016; zhou and burbey, 2014)  however, hydraulic fracturing has a long-term component, featuring long-term fluid-rock interaction  after fractures and channels are created, these fractures become the main conduits for fluid flow - for the fracturing fluid, methane or oil  hence, after sc-co2 fracturing treatment, the remnant co2 may react with native water in the shale to create carbonic acid, which may impact long-term permeability evolution in the reservoir | 
2017-0297 	 can mineralogical compositions predict frictional strength, stability and shear permeability of fractures? |abstract: massive fluid injection can reactivate pre-existing faults or fractures and induce deformation as either seismic slip, slow slip or aseismic slip  these shear deformations, controlled by frictional strength and stability, may lead to different shear permeability evolutions  previous studies have explored frictional stability-permeability relationships of carbonate-rich and phyllosilicate-rich samples during shear deformation, suggesting that phyllosilicate-rich shale has a lower frictional strength, but higher frictional stability and larger permeability reduction than that of carbonate-rich shale  this qualitative result is sufficient to identify the role of individual mineral group (i e , tectosilicate, carbonate, and phyllosilicate) in prompting this response  indeed, it is still uncertain whether or not a quantitative relationship of frictional stability-permeability relationships of fractures exists  in this study, we perform a series of hydroshearing experiments on saw-cut fractures of natural rocks (green river shale, opalinus shale, longmaxi shale, tournemire shale, marcellus shale, and newberry tuff) with distinct mineralogical compositions to understand the frictional stability-permeability relationships with respect to individual mineral groups  our experimental results indicate that permeability change increases non-linearly with frictional strength while decreases non-linearly with frictional stability  these relationships imply that clay-rich fractures may be easily reactivated with aseismic deformation due to low frictional strength and high frictional stability, meanwhile, the permeability may decline due to clay swelling and wear product compaction  on the contrary, tectosilicate-rich fractures show the opposite trend  these results are significant for providing valuable references for understanding how permeability evolves in engineering activities like shale reservoir stimulation and co2 caprock integrity evaluation   1  introduction  the stimulation of shale gas reservoir, of enhanced geothermal system (egs), and the long term geological sequestration of co2 involve massive fluid injection, which may reactivate pre-existing faults and fractures by hydroshearing and induce seismicity as seismic slip, slow slip and aseismic slip (cornet et al , 1997; zoback et al , 2012; guglielmi et al , 2015b; fang et al , 2016)  a number of in-situ observations show that these deformations may affect the transport characteristics of the reservoir formation  for example, rapid flow at seismogenic depths is observed in iodp drill holes on the cascadia margin (davis et al , 1995)  in-situ experiments show permeability enhancement that are associated with small dilatant slip event in reactivation of both tournemire shale and carbonate faults (guglielmi et al , 2015a, 2015b)  at laboratory scale, experimental observations indicate that when a fracture slips, permeability may increase due to significant dilation or decrease as a result of progressive formation of gouge (barton et al , 1985; faoro et al , 2009)  these relationships between fluid flow and fault slip pose a ubiquitous question in understanding how fault permeability evolves during fault movement, which would further provide significant insight of how fluids may be trapped by seal layers, how hydrocarbons may migrate within fractures, and how integrity of seal system may lose or enhance | 
2017-0301 	 estimation of rock mechanical parameters using artificial intelligence tools |abstract: good understanding of the mechanical behavior of reservoir rock is very important in reducing the problems related to wellbore stability, sand production and reservoir subsidence  to carry out any operation, a continuous profile of rock mechanical parameters is needed  retrieving reservoir rock samples throughout the depth of the reservoir and performing laboratory tests are extremely expensive and time consuming  therefore, these parameters are estimated from the sonic and compressional wave velocities obtained from well-logs  parameters obtained from laboratory tests are termed as static parameters while those obtained from sonic logs are dynamic parameters  the former case represents closely the condition in the reservoir  since the well-logs provide a continuous profile of parameters, they have to be calibrated with respect to the static parameters  this paper presents a rigorous empirical correlations based on the weights and biases of artificial neural network to predict sonic logs (compressional and shear wave travel times), elastic parameters (static young’s modulus and poisson’s ratio) and failure parameter (unconfined compressive strength) the testing of new correlations on real field data resulted in less error between actual and predicted values, suggesting that the proposed correlations are very robust and accurate, and can help geo-mechanical engineers to construct representative earth model   1  introduction  rock mechanical parameters are critical in alleviating the risks associated with the drilling and maximizing the reservoir productivity  these parameters are used in the optimization of the well placement, well bore instability, completion design, draw-down limits to avoid sanding, hydraulic fracturing, and many more  the accurate estimation of these parameters is very essential for the development and production phases of hydrocarbon recovery  incorrect estimation of rock mechanical parameters may wrongly lead to heavy investment decisions and inappropriate field development plans (abdulraheem et al , 2009)   to carry out any operation, a continuous profile of rock mechanical parameters is needed  retrieving reservoir rock samples throughout the depth of the reservoir and performing laboratory tests are extremely expensive and time consuming  therefore, these parameters are estimated from the sonic and compressional wave velocities obtained from well-logs  parameters obtained from laboratory tests are termed as static parameters while those obtained from well-logs are dynamic parameters  the former case represents closely the condition in the reservoir  since the well-logs provide a continuous profile of parameters, they have to be calibrated with respect to the static parameters (fj<u+00e6>r et al , 1992) | 
2017-0302 	 weakening effects of microstructural tribological films in co2-altered reservoirs and caprocks |abstract: where supercritical co2 is injected into aquifers, the subsequent dissolution of co2 into the brine may result in substantial reaction and chemical transformation of the minerals comprising the reservoir and caprock and disturb the stress field, and alter the permeability these combined effects may result in weakening of pre-existing faults, transformation of permeability and the triggering of induced-seismicity, via weakening  pristine and co2-alterd rocks from the crystal geyser (major et al  2014) define the evolution of fe-coating (hematite) into altered tribological films (goethite) surrounding the grains with different strength and stability properties  we use this transformed microstructural form to examine the ensemble strength and structural stability  we use a 2-d distinct element model (dem) to simulate fault gouge materials under slip events  the mechanical response of grain-grain contacts is represented by a linear-elastic contact model with rotational resistance and a slip-weakening friction law  goethite and hematite coating configurations are represented using tiny particles surrounding quartz analog particles with different contact properties  numerical shear experiments are performed on simulated fault gouge with unaltered (hematite coating) and altered (goethite coating) configurations  co2 altered gouge shows lower friction coefficient (~0 4) than unaltered gouge (~0 65)  however, the weakening effect of the goethite coating is not enhanced by increasing relative coating concentration  results of end-member (unaltered and altered gouge materials) behaviors show that the goethite film may serve as the main mechanism of weakening and creep behavior in these co2 altered faults   1  introduction  shear strength of natural faults is crucial in determine slip of faults  studies show that natural faults tend to slip at much lower resolved shear stress than laboratory inferred stresses [engelder et al , 1975; dieterich, 1979; marone et al , 1990]  this weakening of natural faults can be related to mechanical effects of low effective stress - increase in pore pressure [rice, 1992; faulkner and rutter, 2001], and chemical alteration on the mineralogy of the reservoir and the corresponding fault zone [escartin et al , 2008]  for the former causality, it has been suggested that the elevation of pore pressure by anthropogenic injection activities may serve as one of the main causalities of induced seismicity [mcgarr et al , 2002; ellsworth, 2013; walsh and zoback, 2015]  injection of supercritical co2 into either brine aquifers or depleted oil reservoirs for sequestration may disturb the local stress field by elevating pore pressure, reactivating pre-existing faults, thus inducing potential seismicity [benson and cole, 2008]  despite the mechanical weakening effects on faults, the chemical reactive fluid may also disturb local chemical equilibrium [park and fan, 2004; altman et al , 2014], and alter the mineralogy  this may change the mechanical properties of affected zones by potentially introducing minerals with low frictional strength, thus weakening the faults [wang and elsworth, 2017]  the injected co2 or brine may also migrate through highly permeable formations to expand the affected zones [shao et al , 2010; bakker et al , 2016]  these affected zones, possibly weakened by the combination of mechanical and chemical effects, may initiate slip events or even nucleate large earthquakes [chou et al , 2012] |

2017-0305 	 determination of mode ii dynamic fracture toughness using short core in compression (scc) specimen |abstract: this study introduces a method for determining mode ii dynamic fracture toughness using short-core-in-compression(scc) rock specimens  the scc specimens which have two notches are loaded dynamically by split hopkinson pressure bar apparatus  a pulse shaping technique with copper disc pulse shaper was used to achieve the stress equilibrium state through the specimen before failure initiating  a high speed digital camera was used to observe the occurrence of shear cracks between the notch tips  the dynamic loading tests of scc specimens were performed in the range of 202gpa/s ~ 343gpa/s and obtained mode ii dynamic fracture toughness was between 6 26mpa m1/2 ~ 7 51mpa m1/2  the mode ii dynamic fracture toughness showed 2 7~ 3 1 times of mode ii static fracture toughness in this study   1  introduction  theory of rock fracture mechanics has been applied to solve many rock engineering problems such as rock drilling, rock excavation, rock blasting and hydraulic fracturing  it is well known that rock materials contains many pre-existing microcracks which may cause complex fracturing processes depending on environmental conditions  when a pre-existing crack is subjected to an externally applied loading, stresses concentrate around the crack tip and accelerates the crack growth , to understand the stresses level around crack tip, the evaluation of stress intensity factor is of significant importance  fracture toughness is a critical value of stress intensity factor which indicates the level of stress required for the pre-existing crack to propagate under a given crack arrangement  three crack tip deformation modes are generally possible in fracture process, i e  mode i (crack opening), mode ii (crack sliding) and mode iii (crack tearing)  in rock engineering problems, mode i and mode ii or mixed mode i-ii is very important and thus various researches have been conducted in the past [1-5] to evaluate the fracture toughness for these fracturing modes  however, according to the isrm suggested methods, there is only one experimental method to determine mode ii fracture toughness while four methods have been already suggested for mode i [6]  in addition, experimental studies about mode ii fracture toughness of rocks are mainly for the case of quasi-static loading condition, while many rock engineering applications including rock drilling and rock blasting are carried out under dynamic loading condition  because rocks show strong loading rate/strain rate dependency [e g , 4,7], understanding the mode ii dynamic fracture toughness is also of significant importance | 
2017-0306 	 evaluation of acoustic and mechanical properties of sedimentary rock under different saturation conditions  |abstract: the growing demand and depletion of deep-earth mineral resources has increased the potential of considering mineral recovery in low-grade ore-bodies  in-situ leaching is an effective method of recovering resources such as uranium, and copper from low-grade ore by injecting a leaching solution to the deposit to dissolve minerals  most common sedimentary ore-deposits and oilfields, however, needs a well-developed fracture network for enhanced recovery  fracturing the ore-deposit for enhanced recovery requires sound knowledge of strength properties of sedimentary deposits  this study presents experimental results of mechanical properties of sandstone saturated in water, oil, and nacl brines to represent strength characteristics of sandstone oilfields and saline, mineral-bearing sandstone formations  unconfined compressive strength tests were conducted on sandstone samples and the stress-strain characteristics were captured through a non-contact digital image correlation system  acoustic velocities and acoustic energy release of samples during failure were measured using a pci-2 based ae system  compared to water saturated samples, brine saturated ones showed further strength deterioration at lower brine concentrations and this influence diminished with increasing salinity  a significant strength retention in sandstone saturated in oil was observed compared to water and brine saturated samples  the acoustic velocities measured can be correlated with strength variation pattern of tested specimens   1  introduction  with the depletion of high-grade ore deposits and the environmental concerns arising with conventional mining methods, in-situ leaching (isl) of minerals has emerged as a new technology making mining low-grade ore deposits more economical (sinclair and thompson, 2015)  isl involves drilling holes into the ore deposit followed by pumping a leaching solution into an ore body, dissolving the metals in the leach solution  the solution is then pumped to the surface and processed to recover the dissolved minerals  at present, isl is limited to highly permeable ore bodies and fracturing technologies may be used to improve the performance of isl by creating open pathways in the deposit for leaching solution to penetrate  however, fracturing of ore deposits, require a sound knowledge of strength properties of the target rock to minimize the nucleation and propagation of unwanted cracks which could lead to groundwater contamination in some cases (de silva et al , 2016)  most sedimentary oilfields and ore deposits are usually are in saturated conditions and the strength variation in the rock under different saturation conditions is an important aspect that must be investigated before any field application of isl in a water sensitive areas | 
2017-0307 	 trajectory optimization for horizontal shale gas well by integrating wellbore stability |abstract: in this paper, the optimization model has been established to optimize 3d horizontal well trajectory in shale gas field  two types of well trajectory have been discussed according to the whole trajectory and the correction trajectory  the sensitivity analysis of wellbore stability versus inclination angle and azimuth angle is conducted  the optimization model takes drilling depth as objective function and takes wellbore stability, dogleg severity as constraints  a new heuristic algorithm named differential search algorithm (ds) has been applied to optimize well trajectory combined with penalty function  at last, case study is presented and it demonstrates that the proposed optimization model can obtain a trajectory with minimum drilling depth under the constraints of wellbore stability and dogleg severity  it also indicates that ds has an excellent performance with high accuracy and stability for 3d well trajectory optimization   1  introduction  cluster horizontal wells have been significantly applied in high-efficient development of shale gas field in china  well trajectory optimization by minimizing the drilling depth is an effective way to reduce the drilling cost  the well trajectory optimization in shale gas field are faced with wellbore instability and potentially high dogleg severity  thus, how to optimize well trajectory by integrating wellbore instability and dogleg severity is significant in horizontal shale gas well design   conventionally, well trajectory design is based on various calculation models (mcmillian, 1981; liu, 2001; sawaryn, 2005; han, 2007; sawaryn, 2007)  when some trajectory parameters are given, others can be calculated  however, to obtain an optimum trajectory, it always adopts trial-and-error approach and the process is time consuming, inefficient and difficult to ensure the optimal well trajectory  the optimization theory provides an efficient method for optimal design as the essence of well trajectory optimization is nonlinear constrained optimization (co) problem  helmy (helmy, 1998) firstly established an optimization model for well trajectory design  suryanarayana and khaled have also studied this problem and sequential unconstrained minimization technique (sumt) has been applied to optimize well trajectory (suryanarayana, 1998; khaled et al , 1999)  aim at 3d well trajectory, shokir established a new optimization model and the casing location has been taken into account  in addition, genetic algorithm (ga) is applied to optimize the 3d horizontal well trajectory (shokir et al , 2004)  recently, amin presents a continuous particle swarm optimization algorithm (pso) for optimizing well trajectory (amin, 2014)  from the existing studies, we can find that the existing optimization model has not considered wellbore instability  moreover, the trajectory optimization model may be difference in the whole trajectory design and the correction trajectory design, therefore, it is better to establish the optimization model respectively  besides, the performances of optimization algorithms applying to well trajectory design are also needed to improve | 
2017-0308 	 microcrack network development in salt-rock during cyclic loading at low confining pressure |abstract: triaxial compression tests of synthetic salt-rock are conducted to investigate microfracture development in a semibrittle polycrystalline aggregate  the salt-rock is produced from uniaxial consolidation of granular halite at 150 °c  following consolidation, the sample is deformed by cyclic loading at room temperature and low confining pressure (pc = 1 mpa)  load cycles are performed within the elastic regime, up to yielding, and after successive increments of steady ductile flow  at the tested conditions, the samples exhibit ductile behavior with slight work hardening  the microstructure at different stages of deformation indicates that grain-boundary cracking is the dominant brittle deformation mechanism  microcracking is influenced by the loading configuration and the geometric relationships between neighboring grains  these microcracks display a preferred orientation parallel to the load axis  with cyclic loading, microcracks increase in density and form linked arrays parallel to the direction of loading  as the linked arrays lengthen, grain contacts are progressively opened, which eventually leads to loss of cohesion along surfaces parallel to the loading direction  the observations of crack-network development in salt-rock can improve our understanding of progressive damage and spalling at salt cavern walls   1  introduction  salt-rock is a viable geomaterial for hydrocarbon storage and waste disposal, because of its favorable creep characteristics and ultra-low permeability for sealing  in the case of storing high-pressure natural gas for balancing seasonal supply, or for pressurized gas associated with wind energy storage, salt caverns are subjected to long-term cyclic loading such that cavern stability becomes a major concern (e g , brouard et al , 2012; minkley et al , 2015)  a common stability issue is spalling at salt cavern wall, which not only alters the cavern geometry but also can damage the hanging string and cause roof collapse  salt block fall due to spalling has been reported in numerous salt caverns, for example the kiel salt cavern of germany (baar, 1977) and the big hill cavern of usa (munson et al , 2004) | 
2017-0309 	 optimization of the number of segments per ring and its effects on segmental tunnel lining behavior- case study: line 4 tehran subway |abstract: this paper describes an evaluation of the optimum number of reinforced concrete segments per ring that can best fulfil the tunnel lining function to support the design loads  hence, the effects of number of segments in the ring were investigated among which the worst case has been selected for further investigation  subsequently, the influence of key-segment location has been considered in-depth  to construct the required models, the beam-spring concept has been employed  the required input data was obtained from line-4, tehran subway tunnels  abaqus, a finite element program, was used to analyze the problem  this program has the capability of analyzing tunnel structures by considering the effect of two-dimensional rotational behavior of intersegmental joint condition  the results demonstrate that as the number of segments per ring increases, the corresponding maximum bending moment within the lining system decreases  consequently, the related displacement due to the lining flexibility increases  finally, it has been concluded that due to increase of the number of segments per ring, the importance of position dependency of the key-segment within the lining system is significantly reduced   1  introduction  shield tunneling has become a widely-used method, in particular, for urban and suburban tunnel construction due to its superior performance compared to conventional methods  the method attributes negligible effect on surrounding environment, fast and safe construction, and outstanding performance in earthquake resistance  (nadimi et al  2010 and 2011, zhang et al  2004)  the arrangement and number of segments in shield tunneling may differ based on the existing situation; however, the entire assembling process is generally the same (chen and mo 2006)  the design of the precast segmental lining is based upon the proposed tunnel alignment and the expected geological and hydrogeological conditions at the tunnel level  the existence of joints in a tunnel ring will influence the behavior of the support system and the induced stress pattern in the linin  actually, inter-segmental joints can be used for the force and lining behavior evaluation  the segmental joint will have a behavioral mode somewhere between a total fixation and a hinge (majdi et al , 2010, nadimi and shahriar, 2013)  the orientation of joints within each segmental ring may vary along the tunnel route depending on the tunnel boring machine steering alignment  furthermore, the possible mode of the joint orientation is governed by the joint numbers  the combination of these two factors might influence the stresses induced in the tunnel lining  accordingly, both cost and planning purpose might be affected (hefny and chua, 2006)  therefore, the main purpose of this research is to investigate the influence of joint numbers and their orientations on the tunnel lining behavior  however, the tunnel lining design is almost based on empirical and analytical methods like the “beam spring model” which was proposed to analyze the tunnel lining under the ground loads (murakami and koizumi 1978)  this method has become the standard technique to design shield tunnel lining in japan (jsce 1996)  in this study, the model was used for representing the segmental joints and surrounding ground as rotational springs and non-tension ground springs, respectively | 
2017-0311 	 shale rock characterization using multi-scale imaging |abstract: characterizing the heterogeneous structure of shale rocks plays a critical role in understanding their gas storage, fluid transport, and geomechanical properties  in this study, multiple imaging scales are used to better view features involved in the geomechanical properties of shales  imaging techniques are combined with routine analytical measurements (e g , x-ray diffraction and mercury injection) to investigate multiscale heterogeneity of a carbonate-rich 2 54-cm core sample from the eagle ford shale of southern texas  a stitched computed tomographic (<u+03bc>ct) image was collected using an x-ray microscope with a voxel dimension of 13 4 <u+03bc>m  within this image, several regions representing different matrix densities and features such as fractures were selected and imaged using a non-destructive method called “interior tomography” with an improved resolution of 3 6 to 3 7 <u+03bc>m  after the interiors were imaged, 5-mm diameter cores were drilled from the regions corresponding to the interior tomography regions using fiducial marks on the exterior of the core as reference points  high-resolution <u+03bc>ct scans of 5-mm cores have voxel lengths of 4 5 to 5 1 <u+03bc>m whereas interior tomography images have voxel sizes of 1 1 <u+03bc>m  the 5-mm cores were similarly subsampled as 1-mm cores that are imaged as whole cores and an interior tomography  the resulting data collection allows the comparison of <u+03bc>ct data at different scales and core diameters as voxel dimensions alone are not sufficient for this task  for instance, the interior tomography for the 2 54-cm core has smaller voxel size (3 6 – 3 7 <u+03bc>m) compared to that generated by the 5-mm core scan (4 7 – 5 1 <u+03bc>m); however, small features in the 5-mm core scan are better resolved than in the 2 54-cm core interior scan  image quality and ability to segment properly is affected by the different <u+03bc>ct settings and additional rock volumes that the x-rays penetrate  in addition, volumetric data generated by segmenting 3d reconstructions of <u+03bc>ct data are compared to independent mineral, organic matter, and porosity measurements  the interpretation of multiscale <u+03bc>ct images improves our understanding as to the porosity distribution and rock fabric in this shale sample  these two properties factor into the geomechanical behavior of carbonate-rich shales   1  introduction  the unconventional hydrocarbon plays from mudrocks or “shales” contribute about half of the overall gas and oil production in the united states; this proportion is expected to increase over the next twenty years [1, 2]  the development of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing has made hydrocarbon production from these unconventional reservoirs possible technically as well as economically feasible for the oil and gas companies  in order to employ these techniques, characterization of the physical and fluid flow properties of shale reservoir rocks has become both a necessity and a complex problem [3, 4]| 
2017-0312 	 multi-stage creep experiments on the wolfcamp shale, permian basin, west texas, usa |abstract: in this study, we examine the variation of viscoplastic creep properties of wolfcamp shale samples from an area in the permian basin of west texas  in this area, multiple horizontal wells are drilled and hydraulically fractured at different depths to exploit the hydrocarbons in different reservoirs  following sone and zoback, (jour  petrol  sci  and eng , 2014) we are studying the degree to which viscoplastic creep leads to creation of high stress frac barriers  we report here a series of creep experiments on samples with various mineral contents and from different depths to test this concept  the experiments were conducted in a multistage pattern at three different stress levels  a comparison between inelastic time-dependent deformation of shale samples with different mineralogies at high pressures demonstrates that carbonate-rich shales show creep-hardening behavior at higher levels of stress whereas clay rich shales appear to creep more at high pressures and show creep-softening behavior   1  introduction  oil and gas production from very low permeability unconventional resources requires hydraulic fracturing  there is a wide range of variations in characteristics within the shale formations; some of the formations are relatively brittle and enabling hydraulic stimulation to enable production, while other shale formations deform ductily and may act as fracture and flow barriers [1, 2, 3]  predicting the magnitudes of the least principal stress within sedimentary basins has significant practical value in the petroleum industry   mineral composition has a direct effect on viscoplastic deformation of shale rocks  higher amounts of clay and organic matter makes the shale formations deform with time which would likely lead to the formations acting as fracture barriers in the reservoir  in addition, it is important to understand the degree of anisotropy in the rocks and its affect on hydraulic fracturing [4, 5, 6]   in this study, we conducted creep experiments under constant applied differential stress of 30 mpa, 40 mpa and 50 mpa on clay- or carbonate-rich shale samples collected from the wolfcamp formation in the permian basin formation in west texas, usa  using the results of these experiments, we calculated the creep parameters from a power-law model to study how mineral composition and sample structure change the deformation of samples at different stress levels in longterm  the results help us to better understand the timedependent response of shale formations with various properties at different stress states | 
2017-0313 	 experimental characterization of movement of water and air in granular material by using optic fiber sensor with an emphasis on refrative index of light |abstract: a new method for identifying type of material ahead of an optic fiber sensor is proposed  the sensor is made of two plastic optic fibers that are aligned side by side and glued together  the tips of these fibers are cut so that outward normal vectors of the cut surfaces are 90 degrees apart and at the same time each of them is at 45 degrees from fiber axes  as light is sent into the first fiber and reaches its tip, part of the light gets refracted and goes out of the fiber into the material ahead  the other part gets reflected, goes out of the first fiber through its side face and gets into the second fiber  this light reaches the cut surface of the second fiber from within and then part of it goes out into the material outside  the remaining light gets reflected and travels through the second fiber back to a photo sensor to be digitally recorded  the intensity of the recorded light is a function of differences between refractive indices of the plastic optic fiber and the material ahead of the fiber tip  analysis of this intensity leads to understanding of if the fiber tip is in air or in water in geo-material, which is of great interest in geotechnical engineering projects   1  introduction  use of optic fibers in geotechnical monitoring is twofold  in the first method, a long and continuous fiber is used to measure strain, temperature, etc  at arbitrary points on the fiber (for example, hill et al 1978, meltz et al 1989, funnel et al 2015) laid out in a closed topology  in this method, grated fiber made of glass is generally used over a large area and collected data are post-processed to obtain final results  no light is transmitted between the fiber and an outside environment; namely in geomaterials  in the second method, on the other hand, an open-ended topology of optic fiber is used for data collection  akutagawa et al (2014a, 2014b, 2015) have reported several examples in which plastic optic fibers are used as though they are lowest-resolution cameras  in this method, plastic optic fiber is used as a one-pixel camera to watch deformation of sand particles, passage of water in granular material, passage of air bubble, wetting process of dry sand and so on  yoshikawa et al (2015) has also applied this method to dynamically monitor change in sea bed elevation during storm  optic data transmitted from the front face of the fiber can be either recognized by naked eyes, or they can be recorded by photo sensors on a real-time basis  this paper introduces a new strategy to be added to a series of monitoring tools developed in the line of the second method, so that differentiation of a material in front of the fiber tip; namely, whether it be water or air, becomes far easier than before by uniquely cut fiber surfaces  reflection and refraction of light play a key role in the proposed method  several examples are described to show how this new sensor works and its future potentials are discussed from a viewpoint of applying this new technology in various geotechnical engineering projects | 
2017-0317 	 modeling the borehole breakout in coal seams with a coupled hydro-mechanical model |abstract: borehole stability is of great concern in drilling wells in coal seams to extract coalbed methane, especially for horizontal wells within which excessive cuttings due to formation failure would easily incur the risk of stuck pipe  due to the presence of cleats and natural fractures, the coal commonly features low mechanical strength, remarkable brittleness and heterogeneity, frequently resulting in borehole instability issues during drilling, completion and production  in this present work, we developed a hydro-mechanical model to predict the borehole breakout and assess the stability of wells drilled in coal seams  the deformation and damage of the coal and the pore fluid flow within the coal are treated in a fully coupled manner  the mechanical behavior of the coal is represented by using an elastoplastic model incorporating post-peak strain softening, which has been evidenced to be essential for faithfully predicting the shape and size of the damage zone  in addition, the permeability of the coal within the damage zone is related to the damage state of the coal through an empirical relation  an inertia-based stabilizing method is proposed and implemented to overcome the loss of numerical convergence due to the abrupt strain softening constitutive behavior  the model has been applied to simulate the borehole breakout evolution and analyze the stability of coalbed methane wells drilled in the qinshui basin located in north china  the effects of the drilling mud density as well as the mud infiltration are demonstrated, and some implications for drilling stable wells in coal seams have been provided   1  introduction  economic production of methane from coal seams has been actively pursued in china during the last two decades, encouraged by the great success of the coalbed methane (cbm) industry in the united states and also by the abundance of cbm resources in china  various technologies have been developed for enhancing the cbm production, among which horizontal drilling is more and more frequently utilized to increase the effective drainage volume, especially for those low permeability cbm reservoirs  despite many efforts, maintaining wellbore stability remains one of the major challenges during the well construction and subsequent production processes due to the weak character of coals  it has been reported that nearly 40% of the horizontal cbm wells drilled by a major operator in the qinshui basin, which is located in north china, have encountered borehole instability related problems, causing remarkable loss in time and cost (yang et al , 2014)  thus, it is desirable to understand the damage process and borehole stability characteristics of wells drilled in coal seams and to provide some insights for successful well planning | 
2017-0319 	 hydraulic fracturing with leakoff in a dual porosity medium |abstract: hydraulic fracturing is a key method in the stimulation of shale gas reservoirs  shale gas formations often contain natural fractures which are fluid-pressure sensitive and dilate in response to the inflation of the fracture, increasing fluid loss and slowing down and prematurely arresting fracture propagation  models typically assume 1-d single-porosity/permeability leakoff perpendicular to the hydraulic fracture  however, the leakoff process in naturally fractured formation is considerably more complex  we present a hydraulic fracturing model based on the pkn-formalism which accommodates the leakoff into a dual porosity medium  proppant transport is accommodated by introducing empirical constitutive equations to determine the proppant distribution during the hydraulic fracturing treatment assuming that only the major hydraulic fractures remain propped  the model is solved numerically and is validated against known asymptotic solutions  it is shown that the model is capable of providing a rapid estimation of the morphology of hydraulic fractures in naturally fractured formations and the corresponding proppant distribution  the simulation results illustrate that the leakoff into a dual porosity medium, where fracture permeability is a strong function of applied fluid pressure, results in a reduced length of the propagating fracture due to the fugitive fluid leakoff from the fracture into the surrounding formation and that this in turn results in a reduced maximum width during the treatment  this observation is important as this significantly influences the ability to infuse fracture-maintaining proppants into the accessed reservoir at desired large distances from the injection wellbore due to the earlier screen-out and may compromise the ultimate efficiency of the final hydraulic fracture in relation to gas recovery   1  introduction  hydraulic fracturing is performed by injecting highly pressurized fluid into subsurface to fracture the formation  proppant is introduced later to keep the fractures open  since the pioneering work of khristianovic and zheltov (1955), various models have been proposed to approximately define the development of fracture geometry, among which the pkn and gdk models are the most popular (perkins and kern, 1961; nordgren, 1972; khristianovic and zheltov, 1955; greetesma and de klerk, 1969)  reviews of those models including their numerical solutions can be found in adachi et al  (2007) and rahman and rahman (2010)  further studies have been devoted to understanding the regimes of propagation and near tip behavior (garagash and detournay, 1999; detournay, 2004; adachi and peirce, 2005; adachi and peirce, 2008; garagash, 2006) which are summarized by detournay (2016) | 
2017-0320 	 isothermal creep behaviour investigation of thin spray-on liners |abstract: rock supporting has a vital importance in longevity and sustainability of all underground openings  there are many types and forms of supporting systems available in the mining/tunneling industry  in the last decade, a new polymer-based surface support material, thin spray-on liner (tsl), has started to take place of conventional surface support materials  tsl is defined as generally cement, latex, polymer-based and also reactive or non-reactive, multi-component materials applied to the rock surface with a layer of few millimeter thickness  they have the advantages of low volume, rapid application and low operating cost  the majority of current tsls are two-part polyurethane/polyuria or portland cement based latex products that are mixed on site before spraying onto surfaces  they are now being considered for highly stressed, deep, rock bursting conditions as a reinforcement and retaining element together with bolts and screen  in this study, the creep behavior of a cement-based tsl was investigated  for this purpose, 7-day cured dogbone tsl specimens were tested under 23±2°c laboratory conditions  a range of dead weights (80, 60, 40, and 20 % of the tensile strength) were applied until the rupture of the specimens  as a result of this study, the time-dependent strain behavior of a tsl was presented for different constant load conditions  moreover, a new equation was derived to estimate tensile failure time of the tsl for a given loading condition  if the tensile stress acting on the tsl is known, the effective permanent support time of the tsl can be estimated by the proposed relationship   1  introduction  the major aim of rock support systems is to establish a safe and stable working condition for excavations through the planned service life  since the 1990’s, in order to increase the safety during screening and bolting in the mines and to decrease the exposure to this process, thin spray-on liner (tsl) support which has been adapted from isolation industry has become the focus of the mining industry due to its considerable operational benefits, with the potential to reduce mining costs  there are various applications in mines all over the world | 
2017-0321 	 numerical modeling of coupled thmc processes for predicting fluid flow and transport behavior within fractured rocks |abstract: we improved our thermal-hydraulic-mechanical-chemical (thmc) simulator to predict the long-term permeability change of the fractured rocks  the model evaluates the influence of the geochemical reaction on the evolution of the permeability in fractured rocks by considering pressure solution in detail  pressure solution that occurs at both grain contacts and contacting asperities within fractures was incorporated in the model  by using the developed thmc numerical model, long-term prediction of rock permeability was conducted by replicating the subsurface environment near the radioactive waste repository  as a result of the analyses, the permeability decrease by two orders of magnitude smaller than the initial value occurs due to pressure solution at contacting asperities within fractures in the edz area  in carrying out radioactive waste disposal, it is apparent that pressure solution within the fractures has significant impact on minimizing the increase of the permeability in edz area   1  introduction  while considering performance of high level radioactive geological disposal system, it is necessary to examine hydraulic properties of rocks near high level radioactive geological disposal facility in detail  in near field that includes the surrounding rocks, phenomena such as heat radiation from waste body, movement of groundwater within fractures, stress redistribution, chemical reaction of rock minerals and pore water interact with each other complicatedly  in this environment, these phenomena are needed to evaluate comprehensively for examining the change of rock hydraulic properties  therefore, it is important to develop the numerical simulator that can describe the coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical (thmc) processes   mineral dissolution and precipitation due to geochemical reaction may have the influence on hydraulic property change of the rocks  it consists of free-face dissolution and precipitation at the pore spaces, and pressure dissolution at the grain contacts and the contacting asperities within rock fractures  especially, it is apparent that pressure solution has non-negligible influence for hydraulic properties of fractured rock [1]  existing thmc simulators may not consider pressure solution at the contacting asperities within fractured rocks in detail  in our previous study [2], a thmc simulator was developed and it considers pressure solution only at the grain contacts in the rock  therefore, in this study, we improved the thmc numerical simulator by newly considering pressure dissolution (ps) at both the grain contacts and the contacting asperities within rock fractures so as to predict hydraulic properties change of rock in detail | 
2017-0322 	 numerical research of creep behavior of shale gas reservoir rock and effects on hydraulic fracturing |abstract: the permeability of shale gas reservoir is very low  hydraulic fracturing is needed to form an effective production capacity  however, creep properties of shale gas reservoir rocks have effects on the development of shale gas, for instance, artificial fracture flow conductivity is very sensitive to the creep deformation of the crack  in this work, we make numerical model of the creep behavior of shale gas reservoir and the constitutive relation is based on creep experiments in triaxial deformation apparatus under room temperature and room humidity conditions  model result shows that after one year the creep deformation is around 9% of fracture width and it will enhance proppant embedment and fracture closure during production process  the capacity of fracture flow conductivity can strongly decrease based on the creep deformation of shale rock after a few decades  in conclusion, shale gas reservoir rock has creep deformation controlled by power-law function of the time  creep behavior leads to the fracture closure and decrease of fracture flow conductivity in the reservoir   1  introduction  creep is a phenomenon in which material deformation increases with time  it has an important effect on the long-term deformation, strength and seepage characteristics of materials  it widely plays important roles in mine, tunnel, nuclear waste storage and large-scale gas storage construction  the various types of rocks have different degrees of creep characteristics  normally creep deformation studies are mostly for high creep performance of soft rock such as mudstone and salt rock  zhou et al  (1985) and deng et al  (1993) established rock triaxial creep experimental devices in the laboratory and the creep experiment was carried out on mudstone and salt rock  the creep empirical mode and constitutive equation were established to analyze the stress on casing and wellbore stability   at present, shale gas has become one of china's important oil and gas replacement resources  shale gas reservoirs are generally more brittle rock and the permeability is very low  the key to the success of fracturing is the formation of large-scale, mutual communication and stability of the fracture network  sone and zoback (2010) found that the shale gas reservoir has a certain creep  the existence of the artificial fractured network of shale gas reservoirs and its extremely sensitive to weak deformation make the study of shale gas reservoir creep become important  the shale gas reservoir after fracturing has the characteristics of long exploitation time, artificial network development and small crack opening, which make the ability of fracture conductivity to be very sensitive to weak creep deformation  creep can cause cracks of shale gas reservoir to close and affect its flow conductivity  it has also an impact on gas well productivity and final recovery (sone and zoback, 2014; li and ghassemi, 2012; rassouli and zoback, 2015) | 
2017-0324 	 geomechanical responses induced by large-scale co2 injection in a multilayer saline aquifer in kuwait |abstract: large-scale co2 injection in saline aquifers will cause pressure build-up in brine far beyond the extent of co2 plume  in this paper, we evaluate the geomechanical responses of large-scale co2 storage in the multilayer aquifer of the kra al-maru trend in kuwait  the site was selected after screening the whole territory of kuwait, identifying and ranking of candidate sites for geological co2 storage  we simulated the co2 injection and geomechanical responses during 40 years of injection with an injection rate of 11 million tonnes/year  results of numerical simulations show that after 40 years of injection the extent of co2 plume is within the radial range of 4 km from the injectors, while the pressure build-up is felt up to 55 km  the largest pressure build-up of 2 3 mpa and the associated poro-elastic stress changes in the reservoir-seal pair are located within the radial range of about 5 km from the injectors  co2 injection can induce a maximum uplift at the ground surface of 11 cm  the present-day noncritical state of stress and the magnitudes of induced stress changes suggest a low risk for containment integrity  future studies will be required with a dedicated well to obtain core and perform detailed site characterization   1  introduction  this paper considers the geomechanical aspects associated with large-scale co2 injection and geological storage in the multilayer aquifer of the kra al-maru trend in kuwait  the potential multilayer aquifer co2 storage site was selected based on the results of a site selection study performed for the whole territory of kuwait  geomechanical characterization and assessment of the selected storage site were performed with existing data provided by the kuwait oil company (koc)  no additional experimental or site investigations were performed in this study   assessment of geomechanical response to large-scale co2 injection in saline aquifers is reported in the literature for different storage sites  large-scale impact of co2 storage is due to the large area of elevated pressures in the storage formation, which extends several tens to hundreds of kilometers from the injection zone  examples are for instance the potential co2 storage in the illinois basin (birkholzer and zhou, 2009), the shenhua ccs project in china (zhu et al , 2015) and the south west hub project in australia (zhang et al , 2015)  although the footprint of elevated pressures is large, the mechanical impact on overlying sealing formations can be low, posing a negligible threat to the integrity of containment (e g  the sleipner co2 injection project in norway; rutqvist, 2012) | 
2017-0325 	 numerical modeling of failure in poroelastic rocks sensitive to pressure drop rate |abstract: in very low-permeability rocks, hydraulic fractures can be prone to tensile rock failure caused by rapid pressure drop  this failure mechanism is sensitive to the rate of pressure drop rather than the rate of production and typically occurs when wells are initially set on production  wells put into production with a too-aggressive flowback schedule can produce a large amount of solids, with fragments sometimes in the order of centimeters  the associated formation damage can result in the complete collapse of well productivity  at the same time, nearby offset wells in the same formation, brought to production with gradual increase of drawdown, can avoid solids production and production decline  in this paper, we review a quick-look numerical model simulating tensile rock failure in the near-wellbore region sensitive to pressure drop rate  the study illustrates, that even in the absence of rock strength heterogeneity, there is a certain length scale of produced rock fragments dictated by the depth of maximum tensile stress from the rock face  this depth is sensitive to initial stress distribution, rock properties, and dynamics of pressure drop  the paper also presents the sensitivity study to provide a general ranking of how various parameters influence this failure mechanism   1  introduction  sanding and proppant flowback caused by high flow rates in hydraulic fractures during production are well-known issues  they can be addressed by installing sand screens and gravel packs and, eventually, by limiting production and keeping it below the critical flow rate limit that maintains proppant pack stability  recently, with the rise of multistage stimulation from horizontal wells, there is a growing number of developments in very low permeability rocks  in these rocks, hydraulic fractures can be prone to another mechanism of rock damage: tensile rock failure caused by rapid pressure drop  this failure mechanism is sensitive to the rate of pressure drop rather than the rate of production and typically occurs when wells are initially set on production  therefore, this type of failure, as well as the related damage to well productivity, is avoidable with proper pressure management practices, such as reducing production pressure at a reasonably low rate (suarez-rivera et al , 2011)  for example, field evidence from relatively soft and high-pore-pressure formations shows that, when some wells were put into production with an aggressive flowback schedule, the size of solids produced can be of the order of centimeters, and the associated formation damage can result in the complete collapse of well productivity  at the same time, nearby offset wells in the same formation and target depth, which were brought to production with gradual increase of drawdown, had no significant solids production and production decline (jacobs, 2015) | 
2017-0326 	 geomechanical response to n2 injection as a means of pressure maintenance in a sandstone reservoir |abstract: pressure maintenance by injection of nitrogen into a reservoir is one of the potential options to mitigate induced seismicity during gas production  it is expected that seismicity and the seismic hazard can be reduced by decreasing the stress changes and compaction associated with the declining pore pressure in the reservoir rocks  however, injection-related induced seismicity has been observed in many settings  hence, the question can be raised whether injection can have an adverse effect on the seismic hazard and can cause an unwanted increase in seismicity  we employed 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional finite element modelling to investigate four mechanisms that can lead to induced seismicity during nitrogen injection in a depleting gas reservoir: (1) pressure diffusion into faults, (2) stress path irreversibility, (3) thermal stresses and (4) differential pressure evolution and stress arching  we show that, depending on the particular setting, mechanisms 1 to 3 can lead to fault destabilization  using fault slip displacement and total fault slip length as indicative estimates for the induced seismicity potential of faults, it is concluded that these mechanisms can increase the seismicity potential of the faults during injection  mechanism 4 is shown to be of negligible importance in a typical setting   1  introduction  pressure maintenance by injection of nitrogen into a reservoir is considered as one of the potential options to mitigate induced seismicity during gas production  as seismicity in producing gas reservoirs is a consequence of stress changes caused by the decline in pore pressures and ongoing (differential) compaction of the reservoir rocks (bourne et al , 2015; van thienen-visser and breunese, 2015; van wees et al , 2014) it is expected that seismicity and the seismic hazard can be reduced by decreasing these stress changes and the compaction by maintaining the pore pressure in the reservoir rocks  in recent years, however, numerous field cases of injection-related induced seismicity have been published in literature (e g  elsworth et al , 2016; keranen et al , 2014; ellsworth, 2013)  this raises the question whether pressure maintenance by nitrogen injection can have an adverse effect on the seismic hazard and can cause an unwanted increase in seismicity  injection-induced seismicity has been observed during wastewater injection (e g  keranen et al , 2014), hydraulic stimulation of shale formations (e g  bao and eaton, 2016), enhanced oil recovery (e g  raleigh et al , 1976), underground gas storage (e g  kraaijpoel et al , 2012), underground co2 storage (kaven et al , 2014), enhanced geothermal systems (egs) (e g  kraft and deichmann, 2014), and conventional geothermal systems (e g  allis, 1982)  to date, published cases of induced seismicity related to nitrogen injection for reservoir pressure maintenance have not been described in literature  based on the physical mechanisms that are typically associated with the previously mentioned injection-related induced seismicity, four mechanisms were selected for further investigation with finite element (fe) models | 
2017-0327 	 three-dimensional modeling of geomechanical units using acoustic impedance in one of the gas fields in south of iran |abstract: geomechanical modeling of a reservoir has a very important role in all parts of a field lifecycle  in this paper, we demonstrate a new method for modeling the distribution of elastic properties in the whole reservoir using the concept of geomechanical units (gmus)  in this study, a gmu is a cluster of young’s, bulk and shear modulus, poisson’s ratio and unconfined uniaxial strength  to establish these gmus we used eight wells and the post-stack seismic data in the field of interest  dynamic elastic parameters were computed from logging data of mentioned wells  to convert these dynamic parameters to static values, empirical equations were determined in a neighboring field of salman, in the interval of kangan and dalan formations  in the next step, multi-resolution graph-based clustering was applied to these static elastic parameters to construct five distinct gmus  for three-dimensional modeling of gmus, the 3d acoustic impedance model of the field was made by genetic inversion and used as a secondary parameter of co-kriging  the amounts of elastic parameters of each gmu at the location of well number six in the final 3d model are found to be in good agreement with the known values of this well   1  introduction  geomechanics is a petroleum engineering sub-discipline developed to address the mechanical behavior of the reservoir and bounding rocks during exploration and production activities (zoback, 2010; aadnoy and looyeh, 2011)  in this regard, three-dimensional modeling of geomechanical parameters plays a significant role in whole life of a reservoir  these models are used for seismic modeling, interpretation, hydraulic fracture design, assessing borehole stability and stress calculations in geological studies  therefore, any improvement in one of these momentous applications could lead to better and more sufficient field development plans, at the same time save the considerable amount of money and operation time   this study employs an efficient approach to construct a 3d reservoir geomechanical model based on the concept of geomechanical units (gmus)  a gmu is a single unit for design and modeling purposes  a gmu can be selected from logs, cores, or judgment (dusseault, 2011)  the advantages of gmu use in engineering studies have been discussed by a number of authors including uwiera et al  (2011) and nygaard (2010)  in this work, a gmu is a set of rock mechanical properties, such as: young’s modulus, bulk modulus, shear modulus, poisson’s ratio, and uniaxial compressive strength  these elastic parameters are clustered by using different clustering methods to establish the best gmu  the purpose of using this method is to determine the distribution of elastic parameters in whole parts of the field of study  the kangan and dalan formations are the reservoir layers in the field of study  these formations are consisted of carbonate and dolomite (figure 1) | 
2017-0328 	 modelling the effect additives on exothermic heat development of well cement |abstract: the external and internal alterations may affect the wellbore cement stability throughout the setting period  these alterations generate micro/macro fractures in the cement matrix  such situation, known as sustained casing pressure (scp), may result in creating pathways for any undesired formation fluid flow through surface and/or other formation(s) behind the casing annulus  the cement exothermic heat development is one of the probable internal alteration to cause scp evolution   this study is an experimental work carried out to investigate the effect of additives on exothermic heat generation  the effect of commonly used cement additives such as friction reducer and fluid loss controller on cement’s exothermic setting reaction had been studied  the thermal alteration of the cement slurries had been witnessed for a period of 24 hours  the results pointed out that the additives noticeably elevated the heat generated during setting period   furthermore, the results were modelled using statistical approach to pioneer the future work for field applications where the cement stability problems related to temperature generation experienced  the obtained results might create an awareness on the prominence of consideration the effect of heat while designing the different compositions of well cement slurries   introduction  the main duty of the cementing operations in oil and gas wells is to provide zonal isolation to and from the wellbore during the lifetime of the wells  moreover, its mechanical strength improves the geo-mechanical stability of the wellbore and its low permeability provides shield for casings against corrosive formation fluids  oil, gas and geothermal wells require wellbore cements to perform zonal isolation for decades (nelson and guillot, 2006)   the zonal isolation delivered by wellbore cements intends to prevent fluid intrusion into wellbores  sustained casing pressure (scp), defined as the pressure accumulation behind casing, caused by trapped fluids in the casing-cement annulus  in more than 22,000 oil and gas wells at gulf of mexico, 11,000 casing strings experiencing scp have been reported  hereof, the american petroleum institute (api) reported that in the gulf of mexico, 56% of the loss of well control are associated with cementing operations and scp, directly caused by inadequate zonal isolation  such situation origins major technical and economic problems during plugging and abandonment (p&a) process as well as long-term integrity and protection of abandoned wellbores (2nd well bore integrity network meeting report, 2006) | 
2017-0329 	 dynamic propagation of three dimensional non-planar fractures based on the high-order generalized fem |abstract: this paper presents a three-dimensional non-planar model to analysis the propagation of hydraulic fracture from highly deviated wells  this model is based on high-order generalized finite element method (high-order gfem), which has applied the partition of unity for discontinuity modelling  this method is designed to inherit the advantages of both gfem and meshfree method, and it is able to increase the order of approximation which will avoid the area of constant zero-stress  two verification examples are investigated and are compared to the observations achieved in existing experiments  in order to study the fracture initiation and propagation mechanism of deviated wells and investigate the effect of well deviations, well azimuths and perforation angles on fracture propagation, the first numerical test has modelled the propagation of fractures from a deviated well with oriented perforation  in the second example the present method is utilized to simulate simultaneous fracturing from three perforating clusters in a horizontal well  numerical results of these two tests agree well with the existing experimental results and numerical results   1  introduction  in recent years, as the oil exploration and exploitation gradually turn to deep and ultra-deep layers, the porosity and permeability decrease while the in-situ stress and rock strength increase  deviated wells, coupled with the reservoir stimulation technology have become the main way of the exploitation of this type of oil and gas resources  plane fractures are usually generated after hydraulic fracturing in vertical wells, while for deviated wells, fractures are more complex  in general, the direction of deviated wellbore is not consistent with the maximum principal stress direction and also unconformity with the orientation of the fracture, so it is easy to form multiple fractures around the wellbore (yew and li, 1987, yew et al , 1989, hossain et al , 1999, hossain et al , 2000)  thus, predicting the geometry of 3d (three-dimensional) fractures of deviated wells has always be a difficult problem in the field of hydraulic fracturing | 
2017-0330 	 theoretical and practical basics of oriented hydraulic re-fracturing |abstract: western ural (russia) oil fields have been developed since 1960s  hydraulic fracturing is the main method of increasing well productivity in the past 15 years  currently re-fracture treatments are being used to sustain the level of oil production  the analysis of the performed treatments shows that re-fracturing is not as effective as the initial fracturing  the technology of oriented re-fracturing is being developed to increase the effectiveness of re-fracturing treatment  creation of the hydraulic fracture which is pre-oriented has a number of advantages: a possibility of accessing poorly drained parts of the formation, decreasing the risk of water breakthrough etc  the main idea is to create a system of lateral horizontal boreholes situated in a vertical plane and oriented in the desired direction  the number of lateral boreholes and the space between them is determined based on geomechanical calculations  one industrial experiment was performed on the well to this date  the results are found to be optimistic   1  introduction  many oil and gas reservoirs need to be hydraulically fractured for the economic development  re-fracturing is a quite efficient way to control production decline after the first fracturing treatments  as discussed by he liu et al , 2008, conventional techniques used for refracture treatments can lead to the following results:  refracture treatment tends to open an old fracture and only to regain the conductivity|fracture tends to be larger than the original fracturing treatment  as a result, it tends to increase water production in highly water flooded reservoirs|the treatment leads to reorientation of the fracture and it may contact undepleted reservoir areas  re-fracturing is not effective in the first and second cases, or it can have a negative effect such as water intrusion  the technology of oriented hydraulic refracturing aimed at the increase of re-fracturing efficiency in the western ural oil fields is being developed  creation of the hydraulic fracture which is pre-oriented allows to increase the treatment efficiency and to decrease the risk of negative consequences  the main idea of oriented hydraulic fracturing in a vertical well is to create a system of lateral horizontal boreholes situated in a vertical plane and oriented in a desired direction  the number of lateral boreholes and the space between them is determined on the base of geomechanical calculations  in order to realize this technology, the following studies are carried out: determination of the in-situ stress state; study of physical and mechanical properties of rocks; development of theoretical and practical basics of oriented hydraulic fracturing | 
2017-0331 	 interaction of drilled shafts with rock masses under the action of vertical compressive load |abstract: in the article the interaction of drilled shafts with rock mass, folded by rocks of low to medium strength, is analyzed  the analysis is based on the results of numerical three-dimensional simulation of the behavior of drilled shafts under the action of vertical compressive load  the results of the research allow to obtain the factor dependencies (regression equation) for calculating of bearing capacity and settlements of shafts  as independent variable factors in the equations were adopted: the ratio of the modulus of elasticity of the shaft to the modulus of deformation of intact rock, the ratio of the length of the drilled shaft to its diameter and rqd of the rock mass  the effect of the shaft - rock mass interface characteristics on the settlements of shafts were studied separately  results of numerical simulation studies were compared with the results of in-situ tests of shafts   1  introduction  socketed shafts are usually designed and constructed as foundations of high-rise buildings and bridge structures, when layers of loose soil overlie bedrock  the behavior of socketed shaft both in rock and in soil has a lot in common  however, the structure of a rock mass and their highly variable mechanical characteristics considerably complicate the calculation of bearing capacity and settlement of socketed shafts   in soils, the load corresponding to the bearing capacity of shaft (qp), is calculated by simple summation of the shear resistance force along its side surface and the resistance force of the base of the shaft (qs and qb)  in the case of rocks, different researches show that this approach is possible only, if the failure of the sidewall interface (shaft – rock) is plastic and a load (qb), transmitted to the base of the shaft, can be determined (nchrp synthesis 360)   especially it should be emphasized the influence of the sidewall interface on the interaction of the shaft with surface of the rock  variability in the properties of the interface and the character of its failure can have a considerable impact on the bearing capacity and the settlement of the shaft | 
2017-0332 	 scaling issues in hollow cylinder tests on shale |abstract: hollow cylinder tests are intended to simulate borehole failure, under controllable and downscaled conditions  upscaling from laboratory conditions to field conditions is not trivial, however  the finite size of the hollow cylinder and the downscaled hole diameter have impacts on the stress level and the borehole strength that have to be accounted for  furthermore, the downscaled hole size also requires scaling of the loading rates in order to properly match pore pressure distribution and stress distribution  it is not possible for a hollow cylinder test to fully reproduce field conditions with respect to stress path, and in most cases not the stress geometry either  an additional complication is that borehole failure is not unambiguously defined in the field nor even in the laboratory test  these complications imply that upscaling of results from the hc test requires a relevant theoretical model, or at least careful design of the test  nevertheless, the test is valuable for calibration of borehole stability models under specific conditions   1  introduction  hollow cylinder (hc) tests are often used for studies related to borehole stability problems  the hollow cylinders are considered to represent the rock around a borehole, and the hc tests are expected to reproduce the processes involved when a borehole fails   the benefit of using a hollow cylinder test as compared to uniaxial or triaxial tests combined with modelling, which is usually the alternative, is that the stress distribution around the hole of a hollow cylinder is similar to that around a borehole  this stress distribution implies a coupling between deformation and stress, unlike the situation in uniaxial/triaxial tests, and plasticity effects are therefore implicitly accounted for in the hollow cylinder test   in other respects, the resemblance between an hc test and real downhole conditions is limited  the hole size is down-scaled in an hc test, and the rock volume involved is much smaller  stress geometry, magnitude of stress and pore pressure, and temperature may be different from in situ conditions, as well as loading rate and stress history  it is therefore a number of parameters that have to be considered in order to establish a quantitative link between lab and field conditions for hc tests |

2017-0338 	 mesostructure change in land facies karamay oil sand reservoirs under water injection |abstract: understanding the mesostructure of oil sand is significantly important in the exploration of karamay oil sand since the effective permeability of water is largely dependent on pore structure  the objective of this study was to quantify and understand the meco-scale structure change on the karamay oil sand samples subjected to shear dilation  three popular laboratory methods in investigation of microstructure: mercury intrusion porosimetry (mip), computer topography (ct) and scanning electron microscope (sem), were conducted in order to disclose the change in pore structure of oil sand cores before and after mechanics experiments  the ct image shows the existing of oil sand shear bands  sem reveals that a large number of micro-cracks are generated in the samples, and the smaller confining pressure during shear applied, the more obvious the shear band becomes  the result derived from mip shows different pore size distribution after shear-- the proportion of micropores decreases, and total porosity increases  meanwhile, acquisition method of several mesostructural parameters obtained by three techniques are put forward  finally, based on the meso-scale structure change in oil sand specimen after triaxial shear test, the oil sand reservoirs performance under water injection is interpreted and evaluated   1  introduction  water injection applied to shorten preheating time of sagd, achieved great success in alberta, canada and xinjiang, china, is an efficient method in ultra-heavy oil recovery  it was discovered that a dilated zone in the neighboring region of the sagd well pair could be created under water injection (collin, 2002; yuan, 2011a)  several research works and technical discussions (dusseault, 1977; samieh, 1995; li, 2005; yuan 2011b; lin, 2015) concerned on dilation mechanism have revealed that the effect of water injection largely dependent on the extent of shear-induced dilation of oil sand under given stress state  in fact, shear dilation is the macro performance of internal oil sand particles extrusion and sliding due to external forces (wong, 1999)  therefore, the effect of shear-induced dilation can be partly evaluated by the mesostructure change of the oil sand before and after triaxial compression tests |

2017-0343 	 modeling geologic and ucs variability through covariogram analysis of rock core images |abstract: rock, unlike most engineered materials, possesses a large degree of inherent variability in physical characteristics  this creates a number of unique challenges when creating engineering works involving rock  when characterizing a rock, engineers must collect sufficient data so that the epistemic uncertainty is small relative to the aleatory variability  the aleatory variability is an inherent characteristic of rockmasses, and refers to the natural variation within the rock, which occurs in even the most homogeneous rocks with uniform size, shape, and orientation of grains  thus, while epistemic uncertainty, which relates to a lack of knowledge can be minimized, variability in the uniaxial compressive strength values contributes to the overall engineering property variability of the material, and needs to be understood in order to characterize a rock  to quantify the extent of spatial correlation, covariograms and semivariograms from core specimen images are calculated from a 2d covariogram and semivariogram image, and the quantitative metrics of spatial heterogeneity can be used to represent aleatory variability  this then can be applied to multiple rocks to qualify and quantify their relative geomechanical variability   1  introduction  rock displays an inherent degree of variability, even within the same lithological unit  this variability is often apparent in the mechanical properties of rocks, including their uniaxial compressive strength (ucs) values  this is problematic when attempting to determine how many specimens to test to adequately characterize the geomechanical properties of the rock  isrm guidelines suggest testing enough specimens to “adequately represent the rock sample”, and indicate that the appropriate number “should be a function of the intrinsic variability of the rock”, but these guidelines are vague (ulusay, 2014)  consider the rocks shown in table 1  the rocks range from highly isotropic and consistent between representative specimens, such as the indiana limestone and the stanstead granite, to anisotropic, very heterogeneous, and having significant spatial variability between specimens, such as metabasalt and metagranodiorite  notice how these less homogeneous rock types have a significantly higher variability in their ucs values than their more isotropic counterparts  this work will investigate the variability of the spatial texture of the five rocks in table 1, and relate this to the variability of their strength values | 
2017-0345 	 pore-pressure prediction beneath salt sheets |abstract: we use a transient, large-strain, forward geomechanical model to predict pore pressure evolution below an advancing salt sheet  we find that salt-sheet emplacement results in significant overpressures subsalt and a narrow drilling window  we show that these overpressures cause the effective stresses and hence the sediment strength to remain low beneath salt  as a result, mudrocks are failing during salt emplacement  we discuss that traditional, porosity-based workflows underpredict pressure beneath salt because they assume uniaxial conditions and do not account for shear-induced pore pressures  however, we show that shear (differential) stresses subsalt are high, and their contribution to overpressure significant  we model salt as solid viscoplastic and sediments as poro-elastoplastic materials, with consolidation properties that are based on experimental testing on mudrocks typical of the gulf of mexico  overall, our transient evolutionary analysis incorporates the geologic loading history, accounts for shear-induced pore pressures and provides the complete stress tensor as well as pore pressure prediction over time   1  introduction  prediction of pore pressure prior to drilling is crucial for the planning of safe and economic well trajectories, borehole stability and design of casing plans (dodson 2004; dutta 2002; zhang 2013)  it is also a key input in the exploration stage to determine the integrity of reservoir seals and regional hydrocarbon migration behavior  pressure prediction has become particularly important in complex geologic settings: for example, a significant percentage of deepwater well costs near salt are attributed to abnormal pore pressures (harrison et al  2004; york et al  2009)  it is generally recognized that elevated pore pressure results from loading  in sedimentary basins, the most common form of loading results from sedimentation  a well understood conceptual formulation is that sediments undergoing burial by sedimentation deform uniaxially  under such conditions, volume changes are directly related to the vertical strain  the horizontal effective stress changes as a function of the vertical, thus stress and volume changes can be described by a unique porosity vs  vertical effective stress curve (e g , bowers (1995))  when sediment compressibility is high and permeability is low (overall coefficient of consolidation is low), rapid deposition of sediments may result in fluid being trapped in the sediment pores; this increases the pore fluid pressure and prevents normal compression of sediments (bowers 1995; osbourne et al  1997)  traditional pressure prediction workflows use the measured porosity to estimate the vertical effective stress from the porosity vs  vertical effective stress curve; then, they calculate pore pressure as the difference between overburden and vertical effective stress | 
2017-0347 	 geomechanics-based stochastic analysis of microseismicity for analysis of fractured reservoir stimulation with application to newberry egs |abstract: natural fractures are the primary pathways for fluid migration and production in unconventional geothermal and petroleum reservoirs  in geothermal reservoirs, reactivation (and possible propagation) of natural fractures is an important component of stimulation  slip on these fractures induced microearthquakes (meqs) and the locations of meq events reveal aspects of stimulation  in this paper, we discuss a technique for extracting information about fractures orientations from meqs  this is achieved by combining geomechanics and geostatistics to better constrain uncertainties in natural fracture properties  we develop a new geomechanics-based stochastic analysis of microseismicity (gbsam) to provide quantitative estimate of fractures orientations  in this work, the rock response to pore pressure is modeled using a line injection source to simulate water injection into a natural fracture network  mahalanobis distance is then used to quantify the similarity between the distribution of meqs (gmeqs) from the forward model and field-observed distribution of meqs (tmeqs) to find the best gmeqs that fits the tmeqs  as an example, the gbsam is applied to a data set of 344 meqs recorded during phase 2 2 of newberry volcano egs demonstration project, located 37 km south of bend, oregon  borehole televiewer (bhtv) was used successfully to map the geometry of 351 fractures in the wellbore  results from gbsam show that the dip and dip direction of those fractures have good agreement with the field results from bhtv  this proposed method is a simple but effective way for interpreting meqs for better characterizing reservoir stimulation   1  introduction  the geometry of fractures has a significant impact on the fluid flowing, thermal transport capabilities and mechanical stability of a rock mass  fractures orientations, spacing, connectivity are important features that control network permeability  despite their essential role in reservoir development, there still are uncertainties regarding direct and indirect diagnostic technologies for characterizing fractures orientations in in-situ environments is not well developed  in the last several decades, many methods have been used to constrain the uncertainty in measuring the fractures orientations  borehole logging and camera and outcrop mapping are commonly suffered from lower dimensional limited exposures (einstein and baecher 1983, williams and johnson 2004, li, feng et al  2013)  furthermore, the description of fracture geometries obtained from local field surveys has to upscale from the local scale to the entire reservoir which can cause loss of geometric characteristics of the fractures  the question of how to establish a reliable fracture pattern remain an unresolved issue in subsurface community  thus, fracture pattern in numerical analysis are commonly treated in a stochastic framework (leung and zimmerman 2012, berrone, pieraccini et al  2015, farmahini-farahani and ghassemi 2015, ghassemi and tao 2016) | 
2017-0348 	 long-term creep prediction with a modified power law model |abstract: creep in weak rock is a common phenomenon observed in the laboratory  based on short-term creep, prediction of long-term creep can be a challenge especially at elevated stress levels, since only a small stress increase may change the creep behavior from stable to an unstable  the original power law model introduced by sone and zoback (2014) was applied to predict long-term creep based on short-term data fitting on data from a set of tests on castlegate sandstone  the observation indicates that this model cannot predict long-term creep at high stress levels  the power law model was therefore modified by introducing a feedback mechanism based on the fiber bundle model (hansen et al , 2015)  this modified power law model is able to predict long-term creep also at moderate and higher stress levels  in fact, all three stages of creep can be captured by this modified model  constitutive parameter analysis shows that it is feasible to determine reasonable constitutive parameters through short-term data fitting   1  introduction  time-dependent deformation is a common phenomenon that may cause problems such as stuck pipe while drilling  on the other hand, it may be beneficial in operations such as plug and abandonment with shale as a permanent annular barrier (williams et al , 2009)  being able to predict long-term creep based on short-term creep data is a wanted ability that may, for instance, help field engineers to evaluate the severity of borehole closure, or help to avoid unnecessary time consumption in laboratory tests  this is, however, a very challenging task   theoretically, a fully developed creep process contains three stages (see for instance fj<u+00e6>r et al , 2008)  they are transient, steady state and accelerating creep  with low and moderate stress level, most rock mechanical tests experience the transient creep first  steady state creep is defined as increasing deformation with constant strain rate, and will eventually lead to failure  most observations of creep in laboratory tests show increasing deformation with deaccelerating strain rate (rutter, 1972, gasc-barbier et al , 2004, rassouli and zoback, 2016)  the experiments mentioned in these references are triaxial tests with constant confining pressure  we assume the stress levels applied in these tests are low and moderate so no accelerating creep is triggered | 
2017-0350 	 numerical simulation of fracture propagation in layered rock |abstract: we have developed a numerical simulation methodology where different materials can be analyzed in the same framework  at the interface between different phases, the necessary velocity and stress continuity conditions are maintained, allowing interaction between particles from different materials when solving the momentum equation  the sph approximation to the continuity equation is corrected in order to handle the density discontinuity at the interface between different materials  for the different types of layered rock, each rock type is presently assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic, with perfect bonding at the interface  failure of the rock or de-bonding of the layers occurs due to elasto-plastic damage model which includes the drucker-prager plasticity model and the grady-kipp damage model  we begin with a description of the theory governing this sph framework  following this, validation results are presented for the simulation of layered materials  results using this sph framework are compared to an analytical solution for geostatic stress, where good agreement is observed  following this, the three point bending of a layered material as reported by lee et al  (2015) is simulated  simulation of the three-point bending experiment shows that inclined layers in the path of a propagating tensile fracture may have a significant influence in the ultimate fracture propagation direction   1  introduction  prediction of hydraulic fracture propagation in a layered reservoir with natural discontinuities remains a big challenge to unconventional reservoir developments  the interaction of a hydraulic fracture and natural discontinuities can alter the fracture path and lead to a complex fracture network which has significance consequences on the design of fracturing treatments and productivity  it is believed that the complexity of the resulting fracture network primarily depends on in-situ stresses, mechanical properties of the host rock, natural discontinuities, including layering and interfaces, and fluid properties and injection rate  experimental observations show that in heterogeneous and anisotropic rock, hydraulic fractures may be become arrested, divert into or cross at contacts (or other discontinuities) between layers | 
2017-0352 	 modeling near-wellbore hydraulic fracture complexity using coupled pore pressure extended finite element method |abstract: understanding near-wellbore hydraulic fracture complexity is important for the design of hydraulic fracturing  this paper presents a fully coupled fluid flow and geomechanics model for predicting complex fracture propagation paths in the wellbore vicinity  the model is developed based on the coupled pore pressure extended finite-element method (xfem)  fracture propagation, fracturing fluid flow, rock deformation, and pore fluid flow are coupled to model fracture behavior in the near-wellbore region  the influence of perforation angle and perforation length on near-wellbore fracture growth are investigated  results show that a fracture initiated from a perforation misaligned with the direction perpendicular to the minimum field stress will finally reorient itself to that direction  but the fracture curvature resulting from fracture reorientation is highly related to the size and angle of the perforation  the results also demonstrate high dependence of fracture breakdown pressure on perforation size and location  the xfem model proposed in this paper provides a unique tool to predict hydraulic fracture trajectory in the near-wellbore region  it can be used to aid design of various hydraulic fracturing related operations in the petroleum industry, such as fracturing stimulations, field injectivity tests, waterfloods, and produced water/cuttings re-injections   1  introduction  understanding the evolution of hydraulic fractures in the near-wellbore region is important for hydraulic fracturing design and injectivity test interpretation  the primary goal of hydraulic fracturing treatments is to provide a pathway, ideally with less tortuosity and high conductivity, to facilitate flow of hydrocarbons from the reservoir to the wellbore  the main objective of field injectivity tests, e g  mini-frac tests and diagnostic fracture injection tests, is to quantify some key reservoir parameters such as fracture closure pressure, permeability, and pore pressure  however, near-wellbore fracture complexity may have adverse impacts on the effectiveness of hydraulic fracturing treatments and lead to difficulties in field test interpretations (feng and gray, 2017; sepehri et al , 2015) | 
2017-0353 	 numerical study of thermo-mechanical effects on the viscous damage behavior of rock salt caverns |abstract: underground cavities in rock salt have received increased attention for the storage of oil, gas, and compressed air energy  in this study, the transition between secondary and tertiary creep in salt is determined by a micro-macro model: the initiation of grain breakage is correlated with the acceleration of viscoplastic deformation rate and with the initiation of damage at the macroscopic scale  salt stiffness decreases when macroscopic damage increases, which allows predicting the evolution of the damage zone around salt caverns used for geological storage  after implementing the phenomenological model into the finite element method (fem) program porofis, two thermo-mechanical coupled stress paths are simulated to analyze stress concentrations and viscous damage around a 650-m-deep cavern in axisymmetric conditions  numerical results indicate that, despite the pressurization or depressurization-induced temperature variation, internal gas temperature always tends to approach the primary surrounding rock mass value  the viscous deformation induced by thermo-mechanical couplings significantly affects the original stress field at the cavern wall and induces high damage at the most concave sections of the cavern  results reveal the significant influences of idle time, gas pressure range, and injection and withdrawal cycles on stress, strain and temperature distributions in the vicinity of the cavern  more analyses are needed to confirm the influence of thermo-mechanical cycles of pressurization and depressurization, and to design long-term cavern operations   1  introduction  salt rock is a favorable hosting material for geological storage, including the storage of hydrogen, oil and gas, as well as compressed air energy storage (caes)  the design and performance assessment of such facilities require a fundamental understanding of the complex time-dependent behavior of salt, which depends on both salt properties and environmental factors (carter and hansen, 1983)  increasing deviatoric stress or decreasing confining pressure induces increasing steady-state strain rate in salt (yang et al , 1999)  the presence of brine at grain boundaries considerably influences the halite rheology and deformation (urai et al , 1986)  temperature is also a crucial component for rock deformation around nuclear waste disposals (senseny et al , 1992; zheng et al , 2016) and caes (leuger et al , 2012) | 
2017-0354 	 numerical simulation of micro-annuli generation by thermal cycling |abstract: during the life span of a well, the cement sheath may fail to provide zonal isolation and micro-annuli may develop between the cement-casing and cement-rock interfaces  multiple factors during well construction and injection processes may have individual or combined influence on the micro-annuli formation  this paper presents a staged finite element modeling approach to simulate the well construction processes and injection cycle  loads from the in-situ stress field, mud/slurry pressure, and periodic temperature changes are incorporated in the model  a “realistic” bottom-hole state of stress is generated in the model and microannuli generation is simulated by the tensile debonding of the cement-formation interface  the simulation results indicate the generation of micro-annuli is highly affected by the temperature difference between injection fluid and formation and the time span of the fluid injection cycle  resulting debonding apertures in the models are in the order of 10<u+2212>5m which corresponds with previous studies  the modeling results of this study indictates once debonding occurs, the debonding aperture increases quickly and may exceed the ranges considered hazardeous   1  introduction  gas migration (gm) or wellbore leakage is a significant problem that the oil and gas industry has encountered for decades in old well abandonment (calvert and smith, 1994), gas well production (feng et al  2016), and geologic co2 sequestration (nygaard et al  2014)  the leakage occurs as a result of wellbore integrity loss during drilling and injection processes during which the wellbore cement sheath may fail to isolate different zones  wellbore failure and associated leakage pathways are shown in fig  1 (celia et al  2005)  except for cement cracking under extreme conditions, the development of micro-annuli is the main reason for gas migration in most scenarios   micro-annuli are defined as systematic and inter-connecting sets of fractures/tiny gaps between the cement-casing and the cement-rock interfaces, which provide possible pathways for gas migrating (wang and taleghani, 2014) | 
2017-0355 	 the impact of viscoelastic caprock on fault reactivation and fault rupture in producing gas fields |abstract: in the netherlands gas is produced from over 150 onshore gas fields  in several fields induced seismicity has been recorded during production  these seismic events are interpreted as induced by pore pressure changes in the reservoir rocks, resulting in stress changes on faults within and in close vicinity of the gas fields  understanding the underlying processes of production-induced seismicity is crucial for the assessment and mitigation of seismic hazards during ongoing production in the onshore gas fields  in this study, we use a numerical geomechanical model in flac3d to analyze the relation between changes in reservoir pore pressures and fault stress changes  we address the effects of fault strength, reservoir and fault geometry and the presence of a viscoelastic caprock on the timing of fault reactivation, the nucleation of seismic events and the main characteristics of the fault rupture process  results of our models show that the presence of viscoelastic caprock can strongly influence the timing and extent of fault reactivation and rupture  faults with offset are generally reactivated at an early stage of reservoir depletion and involve relatively small slip displacements, stress drops and rupture lengths  the presence of a viscoelastic caprock even further promotes fault slip and nucleation of a seismic events at an early stage of depletion  faults without offset are reactivated during later stages of depletion and involve larger slip displacements, stress drops and more extensive slip lengths than in case of early reactivation   1  introduction  in the netherlands gas is produced from over 150 onshore gas fields  in several of these onshore fields seismicity during production has been recorded by the regional seismic monitoring network installed by the dutch seismological survey  figure 1 shows the location of the onshore gas fields in the northern part of the netherlands and related seismic activity  to date, no seismicity has been recorded in the gas fields in the southern part of the netherlands  magnitudes of seismic events are generally below ml 3 0, though in a limited number of fields magnitudes up to and above ml 3 0 have been recorded  largest magnitudes recorded to date are mw 3 6 in the groningen field, ml 3 5 in the bergermeer field and ml 3 4 in the roswinkel field | 
2017-0356 	 poroelastic effects of pore pressure-stress coupling on fault reactivation risks during gas injection |abstract: increasing formation pressure during fluid or gas injection might cause reactivation or instability of existing faults  effective in-situ stresses evolve with changes in pore pressure which is called coupling effect  understanding this effect is important during hydrocarbon field development to assess the fault reactivation risks during reservoir depletion and injection processes  utilizing the poroelasticity theory and applying analytical solution of biot’s diffusion equation is helpful when investigating the coupling effects on various states of in-situ stresses and formation pore pressures  this paper focuses on the horizontal stress and pore pressure coupling effects on a fault stability study during cushion gas injection in a gas storage field in the netherlands  to do so, initial field stresses were estimated using field data  thereafter the poroelasticity theory and diffusion equation were implemented to estimate the injection-induced stresses at different time-steps caused by pore pressure changes  in this paper, the sensitivity analysis was performed to explore the influences of injection time and fault distance on the induced instabilities  the results of this study showed relatively good agreements of injection-induced stresses obtained from the analytical method with corresponding values from complex finite element simulations  moreover, the results indicated that the injection point could be located closer to the central fault   1  introduction  pore pressure and temperature variation in a reservoir and its vicinity occur during gas injection or withdrawal which could cause sudden slip on the pre-existing faults  coupling between pore pressure and stress is one of the factors causing deformation and changes in the total stress field in the reservoir and its surroundings  changing pore pressure directly influences the effective stresses as coupling effects mainly depend on the elastic and diffusion properties of the formation rocks as well as on geometrical characteristics such as positions and/or distances from wells  rock properties can be simplified via elastic or constant permeability assumptions based on rock structure or compositions (josh et al , 2012)  however, coupling effects are still tedious to study due to the complexities existing in operational regimes and geometrical configurations  however, they are essential for geo-mechanical predictions related to caprock integrity, well bore stability, subsidence, fault reactivation and micro seismicity hazards (ruistuen, teufel, & rhett, 1999)  terzaghi (1943) described the coupling effects via poroelastic theory for the first time; he noted that total stress is equal to effective stress plus pore pressure; and this theory has been the basic concept of rock engineering for many years |

2017-0362 	 characterization of acoustic emissions from laboratory stick-slip events in simulated fault gouge |abstract: it is now widely recognized that earthquake faults exhibit a variety of slip behaviors ranging from near instantaneous and devastating rupture to slow slip events that last weeks to months  simulating these events in the laboratory, in the form of stick-slip shear experiments, provides an opportunity to probe fault slip in a well-controlled environment usually unavailable in nature  we report on a suite of laboratory earthquakes, consisting of stick-slip cycles that are probed using a dense array of p-polarized piezoelectric transducers (pzt) to detect acoustic emissions (ae)  the stick-slip experiments are performed on layers of glass beads, used as simulated fault gouge and which exhibit reproducible, earthquake-like dynamic rupture and frictional instability  the experiments were performed in a servo controlled biaxial testing apparatus in a double direct shear configuration  the aes are treated as laboratory earthquake proxies and analyzed to gather information about their frequency, magnitude, energy content and location  we monitor these source characteristics and report on their behavior during periodic and aperiodic stick-slips cycles  we also report on ae during stable, aseismic shearing  we find that grain scale roughness could explain the presence of periodicity in unstable sliding behavior through observations of ae nucleation frequency, spectral content and ae energy   1  introduction  tectonic faults exhibit a wide variety of failure modes, ranging from dynamic earthquake rupture to slow earthquakes and aseismic fault slip  the mode of failure is dictated by frictional properties of the faults, sliding rate, elastic coupling with the surrounding wall rock, and length of event occurrence in time (e g , scholz, 2002; peng and gomberg, 2010)  many studies have sought to understand and describe the underlying physical processes that produce these different failure modes and classes of earthquakes (e g , obara, 2002; ide et al , 2007; leeman et al , 2016)  precursory signatures of fault failure and earthquake slip have also been the subject of much interest  laboratory and field examples of such signals include electromagnetic emissions, gas emissions, groundwater level changes, temperature changes, surface deformation, and changes in elastic wave speed (hayakawa et al , 2000; hartmann and levy, 2005; niu et al , 2008; cicerone et al , 2009; scuderi et al , 2016) |

2017-0368 	 rock slope reconstruction at the neelum jhelum hydroelectric project, kashmir, pakistan |abstract: a rock slide occurred during excavation of the steep stilling basin rock slopes for the neelum jhelum hydroelectric project, disrupting construction progress  post-slide geologic evaluations of the sliding mode facilitated redesign of the slope excavation and temporary support  to expedite construction, the detailed redesign was performed in parallel with reconstruction efforts  the observational approach was carried out by a dedicated field engineering team to rapidly collect new geologic information, perform slope stability analyses, and implement field decisions to meet the excavation design intent  recommendations by the engineer enabled the contractor to improve blasting designs, reduce blast damage, and improve the quality of rock support systems  with careful surveillance and instrumentation monitoring the revised excavations were completed without further incident   1  introduction  the neelum jhelum hydroelectric project (njhep) is located in muzaffarabad district of azad jammu and kashmir in northeastern pakistan and is being developed by the water and power development authority (wapda) of pakistan  when completed, the njhep will generate 968 mw of electricity   the project utilizes a gross hydraulic head of approximately 430 m by diverting water from the neelum river to the lower branch of the jhelum river via a diversion dam, a 32-km-long headrace tunnel, and an underground powerhouse   the project comprises the following three construction lots (fig  1):  lot c1 includes the diversion dam, appurtenant headwork structures, and the initial segment of the headrace tunnels |lot c2 is the main site for headrace tunnel construction |lot c3 includes the powerhouse complex, surge shaft, penstocks, and the tailrace tunnel   the lot c1 headworks (fig  2) include a composite diversion dam consisting of a 60-m-high rockfill dam at the right abutment, a central concrete gravity dam with a spillway and a debris channel, and an intake structure forming the left abutment  the dam channels the water through the intake into a 300-m-long by 76-m-wide and 33-m-high sedimentation basin, then to a collecting canal, and from there into the headrace tunnel | 
2017-0370 	 evaluation of bumps-prone potential regarding the spatial characteristics of cleat in coal pillars under highly stressed ground conditions |abstract: coal pillar bumps involve the sudden expulsion of coal and rock into the mine opening  cleating is a type of joint system unique to coal seams  cleat systems differ from adjacent joint systems in that they are pervasive throughout the coal seam, and are much more tightly spaced than joints that occur in other rock types  this study assumes that if elastic energy remains in the rock mass to a greater extent than plastic energy, the risk of pillar bursting would be increased proportionally to the energy ratio  in order to investigate and quantify the risk posed by this possible imbalance, a 3d finite difference code (the flac3d model) is used so that the elastic strain energy and dissipated plastic energy could be tracked for given zones in the model  various orientations of cleat and applied stresses in the pillar are considered as input data and to determine the boundary conditions for the analysis  the results show the ratio of stored elastic energy to dissipated plastic energy   1  introduction  the type of catastrophic failure in coal mines known as dynamic failure—also colloquially referred to as bumps, bounces, bursts and others—is one of the most challenging and persistent engineering problems associated with coal mining in highly stressed conditions  coal pillar bursts involve the sudden expulsion of coal and rock into the mine opening  these events occur when stresses in a coal pillar, left for support in underground workings, exceed the pillar’s critical capacity, causing the pillar to rupture without warning  these events can be exceptionally violent, ejecting coal and rock with explosive force   as shown in fig  1, the decrease in the number and trend of fatalities in the mining industry from the early 20th century to the first decade of the 21st century, the u s  coal industry has achieved significant improvement in the health and safety of underground coal miners  the number of coal mining fatalities has decreased from a high of several thousand annually to the recent lows which average below fifty per year | 
2017-0371 	 application of energetic stimulation at high temperature and pressure for deep geothermal reservoirs |abstract: dynamic loading methods have been demonstrated to create radial and branching fractures in “tailored pressure stimulation” or “dynamic pulse loading” of boreholes  such approaches show promise for stimulating crystalline rocks, typical of geothermal reservoirs  however, many such target formations are at significant depths where pressures and temperatures induce a more ductile response that may inhibit the stimulation of an effective, permeable network  we present results from a computational effort to assess the feasibility of dynamic loading for creating a stimulated fracture network at depths approaching the brittle-ductile transition  we will discuss the spatial distribution of the developed fracture network for various p-t regimes  the results of this study are intended to support future experimental and/or field-based investigations and pave the way for a field demonstration of the dynamically stimulated geothermal process   1  introduction  in traditional hydraulic fracturing stimulation, the effective conductivity of low permeability rock is increased by generating/activating fractures through injection of pressurized fluid (eaton, 1969; simonson et al , 1978)  one possible extension of traditional hydraulic fracturing is to increase the loading rate of the driving fluid  methods that use dynamic loading potentially extend stimulation to previously unrealized geological resources (reeves and weida, 1995)  with increasing rate of injection, such as achievable with explosives or propellants, it is possible to create fractures at arbitrary orientations and potentially stimulate the near wellbore region more uniformly (reeves and weida, 1995)  such an approach relies on the ability of stress waves from an explosive charge to overcome the in situ stresses and create fractures in various directions, in contrast to one preferentially aligned fracture formed during hydraulic fracturing in uniform rock  however, it is also well known that shock waves emanating from a detonation can compact the rock and reduce the permeability (reeves and weida, 1995)   in the case of geothermal applications in particular, there is a desire to seek greater depths to ensure sufficient heat for efficient energy extraction  for example, at depth of 3 km to 5 km we can expect the temperature to approach 500°c or more  energetic approaches to stimulating a rock mass rely upon the creation of open fractures through brittle processes  morris et al  (2016) applied shock-physics codes to investigate the near field, stress wave effects due to explosive stimulation  their results confirmed that detonations may be used to stimulate the rock more uniformly in the near field of the explosion  in addition, they observed synergistic interactions among multiple charges  however, this previous work did not consider the impact of elevated temperature upon the strength and ductility of the rock  the motivation of the current study is to quantify the extent of brittle fracturing (that is more conducive to increased permeability) compared with ductile deformation at high temperature and pressure | 
2017-0372 	 research on reinforcement and monitoring of the dunhuang mogao grottoes based on risk assessment of cliff stability |abstract: the dunhuang mogao grottoes located at the silk road contain the 4th-14th buddhist art which spans a period of 1000 years  natural weathering over the time and the poor cementation of the surrounding rock bodies have resulted in a lot of geological deterioration  in 1960s, dunhuang academy carried out the reinforcement project and took various measures including the construction of support walls and the removal of dangerous rocks to effectively prevent the cliff from further collapsing and provide a relatively stable environment for the preservation of the wall paintings in the caves  it is necessary to assess the effect of conservation project to ensure safety of caves after more fifties years  based on comprehensive investigation of current condition of mogao’s cliff and it's stability parameters, this study introduces the theory of risk management, assesses and classifies the stability risks of cliff by using different methods such as historical analysis, engineering geological analogy, limit equilibrium, numerical simulation and etc , and then reinforces the areas of high-level risks by anchoring, grouting or using protective capping  meanwhile, more real-time monitoring measures have been used to ensure the security of the dunhuang mogao grottoes   1  introduction  the mogao grottoes chiseled in the quaternary conglomerate is located on the western bank of the daquan river, 25 km southeast of dunhuang city (fig  1)   situated at a strategic point along the silk rood, at the crossroads of trade as well as religious, cultural and intellectual influences, the 735 cells and cave sanctuaries in mogao are famous for their more 2000 statues and 45,000 m2 wall paintings, spanning 1,000 years of buddhist art   due to the weak cemented cliff, natural weathering and human activities over 1000 years, multiple types of geological deteriorations have been appeared, such as cracks and collapses (fig  2)  frequent collapses happened in his history have caused terrible damage to the integrity of the caves  meanwhile, the surface of cliff has become loosened and fragile by long-term deterioration  especially in heavy weathering, gravels and sands often fall or slide down from the sloping area of the top of caves, seriously threatening the safety of the cultural heritage as well as visitors | 
2017-0378 	 inverse problem theory to estimate thermo-poroelastic parameters: an analytical/ experimental approach |abstract: induced stresses are one of the main factors affecting wellbore instability and associated problems in drilling operations  these stresses are significantly impacted by pore pressure variation and thermal stresses in the fields  heat and fluid transfer capability of rock and thermal expansion coefficient are important parameters in the study of stresses using a thermo-poroelastic model  in this study, the field equations governing the problem have been derived based on the thermo-poroelastic theory and solved analytically  afterward, the couple of 50 mm synthetics sand-cement samples are applied in laboratory experiments  the in situ stresses and wellbore pressure are applied on the sample in a true triaxial stress cell (ttsc)  in the laboratory tests, the temperatures are controlled and cooled oil is injected into the sample  the strains are measured and calculated based on experiment and model  in the next step, a genetic algorithm has been applied to solve an inverse problem and get a match between experimental data and the modeling results  ultimately, the important properties for the interactions of fluid and rock can be estimated  with this approach, the required thermal and flow parameters are estimated with good accuracy without using time consuming and costly tests   1  introduction  wellbore stability has an important role during drilling  the formations around wellbore experience new stress conditions due to the removal of drilled rocks (fjaer, horsrud et al  2008, al-ajmi and zimmerman 2009)  any point below ground carries different stresses, namely vertical stress due to the overburden or weight of overlaying formations, horizontal stresses from tectonic movements and pore pressures (amadei 1984)   the assumed rock formation behavior is a significant factor in modeling the stresses around a borehole  in this regard, mclean and addis (mclean and addis 1990) pointed out that a poro-elasto-plastic model can give more realistic results than a linear elastic model  in addition, bradford and cook (1994) suggested using an elasto-plastic model for stress modeling and they have applied their recommendation in wellbore stability analysis for vertical well with isotropic in situ stresses  furthermore, chemo-poro-elastic model is used to determine the stresses around the wellbore in shale formations(ma, chen et al ) | 
2017-0379 	 approximate solutions for radial and plane strain hydraulic fractures for variable injection rates |abstract: this study develops approximate solutions for the problems of a plane strain and radial hydraulic fractures that are generated by a time-varying injection source  the mathematical model considers coupling between the effects of fracture toughness, fluid viscosity (newtonian fluid), and leak-off (carter’s model)  the solution is constructed by approximating spatial variation of the fracture width by a function, whose near-tip asymptotic behavior is captured precisely while the solution in the vicinity of the wellbore is approximated  such an assumption together with the closed form expression for the asymptotic solution allows one to reformulate the problem in terms of algebraic equations, which leads to construction of the closed form approximate solutions  to examine the accuracy of the developed solutions, the latter are tested against the corresponding numerical solutions for a wide range of parameters  results indicate a good agreement for both the plane strain and radial fracture geometries, thus enabling one to use the developed solutions to address problems where rapid computations of fracture parameters are necessary   1  introduction  hydraulic fracturing is a technology that has been used to stimulate oil and gas wells for more than fifty years (economides and nolte, 2000)  the fracturing fluid is injected deep into the subsurface to create cracks that increase the production of hydrocarbons by providing high conductivity channels  a typical hydraulic fracturing model includes flow of a viscous fluid inside the fracture, conservation of the fracturing fluid, elastic equilibrium of the rock, and a crack propagation criterion  there are many different models for hydraulic fracturing, which vary bp the fracture geometry, fracturing fluid rheology, and type of propagation criterion to name a few  recent review papers contain more detailed descriptions oh various hydraulic fracture models (adachi et al , 2007; weng, 2015; peirce, 2016)   complex multiscale behavior of hydraulic fractures occurs even for the simplest geometries, namely, a semiinfinite plane strain, a finite plane strain, and a radial crack, see e g  a thorough review paper (detournay, 2016)  in the situation, in which the problem is governed by the fracture toughness, fluid viscosity, and leak-off, the complexity arises partly from the competition between the energy dissipation due to fracture toughness and fluid viscosity and partly from the possibility of fluid storage in either fracture or formation (most oh the fluid leaks off into the formation in this case)  if a lag between the fluid and the fracture fronts is introduced, then it adds an additional parameter, namely the size of the fluid lag zone (garagash and detournay, 2000; detournay and garagash, 2003)  if there is a possibility of a turbulent flow inside the fracture, then the size of the laminar zone near the tip plays the role of an additional parameter influencing the solution (dontsov, 2016a)  this study considers the case when the solution is determined solely by an interplay between the fracture toughness, fluid viscosity, and leak-off and ignores the effects of the fluid lag and turbulent flow | 
2017-0381 	 evaluation of fracability index for reservoir rock - a laboratory study |abstract: brittleness indices (b i ) defined based on varied input parameters have been historically used as a guideline for evaluation of target zones meant for hydraulic fracturing  however, a number of recent studies have raised valid concerns regarding the efficacy of the utilization of brittleness index alone as selection criteria for hydraulic fracturing purposes  the alternative selection criteria proposed by researchers is a measure of the ease of fracability which utilizes a combination of the brittleness index along with the fracture toughness  in the present study, experiments were performed on rocks representing multiple lithologies to obtain the various input parameters required to estimate b i  parameters obtained from the experiments include the unconfined compressive strength (ucs), young’s modulus, poisson’s ratio and brazilian tensile strength  the isrm recommended cracked chevron notched brazilian disk (ccnbd) method was used to evaluate the fracture toughness of the samples  brittleness indices based on lab measured properties were then calculated to observe variation of brittleness index, fracture toughness and fracability index (f i ) with rock mechanical properties and to provide a data based evaluation of the applicability to hydraulic fracturing design   1  introduction  laboratory studies, to evaluate mechanical parameters for geomechanical models addressing unconventional well design, completion and production usually focus on estimating failure characteristics, elastic anisotropy parameters and strength  the results of these tests find applications in wellbore stability assessment and hydraulic fracture design  an integrated approach towards addressing the concerns of all teams involved with the development of an asset will enhance the efficiency  the models used to simulate for reservoir development, completion as well as production require reliable inputs to enable meaningful results  the inputs required can be obtained from multiple sources; the results from lab based testing being the most direct method of actual measurement of required parameters  lab studies are usually designed to satisfy the input requirements for multiple groups, and experimental programs, use at minimum, combinations of the tests shown in table 1, to get the desired inputs towards designing the optimal solution for an encountered challenge or to anticipate and manage the challenge  the information shown includes dimensional requirements, with the ideal sample diameter being at least 10 times the average grain size (bieniawski, z t , et al, 2007)  core sections obtained are usually slabbed or unslabbed sections of 7 62 cm diameter <u+00d7> 30 48 cm length  well bore stability issues usually require a failure envelope study which consumes 3-4 samples worth of material per lithology from the core  anisotropy studies which aid in wellbore stability analysis, bedding plane weakness studies as also hydraulic fracturing design require at least two samples to be drilled one parallel and the other perpendicular to the bedding  the material requirement estimate is dependent on successful representative drilling attempts and core condition | 
2017-0382 	 discrete modeling of fluid-driven fracture processes in anisotropic rock formations |abstract: this study investigates hydraulic fracture propagation using a coupled hydro-mechanical simulation code, tough-rbsn  the modeling tool combines a multiphase fluid flow and heat transport simulator, tough2, with a geomechanical and fracture-damage modeling approach, called the rigid-body-spring network (rbsn)  the model provides a discrete representation of material failure and fracture processes, and hydrological properties (e g , permeability, porosity) of fractured elements are evaluated by transient fracture aperture changes  modeling capabilities for coupled hydro-mechanical processes are presented through hydraulic fracturing simulations of laboratory test samples with multiple pre-existing natural fractures  sensitivity studies are conducted by changing the reservoir configurations, such as the viscosity of injected fluid and the confining stress condition  more realistic reservoir modeling at a larger scale is conducted with configurations of mechanical anisotropy (e g , elastic moduli, strength parameters), which demonstrates the capability of modeling directional fracturing paths aligned with anisotropic rock properties   1  introduction  fluid-driven fractures are important in many geoengineering applications  for instance, hydraulic fracturing is a commonly used technique to increase the permeability of an oil/gas reservoir to enhance productivity  on the contrary, in the context of underground storage sites for radioactive waste or carbon dioxide, fractures induced by pressurized gas should be avoided or controlled to detain the pollutants   numerous numerical models have been developed to investigate the physical phenomena of fluid-driven fracture processes leading to a better understanding of the fracturing mechanism  however, it is still challenging to explicitly model fluid-driven fracturing because it involves tightly coupled hydro-mechanical (hm) behavior with a singularity at the crack tip  especially in consideration of heterogeneous and anisotropic rock properties with presence of multiple fractures, modeling the fracture processes can be even more cumbersome   in recent years, numerical studies have been conducted to model multiple fractures or fracture networks involved in coupled hm processes  fu et al  (2013) proposed an explicit modeling approach for hydraulic fracturing in arbitrary discrete fracture networks  an adaptive remeshing (node-splitting) scheme within the finite-element based method was applied to demonstrate fracture generations  pan et al  (2014) used a cellular automation coupled with a multiphase fluid flow simulator, tough2 (pruess et al , 2012), to represent multiple fracture interactions induced by co2 injection  asahina et al  (2014) established a coupling framework between the tough2 simulator and the rigid-body-spring network (rbsn) approach, and validated the tough-rbsn code through simulations of swelling and desiccation cracking in geomaterials  the simulation results proved the potential abilities to model multiple fractures and discrete fracture interactions | 
2017-0386 	 modelling p-wave propagation in a medium with multiple parallel fractures and direct comparison with experimental recordings  |abstract: we examine p-wave propagation in a fractured medium using effective medium, explicit fractures, and localized effective medium representations of fracturing, to quantify their effectiveness  we model a published experiment with multiple parallel fractures  initial models assume uniform fracture stiffness across all fractures  a methodology is presented for inverting a source from the experiment  we find that the waveforms from the three models do not match each other  for propagation parallel to the fractures, the explicit model performs best with excellent agreement with the experimental waveform  the waveform from the localized ti model is reasonably similar, matching arrival, predominant period, frequency content, but not amplitude  the ti model is a poor match with significant differences in period, amplitude and high frequency content  for perpendicular propagation, none of the models properly match the experimental waveform  all models reproduce the significant delay in arrival, but only the explicit and local ti models produce a reduction in period and frequency content mimicking the experiment  all models produce a reduction in amplitude but not to the degree of the experiment  an explicit model accounting for the effect of the non-uniform stress-field better matches the experiment, indicating similar developments are needed for the other two representations   1  introduction  fractures in rocks are significant in a number of engineering applications  for example, an assessment of rock fractures is extremely important for characterizing the effectiveness of the geological barrier to a nuclear waste disposal repository, as they can provide fluid pathways, increasing the rock permeability  by examining the full waveform from either active or passive seismic sources we can obtain information on fracturing as seismic waves interact with the fractures (e g , schoenberg, 1980)  many studies (e g , crampin, 1981, hudson, 1981, majer, et al , 1988, rathore, et al , 1995, kawai, et al , 2006, tillotson, et al , 2011, de figueiredo, et al , 2013, ding, et al , 2014, tillotson, et al , 2014) have assumed that the response of a large number of fractures, can be mapped into the overall effective behavior of the medium, by linking the elastic constants with the fracture density and orientation, leading to anisotropy in the wave velocities (effective medium modelling)  an alternative approach is discrete fracture representation using displacement discontinuities  the model was introduced for seismic wave propagation by schoenberg (1980) and has been studied by numerous authors, (e g , pyrak-nolte, et al , 1990, nakagawa, et al , 2002, hildyard, 2007, chichinina, et al , 2009b, perino, et al , 2010, fan & sun, 2015, shao, et al , 2015)  pyrak-nolte et al  1990 examined the displacement discontinuity model for elastic wave propagation through multiple parallel fractures, in an experiment using laminated steel plates to simulate natural fractures  hildyard (2007) then showed that an explicit representation of the fractures could match the experimental recorded waveforms but only if the effect of a non-uniform loading on fracture stiffness was included  in this research we try to model this experiment on laminated steel block (pyrak-nolte, et al , 1990), using the numerical modelling code wave3d (hildyard, et al , 1995) to demonstrate the resulting changes to seismic waveforms for both effective and discrete fracture models, in order to establish under what conditions each representation is most appropriate and how close the models are to producing real effects on waveforms |

2017-0389 	 comparison of roughness indices from weathered, differentially weathered and vuggy profiles obtained using laser scanning and photogrammetry |abstract: surface profiles obtained from weathered limestone specimens using laser profiling and photogrammetry were assessed using three geometric and three fractal roughness algorithms  the specimens were visually classified as smooth, slightly rough, moderately rough, rough, differentially weathered, and vuggy  comparisons of roughness indices from the two methods were made using a graphical qualitative assessment and semi-quantitative assessments using bland-altman plots with kolmogorov-smirnov tests  profile roughness indices computed from laser profiling and photogrammetry methods compared favorably for smooth to rough weathering states  profile roughness indices from using sinuosity, z2, modified division (a- and d-value), and semi-variance a-value did not compare favorably when assessing differentially weathered and vuggy profiles  inspection of the profiles showed that photogrammetry profiles had segments containing high frequency perturbations which caused abnormally high roughness indices from the aforementioned algorithms  the perturbations are an artifact of the interpretation of the profiles obtained from specimen sections with pitted and vuggy surfaces  care should be exercised when choosing profiling methods and assessing profile roughness when characterizing differentially weathered and vuggy specimens   1  introduction  the roughness of rock surfaces is of interest to many practitioners and researchers  rock surface roughness is most often associated with shear strength estimates of discontinuities  surface roughness can also be an indication of the degree of weathering  there have been many different methods used to assess or measure the surface of rock discontinuities or specimens  perhaps the most widely used method is a visual assessment of the surface, viz  barton and choubey (1977), but many mechanical, contact, and non-contact methods have also been employed   the choice of measurement method is dependent on a number of factors including both the desired resolution and the size of the surface to be analyzed  techniques have ranged in sophistication from basic contact methods such as profile gauges (mccarrol, 1997) and needle probe profilometers (ozvan et al, 2014 and singh and basu, 2016) to sophisticated non-contact methods such as charge coupled devices (yang et al , 2016), variable focus microscope (renger, 1970), multistripe laser triangulation scanning (medapati et al , 2013), industrial laser profiling (brown et al , 2016), photogrammetry (kim et al , 2015), and lidar (asmare et al , 2014)  poropat (2009) presents a number of different methods that have been used to assess the surface roughness of rock discontinuities |

2017-0393 	 analysis of a hydraulic fracture’s tip region with proppant plug |abstract: this paper studies the problem of the near-tip region of a fluid-driven fracture with proppant that propagates in a permeable linear-elastic medium at a constant velocity  to deal with this problem, an equivalent problem for the semi-infinite hydraulic fracture with proppant is considered  it is assumed that the proppant is located within a plug, in which its concentration is equal to the maximum value  the boundaries of this proppant plug are defined by the prescribed particle radius (which is used in the bridging criterion) and the entire volume of proppant in the fracture  the fracturing fluid permeates through the proppant plug according to darcy’s law, which leads to a strong pressure change over the proppant zone  to address the problem, we use a non-singular formulation, which was developed previously to solve the problem of a semi-infinite hydraulic fracture without proppant and allows us to use standard numerical techniques to effectively obtain the numerical solution  the computed numerical solution quantifies the influence of proppant plug on the fracture width and shape, which results mostly in fracture widening  fracture width solutions with different proppant sizes, proppant volumes, fluid viscosities, and leak-off coefficients are compared  |1  introduction |hydraulic fracturing is a technique that is used in oil and gas industry to increase the recovery of hydrocarbons from underground reservoirs (economides and nolte, 2000)  in this technique, fluid is injected into the formation under high pressure, which breaks the rock and generates fractures  proppant particles are often added to the fracturing fluid to keep the fracture open after the treatment  to better understand the global behavior of fluid-driven fractures, it is important to study the processes that occur near the fracture tip, see e g  detournay (2016)  |the problem of the tip region of a hydraulic fracture is equivalent to the semi-infinite hydraulic fracture, as was shown for a planar fracture geometry in (peirce and detournay, 2008)  this semi-infinite hydraulic fracture problem has been studied extensively for more than two decades (desroches et al , 1994; lenoach, 1995; garagash and detournay, 2000; detournay, 2004; garagash et al , 2011; dontsov and peirce, 2015)  it is known that the solution it determined by a competition of different physical processes, which may include rock toughness, fluid viscosity, and fluid leak-off  fluid lag, which is caused by the presence of cavity near the fracture tip, is not considered in this study, see e g  (garagash and detournay, 2000; detournay, 2004) for the analysis of such a problem  the situation, in which the viscosity dominates the response, leads to the so-called viscosity dominated solution, which was obtained in (desroches et al , 1994) for the power law fluid rheology  if leak-off dominates, then the solution corresponds to the leak-off dominated regime, and it was obtained for power law fluids in (lenoach, 1995)  the toughness dominated solution corresponds to a "dry" crack (i e  without pressure gradient), for which the solution stems from the linear elastic fracture mechanics (lefm) (rice, 1968)  the complete problem, that accounts for all three physical processes (fracture toughness, fluid viscosity, and fluid leak-off) was analyzed and solved numerically its (garagash et al , 2011)  this problem was later considered in (dantsov and peirce, 2015), where the so-called non-singular formulation was developed  this non-singular formulation rewrites the problem solely in terms of fracture width and eliminates the fluid pressure dependence, where the latter is singular at the fracture tip and can lead to a more complicated numerical scheme  as a result, the numerical solution can be effectively obtained using standard numerical techniques | 
2017-0394 	 breakout analysis for anisotropic rocks (baar): matlab-based code to study failure zone development around boreholes in anisotropic shales |abstract: stress distribution around the borehole and the resulting initiation and propagation of technologically induced compressive and tensile failure zones are strongly affected by the elastic anisotropy of the rock medium  we develop the breakout analysis for anisotropic rocks (baar) code in matlab to study failure zones around the borehole in anisotropic rocks  baar allows for a two-dimensional analysis of the mechanical and thermal effects around a pressurized borehole in an anisotropic thermo-poroelastic rock medium subjected to variable far-field loads  the implemented failure criteria are used to assess the stability of the borehole wall and to establish the optimal pressure of the drilling fluid  baar can be additionally used for the estimation of principal stress magnitudes based on the measurements of breakouts and tensile fractures, the estimation of strengthening effect of intermediate stress on the rock medium around the borehole, the study of the heat and pore pressure distribution in the rock medium and its effect on the stress field  we present an example of the stability analysis for the transversely isotropic sasino and paslek shale formations   1  introduction  borehole stability analysis is crucial to the success of drilling, stimulation, and production processes  borehole wall is a surface of discontinuity, on which stresses concentrate  high stress concentration may lead to compressive failure of the borehole wall i e  initiation of the breakout zone, which can cause technical issues, and in extreme cases loss of the borehole  borehole stability can be ensured mechanically by controlling borehole-fluid pressure and to a lesser extent by modifying its temperature and chemistry   we develop breakout analysis for anisotropic rocks (baar) code in matlab to study stress distribution around the borehole and its effects on borehole stability  the analysis is performed for the plane strain state in the plane normal to the borehole axis  we derive an analytical solution for the stress concentration around a circular hole in an orthotropic elastic medium, which is based on the complex variable method by mushkhelishvili (lekhnitskii 1968, savin, 1968)  the analytical solution provides both the stress and displacement fields  the thermal stress component is calculated based on a series solution to the transient heat conduction problem in polar coordinates (nowacki, 1970, carslaw and jaeger, 2011)  borehole stability analysis in baar can be conducted using several failure criteria such as mohr-coulomb, drucker-prager, lade-duncan, or wiebols-cook (colmenares and zoback, 2002; zhang et al , 2010), facilitating a comprehensive approach to the problem using all available data  we present several examples of baar applications, including the borehole stability analysis for transversely isotropic shale formations of the lower palaeozoic baltic basin | 
2017-0396 	 a comparison of non-local elasticity models for a bladelike hydraulic fracture |abstract: the goal of this study is to compare two perkins-kern-nordgren (pkn) hydraulic fracture models with non-local elasticity: the enhanced pkn (epkn) model and the 2d displacement discontinuity method (2d ddm)  the elasticity equation in the epkn model is obtained by substituting the elliptic vertical width profile into the elasticity integral for a planar crack  the 2d ddm elasticity equation is based on the plane strain solution and has a correction factor that is added to account for the finite height of the pkn fracture  both approaches are implemented using a fixed mesh algorithm, where the tip asymptotic solution is used to advance the moving fracture front  to verify the accuracy of the algorithm, its plane strain version is tested against the reference solutions for the plane strain hydraulic fracture for different regimes of propagation  to evaluate the two non-local elasticity models, their predictions are compared to the reference numerical solution, obtained using a fully planar algorithm, for pkn fracture geometry  it is shown that the epkn method has a better agreement with the reference solution, while the 2d ddm approach causes an approximately 20% error in the fracture length estimation for the considered cases   1  introduction  the process of fracture generation and propagation in a rock formation due to injection of a highly pressurized fluid is called hydraulic fracturing  this technique is often employed by the petroleum industry to stimulate oil and gas wells by creating permeable channels within the reservoir (economides and nolte, 2000)  the physical processes occurring in hydraulic fracturing include elastic equilibrium of rock, fluid volume balance and its flow within the crack, and a criterion for fracture propagation  there are various numerical models that are able to incorporate all these processes into a hydraulic fracturing simulator, see e g  review papers (adachi et al , 2007; weng, 2015) | 
2017-0398 	 characteristics of the weak rock at regional connector project in los angeles |abstract: the regional connector transit corridor project provides a 3 0 km long connection for existing light rail transit lines in downtown los angeles, california  the project involves twin bored tunnels, cut-and-cover tunnels, three deep stations and one sequential excavation cavern that will encounter the fernando formation bedrock, which underlines the alluvium  the fernando formation consists of a poorly bedded to massive clayey siltstone to silty claystone that is poorly cemented and extremely weak to very weak per isrm (1978)  this paper presents the geotechnical engineering characteristics of the formation based on field investigation and laboratory testing   1  introduction  the regional connector transit corridor project consists of 3 0 km long new tracks of connection between a number of existing light rail transit lines in downtown los angeles  the project elements include three deep stations, one cavern using the sequential excavation method (sem), segments of tunnels using a tunnel boring machine (tbm), and cut-and-cover guideway structures  the subsurface conditions along the tunnel alignment generally consist of artificial fill overlaying finer-grained alluvium (dominantly medium dense to dense sandy soils), underlain by coarser-grained alluvium (a wide variety of medium dense to dense sandy and gravely soils)  below the coarser-grained alluvium is the fernando formation, which is characterized as extremely weak to very weak sedimentary bedrock; a long segment of the project alignment will be excavated in this formation  the geologic profile along the alignment is shown in figure 1   2  overview and basic properties  based on a large number of geotechnical investigations performed for the project alignment, the fernando formation commonly consists of a weathered profile, ranging from “moderately weathered” to “highly weathered”, which overlays a “slightly weathered” to “fresh” profile  the thickness of the more weathered, weaker bedrock ranges from 0 to approximately 60 feet (1 foot = 0 305 m) along the project alignment  as shown on figure 1, the thickest weathering underlies the high terrain in the vicinity of 2nd street and hope street (i e  from approximately station 29+00 to 45+00 feet), where the depth to slightly weathered/fresh bedrock ranges from approximately 30 to 60 feet below the top of bedrock  the thickness of the more highly weathered bedrock decreases toward the flanks of the hill  although bedrock is generally massive, the bedrock contains discontinuities that include bedding planes (bedding plane partings/bedding plane joints), joints and shears | 
2017-0399 	 modeling the effect of turbulence on the simultaneous propagation of multiple parallel hydraulic fractures |abstract: the injection of slick-water at the high rates used to fracture unconventional shale-gas reservoirs results in flows that are turbulent - particularly near the wellbore  in this paper we consider the effect of turbulence on the simultaneous propagation of multiple hydraulic fractures that are constrained to evolve in parallel planes  the effect of turbulence is captured using a modification of the darcy-weisbach fluid-flow model with an adaptation of churchill's friction factor approximation to fracture flow geometries that is able to capture the transition from laminar to fully turbulent flow  since the reynlods number is proportional to the fracture width, the flow transitions to laminar close to the tip where the fracture width approaches zero  the model used in this paper is therefore able to exploit the multi-scale laminar tip asymptotic behaviour in order to use the implicit level set scheme (ilsa) to locate the fracture free boundary and to identify the propagation regime  we provide a numerical example for an array of five uniformly distributed planar fractures in which the laminar model exhibits significant stress shadowing while the turbulent model predicts substantially less  this reduction in stress shadowing in the turbulent flow model is due to the significantly larger pressure drop near the well-bore compared to the laminar case that dominates the mutual stress interactions between the fractures in the array   1  introduction  hydraulic fractures are tensile fractures induced in a rock formation by the injection of a pressurized fluid  this technique is used to stimulate oil and gas wells economides and nolte (2000), for waste disposal abou-sayed et al  (1989), to enhance rock mining jeffrey and mills (2000), for co2 sequestration, and for geothermal energy extraction brown (2000)  to increase the treatment efficiency in unconventional tight-gas reservoirs multiple hydraulic fractures from different perforations are often generated simultaneously from one wellbore  in this situation, outer fractures induce additional compressive stresses on inner fractures and cause non-uniform fracture growth  this phenomenon is called stress shadowing and has been addressed in numerous studies olson (2008); singh and miskimins (2010); mcclure and zoback (2013); kresse et at  (2013); peirce and bunger (2014); daneshy (2014); wu et at  (2015); skomorowski et al  (2015); kumar and ghassemi (2015); manchanda et al  (2016); dontsov and peirce (2016) and can significantly affect the fracture geometry and the associated production rate  for this reason, it is important to develop numerical models that are able to predict simultaneous growth of multiple hydraulic fractures and that can be used to design more efficient hydraulic fracture stimulations | 
2017-0400 	 a novel approach to efficiently solve displacement discontinuity problems in poroelastic media |abstract: the displacement discontinuity method (ddm) is one of the most popular numerical methods in simulating hydraulic fracturing problems  despite its superior advantages in solving fracture modeling problems, this method becomes computationally expensive when the number of degrees of freedom (dof) increases  an example takes place in the study of two-dimensional fracturing problems with multiple fractures propagating from one or more wells  it would also occur in three-dimensional problems where typically the number of elements exceeds a few thousands  additionally, including poroelasticity into the problem makes this method even more computationally expensive because of the necessity to build a time-marching procedure  the fast multipole method (fmm) is a computational method to efficiently compute matrix-vector products with a controllable error  unlike the conventional boundary element method (bem), in fmm the interaction between far-field sources and influenced points are calculated by initially concentrating a cluster of far-field sources into a separate point, then the effect of these concentrated forces on each influenced point is calculated  |in this study, a novel technique known as black-box fast multipole method (bbfmm) is used to improve the computational efficiency of a poroelastic displacement discontinuity hydraulic fracture model while keeping its accuracy  this method is used to develop an efficient poroelastic hydraulic fracture simulator  then, the simulator is used to examine the computational effectiveness and the accuracy of the new approach against the conventional displacement discontinuity approach in calculating stresses, displacements and pore pressure  a comparison between efficiency and precision of the developed fast multipole model and the conventional displacement discontinuity model is presented  several cases of discrete fracture problems with large degrees of freedom are tested  results show that the new approach reduces the computation time and memory compared to the conventional approach  the applicability of the developed model in hydraulic fracturing problems is also demonstrated  because of this increase in computational performance, this method can be applied to poroelasticity problems which require such computations at each time step  unlike the regular method, calculations using the fmm algorithm may be accomplished in a reasonable time | 
2017-0401 	 predicting the primary impact and total rollout distances of rock falls based on cases in quarries and mines in australia and the united kingdom |abstract: the excavation of slopes in mountainous terrain for road or railway access, slopes in open cast mines, and deteriorating natural or existing slopes can pose a significant hazard to human activities and infrastructure  the assessment of rock fall risk along roads, in communities below mountains and in mining operations is imperative  numerical models are often used to predict rock fall trajectories, assess the effectiveness of benched slope designs, and aid in the design of rock fall barriers  inputs into the models should be calibrated with field tests or historic case studies specific to the geological setting  this paper investigates the primary impact distance (pid) and the total rollout distance (rd) from the base of the slope using both field tests and numerical models  understanding and having the ability to predict pid and rd for future rock fall events is beneficial during the slope design process for optimizing slope angles to minimize excavation costs and risk management for constructed or natural slopes   1  introduction  rock fall is the movement of rock from a slope that is so steep that the rock continues to move down the slope  the movement can be free falling, bouncing, rolling or sliding as illustrated in figure 1   rock falls can be a result of slope degradation from weathering, freeze-thaw action, earthquakes, blast vibrations, excavation, pore pressure changes due to rainfall infiltration, surface water runoff, root-growth or leverage by roots moving in high winds (hoek, 2007)   when areas prone to rock falls are unknown or not adequately managed, rock falls can present a major hazard to human activities and infrastructure below  when designing barriers to manage rock fall risk, an engineer needs to consider the following aspects of a possible rock fall event:  geometry of the slope and location of infrastructure and human activity |size of the expected rock and associated kinetic energy |expected primary impact distance (pid) from the base of the slope |expected total rollout distance (rd)  
2017-0402 	 experimental analysis of geomechanical and fracture mechanical rock properties |abstract: the study of fracture propagation and its potential interaction with bedding interfaces is essential to investigate whether vertical fractures induced by deep subsurface injection operation penetrate into seal formation and provide potential pathways for contaminated fluid to migrate upward into the drinking water formation  the major factors that affect the fracture containment during fluid injection include in-situ stress condition and geomechanical properties of the rocks  in order to address this issue, our experimental study utilized two rocks: sandstone and mudstone  we performed a series of laboratory triaxial experiments to determine the geomechanical properties and fracture mechanical properties of intact rocks  experiments were also conducted on rock specimens prepared with precut failure shear planes bonded with epoxy  comparison was conducted between the intact and bonded rocks  the friction angle and cohesion of the intact mudstone evaluated using mohr-coulomb failure criterion are 47 8° and 10 mpa, respectively  using the hoek-brown failure criterion, for normal stresses from 0 to 400 mpa, the cohesion of the intact sandstone ranged from 8 5 to 113 8 mpa and the friction angle ranged from 69 2° to 28 7°  bonded rocks have lower young’s moduli and maximum shear strength  the geomechanical properties of bonded samples were governed by the confining pressure-dependent strength of the epoxy   1  introduction  major factors that affect the fracture containment during fluid injection include in-situ stress, material property contrast, and bedding interfaces  in-situ stress has been considered one of the most significant effects on fracture-height growth  it is recognized that higher minimum in-situ horizontal stress in the overlying lay is favorable for fracture containment within the injection formation (fisher and warpinski, 2012)  it was shown that low-modulus bounding formations surrounding a higher-modulus injection formation can be favorable for facture to be contained within the injection formation, but containment also depends on the relative fracture toughness of the rocks in different formations  when a fracture approaches a layer interface, it could be arrested or it could be step over the interface  it is well known that bedding interfaces hinder facture vertical growth because crossing interfaces requires additional energy  however, the complicated interaction mechanism between the interface and the fracturing process makes the understanding of the fracture containment extremely challenging (fisher and warpinski, 2012)  in spite of the importance of the interaction between hydraulic fractures and bedding interfaces for fracture containment analysis in hydraulic fracture enhances hydrocarbon recovery, a sound theory is not reliable | 
2017-0404 	 2d experimental and numerical results for hydraulic fractures interacting with orthogonal and inclined discontinuities |abstract: experimental and numerical results are presented for hydraulic fracture interactions with a discontinuity (representing a natural fracture, fault, or bedding interface) in a 2d configuration where viscous dissipation is dominant  a 2d boundary element code (minehf2d) is used to simulate hydraulic fracture interaction using experimental parameters such as interface friction, injection system compressibility and fracture toughness  crossing and arresting (blunting) hydraulic fracture behaviors have been observed in experimental and numerical results for orthogonal and inclined interfaces  optical analysis of video records allows tracking of fracture pathways, growth rate and opening (fracture width)  the experimental results are presented using the renshaw-pollard criterion and compared to numerical simulation outputs  the numerical predictions of crossing behavior, fracture pathways including offsets and crossing fracture re-initiation delay compared well with measurements   1  introduction  interaction between a growing hydraulic fracture (hereafter also called hf) and discontinuities within the rock (such as a natural fracture, fault, or bedding plane, hereafter called nf or discontinuity) can have a significant impact on hydraulic fracture growth and the resulting treatment effectiveness (kresse, weng, chuprakov, prioul, & cohen, 2013)  this hf-nf interaction problem has been studied using modelling (zhang & jeffrey, 2006, 2008), laboratory experiments (blanton, 1986; bunger, kear, jeffrey, prioul, & chuprakov, 2016; gu et al , 2012; r  g  jeffrey et al , 2015; kresse et al , 2013; warpinski & teufel, 1987) and field studies (robert g  jeffrey et al , 2009; warpinski & teufel, 1987; weng, 2015; weng et al , 2014) with the intent of developing a greater understanding of hydraulic fracture growth behavior in a naturally fractured rock mass   the hf-nf interaction mechanics are complex, and two main effects are considered critical to this interaction  firstly, local stresses at the discontinuity are changed by the stress and displacement influence of an approaching hf  through this process, the tensile stress induced ahead of the fracture tip (process zone) can cause local sliding on the discontinuity  alternatively, if the friction coefficient of the discontinuity is large enough to resist sliding, the applied forces can be transferred across the discontinuity and cause the creation and growth of a tensile fracture on the far side of the discontinuity | 
2017-0409 	 stimulated reservoir volume evaluation using shear wave |abstract: the concept of stimulated reservoir volume (srv) has spawned numerous reservoir engineering models to approximate the production mechanisms associated with complex hydraulic fractures and to facilitate production modeling and well performance evaluations   there have been various methods to quantify srv, both in laboratory and in field  micro-seismic monitoring is widely applied in both scales  the technique records the acoustic emission associated with fracture propagation and shear activation  the data acquisition only lasts during these phases, and the evaluation is not repeatable  determining srv from micro-seismic faces some major challenges due to noise-signal processing and attenuation  although some other methods, such as scanning electron microscopy (sem) provide detailed srv characterization, they are applicable only in very small scale  sem is only suitable for laboratory observation  in this study, we use shear wave attributes to evaluate srv  this association can also be utilized in field  the concept is not new to seismic assessment  in fact, directional shear wave has been used to determine natural fracture orientation  however, we present this concept for srv monitoring purposes, and demonstrate its capabilities on la experiment  the experiments were initially done with a tennessee sandstone core before and after being hydraulically fractured under triaxial laboratory condition (<u+03c3>1 = 3000 psi; <u+03c3>2 = 2000 psi; <u+03c3>3 = 500 psi; pinj = 4500 psi)  shear wave travel time have been recorded with polarizations parallel and perpendicular to the direction of maximum stress   as expected, shear velocity is slower across the main fracture  however, the effect is emphasized on the right wing  shear velocity is also slower when it propagates perpendicular to the main fracture  this agrees with what has been observed by sem image, in which secondary fractures are parallel to the main fracture   1  introduction  hydraulic fracturing is an important application for an economical production of hydrocarbons from unconventional formations  it constitutes a significant contribution to the well development cost  there are arguments that state that the physical laws governing fractures are known and fracture models are accurate, but the emergence of ‘new mechanisms’ every few years suggests that the basic physics incorporated into models has not been as comprehensive as required to model a fracture fully (warpinsky, 1996) | 
2017-0411 	 use of seismic wave conversions (s-to-p wave) to monitor shear crack growth |abstract: in the laboratory, uniaxial compression experiments were performed on prismatic specimens of indiana limestone with two pre-existing parallel flaws  full waveform measurements of shear waves were used to monitor shear crack initiation and propagation in rock  simultaneously, digital image correlation (dic) was used to monitor the damage evolution on the specimen surface by measuring full-field displacements  the shear cracks that initiated from the flaws tips that ultimately produced coalescence were observed to propagate roughly parallel to the loading direction such that the waves impinged on the crack plane at normal incidence  the amplitude of the transmitted waves did not change significantly with shear crack initiation  however, shear to compressional wave conversions occurred when a shear crack was initiated, roughly at 76% of the load detected with dic  the wave conversion is associated with micro-cracks generated as the shear crack initiates  the amplitude of the converted waves increased with shear crack growth and reached a maximum at coalescence  observation of converted waves provides a means for monitoring shear cracks, given that past research has shown that transmitted waves were not sensitive to shear crack initiation   1  introduction  discontinuities play an important role in the behavior and stability of the rock mass, as well as in the flow of fluids through the rock  discontinuities occur on different scales, from micro-cracks to fractures and faults  given the role that pre-existing and induced discontinuities have in rock mass behavior, it is critical to develop techniques that can be used to identify and characterize fractures inside the rock, as well as their evolution with stress changes or with time   several investigators have shown that seismic methods can be used to monitor or even predict rock mass behavior  they have shown that local and microscopic changes of the physical properties of the rock matrix and of the discontinuities affect seismic characteristics such as amplitude and velocity (pyrak-nolte et al , 1990, chen et al , 1993, pyrak-nolte, 1996, nakagawa et al , 2000, kahraman, 2002, leucci and de giorgi, 2006, shao and pyrak-nolte, 2013, byun et al , 2015)  transmitted and reflected compressional (p) and shear (s) waves have been used in our previous work to identify the evolution of tensile and shear cracks inside the rock  the experimental results consistently show that changes in the amplitudes of transmitted seismic waves can be used for detection of damage evolution in the form of tensile cracks, but cannot identify the initiation of shear cracks (modiriasari et al , 2015) | 
2017-0414 	 wellbore stability analysis due to turbulent flow in coiled tubing drilling |abstract: one of the challenges of drilling petroleum and mineral exploration wells is borehole instability posing various risks such as poor drilling efficiency, drill string sticking/stuck, hole cleaning and fluid loss  one of the mechanisms of open borehole instability is a failure caused by the eroding action of drilling fluid in the annulus, called borehole erosion  the shear stress and lifting force mobilized on the formation and the impact of cuttings at the rock grains lead to detachment of formation grains and enlargement of the borehole  this failure is more critical when a turbulent regime is imposed in the annulus in a small gap between the drill string and the formation, which is usually the case during coiled tube drilling  while bore hole erosion, further cutting contamination can also occur from the borehole erosion, which is particularly important for the new drilling system being developed by the deep exploration technologies cooperative research centre (det crc) for mineral exploration use  this paper aims to review existing experiments of soil or rock erosion and to introduce new experimental setup for borehole erosion study   1  introduction  borehole instability is a condition where the drilled section loses its structural integrity and the borehole remains out of gauge (mclean & addis, 1990)  borehole instability has been a challenge for drilling, where it causes a decrease in drilling efficiency, pipe sticking and fluid loss  instability can be initiated through three different mechanisms:  structure controlled, where the discontinuities around the wellbore control stability e g  planar, wedge failure |stress-controlled, causing localised plastic behaviour which leads to a failure around the wellbore |chemical reaction, where the fluid content in rock mass changes the rock properties causing instabilities such as swelling of shale rock |fluid flow/rock interaction in which the fluid flow through the borehole or discontinuities exerts drag or lift forces on the formation and causes erosion  
2017-0415 	 a laboratory experimental study of enhanced geothermal systems |abstract: with the growing interest in renewable energy resources, geothermal energy has become an important research topic  the research objective is to develop a more cost-effective laboratory-scale experimental setup than a full-scale field system to understand the effects of temperature alteration on 1) the thermal-hydro-mechanical interaction between a solid and fluid, and 2) the wellbore stability as a result of geothermal energy extraction  the proposed setup consisted of a steel pipe network, five concrete slabs to simulate a rock mass with two controlled horizontal discontinuities and two wellbores  water was circulated using a water bath into the injection wellbore, through two continuities and out of the simulated reservoir from the extraction wellbore  the concrete slabs were heated and heavily instrumented with vibrating-wire sensors to measure the changes in strains, pore water pressures, and temperatures  water circulated through the reservoir was measured for flow rate, pressure and temperature  also, an overburden pressure was applied to the slabs to simulate actual overburden soil and rock  the workability of the laboratory-scale experimental setup for the geothermal energy investigation was confirmed   1  introduction  with the growing national and international interest in alternative energy resources, geothermal energy has attracted more research attentions, especially in the west region of the united states, where many abundant geothermal resources are yet to be explored  geothermal energy is gaining more supports throughout the world, because it is an affordable and environmentally friendly source of heat (lofken 2013)  enhanced geothermal system (egs) is a man-made geothermal reservoir with hot dry rock and insufficient or little natural permeability or fluid saturation  fluid is normally injected into the geothermal reservoir through hydraulic stimulation or fracturing   in order to develop this resource, it is also important to understand the effects of temperature alteration on wellbore stability as a result of geothermal energy extraction and application  wellbore stability is usually caused by a combination of uncontrollable and controllable factors, and temperature is considered as a controllable factor (mohiuddin et al  2001)  most past studies were focused on the effects of drilling fluid temperatures on the wellbore stability and how mud temperatures were controlled to keep wellbore stress concentration within the surrounding rock limiting strength  knowledge gained from past studies can be applied in this study to investigate the thermal effects on the geomechanical and hydraulic characteristics of wellbores and geothermal reservoir  fundamental knowledge of the relationship between the permeability of a geothermal reservoir and the thermal expansion and contraction of geomaterials will improve our understanding of thermal-hydro-mechanical problems | 
2017-0416 	 experimental study of reservoir stress path and hysteresis during depletion and injection under different deformational conditions |abstract: during production, pore pressure decreases as reservoir becomes increasingly depleted  because of reduction in pore pressure, the far-field stresses change  consequently, formation fracture pressure decreases and therefore the safe mud window becomes narrower  therefore, it is of paramount importance to predict horizontal in-situ stress changes during production and injection  most often, it is assumed that a reservoir deforms uniaxially and the overburden stress is constant during production and injection  however, measured stress paths in the lab under these conditions have large discrepancies with field stress measurements from fracturing tests  these discrepancies might be due to several factors such as scale effects, damaged cores, stress arching, and faulting contributions  however, we identified that another controlling parameter is the dominant boundary conditions in the reservoir  a test matrix is designed and several laboratory experiments are conducted on caslegate sandstone specimens using a triaxial facility  the depletion and injection tests were performed under uniaxial-strain, plane-strain, generalized-plane-stress, and unconstrained conditions  according to the results, stress paths during pressure drawdown and build-up stages are different and a permanent stress change is observed during production and injection cycles in all boundary conditions  interestingly, the permanent stress change is highest for those bc’s where the lateral deformation is permissible (e g , plane strain, generalized plane stress, and unconstrained conditions)  in fact, the stress changes during production are irrecoverable upon repressurization for these cases  according to results, depletion-induced horizontal stress changes under plane strain and unconstrained conditions are lower than generalized-plane-stress assumptions  the highest change in horizontal in-situ stress is for the case of uniaxial strain condition   1  introduction  in-situ stresses in the reservoir control mechanical, petrophysical, and strength properties as wells as fracture pressure and deformational behavior of reservoir and surrounding formations (teufel et al , 1991)  furthermore, conducting any wellbore and reservoir geomechanical analysis is significantly sensitive to the accuracy of in-situ stresses in the reservoir  consequently, knowledge of in-situ stresses is critical for accurate prediction of reservoir response under various loading conditions  on the other hand, field measurement of in-situ stresses via fracturing tests during the life of reservoir reveal that the far field stresses change as the reservoir becomes increasingly depleted due to stress and pore pressure coupling (teufel, 1991; tuefel et al , 1996; addis, 1997; wu and addis, 1998; santarelli et al , 1998; hettema, 2000; chan and zoback , 2002)  zoback (2007) pointed out that fracture initiation pressure (fip) during a leak-off test is a strong function of in-situ stresses and also the fracture propagation pressure (fpp) is very close to the minimum horizontal stress  this implies that any changes of in-situ stresses will alter the fracture initiation pressure and fracture propagation pressure  specifically, in oil and gas drilling industry, the changes in fracture pressure significantly affects the safe drilling margin and therefore improper design of mud weight without taking into account the changes of in-situ stresses will lead to loss circulation of drilling fluid and increasing non-productive-time (npt) of drilling operation  this is of special importance in deep-water wells, which the fracture pressure of reservoir is low even prior to depletion  moreover, induced stress changes during production from or injection into reservoirs may cause sand production, casing collapse, compaction and subsidence, and reactivation of pre-existing faults and induced-seismicity (segall, 1985, 1989; morita et al , 1989; santarelli et al , 1998; hettema, 2000; hillis, 2001; holt et al , 2004; lynch et al, 2013; rafieepour et al, 2015, 2017)  the earlier analytical solutions were based on the theory of poroelasticity  for example, aadnoy (1991) developed the following equation for the horizontal stress change as a function of pore pressure  (equation)  this equation was obtained based on uniaxial strain assumption and relates the stress path to the poisson's ratio and biot-willis coefficient  consequently, the fracture initiation pressure after depletion changes as follows  (equation)  similar derivations were developed by addis (1997a) for transversely isotropic and shahri et al  (2013) for orthotropic materials | 
2017-0419 	 experimental investigation on wettability of karamay oil sand under various differential pressures |abstract: fluid injection has become a common practice to improve reservoir performance of ultra-heavy oil sand reservoirs in the karamay, northwest china  at present, a lack of understanding of the wettability of the oil sands precludes the engineers from characterizing the efficiency of fluid injection in water or steam-flood practices  in this regard, experiments including x-ray diffraction (xrd), scanning electron microscopy (sem), contact angle and nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) tests were conducted on specimens sampled from field-collected oil sand cores  three specimens prepared with pressure values at 0, 1 and 2mpa were tested for their nmr responses and contact angles  the nmr experiments were carried out to obtain the transverse relaxation time (t2) curve of the specimens in order to analyze the nature of the liquid with which the solid grains are in contact with  the contact angle tests were to examine the water film formation on the grain and bitumen surfaces  it was found that the karamay oil sand tends to be water-wet under water injection practices  moreover, as the differential pressure increases, the extent of wetting strengthens in terms of having more water enter the pores of multiple scales and forming thicker water films on the grain surfaces   1  introduction  wettability can influence a variety of important reservoir properties such as relative permeability and residual oil saturation, therefore have a significant impact on the ultimate heavy oil recovery  at present, water (brine) injection has been frequently adopted in field practices to stimulate the reservoir in order to improve its performance during the subsequent stages (yuan et al  2011a&b, yuan et al  2013, zhang et al  2016, lin et al  2016&2017)  the efficiency of injection is especially dependent on the wettability of the oil sand   the investigation on the wettability of oil sand is different from the corresponding research in shale or sandstone because of their differences in mineralogical composition  specially, heavy oil (bitumen) acts as cement in an oil sand matrix rather than merely occupying the pore space  for this reason, the oil sand matrix was examined in this study on its wettability using oil sand cylindrical specimens saturated with brine | 
2017-0424 	 rapid and inverse determination of joint normal stiffness based on wave propagation theory |abstract: how to rapidly and accurately determine joint normal stiffness in rock mass is an important issue in rock engineering  in this work, a new method, i e , the rapid evaluation method, was introduced to determine the normal stiffness of joints  this method was derived from one-dimensional compressional wave propagation theory  the effect of joints on wave propagation is modelled by displacement discontinuity model as a boundary condition in solving wave equations  together with input parameters from laboratory or field ultrasonic tests, joint normal stiffness was inversely determined  direct measurements of joint normal stiffness were performed from uniaxial compression tests  the joint normal stiffness predicted by the rapid evaluation method was then compared with that from direct laboratory measurements  the results show that joint stiffness determined from the rapid evaluation method agreed with their corresponding experimental values, which confirms that this proposed method is valid and feasible   1  introduction  joints, which distribute widely and range in a variety of size in rock mass, have a significant impact on the mechanical and seismic behaviors of rock mass  the joint normal stiffness, one of vital mechanical properties of rock joints, is equal to the axial stress divided by the corresponding deformation of joint  determining joint normal stiffness is significant in applied geophysics, rock mechanics, and earthquake engineering   so far, a large number of researchers have proposed different methods to calculate the normal stiffness of joints from different aspects  after summarizing these methods, we found they can be classified into two main categories  the first category is laboratory or field measurement (goodman 1976; olsson and barton, 2001)  although accurate normal stiffness of joints can be acquired from laboratory or field tests, this method can damage rock mass irreversibly and sampling process to obtain highly qualified jointed rock samples is not an easy job  the second one is empirical estimation according to joint characteristics (barton, 1976; bandis et al , 1983; jaeger et al , 2007)  the drawback of the second method is that it greatly depends on professional skill of geologists and civil engineers | 
2017-0427 	 study on the influence of drilling fluid on hard-brittle shale strength characteristics based on fractal theory |abstract: drilling fluids will affect the hard-brittle shale strength characteristics  fractal theory has a unique advantage in studying the microstructure of rocks, which can be used to study the influence of drilling fluid on shale strength characteristics  shale samples obtained from western south china sea field have been tested using x-ray diffraction (xrd) tests, nitrogen adsorption (na) tests, scanning electron microscope (sem) tests, uniaxial compressive strength tests to study the impact of drilling fluid on shale  the results indicate the total porosity along with the percentage of micro-pores increased, and the calculated fractal dimension increased as follow, meanwhile uniaxial compressive strength gradually reduced due to immersing shale  at the same time, the sem results show that the number and size of micro-cracks increased and more corrosion holes appeared  shown by the experimental results, the fractal dimension is positively correlated with the micro-cracks and inversely correlated with shale uniaxial compressive strength  accordingly, the drilling fluid formulation is optimized to lower the fractal dimension of shale, by which the decrease in shale rock strength is significantly lowered   1  introduction  with the rapid development of the world economy, the oil and gas resources demand increase significantly  however, the scale of the land resources discovered gradually is reducing, and the difficulty of the land resources explored gradually is magnifying  so the industry focuses on the offshore resources  nevertheless, successful and sustainable development of the offshore reservoir is still faced with a set of drilling and operational challenges [1]  the oil and gas reserves are of high abundance in the western south china sea fields  when drilling through hard-brittle shale formation of great depth, the drilling cost will be significantly increased because of frequent and complicated downhole situations such as the sticking and wellbore breakout [2]  after the long time immersing in the drilling fluid, the physical and chemical properties of shale formations must be changed to some extent, thus may be affecting the shale strength characteristics  the contents of mineral components and the microstructure greatly influence the shale strength characteristics [3]  drilling fluid can invade along with a fracture network into formation, and can increase pore pressure of the fracture network to form a local high pressure zone  at the same time, drilling fluids require to maintain an alkaline condition to enhance the emulsion stability  however, alkali can corrode clay minerals and quartz [4], which plays significant roles in triggering fracture generation and propagation, and wellbore instability | 
2017-0428 	 development of new correlation of unconfined compressive strength for carbonate reservoir using artificial intelligence techniques |abstract: unconfined compressive strength (ucs) is the key parameter to; estimate the in situ stresses of the rock, alleviate drilling problems, design optimal fracture geometry and to predict optimum mud weight  retrieving reservoir rock samples throughout the depth of the reservoir section and performing laboratory tests on them are extremely expensive as well as time consuming  therefore, mostly ucs predicted from empirical correlations  most of the empirical correlations for ucs prediction are based on elastic parameters or on compressional wave velocity  these correlations were developed using linear or non-linear regression techniques  this paper presents a rigorous empirical correlation based on the weights and biases of artificial neural network to predict ucs  the testing of new correlation on real field data gave a less error between actual and predicted data, suggesting that the proposed correlation is very robust and accurate  therefore, the developed correlation can serve as handy tool to help geo-mechanical engineers in order to determine the ucs   1  introduction  ucs defines the strength of the rock when subjected to uniaxial loading  under unconfined conditions, it is the maximum axial compressive stress that a perfectly right-cylindrical sample of material can withstand  ucs has been used widely in petroleum industry to estimate the in-situ stresses of the rock, to make geo-mechanical earth model, to optimize of rate of penetration in drilling and to design optimal hydraulic fracture parameters in production (gatens et al , 1990)  accurate prediction of ucs can avoid severe drilling problems which includes well bore collapse, hole pack off, sand production and tight holes (khaksar et al , 2009)   ucs can be determined by means of static methods  these methods are uniaxial and tri-axial compressional tests, which are conducted on a right cylindrical cores retrieved from the depth of the interest  these tests measure the deformation of rock sample by the application of known force (barree et al , 2009)  the stress-strain deformation curves are generated from these tests  these curves are traced and analyzed to obtain ucs as well as elastic parameters (jaegar et al , 2007) | 
2017-0429 	 optimization of rate of penetration using artificial intelligent techniques |abstract: rate of penetration (rop) is defined as the volume of rock removed per unit area (ft) per unit time (hrs)  there are several published models to predict the rate of penetration; however, most of them focus on drilling parameters such as: string revolutions per minute, weight on bit, pumping rate  only few researchers focused on the effect of mud properties and their influence on the rate of penetration values using few or little data  the objective of this paper is to develop a new model to predict the rop based on both the drilling parameters and mud properties using artificial intelligent techniques (ann)  actual field measurements of more than 3333 data points of different parameters were used to build an empirical rop model  the obtained results showed that ann model can be used to predict the rop with a high accuracy (correlation coefficient of 0 99 and an average absolute percentage error of 5 6%)  it is very important to combine both the mechanical parameters and the drilling fluid properties to predict the rop  the developed ann model for estimating the rop outperformed all of the previous available correlations   1  introduction  rate of penetration (rop) is defined as the volume of rock removed per unit area (ft) per unit time (hrs)  it also can be referred as the speed of breaking the rock under the bit  in general, it measures the speed or the progress of the bit when it drills the formation (bourgoyne and millheim, 1986)  faster rop values are always consider good signs since they result in faster delivery of the well and thus saving time and money  however, too fast rop may result in hole problems and poor hole cleaning that can extend the duration of well delivery and introduce much more complications such as losing part of the bha in the hole due to formation instability and collapse (akgun, 2002) | 
2017-0430 	 assessing stress conditions for coast range tunnels in british columbia |abstract: despite the significance of in situ stresses in geotechnical engineering, they are often not well defined due to (1) insufficient reliable stress data, which can be due to a lack of measurements and/or the uncertainties/errors associated with the measurement methods employed, and (2) natural variability in the in situ stresses due to the anisotropic and heterogeneous nature of the geology  this is especially true in the coast range mountains of western british columbia in canada, where a number of tunnels have been planned for the coming years  this paper aims to provide guidance for the determination of in situ stress conditions in this complex environment through an assessment of the applicability of existing in situ stress methods and a review of previous project experience  the geological history of the area is presented to provide insight into the broad tectonic domain and allows general conclusions to be drawn regarding the state of stress in the region   1  introduction  the in situ stress magnitude and orientation are critical engineering parameters for evaluating the short and long term behaviour of an underground excavation  these parameters not only define the induced stresses around the excavation, but also have a significant impact on rockmass characterization and establishing probable failure mechanisms (either structurally or stress controlled)  by understanding the in situ stress conditions, the expected extent of failure can also be assessed through analytical or numerical analysis techniques, which plays an important role in selecting an appropriate excavation orientation, excavation method and ground support system   observations from existing tunnels in the coast range mountains (shown in figure 1) have illustrated the importance of considering in situ stress primarily for two design cases: (1) for assessing the effects of relatively high in situ stress on ground stabilization during excavation, and (2) for assessing the extent of steel lining for hydraulic pressure tunnels  case 1 is dominated by high stresses while case 2 is dominated by low stresses  this paper focuses on case 1 although some insight into case 2 is also provided | 
2017-0433 	 an experimental study to investigate the effect of mineral composition on mechanical properties of shale gas formations |abstract: hydraulic fracturing is well-known stimulation technique to extract unconventional shale gas  this technique is however highly dependent on the mechanical properties of the shale reservoir that is expected to be significantly varied with their rocks’ mineral composition  this study has therefore been aimed to examine the effect of various rock minerals on mechanical properties of shale formations through conducting a comprehensive experimental program  in order to replicate the composition of shales found in different regions, reconstituted specimens were produced from powdered minerals (quartz, feldspar, calcite, dolomite and kaolinite) with different compositions  reconstituted specimens were tested for unconfined compressive strength (ucs) and splitting tensile strength after curing for 14 days  38mm diameter and 76mm length specimens were used for the ucs tests, and 19mm diameter and 38mm length specimens were used for the splitting tensile strength  findings from this study indicate increasing trend of ucs with the increasing of kaolinite and calcite percentages  same kind of relationship was observed for the splitting tensile strength as well  moreover, results show an increasing trend of ucs with increasing density  interestingly, results indicate a decreasing trend of ucs with the increasing of quartz percentage, which was not expected in this study   1  introduction  with increasing demand for energy, the need for better alternative solutions to conventional fossil fuels has arisen  in the united states (us), there has been a recent surge in the amount of natural gas extracted from shale gas plays  this can be attributed to the rapid advancement in hydraulic fracturing or ‘fracking’ technologies   hydraulic fracturing has been developed as a means to efficiently release the natural gas trapped within an almost impermeable reservoir rocks (approximately 10-1000<u+03bc>d) (miller et al, 2011)  hydraulic fracturing involves initially drilling vertically until a shale gas reservoir is reached at approximately 1-5km, at that point, the well is turned and horizontal drilling takes place  once the well is in place, and surrounding aquifers have been sufficiently protected using well casing, hydraulic fracturing can begin  hydraulic fracturing begins with injecting a ‘fracturing fluid’ at high pressures into the horizontal well  this causes the shale to break and form a network of fractures  in most cases, the fracture network created greatly increases the permeability of the shale formations, promoting the flow of gas  the gas is then able to diffuse into the wellbore, once the fracking fluid is pumped back to the surface (wanniarachchi, 2017)  the fracking fluid consists of a liquid, gas, foam or energized fluid that is mixed with ‘proppants’ such as sand, bauxite or ceramic which is used to hold fractures opened even after releasing the fracturing pressure, as well as chemical additives which enhance the efficiency of the fracturing process  the gas is then allowed to diffuse into the wellbore, which is then extracted and processed | 
2017-0437 	 micromechanical modeling of rate and state frictional behavior of fault using the discrete element method |abstract: in this study, we use the discrete element method (dem) to numerically simulate the micromechanics of frictional behavior of faults  although fault zone widths can be tens of meters, the principal slip occurs within localized zones having widths of a few millimeters  fault slip analysis is complicated by uncertainties in slip mechanics  depending on rate and state of slip, the system can undergo weakening or strengthening, however the details of the underlying mechanisms remain uncertain  the dem can provide a robust modeling tool to capture many micromechanical features present within these fault slip zones that are beyond observation in physical experiments  in this work, we investigated the origin of the rate and state effects under various boundary conditions aiming to improve the representation of rate and state effects in larger-scale continuum analysis  primary subject of this study is the relationship between stresses occurring at the particle scale and the constitutive response assumed in macro scale analyses   1  introduction  observations have suggested that slip in faults, spanning tens of meter in length, can be extremely localized, occurring in a zone with a thickness of 1 to 5 mm (rice, 2006)  studying this phenomenon has been commonly performed by understanding of macroscopic frictional properties and developing rate and state friction laws based on experimental observations (lapusta, 2001)  from these observations, the system can undergo strengthening or weakening depending on the rate and state effects on the system  although these effects are small compared to the frictional strength of the system, they are very important in understanding the physical and mathematical properties in frictional sliding (lapusta, 2001)  rice et al  (2014) used linearized stability analysis to study the extreme strain localizations and relate this to dilatancy and rate strengthening friction   in this work, a micromechanical model is developed using the discrete element method (dem) to capture the micromechanics involved in slip  earlier work had been done using a two-dimensional (2d) dem to model the rate and state effects of frictional sliding of granular fault gorge (morgan, 2004)  also, modeling efforts have been performed in the area of gravitational volcanic deformation due to friction (morgan, 2005)  in this work, the three-dimensional (3d) dem model is used to show how a system of plane-aligned particles can be used to model the slip characteristics observed from experimental data  the present dem model extends the previous published work using the 3d dem and provide further insight into micromechanics of the rate and state slip behavior | 
2017-0439 	 modelling the evolution of a fracture network under excavation-induced unloading and seepage effects based on a fully coupled fluid-solid simulation |abstract: in order to assess the dynamic, coupled geomechanical and hydraulic response of a highly fractured rock during/after excavation, it is important to quantify the changes in the connectivity and conductivity of the fracture system  the objective of the work is to explore the seepage effect on fracture network evolution during a tunnel excavation in a highly fractured rock mass based on fully coupled hydro-geomechanical modelling  an empirical joint constitutive model (jcm) that can capture the normal and shear behavior of rough fractures has been implemented in the combined finite-discrete element method (femdem) code ‘solidity’  solidity can simulate the deformability of matrix blocks, the interaction of pre-existing fractures, and the propagation of new cracks driven by mode i, mode ii or mixed mode brittle failure using nonlinear fracture mechanics in terms of a ‘smeared crack model’  the ‘jcm-solidity’ model is further coupled to the multiphase flow solver ‘ic-ferst’ which is based on a cv-fem formulation  this is achieved using a conservative mesh-to-mesh interpolation between solids and fluids, while forces are balanced using the novel ‘immersed body method’ for full two-way coupling  anisotropic adaptive mesh refinement is used in the coupled domain to capture the fracture characteristics throughout the simulation  thus, geomechanically-constrained hydraulically equivalent fracture apertures inform the local permeability for often highly refined fluids mesh elements within fractured regions of the porous rock mass, leak-off being automatically accommodated  fluid flow is solved over the entire domain which represents the fractured system, with underlying details from the solid model  coupled deformation, fracturing and flow processes can thus be captured by such a fully coupled solution scheme  1 introduction  tunnel construction in highly fractured, fluid saturated rock can often present hazards with potentially disastrous consequences  fractures often dominate the strength (hoek, 1983) and deformation properties (kachanov, 1992) of geological formations; interconnected fractures can serve as conduits or barriers for fluid and chemical migration in subsurface space (caine et al  1996; berkowitz 2002)  additionally, during the tunneling process, a draw-down of fluid level occurs as seepage flow towards the tunnel takes place (anagnostou, 1995)  groundwater discharge into the tunnel, facilitated through fractures and joints, can often lead to failure of the tunnel walls, rising costs of containment and draining, and potential environment hazard  the ability to understand the impact of the coupled processes in such applications is a challenging issue, and can greatly improve the evaluation of risk associated tunnel excavation | 
2017-0443 	 ductile behavior of thermally-fractured granite rocks |abstract: we investigate the time-dependent deformational properties of fractured rocks in order to evaluate the apparent creep behavior of such rocks and understand the relevant physical mechanisms responsible for such behavior  rocks surrounding subsurface structures and natural fault zones are densely fractured due to the damage induced by the stress concentrations around each structures  these abundant fractures may serve as independent slip planes within the rock, depending on its frictional properties and hydrothermal conditions, potentially allowing the bulk rock to behave apparently as a ductile medium  accurate prediction of such behavior may be crucial when assessing the long-term stability of these underground structures and the stress state around faults  we conducted triaxial creep experiments using thermally-fractured granite rocks  westerly granite samples were heated to a maximum temperature up to 600 degrees celsius to produce analogues of damaged crystalline rocks with varying degree of fracture densities  measured index properties of these rock samples and microstructure observations show that fracture densities were successfully varied according to the maximum temperature reached during heating  laboratory data shows that the samples exhibit substantial amount of time-dependent deformation when constant isotropic or anisotropic stresses are applied even under dry and room temperature conditions   1  introduction  underground openings are accompanied by rock mass with enhanced damage surrounding the structure known as excavation damage zones  upon excavation of the original rock formation, stress concentrations develop along the periphery of the opening at certain locations depending on the geometry, and some normal stresses are also released close to the opening due to the newly created free surface  such local perturbation in the stress state causes the failure of the surrounding rock mass by newly created fractures and opening of pre-existing fractures   damaged rock masses also develop by natural causes around fault structures  rock masses surrounding a fault accumulates damage as faults mature due to coalescence and interaction of micro-/macro-fractures, and stress concentrations occurring at fault tips (process zone), dynamic rupture fronts (pulverization), and geometrical irregularities (mitchell and faulkner, 2009)  micro- and macro-fracture densities decline with distance away from the fault and eventually become identical to the host rock (johri et al , 2014; mitchell and faulkner, 2009)  this damaged region is referred to as the damage zone as opposed to the fault core which comprise the very fault plane | 
2017-0444 	 application of a brittle failure model to assess roof stability in coal mine entries |abstract: stress-driven instability of roof rocks in coal mine entries can result in large roof falls with associated safety hazards  failure may be related to spalling, cutter formation, and delamination of bedding of the roof strata  the mode of failure is similar to failure of brittle rocks observed in hard rock environments  additionally, coal mine roof rocks and coal materials can exhibit brittle failure characteristics when tested in the laboratory  a brittle failure criterion that considers both extensional fracturing under low confinement as well as shear failure under increased confinement is applied in numerical models of coal mine entries  the results show that such models can replicate field-monitored rock mass deformations and depths of failure  the results further show that the predicted zone of extension failure resembles the “softening zone” that is described in coal mine roof support literature  the authors conclude that modeling the presence of a reduced strength extension failure zone produces a satisfactory simulation of rock response around coal mine entries   1  introduction  roof instability is a leading cause of injuries and fatalities in underground coal mines  each year more than 400 reportable roof-fall events occur in coal mines in the united states (msha, 2016)  improved understanding of the rock failure mechanics and development of methods to evaluate likely rock mass response for given geologic conditions can assist in designing ground support systems  observations of rock damage and roof failures in the bedded roof of coal mines demonstrate that brittle spalling and delamination of beds contribute to the onset and propagation of roof instability (hill 1986, gadde and peng 2005, hasenfus and su 2006)  the mode of rock failure is observed to be similar to the extension-type brittle fractures encountered in hard rock excavations under low confinement described by stacey (1980), martin et al  (1997), diederichs (2003), and others | 
2017-0447 	 an integrated approach to constrain in-situ stress field: comprehensive geomechanical analysis |abstract: the in-situ stress field could govern the mechanical response of a formation to drilling, stimulation, and depletion  therefore, the in-situ stresses are essential input parameters for all geomechanical analyses, regardless of the complexity of the problem  the determination of in-situ stresses should include both the magnitude and direction of all the principal stress components  an accurate estimation of the in-situ stress field is a prerequisite for a robust and reliable geomechanical analysis   in this work, an integrated approach is used to constrain both minimum and maximum horizontal stresses (including both magnitude and direction) by using the data from a single well  within the framework, the combination of fracture injection test and image log analysis is used to constrain and calibrate the in-situ stress components and minimize uncertainties   using the proposed workflow, a series of geomechanical analyses is performed to quantify the impact of in-situ stress uncertainty in geomechanical modeling and analysis used in different design applications  the geomechanical analyses include critically stressed fracture analysis, hydraulic fracture modeling (i e , near wellbore initiation and far-field propagation), and discrete fracture network reactivation (i e , induced micro-seismicity)   the analysis confirms that by using the integrated stress-field-determination approach, the uncertainty of in-situ stress magnitude and direction can be reduced and the reliability of geomechanical model predictions can be enhanced  the accurately constrained in-situ stress field could be utilized in different geomechanical models and analysis—including wellbore stability, hydraulic fracturing, wellbore placement, depletion-/injection-induced stress changes, and corresponding production forecast—to improve the overall efficiency of the field operations and development   1  introduction  during exploration, stimulation and production, in-situ stress field is routinely monitored, measured and used in the oil and gas industry  the in-situ stress field is composed of three principal components (vertical and two horizontal components)  the vertical stress is generated by the gravity of the overburden rock  the two horizontal components are caused by the poisson effect and poroelastic deformation of the confined formation upon the overburden loading acting on top of the target layer or zone  the tectonic forces acting on the perimeter of the formation could change and even make the in-situ stress condition more complex  as a result of the regional tectonic activities and reservoir heterogeneity, the magnitudes of the two horizontal components are usually unequal, the difference between which is termed as stress anisotropy in horizontal direction |

2017-0451 	 plugging and abandonment of oil and gas wells: a geomechanics perspective |abstract: at the end of field life, wells require permanent plugging and abandonment (p&a) as part of decommissioning activities  some uk fields developed in the 1970’s are reaching their end of field life, with uk industry estimates predicting well p&a costs over the next 30-40 years of 24 billion dollars  as well as the high financial cost, there is a significant hsse exposure to ensure safe and reliable p&a such that no escape of hydrocarbons is possible to the near surface environment   this paper discusses the role geomechanics has to play in potentially reducing well p&a costs, but also ensuring integrity of the wells and formations over long time scales  recent experience in the uk north sea has highlighted the requirement for detailed geomechanical knowledge of the field  we will focus on three key areas for geomechanical analysis  firstly, we discuss reservoir pressure re-charge and in-situ stress response, from simple pressure-depth plots to more complex 3-d numerical modelling of the stress changes in reservoirs and surrounding formations  an added level of complexity compared to ‘conventional’ geomechanical modelling is the ability to forward predict the reservoir pressure recharge over hundreds of years and the commensurate response of the in-situ stresses  secondly, as well as the modelling of stress changes over time, geomechanics has a key role to play in determining the opportunity of using shale creep deformation to create annular barriers in the place of cement  lastly, in some cases the preferred p&a design for a well is not possible due to well access issues which then requires cross-flow analysis linked with the geomechanical response of permeable formations  this approach is required for containment risk assessment and application of ‘as low as reasonably practicable’ (alarp) assessments for well and formation integrity  each of these subjects will be covered with field examples from the uk north sea which demonstrate the geomechanical workflows employed and the impact these have had on the business | 
2017-0453 	 shale creep data extrapolation: comparing different data fitting methods and its uncertainties |abstract: in unconventional reservoirs, where oil or gas is produced from ductile shales, understanding time-dependent geomechanical phenomena, like creep and stress relaxation, may be crucial for the successful development of a play  laboratory creep data is always limited in time and therefore a creep compliance function is needed to extrapolate laboratory findings and to model long-term behavior  |in this paper, we present a comparison of regression methods, using creep data of shale samples from the baltic basin, poland  creep data used for the analysis consists of three 72-hours-long tests and one two-week-long test  differential load was applied in steps, the last one lasted for 39 hours in case of shorter tests, and 303 hours for the longer test  in order to describe the uncertainty of every method, we fitted parts of the data of different lengths, and then extrapolated the fitted function to the entire time span of the data  |while self-similar functions such as the power-law and logarithmic function are useful for the relatively few parameters required to describe creep behavior, prony series give better fit to laboratory data by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude in least-squares sense  however, the caveat of the prony series is that the choice of retardation times is not necessarily unique  although prony series with different sets of retardation times may fit a data equally well, these may predict completely different results when extrapolated to larger times beyond the laboratory experiment  in this paper we investigated wide spectrum of retardation times, and the parameters obtained from inversion  |1  introduction |shales may have diverse lithological composition, compaction level, but their common feature is high clay content and very low permeability with relatively high porosity  time-dependent deformations, even at constant and small load, are caused by a delayed microstructural deterioration, known as cataclastic creep (fabre and pellet 2006)  also, clay platelets and grains may undergo sliding and rotation followed by aggregate deformation  these phenomena are slowed down by friction and thus appear viscous  creep is an inelastic phenomena, and often is neglected in reservoir analysis  the inverse of creep strain is stress relaxation  in bigger scale, when ductile shales are loaded tectonically, they exhibit instantaneous elastic response, followed by long-term stress relaxation  it can change significantly the in situ stress state in the reservoir | 
2017-0456 	 numerical study on bearing capacity characteristics of masonry platform structure for different stone thickness |abstract: many historic masonry structures exist that have collapsed due to deformation and failure of their foundation ground  it is hence strongly required to investigate the deterioration mechanisms and the rational restoration methods of these structures based on the geotechnical engineering  for example, a platform that consists of a man-made soil mound and masonry stones was constructed as the foundation of the monuments in the angkor ruins, which is a world cultural heritage in cambodia  in order to achieve the restoration securing structural stability, the bearing capacity characteristics of the masonry platform structure should be understood  in the present study, numerical experiment on the bearing capacity of the masonry platform structures with different stone thickness is carried out using the elasto-plastic nmm-dda (coupled numerical manifold method and discontinuous deformation analysis), one of the discontinuum-based numerical methods  since masonry structures and foundation ground are modelled using dda blocks and nmm elements, respectively in the nmm-dda, the interactive problems between soils (continua) and masonry stones (discontinua) can be suitably treated  from the simulation results, the differences of the ultimate bearing capacity and the failure mechanisms due to the structural conditions are compared and its mechanisms are also discussed   1  introduction  the angkor ruins, a world cultural heritage in cambodia, includes many masonry structures in danger of collapse due to geotechnical problems, such as uneven settlement of the foundation ground (see fig  1)  in order to select suitable restoration methods, stability evaluation considering the mechanical interaction between the masonry building (discontinuum) and the foundation ground (continuum) is required (jsa, 2005, nnricp, 2015)  especially, the bearing capacity characteristics of the foundation which consists of artificial soil embankment and masonry stones (fig  2), so-called ‘platform’ should be reflected in the design   in case of the foundation shown in fig  2, the weight of the upper structure is applied on the top stone and transmitted to both the masonry stones and man-made embankment of lower layers  since the mechanical behaviors of such composite structures are governed by the material nonlinearity of soil and the discontinuity of the masonry stones, it is difficult to solve the failure mechanism of the platform by theoretical method |

2017-0462 	 visual detection and model reconstruction for underwater topography and rock mass surface by using b-mode ultrasonic imaging device |abstract: rock mass surface and topographic bed under muddy water or in sediment-laden flow are often clouded by suspended or moving particles, which are hard to be detected for real-time analysis and visual observation for many actual geotechnical engineering projects  in this paper, a novel method is described for the visual detection and model reconstruction of underwater topography and rock mass surface by using b-mode ultrasonic imaging device  it automatically detects the imaging lines of topography and rock mass surface in the obtained ultrasonic images  these imaging lines are used to detect and reconstruct underwater topography and rock mass surface  experimental results show rock mass and topography surface can be clearly detected, and the error of visual detection and model reconstruction for surface can be less than 1 mm during our model testing  this method can effectively neglect the imaging interference of moving or suspended particles on the detection of rock surface under muddy water or in sediment-laden flow  with the advantages of fast speed, high accuracy and real time of b-mode ultrasonic imaging device, this method is an effective approach of visual detection and model reconstruction for underwater topography and rock mass surface   1  introduction  the accurate detection and model reconstruction for underwater topography and rock mass surface is vital for the research of sedimentation and rock geotechnical engineering  topographic meters, which use impedance and optoelectronic signaling principles [1], must contact underwater topographic surface  it may destroy the original local topography and result in a large measuring error  laser topographic meter and traditional acoustic detection method have high measuring precision when applied to model topography [2]  but these methods are unsuitable for underwater topography and rock mass surface under muddy flow because the flow is clouded with moving particles near the riverbed [3]   however, ultrasound imaging method can improve these problems [4]  in order to obtain the real-time ultrasonic image of underwater topography and rock mass surface, a b-mode ultrasonic imaging device is used in the river model experiment [5]  faced with these images obtained by b-mode ultrasonic imaging device, the imaging of sediment particles can be used to analyze suspended sediment concentration [6], particle velocity [7] and flow field [8]  the imaging of submerged terrain can be used to observe the change process of sediment movement [9-11] and help the understanding of riverbed evolution [12-13]  the knowledge of ultrasonic imaging features in sediment-laden flow or muddy water is fundamental for the application of b-mode ultrasonic imaging device in the hydraulic engineering model test | 
2017-0468 	 core analysis workflow for evaluation of geomechanical heterogeneity and anisotropy in an oligocene shale from the gulf of mexico |abstract: in this paper, we report on a scoping study that was prompted by operational issues through an oligocene smectite-rich shale that involved changes in borehole inclination with respect to the bedding  a core characterization workflow is used to specifically probe geomechanical heterogeneity and anisotropy for static and dynamic elastic properties as well as failure strength  initial petrophysical scanning of the core surface provides a first indication of existing heterogeneity for properties of interest and assists in devising an efficient sampling strategy  over the three-foot section analyzed, and despite its apparent homogeneity, the core exhibits a two-fold variation in reduced young’s modulus between softer and stiffer zones, which is tied to slight changes in carbonate content  confined elastic and mechanical measurements reveal strength anisotropy of the order of 20% and p-wave and s-wave velocity anisotropies of about 20% and 30%, respectively  moreover, testing shows that the shale is weakest at oblique angle to the bedding due to weak bed parallel surfaces which activate when favorably oriented  these results suggest that anisotropy and heterogeneity both need to be accounted for in borehole stability models involving smectite-rich material   1  introduction  accurate wellbore stability prediction in geomechanically unstable formations requires thorough understanding of the drilled rock properties  this includes the ability to predict failure in deviated wells associated with bedding heterogeneity or to better assess the relationship between intrinsic elastic properties and stress/strain boundary conditions for e g  in situ stress computations and log-based geomechanical forecasting   this paper presents a geomechanical core analysis workflow that includes petrophysical core scanning for heterogeneity assessment and sample picking, as well as geomechanical testing for anisotropic static/dynamic elastic properties and strength  in particular, the petrophysical scanning includes a mechanical probe called the impulse hammer which functions by analyzing the force-time function of a hardened steel sphere mounted on an accelerometer dropped on the surface of the rock  this analysis produces a reduced young’s modulus at a resolution on the order of the millimeter revealing fine scale heterogeneity  using the profiles obtained during petrophysical scanning, locations of interest can be chosen for further geomechanical evaluation on plugs | 
2017-0469 	 experimental study of the influence of joint geometric configurations on the dynamic properties of intermittent jointed rock models under cyclic uniaxial compression |abstract: understanding the dynamic mechanical properties of jointed rocks is beneficial for the rational design and stability analysis of rock engineering projects  this study experimentally investigated the influences of joint geometrical parameters on the dynamic fatigue mechanism of jointed rock models using the synthetic materials with artificially intermittent joints  our results revealed that the dynamic fatigue stress-strain curve of jointed rock is dominated by its static uniaxial curve; the terminal failure strain in dynamic fatigue curve is equal to the post-peak strain corresponding to the maximum cyclic stress in the static stress-strain curve  the studied four joint geometrical parameters significantly affect the dynamic properties, including the energy evolution, the damage variable and the crack coalescence pattern  the higher the geometrical parameter, the higher the fatigue damage accumulates in the first few cycles, and the lower the fatigue life  two basic micro-cracks, i e , tensile wing crack and shear crack, are observed in dynamic cyclic tests, which are controlled principally by joint dip angle and persistency  in general, shear cracks only occur in jointed rocks with high dip angle or high persistency, and these jointed rocks are associated with the low fatigue strength, the large damage variable and the low fatigue life   1  introduction  rock engineering structures, such as underground tunnels, dam foundations and bridge abutments, are likely to be subjected to dynamic cyclic loadings resulting from earthquakes, rock blasting, rock bursts, etc  widely existing in these rock structures, intermittent jointed rocks are most sensitive to cyclic loading conditions and the joints play a controlling role in the overall stability of rock engineering  a comprehensive understanding of the dynamic mechanical response of intermittent jointed rocks subjected to cyclic loadings is beneficial for the stability analysis and rational design of rock structures   most studies in the literature have been focused on the dynamic properties of intact rocks under cyclic loadings  a hysteresis of the stress-strain curve and an accumulative dynamic deformation were revealed via laboratory tests (burdine, 1963; attewell and farmer, 1973; ray et al , 1999)  researchers also investigated the fatigue strength and deformation of intact rocks  they reported that both the dynamic strength and elastic modulus decrease exponentially with increasing cycles (bagde and petros, 2005a, b; fuenkajorn and phueakphum, 2010)  in addition, the dynamic energy characteristic of intact rocks under cyclic loadings has been investigated (hua and you, 2001; bagde and petros, 2009; momeni et al , 2015), and meng et al  (2016) further indicated that the fatigue failure of the intact rocks occurs once the elastic energy reaches its storage limitation  to determine an ideal damage variable for describing the actual evolution of fatigue damage, xiao et al  (2009, 2010) assessed six definition methods of damage variable and proposed an inverted-s shape nonlinear model for fatigue damage of intact rocks  similarly, an obvious three-stage evolution for the accumulative fatigue damage of intact granite was observed by momeni et al  (2015) | 
2017-0470 	 a method to estimate the energy distribution during the confined comminution of granular materials |abstract: during the confined comminution of granular materials, the work input is transformed into elastic energy stored in the grains, breakage energy used to generate new surfaces, energy dissipated by friction between grains in contact, and redistribution energy dissipated by the relative movement of crushed fragments  we assume that the expression of particle size distribution (psd) in a crushed sample is a function of a fractal distribution and a uniform distribution  this allows calculating the breakage parameter, the increase of surface energy, and finally the energy dissipated by breakage  by summing the contact energy at all the contacts within a sample, we calculate the elastic energy stored  the calculation of friction-dissipated energy requires calculating relative movements of contacts, which are highly unpredictable especially when crushing is involved  thus we include the dissipation that results from the relative displacement of grains in contact (including both crushed fragments and surrounding intact grains) in the friction-dissipated energy  we obtain the friction-dissipated energy by subtracting the elastic energy stored in the grains and the breakage energy from the input energy  the results show that the energy distribution is stress sensitive and changes a lot with the increase of compressive stress  energy dissipation by friction plays a major role during confined comminution   1  introduction  quasi-static confined comminution is a mechanical process in which particle sizes decrease due to high compressive stress  this method is encountered in civil engineering, powder technology and the mineral industry  during this comminution, the total input energy (<u+03b4>w) at the boundary is transformed into elastic energy stored in grains, breakage energy, friction energy and redistribution energy - the dissipation of the kinetic energy triggered by crushing (mcdowell, 1996; nguyen and einav,2009; russell and einav, 2013)  the complete energy balance equation is given by (russell, 2011):  (equation)  where <u+03b4><u+03a8>, <u+03b4><u+03a6>p, <u+03b4><u+03a6>s and <u+03b4><u+03a6>redist represent elastic energy, friction dissipation, breakage energy and redistribution energy, respectively |

2017-0478 	 geomechanical risk analysis for geologic carbon sequestration |abstract: geologic carbon storage (gcs) is likely to be an important part of any comprehensive strategy to mitigate global climate change  the objective of this study is to quantify the effect of rock mechanical on the risk of induced seismicity  as pore pressure increases in a storage reservoir, the state of stress in both the reservoir and surrounding formations is altered  conventional analytical solutions used to predict the reservoir stress path assume that deformation occurs only in the vertical direction  several studies have shown that this is a good assumption if the lateral extent of the pressurized region is much greater than the vertical extent and the shear modulus of the reservoir and cap rock are similar  these results assumed a spatially uniform pore pressure, which is not realistic for most cases  a new coupled simulator was used to parametrically study these effects  the results indicate that the conventional uniaxial strain assumption predicts smaller changes in stress than are predicted by the coupled model  this means that the uniaxial strain assumption is not conservative from the perspective of induced seismicity and other geomechanical risk factors  it is also shown that, for the cases studied, a higher caprock shear modulus produces smaller reductions in horizontal effective stresses, which would indicate a smaller risk of induced seismicity in normal faulting and strike-slip regimes   1 introduction  subsurface reservoirs are believed to be capable of safely storing hundreds of years’ worth of anthropogenic co2  potential subsurface storage reservoirs that have been proposed include depleted petroleum reservoirs, saline aquifers, un-minable coal seams, and basalt formations  in nearly all cases, storing co2 in these formations will cause increases in pore pressures and associated changes in stresses that have the potential to cause several negative impacts, including induced seismicity and damage to the sealing capacity of overlying formations   for geologic carbon storage (gcs) to become widely employed, methods must be developed to assess and manage the risks associated with these potential impacts  to assess these risks it is necessary to estimate the initial state of stress, and how the stresses will evolve over time during and after active injection | 
2017-0479 	 the possibility of infrared camera thermography for assessing the real-time stability of tunnels against rockburst |abstract: rockbursts under high stress environment is of prime concerns during underground excavations  infrared camera thermography could be of some value for assessing hot spots at the excavation face, which may result in pop-ups, spalling or rockbursting  the authors undertook an experimental and monitoring program on the possibility of the utilization of the infrared camera thermography (irct) for assessing the real-time stability of underground excavations  first, a series of laboratory tests on rock specimens and large rock blocks having a circular hole are tested under compression environment in relation to the deformation and rupture processes  later, some observations were carried out at the excavation face of taru-toge tunnel before, during and after blasting operation in relation to assess the real-time stability of the excavation face  the authors present the outcomes of this unique experimental and monitoring program for real-time stability assessments of underground excavations and discuss their implications in actual applications   1  introduction  stability problems such as rockburst under high stress environment are of prime concerns during underground excavations  aydan and his group performed a series of tests on minerals and rocks ranging from soft to hard, which showed distinct heat releases before the rupture (aydan et al  2014, 2015)  this fact implied that infrared camera thermography should be of some value for assessing hot spots at the excavation face, which may result in pop-ups, spalling or rockbursting   the authors undertook an experimental and monitoring program on the possibility of the utilization of the infrared camera thermography (irct) for assessing the real-time stability of underground excavations  first, a series of laboratory tests on rock specimens and large rock blocks having a circular hole are tested under compression environment in relation to the deformation and rupture processes  later, some observations were carried out at the excavation face of taru-toge tunnel before, during and after blasting operation in relation to assess the real-time stability of the excavation face  the authors present the outcomes of this unique experimental and monitoring program for real-time stability assessments of underground excavations and discuss their implications in actual applications | 
2017-0483 	 a study on ultrasonic wave propagation across fractures in jointed rocks |abstract: the effect of joints on wave propagation in rocks has always been a matter of concern with regard to their transmission and attenuation characteristics  experimental studies are conducted to analyze the wave attenuation characteristics in single and parallel fractures at varying angles considering non welded interfaces in rocks  after validation with the ultrasonic pulse velocity tests, numerical models using udec were developed to simulate the wave propagation in jointed rocks  the numerical study was extended for multiple fractures over a range of ultra sonic frequencies  the effect of the fracture angle and number of cracks on the transmitted p wave velocity and corresponding travel time ratio were investigated  this study was conducted on blocks of artificially prepared rock specimens casted with gypsum plaster, introducing artificial joints at various angles  the variation in p wave velocity and travel time ratio for different joint angles and multiple joints have been studied   1  introduction  the propagation of waves through jointed medium is always under focus due to its various applications and implications<u+2025> wave propagation through rock joints have been studied as the effect caused by the waves on the rock fractures as well as the effect of fractures on the attenuation pattern of the waves  the effect of wave depends on frequency and energy of the transmitted wave and the material properties of the rock  the knowledge on the attenuation pattern of waves across a fracture is very important for the safety of any rock engineering structure   the fundamental interest in the study of seismic wave through jointed rocks will depend on the transmission and reflection of stress waves across joints  this will determine the stress occurring on rock structures due to earthquakes, vibration or explosions  the studies regarding the attenuation of elastic waves across rocks that started very long ago, is still a subject of concern  miller (1977) pointed that a large part of the energy will be dissipated as frictional energy and that the frictional boundary stresses are non linear  miller (1977,1978) proposed that wave propagations are dependent on the ratio of amplitude of incident stress to frictional stress associated with the non-linear model  in the absence of kinematic interlocking, transmission is nearly complete for very low values of this stress ratio and reflection is nearly complete for high values  the relation of frequency on the seismic wave reflection, transmission and conversion across natural joint fractures were again emphasized by cook (1992), where a set of experiments lead him to correlate the theoretical analysis with his experimental results, by which specific stiffness and viscosities can be estimated from seismic reflections or from the change in amplitude and travel time of seismic waves transmitted across them  cai and zhao (2000) found that the magnitude of transmission coefficient depends on fracture spacing and number of fractures along with fracture stiffness and wave frequency<u+2025> the theoretical solution was based on displacement discontinuity model  the presence of multiple parallel fractures were studied in terms of spacing and number of fractures on the transmission coefficients which was confirmed using udec  it was found that transmission coefficients were independent of spacing length but were highly dependent on the number of fractures  the work was further extended by zhao et  al  (2006a,b) and a series of laboratory experiments were conducted to analyze the theoretical solution by cai and zhao (2000)  zhao et  al  (2008) had considered the effect of non linear deformable joints on p wave propagation across fractures using udec  li and pyrak-nolte (2010) analysed the effect of wave transmission on layered carbonate rocks  1 mhz signals were passed to find the effect of joint stiffness, number of layers and angle of incidence  they also considered the results of these for a single fracture with theoretical methods like displacement discontinuity method and transfer matrix method  eitzenberger (2012) described the effect of discontinuity on wave propagation to depend on roughness of surface, infill material, opening of discontinuity, thickness of infill, compressive strength of contact surface, normal and shear stiffness and water pressure and flow through the discontinuity using laboratory experiments and udec analysis  many theoretical correlations on transmission and attenuation coefficient has been studied extensively for its variation based on fracture specific stiffness and stress ratio as the major parameter  the transmission coefficient was found to increase as the fracture stiffness coefficient increased and was found to decrease as the fracture stiffness coefficient decreased  as for inclined angles schoenberg et  al  (1980), pyrak-nolte et  al  (1990b) gave theoretical relations on the transmission coefficient and reflection coefficient while zou et  al  2016 extended the theoretical solution by pyrak-nolte et al (1990b) to produce the difference in arrival time of p wave and s wave after transmission | 
2017-0486 	 an investigation into factors contributing to movement of a slow-moving rockslide at the revelstoke dam, british columbia |abstract: the marble shear block is a rockslide located between the spillway and tailrace on the right bank of the revelstoke dam, british columbia  the marble shear is a thin graphitic foliation shear that forms the base of the marble shear block  failure of the marble shear block could result in damage to the spillway and the tailrace area  the stability of the block was reassessed for higher piezometric pressures and the design seismic event  the geological model was updated using additional geological and piezometric information from recent site investigations  an extensive instrumentation data review found that piezometric pressures close to the head of the slide had increased; however, this did not result in corresponding increases in slope movement  instrumentation data showed that the 175 m high concrete dam moved downstream during reservoir filling and annually rocks back-and-forth due to thermal loading  the initial movement of the dam and this cyclic rocking motion was found to correlate with the movements observed in the marble shear block  a finite element analysis showed that the movements of the concrete dam causes displacements along the centimetre-thick marble shear (which forms a continuous feature from underneath the concrete dam to the marble shear block) and likely contributes to the downslope movement of the marble shear block  updated stability analyses also showed that the marble shear block is currently stable and is more sensitive to piezometric pressures at the toe of the slope than the head of the slope   1  introduction  the revelstoke dam is located on the columbia river, approximately 5 km upstream of the city or revelstoke, british columbia canada  the dam construction and reservoir filling was completed in 1984  the revelstoke dam consists of a concrete gravity dam in the columbia river canyon with a maximum height of 175 m and a zoned earthfill dam with a maximum height of 125 m (figures 1 and 2) | 
2017-0490 	 modelling fault movement triggered by fluid injection using cohesive zone method |abstract: in this paper we demonstrate our attempts to model fluid injection induced fault movement using the cohesive zone method (czm) within the framework of the finite element method (fem)  we build a concept model with stress state similar to that of western canadian sedimentary basin  in our concept model, a strike-slip fault is represented by a thin layer of cohesive elements  the constitutive equations of the cohesive elements are prescribed to represent the rheology of the fault  our benchmark test with changing stress states shows that our approach can effectively model the stick-slip process of an earthquake  we further apply this method on a transient test with the injection/extraction histories similar to a hydraulic fracturing operation  the simulation results show that the increase in pore pressure due to fluid injection leads to the reduction of the fault’s shear strength which is represented using a damage factor d in our model  the fault’s slip rate is highest while the bonding between two sides of the fault plane is being broken down  after the bonding is completely broken, the fault will continue to slip but at a smoother and slower rate   1  introduction  in the past decade, researchers have suggested that fluids injected into the subsurface during reservoir stimulation operations may perturb the in-situ state of stress sufficiently to re-activate the motion on the nearby faults (bachmann et al , 2012; ellsworth, 2013; mcgarr, 2014; zang et al , 2014)  the displacement along such faults, while small relative to major tectonic events, can produce swarms of small earthquakes and potentially results in property damage (lei et al , 2008; keranen et al , 2013)  this issue has been brought to broader attention with the increasing application of enhanced hydrocarbon recovery via hydraulic fracturing in low permeability reservoirs with clusters of low magnitude earthquakes occurring near some of the shale oil/gas plays across north america (davies et al , 2013; holland, 2013; schultz et al , 2015; skoumal et al , 2015; atkinson et al , 2016)  a great deal of effort has been expended on the monitoring and characterization of these earthquake swarms by industry, regulators and academia  semi-permanent broadband seismometers have been deployed in areas of interest to allow for more precise estimates of event locations, magnitudes and focal mechanisms (schultz and stern 2015; wang et al , 2016)  in some cases the induced events may be related to features in local geology (rutledge et al , 2004; schultz et al , 2016) or the stress regimes (zoback and hickman, 1982)  overall, there appears to be strong statistical evidence in some areas for a link between reservoir stimulation and induced seismicity | 
2017-0491 	 coupled fluid flow and geomechanical modeling for understanding the mechanisms of depletion-induced reservoir compaction and its impact on hydrocarbon production |abstract: the coupled fluid flow and geomechanical simulator tough-flac was employed to study the mechanisms of depletion-induced reservoir compaction and its impact on hydrocarbon gas production  for consideration of compaction-drive in the sequential coupling between fluid flow and geomechanics, we developed and applied a new alternative approach of linking volumetric strain to the fluid mass balance through a correction of rock compressibility in the fluid flow simulator  using this approach, we conducted model simulations for understanding the impact of porosity change on deformation and gas production, including sensitivity studies with regard to material properties and operation parameters for the optimization of gas production  the model simulations showed that the reservoir compaction can increase or decrease the gas recovery depending on the specific porosity and the permeability changes in the reservoir  this result shows that the interaction between fluid flow and geomechanics should be considered for optimal reservoir management and tough-flac with the implemented coupling approach can be an effective tool for such analysis   1  introduction  biogenic gases have become increasingly attractive targets of oil and gas exploration and production activities in the worldwide  however, production of the gases from poorly consolidated or unconsolidated soft sediments in shallow reservoirs can be technically challenging operations because of depletion-induced reservoir compaction  fluid production from such reservoirs and associated pressure drop may cause reservoir compaction and consequent surface subsidence (settari, 2002), potentially resulting in surface facility damage (mayunga, 1969), fault reactivation (segall, 1989, odonne et al , 1999), or wellbore instability (bruno, 1992, rutqvist et al , 2012)  pore collapse of weak sediments during compaction could drastically degrade reservoir quality by significantly reducing porosity and permeability  meanwhile, the reservoir compaction can maintain reservoir pressure being an important driving mechanism enhancing oil and gas production (compaction-drive)  therefore, understanding the mechanisms of and impact of reservoir compaction is essential for reservoir management and risk control  however, such interaction between fluid flow and geomechanics may not be properly handled with conventional reservoir simulators where compaction is calculated as a function of pore pressure only, while neglecting stress changes due to deformation | 
2017-0492 	 smart lost circulation materials for wellbore strengthening |abstract: lost circulation can be a very serious problem while drilling especially in naturally fractured formations  lost circulation may have serious safety consequences and heavy financial costs in the form of losing mud fluid to the fractures, wellbore stability issues and losing rig time while dealing with the problem  despite recent advances, lost circulation materials used in the field still have disadvantages such as plugging tools due to the large size of the particles, damaging production zones and failure to minimize lost circulation when heavy mud columns exists in the annulus  in this work, we introduce a new class of “smart lost circulation materials” to effectively seal the fractures and minimize lost circulation by increasing hoop stress  our smart lcms are made out of thermoset shape memory polymers which are activated upon exposure to the formation’s in situ temperature that causes expansion and acts as an effective seal for the fractures  the physical properties of our smart lost circulation materials prevent damage to production zones and tool plugging  in addition, the expansive property of the smart lcm provides compressional forces that strengthen the wellbore by artificially reducing the fracture gradient  we conducted a series of experiments using a hpht particle-plugging apparatus (ppa) to measure the sealing efficiency of the smart lcms  in addition, a fully coupled cfd-dem model is developed to further study the effectiveness of various particle size distributions and the corresponding stress release to improve the design of this product   1  introduction  one of the problems in rotary drilling is lost circulation  in order to transport cuttings and cool the bit, drilling fluids are supposed to be circulated down to the bottomhole and come back to the surface (white, 1956)  when lost circulation occurs, drilling fluids are lost  to stop further fluid loss, loss circulation materials (lcms) have to be added to the mud  this kind of incidents may have a heavy financial and environmental burden, which justifies the high price of lcm products  it would also increase the high cost of nonproductive rig time that is very valuable (whitfill and hemphill, 2003)  the us department of energy reported in 2010 that on average 10% to 20% of the cost of drilling high-pressure, high temperature wells is spent on mud losses  above all, lost circulation can lead to mud levels falling, which can cause an underbalance pressure state of the well  in severe cases, it may lead to a kick or even a blowout (arshad et al , 2014)  instances of lost circulation usually occur in cavernous, karst, highly permeable and naturally fractured formations (al-saba et al , 2014)  if lost-circulation zones are anticipated, preventive measures should be taken by treating the mud with loss of circulation materials (lcms) and preventive tests such as the formation integrity test should be performed to better define the mudweight window to limit the possibility of loss of circulation  hence, lost circulation is a very important issue which has led to a lot research dedicated to minimize its negative impacts and the biggest breakthrough has been lcms  they are designed to seal fractures and minimize mud loss  the seven categories of lcms classified by nygaard et al  (2014) are: fibrous, granular, flaky, acid/water soluble, mixture, high fluid loss lcm squeeze, swellable/hydratable lcm combinations and nanoparticles  each material varies in its chemical properties, flexibility, shape and the way they seal the fracture | 
2017-0494 	 dem investigation on the fracture mechanism of the cracked chevron notched semi-circular bend specimen |abstract: the cracked chevron notched semi-circular bending (ccnscb) method falls into a significant testing category of chevron notched specimens for measuring the mode i fracture toughness, of which the progressive fracture mechanism deserves to be further assessed  in this study, the discrete element method (dem) is adopted to depict the fracture processes of the ccnscb specimens considering different supporting spans and heterogeneity  our results demonstrate that the crack front of the ccnscb specimen with any loading condition is prominently curved, which violates the straight-through crack propagation assumption and may induce some errors in the fracture toughness measurements  the peak force of the ccnscb specimens evidently increase with decreased supporting span  for a relatively large span, the crack grows restrictively in the notched ligament, which conforms to the ideal assumption of the fracture process and contributes to an accurate measurement of the mode i fracture toughness  thus, a large supporting span is suggested for the semi-circular bend tests  in addition, the tanglesome weak elements distribution in the heterogeneous specimen can disturb stress distribution, and the more heterogeneous specimen corresponds to the lower peak force  this study calls for more attention on how to accurately determine the fracture toughness via chevron notched samples   1  introduction  rock fracture induced by various loadings is frequently encountered in engineering applications involving drilling, rock bursting, oil-well fracturing and tunneling, etc  these failure processes of rocks are affected by various fracture parameters, among which, rock fracture toughness, reflecting the capability of rocks to resist crack propagation, is regarded as a significant parameter  depending on the suffered stress experienced by the crack, a crack grows with the superposition of three basic failure modes (anderson, 2005)  for engineering rocks, the mode i (the opening or tension mode) fracture is frequently encountered  therefore, the studies on the mode i fracture toughness determination have attracted wide researches | 
2017-0496 	 real-time monitoring of heterogeneous fractures in rock: an experimental study |abstract: this study investigates the elastic anatomy of fractures in rock using full wavefield measurements  in this spirit, a 3-step experimental campaign is pursued in a laboratory setting, namely: (1) full-field ultrasonic testing of the intact rock, (2) fracturing, and (3) ultrasonic interrogation of the fractured rock  experiments are performed on a slab-like prismatic specimen of charcoal granite  the sample is illuminated under the plane stress condition, prior and posterior to fracturing, by a shear piezoelectric transducer at 10 and 30khz  the (in-plane) velocity response of the rock is monitored via the 3d scanning laser doppler vibrometer over a rectangular region in the fracture neighborhood  upon proper signal processing, (i) the maps of elastic modulus in the specimen (before and after fracturing) is computed via elastography, exposing the geometric and elastic properties of the process zone; (ii) the fracture geometry is reconstructed, and (iii) profiles of shear and normal specific stiffness at the fracture interface are identified   1  introduction  fracturing-induced damage in rock and its elastic attributes, namely: (i) the modified material properties in the damage zone and (ii) the heterogeneous contact condition at the fracture interface, are the subject of mounting interest in various aspects of geophysical science and technology including energy production from unconventional resources (gas/geothermal) (baird et al  2013, verdon and wustefeld 2013, taron and elsworth 2010), environmental protection (place et al  2014), seismology (mclaskey et al  2012), and mining (gu et al  1993)  the variation of elastic moduli in the damage zone may trigger aseismic slip along rock faults (calo’ et al , 2011)  furthermore, such non-uniform stress distribution gives rise to a heterogeneous elastic contact at the boundary of fractures and faults, that is often parametrized in terms of a distributed (shear and normal) specific stiffness, relating the contact traction to the jump in displacements across the interface (schoenberg, 1980)  the interfacial stiffness - strongly correlated with the surface roughness, static pre-stress and material properties of the bulk rock (and pore/interfacial fluid) (pyrak-nolte and morris 2000) - plays a critical role in the stability and strength of rock discontinuities, and controls the key characteristics of fracture networks in reservoirs  in particular, the inhomogeneous contact condition is responsible for the progressive failure along discontinuities that may occur well before the frictional resistance of the entire interface is surpassed (hedayat et  al , 2014; eberhardt et al , 2004)  moreover, the hydraulic properties e g  fluid conductivity of subsurface discontinuities is directly connected to the elastic nature of their interface (pyrak-nolte and nolte 2016)  therefore, a proper elastic representation of fractures in the continuum models of the subsurface may lead to better understanding of subterranean fluid flow e g  through the fractured reservoirs, and thus, enhance the (gas/geothermal) reservoir prognosis (pyrak-nolte and nolte 2016)  on the other hand, the marriage between such “enriched” models of discontinuity and active seismic imaging tools (pourahmadian et  al , 2015, 2016) opens a path forward for finding timely precursors of instability along rock faults  this work aims to decipher the elastic nature of fracturing in rock in a laboratory setting  in this spirit, a 3-step experimental campaign is designed by taking advantage of the 3d scanning laser doppler vibrometer (sldv) that is capable of monitoring triaxial particle velocity, with frequencies up to 1mhz, over the surface of rock specimens with 0 1mm spatial resolution and o(nm) displacement accuracy  full-field ultrasonic measurements are performed prior and posterior to fracturing the specimen which are then used to quantify (a) the variation of the sample’s elastic constants due to fracturing, and (b) the induced fracture geometry and its heterogeneous interfacial condition | 
2017-0500 	 application of mortar methods to subsidence computations |abstract: the mortar finite element method (mfem) significantly reduces the computational cost of subsidence computations by avoiding conforming cartesian meshes arising from the pay-zone (pz) towards its surroundings, where we may employ instead unstructured meshes to represent complex geological features correctly  there is thus an apparent necessity of having non-conforming interfaces between the reservoir (rs) and its surroundings  to glue these non-matching subdomain problems, we utilize mfem on curved 3-d boundaries represented by nurbs surfaces  we extend the approaches that we presented in arma papers 12-313 and 13-475  we decouple the mortar saddle-point problem (spp) using standard domain decomposition techniques to exploit current parallel machine architectures  we demonstrate that this approach is suitable for field level computations  we conduct detailed benchmarks between the conforming and non-conforming solutions to validate the procedure  examples involve coupling a continuous galerkin finite element program for mechanics with a slightly compressible single-phase code   1  background  hydrocarbon production or the injection of fluids in a rs can produce changes in the rock stresses and in-situ geomechanics, potentially leading to compaction and subsidence with harmful effects in wells, cap-rock, faults, and the surrounding environment as well  we require accurate simulations to predict these changes and their impact  in such cases, the flow simulation needs to be coupled to geomechanics, causing a significant increase in cpu time and memory requirements [1-7]   the mfem is a powerful technique to formulate a weak continuity condition at the interface of subdomains in which different meshes, i e  non-conforming or hybrid, are used  the method allows coupling elasticity and poroelasticity on various domains, which is a necessity in coupled flow and geomechanics  a short introduction to mfem, its historical development, and the classical references can be found in [1-3,8]   we presented in [9] a rs geometry reconstruction algorithm aimed to create conforming hexahedral meshes that are suitable for coupled flow and geomechanics  the technique exploits the rs’s geometrical simplicity to build a piecewise continuous representation using nurbs interpolation and translational surfaces; then transfinite interpolation is applied to generate hexahedral meshes  the resulting volume mesh extends the rs grid towards its surroundings, i e  over- (ovb) and under-burden (udb) and side-burdens  the success of the above algorithm suggests reconstructing the rs in the same way but allowing non-conforming meshes in different levels as shown in figure 1  we thus revised our algorithm in [10] to improve its performance and to allow different meshes in the ovb and udb respect to the pz level  this new approach reutilizes the surfaces that were employed initially, and it also alleviates the necessity of propagating tensor product meshes, from the pz, which increases the computational cost substantially  we present herein an mfem that glues these three non-matching subdomains, and it guarantees that displacements are continuous across the given interfaces that are nurbs surfaces  we solve the resulting spp to enforce continuity among the subdomains, and we also decouple it with the dirichlet-neumann (dn) domain decomposition method (ddm)  we include a brief description of the mfem, and we also comment about computing the mortar projector and its algorithms in pseudo-code  the results show that mfem can tackle problems of practical interest even at the field level | 
2017-0501 	 applications of model-order reduction to thermo-poroelasticity |abstract: coupled flow and geomechanics computations are highly complex and involve solving large nonlinear algebraic systems  such simulations are intense from both cpu time and memory resources, which strongly suggests employing model-order reduction (mor) techniques to speed up them  different types of reduced-order models (rom) have been proposed to alleviate this computational burden  mor approaches are based on projection  they first execute a computationally expensive “offline” stage, during which the full-order model (fom) is studied  upon creating a rom basis, the cheap “online” stage is then executed  our reduction strategy computes a reduced subspace using proper orthogonal decomposition (pod)  we calculate a family of solutions of the problem, for a suitable sample of input conditions, where every single result is so-called a “snapshot ” we then ensemble all snapshots together to determine a compressed subspace that spans the solution   usually, pod employs a fixed reduced subspace of global basis vectors  the usage of global basis is not convenient to tackle problems characterized by different physical regimes, parameter variations, or moving features such as discontinuities and fronts  having many snapshots to capture all these local features is unfeasible, which proposes seeking adaptive approaches based on a local basis  we thus develop an approach based on local pod basis to reduce geomechanics computations  we consider factors such as challenging variable boundary conditions and the role of the heterogeneity  preliminary 2- and 3-d results show significant compression ratios up to 90%  we formally compare fom and rom and provide timing data to demonstrate the speedup of the procedure  examples focus on linear and nonlinear thermo-poroelasticity  we employ continuous galerkin finite elements for most of the discretizations   1  background  coupled flow and geomechanics simulations are highly complex and involve solving nonlinear algebraic systems of millions of equations and unknowns  such simulations allow assessing reservoir compaction and subsidence with harmful effects in wells, cap-rock, faults, and the surrounding environment as well [1-3]  those numerical studies are intense from both cpu time and memory resources standpoint  this cpu burden strongly suggests employing mor techniques to perform simulations in real time that allow decision-making in a timely fashion  different types of rom have been proposed to alleviate this computational burden [4] | 
2017-0504 	 crack coalescence in rock-model materials through a frictional interface |abstract: prismatic specimens of gypsum containing two pre-existing open flaws and a frictional interface are tested under uniaxial compression  the specimens are 203 2mm high, 101 6mm wide, and 25 4mm thick  two flaws, with 0 1mm aperture and 12 7mm length, are placed through the thickness of the specimen  the flaws are inclined 30° from the horizontal  unbonded interfaces, inclined 10° from the horizontal, are created by casting the specimen in two parts  the first half of the specimen is cast against a pvc block with a face inclined 80° with respect to the vertical axis of the specimen  the second half is then cast against the first half  sandpaper attached to the pvc block provides different friction at the interface and, using a debonding agent, a cohesionless contact is obtained  in the experiments, digital image correlation (dic) is used to monitor crack initiation and propagation on the specimen surface by measuring displacements during loading  the experimental results indicate that specimens with the smooth interface have lower initiation and coalescence stresses than with the rough interface  also, a smooth interface seems to arrest tensile cracks reaching the interface, while shear cracks can cross it  this mechanism seems to favor crack coalescence through shear cracks when the flaws are separated by a smooth interface, rather than through tensile cracks, which is what happens when there is a rough interface   1  introduction  the presence of discontinuities, i e  fractures or cracks, plays an important role in rock mass behavior  failures of structures in rock such as tunnels and foundations commonly originate through pre-existing discontinuities or through new discontinuities created by the stress state imposed by the engineered structures   experimental research has been extensively conducted on pre-cracked brittle materials to investigate crack initiation, propagation and coalescence under compression (bobet and einstein, 1998; wong and chau, 2001; wong and einstein, 2007; park and bobet, 2010)  coalescence can be described as the linkage of pre-existing flaws through the propagation of tensile cracks and/or shear cracks (fig  1)  tensile cracks usually propagate in a stable manner following a curvilinear path that aligns with the most compressive load; their surfaces are clean and do not contain any pulverized material  in contrast to the tensile cracks, shear cracks are characterized by the presence of crushed material and powder in their surfaces, and usually propagate in a stable manner, at least initially  they, however, may become unstable near coalescence  shear cracks may be classified as quasi-coplanar or coplanar and oblique, depending on the angle of initiation with respect to the plane of the flaw from which they originate  coplanar cracks make an angle of 45° or less with the flaw plane, while oblique cracks make an angle higher than 45° | 
2017-0505 	 numerical simulation on hydraulic fracturing in the discrete-fracture- network reservoir with ddm and graph theory |abstract: natural fracture (nf) network is a hot topic in the developing of shale gas reservoir  a large computational resource is required to store the coordinates, intersects and paths of nf network  to increase the computational speed and save the computer memory, the nf network and created hydraulic fracture (hf) network are mapped into nf graph and hf graph respectively based on the graph theory  a modified displacement discontinuity method (ddm) is used to simulate the process of network fracturing  the hf networks are mainly affected by the nf networks, the in-situ stress and the fracturing parameters  the higher net-pressure leads to a wider but shorter band of the hf networks  the higher stress contrast leads to a longer but narrower band of hf networks  a dimensional parameter <u+03c8> is defined as the net-pressure over the stress contrast  as <u+03c8> increases, the stimulated reservoir volume (srv) tends to increase  the stress interaction among the hfs in the fractured medium is similar to that in the isotropic, homogeneous medium, but more complicated because of the influence of nf network  repelling behavior is observed in the simultaneous propagation of the multiple hfs   1  introduction  the nf network is an important tunnel for the oil and gas flowing in low permeability reservoir, such as shale oil and gas reservoir  the main purpose of the hydraulic fracturing technique in the shale gas reservoir is to create many hfs or connect numerous nfs (wu et al , 2012; zhang et al , 2015a)  however, the numerical simulation of hydraulic fracturing in the naturally fractured reservoir gives rise to at least two challenging problems: storing the information of complex fracture networks efficiently; modeling the mechanical behavior of hf precisely   a nf network with a random distribution in the reservoir is assumed in many recently articles (e g  olson and dahi-taleghani, 2009; ren et al , 2016)  actually, the nf network in the rock is usually connecting, intersecting with the other nf network  even though some papers used the discrete fracture network (mcclure, 2012; meyer and bazan, 2011) to simulate the fractured medium, they didn't mention any algorithm to store the full information of nf network  this paper imports the graph theory (wallis, 2000) from the discipline of computer science by storing the fracture network as a graph  the graph theory provides many approaches to capture the characteristics of the nf network, including the edge set, coordinate set, clustering coefficient, geodesic distance, et al  similar to the nf network, the hf network is also stored as a graph  when the hf propagates step by step, or even intersects with the nfs, it is stored as a growing graph  as the hydraulic fracturing goes on, the hf network grows from simplicity to complexity as well as the hf graph | 
2017-0510 	 modeling lost circulation and assessing enhanced propagation resistance by fracture sealing |abstract: lost circulation, a major challenge in well construction, is the loss of drilling fluid into formation caused by wellbore hydraulic fracturing  wellbore strengthening techniques can be applied to mitigate lost circulation by generating resistance to the growth of induced or natural fractures  in this paper, a fully coupled hydraulic fracture propagation model is presented to simulate lost circulation and wellbore strengthening  a near-wellbore stress analysis is performed to characterize wellbore mechanical responses during lost circulation  the analysis validates the hypothesis of hoop stress enhancement and emphasizes the impacts of poroelasticity involved in the stress enhancement  in addition, a novel approach integrating fracture resistance enhancement mechanism (i e , tip protection) into hydraulic fracturing simulation is introduced and is used to quantify fracture gradient enhancement for drilling operations  case studies are performed to assess different sealing conditions  results show remarkable declines of fracture fluid pressure across the sealant and substantial reduction of fluid loss into the fracture  case study concludes that fracture tip protection can be achieved through both fracture sealing and fracture fluid dissipation  some operational insights on wellbore strengthening design are also extracted from this study   1  introduction  drilling operations require maintaining both hydrostatic and equivalent circulating density of drilling fluid within the mud weight window (mww), which is bounded by a lower limit preventing fluid influx and wellbore instability and by an upper limit (i e , fracture gradient) avoiding wellbore fracturing  a narrow mww often arises in depleted formations where fluid production reduces the fracture gradient and when drilling extended-reach wells which possesses large wellbore pressure fluctuation  lost circulation is a major problem in drilling with a narrow mww  under the circumstances, fluid loss disturbs the normal downhole condition, causing consequent chain reactions (e g , underground blowout, unplanned casing point, etc )  thus, nonproductive time has to be taken to remedy the wellbore and in turn leads to excessive expenses toward well construction | 
2017-0515 	 bio-inspired fluid extraction model for reservoir rocks |abstract: biological and engineering flow systems maximize their efficiency by following the path of minimum energy over the domain they are embedded in  this fact motivates the present research, since industrial fluid extraction and injection processes are designed to minimize the implementation cost (energy, materials) and maximize the volume of fluid injected (or withdrawn)  this work presents a bio-inspired fluid flow model to optimize the path that connects resource-rich pores in a rock  we explain the commonalities between the equations governing flow in a porous medium and growth of slime mold, an organism that dynamically deploys tube-like structures and adapts them as a function of their contribution to the overall network  we perform several simulations to analyze the influence of the pore size distribution and of pore spatial distribution on the topology of the extraction network predicted by the slime mold growth algorithm  we discuss the suitability of the biomimicry model to design fracture patterns for optimal fluid extraction from a porous rock   1  introduction  what fracture network topology optimizes fluid flow in a rock mass? power laws and fractal dimensions govern most physical processes observed in nature  however, optimization algorithms that shape natural self-organization remain in many cases unknown  furthermore, engineering approaches rarely consider nature as a guide to improve human systems and very few attempts have been made to explain the fractal nature of the topology observed in many connectivity networks   the constructal theory (bejan & errera, 1997) is an optimization method for finite flow systems with configuration (e g , slenderness), in which a purpose (e g , heat collection) and constraints to the flow (e g  mass balance) are established  this theory can be used to predict the topology of both natural networks, such as the design of the lungs (a h reis, miguel, & aydin, 2004), and man-made networks, such as the layout of cities (bejan & lorente, 2008; a  heitor reis, 2006)  unlike other biological models of cell networks, the constructal theory is completely deterministic, predicting the layout of a network without prior assumptions  major limitations are: (a) the need to assume controlling thermodynamic potentials, steady boundary conditions and uniform distribution of connecting points; (b) the absence of interaction dynamics from the formulation which disregards the fluctuations of the environment and the corresponding adaptation of the network  in the same way, steiner tree algorithms allow finding: the minimum spanning tree from a set of points distributed in space; the global optimum from the creation of steiner points that minimize the length needed to connect 3 points on the plane; the minimum network length concatenating those full steiner trees using a combinatorial algorithm (winter & zachariasen, 1997) | 
2017-0517 	 modeling dynamic shear rupture and microseismic source responses on discontinuities induced by quasi-static flow-driven stress in fractured porous media |abstract: the problem of dynamic shear (mode ii) rupture on a non-growing fracture embedded in a solid continuum is traditionally solved using a standard split-node finite element method by permitting displacement discontinuity on the fracture while imposing contact constraint via a lagrangian multiplier or a penalty regularization  in the presence of fluid pressure, this framework can be adjusted accordingly using an effective stress formulation, hence, in principle, can be used for modeling a rupture process in a fluid-filled porous medium and the associated microseismic source responses  however, if the porous medium is subjected to pressure spatial variations, the pressure gradient then acts as a body force, as naturally predicted by the force balance law, generating additional flow-driven stress in the medium  moreover, when fractures are present, the pressure gradient across fractures is often discontinuous, further complicating the flow-driven stress state  such coupling effects are rarely included in currently available rupture codes, hence limiting their applications to fluid-induced seismicity  in this study, we take into account flow-driven stress and provide a numerical modeling framework for fluid-induced quasi-static triggering and dynamic shear rupture processes on pre-existing discontinuities  through a simple configuration in which two natural fractures intersect a hydraulic fracture, we illustrate how a flow-driven rupture process can be used to understand microseismic source responses, estimate permeability enhancement, as well as provide potential explanations for some curious injection-related geophysical observations   1  introduction  fluid injection and withdrawal can induce seismicity on a wide range of scales (ellsworth, 2013)  occurrence of such seismic events poses major environmental and public concerns in activities including co2 capture and sequestration, wastewater injection and conventional hydrocarbon production  on the other hand, events at a much smaller scale, known as microseismic events, are considered as an important mechanism to enhance fluid flow and are stimulated in unconventional hydrocarbon reservoirs and geothermal systems with ultra-low permeability  in any case, an understanding of the associated physical process is crucial for effective control and management of these fluid-induced (micro)seismic events | 
2017-0522 	 seismic wave velocity measurements in an underground canadian mine |abstract: seismic wave velocities are sensitive to rockmass properties including fracture density and orientation, and stress amplitude and orientation  by measuring small changes in the seismic wave velocities, over time it is possible to track changes in the rockmass properties  in mining the rockmass properties are being changed on a regular basis as the rock is removed or pillars are formed  by tracking these changes, it is possible to get a better understanding of the effect mining is having on the rockmass  these changing rockmass properties are important for static stress modelling of the mine and for stability analysis  we use two methods of tracking seismic wave velocities in an underground mine  these methods are 1) active seismic source where a pneumatic hammer is used to generate repeatable impacts which can be measured a few hundred meters away from the source; and 2) ambient noise where background vibrations produced by mining activity are used to turn seismic sensors in to virtual active sources  these two methods then allow us to measure 3d and directional velocity changes where these can be compared with mining activities to get a better understanding of the effect of mining on the rockmass   1  introduction  deep underground mines are highly stressed environments, where seismic activity and rock falls can be significant hazards  thus, seismic monitoring networks have become more common in mining environments  it is important for geotechnical engineers to monitor the rock mass response to mining over time since most seismic events in mines are induced by mining activities  over the last 20 years, seismic monitoring in mines has made great progress as a tool to analyze some of the risks involved in mining at depth, but seismic activity alone is hard to interpret   seismic velocities of intact rock have been known to be sensitive to the internal state of the rock mass  changes in applied stress (larose and hall, 2009), pore pressure (brenguier et al , 2014) and fracture density (nur and simmons, 1969; nur, 1971) have all been shown to cause measurable changes in seismic velocity  the relationship between seismic velocity and stress has been investigated for many years to try to understand the time dependent seismic velocity variations  this is a possible method to predict earthquakes, as it is generally assumed that earthquakes initiate due to the accumulation of stress on a fault | 
2017-0524 	 the application of ultrasonic imaging technology in the detection of water filled goaf area: a case study |abstract: the detection of the goaf area is the key to the treatment of the coal mine goaf  the underwater ultrasonic imaging technology is applied to detect the shape of the water filled goaf of coal mine for the first time in china  the basic principle of ultrasonic imaging technology is explained  the work process of the ultrasonic detection is introduced with a detection case of a coal mine goaf under a railway bridge in shanxi, china  the ultrasonic reflection signatures of wall, fork and ground obstacle of the mine roadway have been discussed  the post-processing techniques of the ultrasonic detection are proposed to reconstruct the goaf shape from cloud data  finally, the detection results are compared with the known exploratory drilling data  it shows that the ultrasonic goaf detection has a high accuracy, which can satisfy the requirement of the actual engineering  the detection results provides the key data for the treatment of the goaf area   1  introduction  due to the disordered over-exploitation of coal resources, there are plenty of coal mine goafs with unknown shapes in many areas of china (han et al , 2011a)  the exist of coal mine goaf is a safety problem, for it may cause land subsidence and ecological environment destruction, which may bring great damages to the economy and society development of themining area (wang et al , 2015, fan and liu, 2017)  the treatment of coal mine goaf have become a current urgent duty   an accurate and effective detection of goaf area can ascertain the distribution of goaf roadways, which is the key data for the safety evaluation and hazard control of goaf treatment projects  at present, many detection methods have been used in the world, such as the transient electromagnetic method (han et al , 2011b), high-density electrical methods (wu et al , 2016), and shallow seismic reflection method (thomas and holzer, 1986)  most of these methods are indirect detection methods, which are used to determine the general range of the coal mine gaof area in most cases  the accuracy of these methods is not enough for the actual engineering requirements of the treatment of the coal mine goaf  the laser range imaging method (ding, 2015) can directly detect the shape of roadway through a borehole, however, it can easily get disturbed by borehole water curtain  otherwise, the laser can not pass through muddy water, thus the laser range imaging system can not work in water-filled goaf  aiming at these problems, this paper proposes using the ultrasonic imaging technology to detect the water filled goaf of coal mine for the first time  the basic principle of ultrasonic imaging technology is explained  the work process, data analysis and detection effects of the ultrasonic imaging technology are discussed with an example of the detection of a coal mine goaf in shanxi, china |

2017-0528 	 the effects of fracturing fluid imbibition on fracture conductivity in tight reservoirs |abstract: field observations indicate that larger than 70% of injected water cannot be recovered due to fracturing fluids imbibition during shut-in periods  however, the effects of imbibition on fracture conductivity are still unclear  in this paper, the fracture conductivity and imbibition experiments are conducted, and the correlativity between fracturing fluid imbibition and fracture conductivity damage is analyzed to explore the micro mechanism  the study finds out that fracturing fluid imbibition can obviously reduce fracture conductivity, and the conductivity damage degree of shale is much higher than that of conventional reservoir  after fracturing fluid entering shale, the interaction between shale and fracturing fluids is so strong as to cause the strength weakness and creep aggravation, which results in proppant embedment and fracture conductivity reduction  the interaction strength is not related to imbibition rate, but it is positively correlated with driving force coefficient  the research is significant for a deep recognition on interaction between fracturing fluid and shale   1  introduction  multistage fracturing is the most important technology to form massive complicated fracture network in shale reservoirs and achieve efficient exploitation of shale gas  however, the efficient exploitation not only depends on the fracture network, but also needs to keep sufficient conductivity of artificial fracture network (novlesky et al , 2011)  the phenomena that the proppant is seriously imbedded into fracture surface can obviously reduce the artificial fracture conductivity and the shale gas production (pritz et al , 2011)   the fracture conductivity has received considerable attention  however, there are few researches on the influences of fracturing fluid imbibition on fracture conductivity  field observations indicate that more than 70% of fracturing fluid are detained in shale formation (makhanov et al , 2014)  it is generally recognized that the fracturing fluids imbibition into matrix pores is the key factor to result in low flowback efficiency  to a large extent, the interaction between fracturing fluid and shale is caused by imbibition, which both reduces the shale strength and proppant embedment (zhou et al , 2016; zhang et al , 2015) | 
2017-0531 	 estimating stope hangingwall sloughage using a hybrid dfn-dem numerical model |abstract: hanging wall (hw) sloughage is one of the main sources of ore dilution in underground open stope mines  this paper presents the results of a series of numerical analyses performed to investigate hw sloughage potential in open stope underground mines  hybrid dfn-3dec models were developed to assess the sloughage zone that can form in a stope hanging wall that consists of a weak and highly fractured rock mass quality  the influence of leaving 1 m and 2 m of ore-skin of higher rock mass quality, unmined along the weak hanging wall zone, on the potential hanging wall sloughage was investigated  the main advantages of hybrid dfn-3dec models for assessment of hangingwall sloughage potential are their capacity to represent the structural complexity of the rock masses (through the dfn model) and to address the effect of confining stresses on the unravelling process   1  introduction  underground open stoping is a popular bulk underground mining method usually selected for its safe non-entry stopes and for the relatively high production rates that can be achieved using larger excavations and mechanized equipment  steeply dipping tabular ore-bodies with medium to narrow width are ideal for open stope mining  the ore-body is generally divided into a series of regularly shaped, large open stopes, which are extracted in sequence  in canada, a significant portion of underground metal mines production rely on open stope mining   in this method, the stopes remain generally unsupported during the mining process  this can result in instability of stope walls that can lead to significant dilution rates  field observations show that one of the main sources of unplanned ore dilution in open stoping underground mines is hangingwall sloughage (ran, 2002, saeedi et al , 2010, henning and s  mitri, 2008)  hangingwall sloughage is related to the stress relaxation process that occurs as the volume of rock that constitutes the stope is being extracted  the stope extraction leads to the redistribution of in-situ stresses around the excavation such as the minor principal stress at the face is lowered to zero  in countries like canada, where the minimum principal stress is nearly vertical, the redistribution of the in-situ stresses, combined with progressive mining along the ore body strike will cause the stope hanging wall (hw) and footwall (fw) to be in a relaxed stress state, with no more confining stress  hence, the rock blocks located within the relaxation zone become more susceptible to the influence of gravity and will start to unravel  at this point, the gravitational forces are more important for the stope stability than the load bearing capacity of the rock mass, causing the structural geometry of the rock mass and the shear strength of the discontinuities to be the major controlling parameters for the hw sloughage |

2017-0542 	 analytical and numerical description of natural fracture initiation in basin modeling context |abstract: in the context of basin modeling numerous phenomenon, depending on the geological history, can lead to a decrease in horizontal effective stress and may result in fracture initiation  therefore, natural fracturing and fracture network formation can occur in various context such as tectonic loading, erosion, or compaction disequilibrium due to significant sedimentation rate  during sedimentation, buried rocks are subjected to an increase in vertical stress that leads to a decrease of porosity and a significant rise in pore pressure  in present work, the case of fractures induced by significant sedimentation rate is studied using both analytical and numerical methods  the focus is put on a synthetic geological structure containing a caprock and a reservoir that are overpressured by a vertical mechanical load  for the numerical simulations, finite element modeling and cohesive model with damage are used  the context of poro-mechanics is considered to build an original analytical solution  the effect of several parameters is studied and the analysis lead to a fracturing criterion for sedimentation context  |1  introduction |basin modeling is commonly used to provide a better understanding of a sedimentary basin history and of its actual state  the actual state of a sedimentary basin in terms of pressure, fluid content, stress state and rock properties is the result of its complete history  many processes are involved in a basin history such as sedimentation, erosion or tectonics  this phenomenon are known to induce change in pressures and stresses and possibly natural fracturing  natural fracturing can therefore significantly modify rock transfer properties (twenhofen, 1950; schneider et al , 1999)  the knowledge of fracturing processes enhances the description of overpressure history, which is a key issue to predict actual overpressures and the fluid content of the underground  deep natural fracturing has been widely studied since the introduction of the effective stress concept by terzaghi, (1936) and the concept of poroelasticity by biot, (1941) to explain tensile stress at very high depth  according to these concepts fractures are initiated when the pore pressure and the total stress are such that a positive and significant enough effective stress locally appear  this phenomena is called natural hydraulic fracturing (audet et al , 1992; mourges r  et al , 2011)  lorenz and finley, (1991) and lorenz et al , (1991) have shown that it is not possible to initiate fractures in homogeneous poroelastic formation in regional context  furthermore previous references showed that natural fractures are initiated in the vicinity of natural defaults in the rock which has been confirmed through numerical poroelastic modeling of natural facture propagation in the context of high sedimentation rate (ouraga et al , 2016) | 
2017-0544 	 numerical analysis of the effects of fluid injection and heat extraction on fracture and reservoir matrix deformation |abstract: this paper investigates the effects of fluid injection and heat extraction on pressure and temperature diffusion processes, and fracture/matrix deformation in an enhanced geothermal reservoir  the geometry of a single linear fracture in a 2d permeable rock matrix is chosen  using an instantaneous point source solution, expressions are derived for the pore-pressure diffusion in the fracture and the reservoir  moreover, heat transport within the fracture includes advection and conduction from the fracture walls, while heat transport in the reservoir includes only conduction and is assumed one dimensional and perpendicular to the fracture  based on these assumptions, a green’s function approach is used to find the two-dimensional solution for the pressure and temperature diffusion  a numerical example illustrates the time-dependent variation of each of the two variables; fluid pressure and temperature and their sensitivity to the fracture/formation properties  the resulting solutions can be used, amongst others, to study wellbore stability and in fracture propagation models to simulate secondary fracture propagation from the main fracture   1  introduction  the geothermal energy harnessed from hydrothermal and enhanced geothermal systems (egs) proves to be important for humankind  it is clean, sustainable and economical  these enhanced geothermal systems (egs) are usually characterized with predominantly dry, impermeable rock with some pre-existing fractures  additional fracturing is needed to improve the reservoir permeability through creation of a fracture network  figure 1 shows the heat injection/extraction approach  the approach involves the drilling of two wells, one for injection and another one for extraction  cold water is injected into the hdr system at sufficient pressures and is later extracted at much higher temperatures and transported to a power plant  the injection/ extraction (fig 1) processes lead to the perturbation of in-situ stresses and pore pressures   on the other hand, the cooling/heating of the reservoir rock introduces thermal effects that have proven to directly impact on the fracture and matrix deformation (cheng et al , 2001), (ghassemi et al , 2008), (tarasovs and ghassemi, 2011), (tarasovs and ghassemi, 2012)  therefore, the response of fractures to injection and extraction operation is required for a better design and management of the reservoir  studies have also shown that secondary fractures are very likely to stem from pre-existing or main fractures due to cooling without considering the role of water pressure  hence, the study of fracture initiation and propagation and the reservoir matrix deformation should incorporate an analysis of both the pore pressure and temperature in the system and their evolution through time  these functions should be considered when analyzing problems such of wellbore stability and induced seismicity | 
2017-0549 	 design guidelines for foundations on jointed rock |abstract: a finite element based approach to design of foundations on jointed rock is described  focus is on computation of load-settlement (p-<u+03b4>) plots that provide important design guidance in the form of foundation stiffness k where <u+03a1>=<u+039a><u+03b4>  while bearing capacity is an ambiguous term that may imply load or settlement, foundation stiffness relates to both  combinations of joint properties and geometry with properties of intact rock between joints are endless, so site-specific analysis is highly desirable  however, tabulation of jointed rock foundation stiffness for selected combinations of three-joint set geometries can provide useful guidance during preliminary design stages  examples illustrate application of the approach using tabulated data   1  introduction  design of foundations on soil is evidently based on a legacy of limiting equilibrium analyses of strip footings (plane strain) from an era of pre-digital computer days  collapse loads based slipline solutions to rigid-ideally plastic problems used with a judicious factor of safety or one specified by building codes are the norm  such solutions are upper bound solutions  lower bound estimates perhaps would be more useful and indeed much effort has been expended in developing such bounds (chen and han 1988, chen 2008)  however, estimates of collapse loads are silent on the critical question of settlement  to be sure, elasticity theory is also used in foundation analysis (selvaduari and davis 1996)  while the literature concerning foundations on soils is enormous, the literature on rock foundations is sparse, indeed, and moreover tends to follow the soil mechanics tradition of focusing on collapse loads (goodman 1980, wyllie 1999, kulhawy 2005)   a finite element based design approach uses current technology to obtain estimates of load and settlement quickly and accurately subject to the quality of available site data  a most important feature of such an approach is a technically sound accounting of joints at the site of interest  an equivalent properties computation that allows joint and intact rock between joints to yield as evolution of the stress field occurs under load meets this requirement (pariseau 1999)  viability of the approach is demonstrated first in comparison with analytical solution to load-settlement of a strip footing without joints  the effect of joints on this solution is presented next  example problems follow  a brief summary concludes this contribution | 
2017-0552 	 a numerical study of the influence of mechanical properties of discontinuities in the behavior of tunnels: a case study in the southeastern region of rio de janeiro, brazil  |abstract: this paper presents analysis of the mechanical behavior of a tunnel, specifically assessing the degradation of gneiss rock mass excavated over time, in the southeastern region of the state of rio de janeiro in brazil  the underground excavation has a depth of 300m in a rock mass containing three families of discontinuities, the intact rock showing degrees of alteration of its minerals  scenarios for analyses are evaluated in conditions of very persistent and moderately persistent discontinuities with the purpose of observing their influence on the stability of the tunnel  three scenarios of in-situ stress conditions are considered  excavations with and without support elements were also considered  the supports were shotcrete with steel fibers, reinforcement cables and a mixture of the two  two-dimensional numerical analyses of the stability of the excavation were carried out using the discrete element method (dem) through the software udec (itasca, 2011)  failure mechanisms were observed plotting maximum shear displacement values in discontinuities  sensitivity analyses were carried out in order to determine most sensitive parameters in relation to failure conditions   1  introduction  the behavior of a tunnel excavated in fractured rock mass depends of the resistance of the rock mass, in other words, of the intact rock and, mainly, of the existing directional features and discontinuities (fractures, joints, schist, plans of stratification), and the stress state acting around the excavation   when the stresses induced around the opening exceed the resistance of the rock mass, plasticity effects occur, eventually leading to failures  the latter requires the installation of support to keep the stability of the excavation  this scenario is made more critical when, after the excavation of the tunnel, with and without support installed, weathering effects causes the reduction of the parameters of resistance of the rock mass  in particular, this is the case in rio de janeiro, where the hydrothermal alteration of the minerals determines a high degradation (change in the mechanical properties) of the rocks, causing a matter of concern due to the changes suffered by the rock  more precise numerical analysis of the stress-strain response of the rock mass requires discontinuum based models, amongst these the discrete element method (dem)  in the present paper, the software udec (itasca) was used  it simulates discontinuum related behavior such as the fall of blocks of rock and large displacements in the fractured region  it allows studies of the current and future behavior of excavated tunnels in fractured rock masses, considering the inclusion of different constitutive models and pertinent geotechnical parameters for the different geological materials as well as different support systems | 
2017-0553 	 new method to differentiate between matrix and micro-fractures using diffusion data in gas shale |abstract: the fact that salt ions in shale pores diffuse into fracturing fluids is key factor to lead to recovered water with high salinity  in this paper, the authors conduct the test of mineral composition and sem to understand the reservoir characteristics  the diffusion experiments are conducted on crushed samples, and a new method is proposed to differentiate between matrix and microfractures by using diffusion data  a large amount of salt ions exit in shale pores and can diffuse into fracturing fluids after fracturing operations  to a great extent, ion diffusion rate is determined by the development of microfractures  the crushed samples with smaller grain diameter contain have lower diffusion rate due to the low probability of microfractures development  when the grain diameter is lower than critical value, the crushed samples cannot contain microfractures  as for longmaxi formation sample, the fracture-matrix boundary is about 80mesh the research contributes to understanding the reservoir characteristics and salinity profiles of gas shale   1  introduction  the field observations show that the salinity of recovered water is generally high  what’s more, the salinity increases continuously over time and even exceeds 10%  it should be noted that the salinity of slick water is about 0 1%  the researchers tend to attribute this observation to the salt ions diffusion into fracturing fluids (wang et al , 2016)   the salt ions concentration and type in recovered water can act as the indicator to evaluate the development of fracture network  unlike primary fractures, the secondary fractures are induced fractures that are covered by connate water film  the connate water film can mixes easily with fracturing fluids to increase the salinity of fracturing fluids (woodroof et al , 2003)  the secondary fractures with smaller aperture size tend to forms high exposure area that can enhance the ion diffusion capacity  in addition, the ion type in secondary fractures is different from that in primary fractures (gdanski et al , 2007)  the study found that ba2+ exits in secondary fractures and the development of microfractures are evaluated based on the concentration of ba2+ (agrawal and sharma, 2013) |

2017-0564 	 investigation of rock mass stability around tunnels in an underground mine by three-dimensional numerical modeling |abstract: in this paper, the stability of the tunnels in an underground mine was investigated by three-dimensional numerical modeling  based on the available geological, geotechnical, and mine construction information, a three-dimensional model was built using the 3dec code  the model contains the features of the inclined lithologies, a large-scale non-persistent fault, and a complex tunnel system  stress analyses were performed on the rock mass having the elastic-perfectly plastic and strain-softening behaviors, respectively  the effects of the horizontal in situ stress and the support system were studied through the distributions of stress, displacement, and yielded zone around the tunnels  by comparing the numerical modeling results with the field deformation measurements, it was found that the strain-softening cases with the lateral stress ratios of 0 5 and 1 0 are accurate and applicable for this mine   1  introduction  the stability of the development tunnels is critical for an operating mine in ensuring the safety of the working places and the successful ore production  however, the rock mass behavior around underground excavations is rather complex due to a lot of factors  as a geological material, the rock mass includes natural discontinuities, such as joints, faults, bedding planes, shear zones, and dikes, which can significantly weaken the strength of the material (aydan et al , 1997)  as excavation goes down deeper, the problem of high in situ stress is encountered, resulting in large deformations and failure zones (kulatilake et al , 2013)  additionally, the excavation geometries, the excavation layout, as well as the constructing sequences also play important roles on the stability of the underground openings (chen, 1997; bhasin et al , 2006; chryssanthakis et al , 1997; lu et al , 2012)  therefore, the assessment of the rock mass stability around underground excavations is challenging  to take care of many such factors, the numerical method has been proved as an efficient tool (jing, 2003)  because of the geological characteristics of the rock mass and the many discontinuity-related failures in underground problems, the discontinuum modeling has gained a lot of attention and been widely used (barla and barla, 2000; jing, 2003) | 
2017-0567 	 discrete modeling of the fracture-permeability behavior of shale |abstract: a three-dimensional discrete dual lattice model is formulated to investigate the permeability and mechanical behavior of fracture-damaged shale  the mechanical lattice model simulates the granular internal structure of material at the grain level, and describes the heterogeneous deformation by means of discrete compatibility and equilibrium equations  a network of fluid transport elements built upon the mechanical lattice is used to simulate fluid flow along intergranular pores and cracks  the variation of permeability for cracked material is captured by coupling mechanical and transport lattice models  a numerical example of direct shear triaxial test on utica shale is simulated by the formulated framework  variation of shale shear strength with the angle between the vertical bedding plane and the shear plane is captured  the permeability of the fractured specimens was obtained by simulating water flowing along the specimens  the numerical results show that the simulated effect of cracking on the overall permeability is in general qualitative agreement with available experimental data   1  introduction  material characterization of gas/oil shale and shale-like rock, including study of their mechanical and hydraulic properties, is needed in many engineering practices such as hydraulic fracturing  investigating the fracture- and damage-induced permeability variation of shale is necessary to understand and optimize oil and gas production  this involves quantifying damage and fracturing of material due to nucleation and propagation of microcracks and correlating permeability variations with damage by taking into account the multiscale nature of shale (hyman et al , 2016; li et al , 2016)  despite the urgent need to understand and characterize shale fracture permeability behavior, little work has been published to the best of authors’ knowledge   most experimental work related to the evolution of rock hydraulic properties with cracking and damage has investigated the permeability of prefractured (split or sawn) specimens (gutierrez et al , 2000; davy et al , 2007; jobmann et al , 2010; cho et al , 2013; mokhtari et al , 2014)  these studies clearly show that rock permeability is strongly related to density, spacing, orientation, width, and length of fractures within samples  nevertheless, studies on shale permeability are substantially limited  it was suggested by researchers (carey et al , 2015a; carey et al , 2015b; frash et al , 2016) that permeability studies of rocks fractured at in situ conditions through triaxial compression or direct shear tests better represent fracture properties in the subsurface than the ones using prefractured or artificial specimens | 
2017-0568 	 experimental characterization of microstructure development for calculating fabric and stiffness tensors in salt rock |abstract: uniaxial consolidation tests were conducted on reagent-grade granular salt in dry conditions at 150 c  2d-microscopic images, parallel to the axis of consolidation, were obtained at several stages of progressive consolidation from 15% to 3% porosity  microstructure image analyses were performed to obtain probability density functions (pdfs) of the area, solidity, coordination number, orientation, elongation and roundness of the grains, as well as the pdfs of the branch lengths, branch orientations and solid volume fraction, defined locally over polygons with edges matching grain centroids  it is found that sample deformation is mostly due to grain rearrangement and that upon consolidation, grains become less convex, and elongate in the direction perpendicular to the loading axis  four fabric tensors were calculated to assess microstructure anisotropy induced by grain orientation, branch length orientation, grain solidity and local solid volume fraction  fabric tensors were diagonal and orthogonal  therefore, their product was used to define a global fabric tensor, which was introduced in the expression of the stiffness tensors  the constitutive parameters were calibrated against the consolidation tests  the approach paves the way to enrich continuum damage and healing mechanics model with fabric descriptors that can play the role of internal variables   1  introduction  salt rock is often considered as an ideal material for geological storage of compressed air and nuclear waste, because of its low permeability and favorable creep properties  salt is a polycrystalline material made of bonded crystals (called grains in the following)  salt stiffness depends on rock microstructure, which changes during the geostorage process  a micro-macro mechanical model is proposed to predict the evolution of stiffness, deformation and microstructure development during consolidation   a fabric tensor is a symmetric tensor that captures anisotropy due to the presence of heterogeneities in a rock  a fabric tensor can be defined in many ways to characterize the microstructure arrangement of geomaterials, and is usually regarded as the second microstructure measurement, after porosity  crack fabric tensors were defined with space distribution, density, shape, dimension, and orientation of cracks  a fabric tensor was defined based on the density, dimension, and angular distribution of branches linking particle centers (oda, 1982)  stereological methods were used to characterize the distribution of directional data (kanatani, 1984)  a fabric tensor can be determined by calculating the local porosity on test lines drawn in various directions of space  a set of probe lines drawn at 10° (muhunthan and chameau, 1997) or a set of parallel test lines in a given direction were commonly used as test lines (kou et al , 1998)  the volume fraction, the mean coordination number, and the correction factor depending on grain size distribution were found to be essential descriptors of rock microstructure, and were introduced in the trace of fabric tensors (madadi et al , 2004) | 
2017-0569 	 compaction localization in granular rocks: modeling grain-size effects |abstract: this paper focuses on the simulation of localized compaction in granular rocks  for this purpose, a continuum framework referred to as breakage mechanics is used to capture the role of microscopic crushing on the mechanical response of grain assemblies  in particular, grain size dependencies are introduced by connecting the physics of grain-scale fracture to the energetics of collective crushing  it is shown that this approach enables the simultaneous consideration of changes in grain sorting and average grain size, where the role of the latter is modeled via central splitting and contact fracture laws  using this constitutive framework, the localization potential of bentheim sandstone has been studied with the purpose to emphasize the role of grain scale characteristics in the inception of compaction banding  the analyses show that the model captures correctly the increase of the localization potential resulting from a coarser gradation or a narrow grain size distribution   1  introduction  understanding the processes that control compaction and faulting in reservoir rocks is crucial for many branches of geophysics and geo-engineering  in this context, a considerable challenge is due to compaction banding, a mechanism by which strains localize into narrow tabular zones (aydin, 1978, mollema and antonellini, 1996, fossen et al , 2007)  these deformation bands are critical for the energy industry in that they lead to marked pore collapse and permeability loss, thus having considerable impact on reservoir integrity and injection/extraction efficiency (wawersik et al , 2001)   a widely adopted tool to assess the localization potential of rocks is the bifurcation theory proposed by rudnicki and rice, 1975, often used in combination with elastoplastic constitutive laws  among its many applications, this theory has been used to study compaction banding in porous rocks (issen and rudinicki, 2000) via cap-plasticity (challa and issen, 2004) or critical state models (buscarnera and laverack, 2013; das and buscarnera, 2014)  these models are typically calibrated on the basis of the results of laboratory tests, which, in addition to measurements of stress-strain response, have often provided a link between shear-enhanced compaction and inelastic phenomena at the grain-scale (wong et al , 1997, klein et al , 2001, wu et al , 2000, besuelle et al , 2003, baud et al , 2004)  recently, such multi-scale links have been exploited in the context of the theoretical and numerical modeling of compaction bands  an example is given by the work of das et al , 2011, 2013, who studied compaction banding in sandstones through a microstructure-inspired constitutive framework referred to as breakage mechanics (einav, 2007a,b)  starting from thermodynamic principles, this theory links the macroscopic yielding of a granular rock to the energy released by crushing events, thus enabling the simulation of the changes in grain size distribution due to high-pressure compaction  despite its links with the micromechanics of grain crushing, recent findings by zhang and buscarnera, 2014 pointed out that the model lacks an inherent length scale related with the size of the largest grains, thus preventing the model from capturing major grain-size dependencies  hence, to incorporate such length scale, zhang et al , 2016 have recently augmented the framework by proposing a linear scaling law that connects the fracture properties of grains to the macroscopic critical breakage energy of the solid, thus bridging the physics of fracture at particle scale with the energetics of comminution at continuum scale | 
2017-0572 	 a new pseudo-3d model for hydraulic fracture height growth in multilayered rocks |abstract: controlled fracture geometry is one of the most important criteria that measure the success of a hydraulic fracturing treatment  typical stress conditions often lead to generation of a planar vertical fracture  even for this simple geometry, fracture growth in a multilayered rock depends on many factors, such as stress, toughness and modulus contrasts across layers, fracturing fluid viscosity and injection rate  in the present work, a new cell-based pseudo-3d (p3d) model, which uses plane strain deformation in each vertical cross-section and simplified 2d flow assumptions, is described, with an aim to extend the classical p3d model to consider the effect of multiple elastic layers  to capture the effect of viscous fluid flow on height growth, the flow direction at a point along a cell is taken either lateral or vertical, depending on the local pressure level  the lateral flow region is divided into a so called central part that is subject to the maximum fluid pressure in a cell and the vertical flow region which is called the filling segment or part of the cell  the vertical and lateral fracture growth is controlled by the toughness criterion, and, the lateral stress intensity factor is used to convert a filling segment into the central part so as to accelerate lateral fracture growth by changing the local pressure level to the maximum of the cell  the governing equations associated with the problem are provided  a comparison is made between numerical results and the fully 3d (f3d) simulations for a vertically planar fracture propagating in a homogeneous rock subject to stress contrast  the numerical results appear reasonably acceptable  some solution features associated with the proposed model are delineated  in addition, a special example for hydraulic fracture propagation in a layered rock is examined and the fracture height is found to increase much slower than the fracture length   1  introduction  hydraulic fracture treatments in multiple-layer, low- permeability unconventional gas reservoirs provide an important stimulation technology  in a layered rock formation, there are dissimilarities in confining stresses and material properties across the layers  the fracture height growth can be enhanced or constrained by these stress and material property changes (palmer and kutas, 1991; gu and siebrits, 2008; gu et al , 2008), as well as by any slippage along the interfaces (gu et al , 2008; fan et al , 2014; chuprakov et al , 2015;)  fracture containment or limited fracture height growth may result in dominant lateral fracture growth with fluid flow localized in the lower-modulus, lower-stress layers (jeffrey et al , 1993) | 
2017-0573 	 experimental investigations on the self-sealing of anhydritic rock |abstract: when anhydrite dissolves upon contact with water, the sulphate and calcium ions in the pore water can lead to precipitation of gypsum  this anhydrite to gypsum transformation (agt) results in an increase in the solid volume by 61% and in a decrease or increase in the pore volume  on a macroscopic scale the so far insufficiently understood phenomenon “swelling of anhydritic rock” is observed, which is known to cause massive damage to underground constructions, such as tunnels  this contribution focuses on one specific aspect of agt, the precipitation of gypsum directly on the surface of the dissolving anhydrite, which creates a diffusion barrier for the dissolving ions and slows further anhydrite dissolution down (hereafter referred to as “self-sealing”)  the development of such gypsum layers on anhydrite is investigated experimentally by storing natural rock specimens consisting of 96%-99% anhydrite in water and observing the thickness of the developing gypsum layer optically via photography during the tests and via microscopic analysis after drying of the samples  the measured thicknesses corresponded well to the amount of precipitated gypsum determined post test via thermogravimetric analysis and to predicted values which were calculated with an existing kinetic model  the plausibility of this model could thus be verified so far  |1  introduction and conceptual model |as anhydrite comes into contact with water it will begin to dissolve under most circumstances below 40°c (at atmospheric pressure)  as the saturation concentration with respect to anhydrite (ceq,a) is higher than that of gypsum (ceq,g), anhydrite dissolution results in oversaturation with respect to gypsum, thus triggering growth of gypsum crystals, whereby the solid volume of gypsum is 61% higher than that of anhydrite due to the additional water molecules bound in the crystals  the chemical reaction from anhydrite (caso4) to gypsum (caso4 • 2h2o) will be referred to here as agt (anhydrite – gypsum transformation) and can be formulated in short as caso4 + 2h2o > caso4 • 2h2o | 
2017-0580 	 modeling of key lifespan stages of a pre-salt wellbore |abstract: oil and gas wellbores experience a number of phases and scenarios during their lifespan  drilling, completion, production and abandonment imply significant changes in the mechanical behavior of the well and its surrounding rock formation  stress state and temperature changes are even more significant in pre-salt wellbores since the creep behavior inherent to the salt rocks is strongly influenced by these state variables  this work presents a comprehensive pre-salt wellbore integrity analysis addressing key phases of the well lifespan  preventing casing from plastic deformations is recommended  the analyses were carried out with an in-house finite element simulator, geoflux3d, and have highlighted the wellbore casing sensitivity to the internal pressure and to the channels in the cement sheath  plastic deformation has not been detected; however, the full evacuation periods and the cement channel affect negatively the casing integrity by triggering severe stress changes and non-uniformities, respectively  therefore, proper definition of the loading and geometry scenarios to which pre-salt wellbores are subjected is fundamental for reliable integrity predictions   1  introduction  oil and gas wellbores experience a number of phases and scenarios during their lifespan  drilling, completion, production and abandonment imply significant changes in the mechanical behavior of the well and its surrounding rock formation  over the operational time, full evacuation maintenance periods occur, during which the internal pressure in the casing is drastically reduced  moreover, the flow of fluids at different temperatures produces thermal processes through the casing (liner, overlap and pipes) that lead to a temperature rise in the salt formation  the stress state and temperature changes are even more relevant in pre-salt wellbores since the creep behavior inherent to the salt rocks is strongly influenced by these two state variables   this work presents a comprehensive pre-salt wellbore application addressing key stages of the well lifespan  a synthetic (but representative) wellbore model is adopted as object of study to simulate borehole drilling, liner running (installation of the outer casing), overlap running (installation of the inner casing) and full evacuation periods  it is assumed that both casing running’s are simultaneously followed the cementation of the corresponding drifts or annular spaces  the analyses are carried out with an in-house thermo-hydromechanical (thm) finite element simulator, geoflux3d (quevedo, 2012)  this tool holds a number of capabilities of interest for wellbore integrity analysis, including procedures to simulate borehole drilling, casing running, salt creep and non-uniform loading schemes  axisymmetric, 2d and 3d models are supported | 
2017-0585 	 effects of super-critical co2 phase change on dynamic multi-fracturing process in reservoir stimulation |abstract: to investigate the effects of carbon dioxide phase change on dynamic multi-fracturing process during supercritical carbon dioxide (sc-co2) fracturing, polymethyl methacrylate (pmma) specimens of 20 <u+00d7> 20 <u+00d7> 10cm3 are used in experiments with sc-co2 and water as fracturing fluids, respectively  the process of fracture propagation is recorded using high speed camera to determine fracture propagation velocity and morphology  simple models related to expansion work and heat energy caused by sc- co2 phase change are to explain the experimental observations and results  the experimental results show that, due to strength weakening from co2 adsorbed into the nano-scale fracture surface, the magnitude of fracture initiation pressure of sc-co2 fracturing is lower than that of water-based fracturing  it is of interest that fracture propagation velocity of sc-co2 fracturing is two order greater in magnitude than that of water-based fracturing, which shows that the energy release rate maybe sufficient for fracture branching  the expansion and thermal stresses induced by co2 phase change, when the fracture instability occurs, further extend the fractures or even create multi-fractures  eventually, the intermittent dynamic growth of multi-fractures occurs under the effect of co2 phase change in sc-co2 fracturing   1  introduction  it is widely accepted that the traditional hydraulic fracturing has some disadvantages, such as excessive water consumption, reservoir damage and underwater contamination and so on  thus many efforts have been dedicated to mitigate or avoid those adverse effects, and sc-co2 fracturing as the waterless fracturing technology has been studied by some researchers recently (verdon et al , 2010, ishida et al , 2012, kizaki et al , 2012, zhou and burbey, 2014, fang et al , 2014, middleton et al  2015, zhang et al , 2016, papanastasiou et al , 2016)   from the 1981 (lillies and king,1982) the co2-sand fracturing technology prevails gradually and has been applied in different permeability(0 1md-10d)and temperature (10-100°c) of reservoir (gupta and bobier,1998)  unlike the co2-sand fracturing, sc-co2 fracturing needs relatively higher wellhead temperature and pressure to reach the supercritical state before the co2 is pumped into the reservoir  the passive seismic data from the injection of water and co2 in the case of very similar conditions suggests that co2 fracturing treatment can be learned from the abundant experience of conventional fracturing (verdon et al  2010)  some sc- co2 fracturing experiments (ishida et al , 2012, kizaki et al , 2012, zhang et al ,2016) show that the number of branches of fractures generated by sc-co2 is more than that generated by water, and the magnitude of initiation pressure for sc-co2 is also lower than that of water  both fluid compressibility and viscosity influence fracture propagation, with low viscosity being the more important property (kizaki et al , 2012)  viscosity can greatly affect hydraulic conductivity and leak-off coefficient (zhou and burbey, 2014)  as a result, the sc-co2 leak-off greatly increases pore pressure in the vicinity of fracture tip which leads to decrease the initiation pressure (zhang et al , 2016)  in light of abundant experimental results and some theoretical invitations, sc-co2 fracturing is feasible for shale reservoir (middleton et al  2015)  consequently, among the parameters, other than low permeability of tight reservoir (cipolla et al , 2010), the horizontal stress difference (olson and pollard, 1989, blanton, 1986), the bedding and natural fractures (daneshy, 1974, warpinski and teufel, 1987, warpinski, 1991, fan and zhang, 2014), rock brittleness (rickman et al , 2008) and the treatment conditions (soliman et al , 2000), the co2 phase change plays a vital role on formation of fracture complexity | 
2017-0587 	 parametric study of influence of corrosion phenomena on the thermo-hydro-mechanical response of claystone |abstract: this work is performed in the framework of feasibility study of underground repository for high-levels radioactive wastes  based on the design concept of andra, the retrievability of waster packages requires ensuring the mechanical stability of the steel liner for several thousand years  during the lifetime of repository, the host rock is subjected to various coupled loadings, such as mechanical loading/unloading, ventilation and temperature variation  moreover, the steel liner may be corroded by the eventual contact of groundwater coming from the host rock and then induce a degradation of its useful properties, including strength, permeability, gas production, volumetric expansions, etc… the combinative effects of the steel corrosion and the evolution of host rock deformation may induce an eventual structural failure of steel liner and an amplified fracture damage zone in the host rock  therefore, the long-term safety of the repository requires a detailed study on the thermo-hydro-mechanics coupling effect including corrosion phenomena on the response of host rock  in view of this, a disposal tunnel supported by a steel liner is simulated and analyzed  using thm coupling model, a series of parametric study is then performed to identify the influence of different corrosion phenomena, for instance, the corrosion velocity, the volumetric expansion of corrosion products and the mechanical properties of corrode steel as well as the temperature  the analysis of numerical results allows us capture the important issues controlling the influence of corrosion process of steel liner on the thm response of claystone  1  introduction  in the framework of feasibility study of underground repository for high level wastes (hlw), the facts supported the design choices are primarily linked to manage the impact of hlw and protect man and environment  in view of this, the basic layout of underground hlw disposal repository is principally guided by its long-term safety and reversibility (fig  1)  in order to achieved this basic layouts, a multi-barriers concept composed of geological barrier and engineering barriers, is commonly adopted  different types of engineering barriers can be used in underground repository: concrete, steel bentonite etc | 
2017-0588 	 assessment of ureolysis induced mineral precipitation material properties compared to oil and gas well cements |abstract: novel methods are needed to prevent or mitigate subsurface fluid leakage (stored carbon dioxide or fuels, during unconventional oil & gas resource development or nuclear waste disposal)  ureolysis-induced calcium carbonate precipitation (uicp) has been investigated as a method to plug leakage pathways in the near wellbore environment or in fractures  the enzyme urease catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea to react with calcium to form solid calcium carbonate (similar to limestone)  uicp test specimens were prepared in triplicate by filling 2 5 cm diameter <u+00d7> 5 cm long molds with sand and injecting both microbial and plant- based enzymes with urea and calcium solutions to promote precipitation  for comparison, class h well-, fine-, and portland type i- cement specimens were prepared by mixing the cement paste (api 10b) then mixing with sand (astm c305)  compression strengths of the plant-based enzyme specimens reached 77% and 66% of the compressive strength of the 28-day well-cement and type 1 cement mortars, respectively  the specimens also reached 83% of the 14-day fine cement strength  the results of this study indicate that the uicp produced specimens may have adequate strength for field applications   1  introduction  ureolysis induced calcium carbonate precipitation (uicp) has been investigated for a number of engineering applications, in particular, as an environmentally friendly method of improving the performance of cement or concrete structures (de muynck et al , 2010; ramachandran et al , 2001, phillips et al , 2013a)  such improvements documented in the literature include the remediation of cracks in concrete (de belie and de muynck, 2008; de muynck et al , 2008; van tittelboom et al , 2010), incorporating microbes into cement-sand mortars to alter material properties, (ghosh et al , 2005; halder et al , 2014), and self-healing applications (jonkers et al , 2010; wang et al , 2014)   in previous research, uicp promoted by microbially produced ureases has been demonstrated in the field to seal hydraulic fractures (cuthbert et al , 2013; phillips et al , 2016) and was recently demonstrated in the field to improve wellbore integrity by sealing a channel in the cement behind the casing (phillips et al , manuscript in preparation)  data collected in the field is limited to pressure and flow measurements which can be used with observations from subsurface logging tools to estimate the wellbore integrity after treatment  however, it is difficult to assess material properties of the seals formed down-hole  the motivation for the research described here was to assess the strength of the uicp materials in the laboratory and compare them to well-cements typically used in subsurface oil and gas well-cementing operations | 
2017-0590 	 evaluation of fracture toughness and its impact on hydraulic fracturing |abstract: the inherent anisotropy in shales due to the presence of fine laminations makes the process of fracture prediction complex  an optimized hydraulic fracture design requires a better understanding of anisotropy in rock strength and its impact on fracture propagation  this paper presents a workflow to generate continuous fracture toughness (kic) profiles (parallel to bedding and perpendicular to bedding) using laboratory generated correlations between fracture toughness and other rock properties like ucs, young’s modulus and tensile strength  anisotropic nature of fracture toughness has not been studied in detail previously which this paper seeks to address  a boundary element method model was used to study the effect of anisotropy in fracture toughness and the magnitude on fracture geometry for a field in north america  fracture simulations show anisotropy in kic does impact hydraulic fracture propagation especially in cases where stress barriers are absent and neglecting it would lead to inaccurate predictions of fracture geometry   1  introduction  understanding fracture growth across layers is critical to accurately predict fracture growth and in generating an optimized hydraulic fracture design  fracture toughness (kic) is often overlooked and considered unimportant since the in situ stress profile is considered the controlling factor when it comes to fracture growth, containment and geometry (fisher and warpinski, 2012 )  in laminated formations, such as shales, fracture height predictions based on numerical models grossly overestimate the fracture height when compared with results from fracture diagnostics  (baree et al , 2010)   numerous authors published results indicating fracture toughness significantly affects fracture size (thiercelin et al , 1989, dudley et al , 2016, abe et al , 1976, shoji et al , 1985)  fracture toughness variations across different layers also have a significant effect on fracture geometry as shown by settari (1988)  correlations of fracture toughness with p-wave velocity, young’s modulus, poisson’s ratio, ucs, tensile strength and other physical properties have been derived from experimental data of different rock types (barry et al , 1992, zhixi et al , 1997, brown and redish, 1997)  dudley et al  (2016) developed correlations of fracture toughness with density, p-wave velocity and s-wave velocity exclusively for gas shales  none of the above studies considered the direction dependency of kic  ghamgosar et al , (2015) found that anisotropy has a strong influence on the magnitude of fracture toughness and crack propagation using the cracked chevron notch brazilian disc (ccnbd) specimens of brisbane sandstone | 
2017-0591 	 complete geomechanical property log from drilling data in unconventional horizontal wells |abstract: geomechanical properties are important for reservoir characterization and optimal stimulation design in the oil and gas industry  the conventional techniques, such as laboratory core analysis and downhole acoustic/wireline logging can be expensive and sometimes uncertain to process for unconventional reservoirs  in this study, a convenient and cost-effective technology is presented that uses routinely available drilling data to calculate the geomechanical properties without the need for downhole logging operations  a wellbore friction model is used to estimate the coefficient of friction and effective downhole weight on bit (dwob) from the routinely collected drilling data  the inverted rate of penetration (rop) models use the estimated downhole weight on bit and formation lithology constants to calculate the geomechanical properties throughout the horizontal reservoir formations such as confined compressive strength (ccs), unconfined compressive strength (ucs), young’s modulus, permeability, porosity and poisson’s ratio  in this article, the field case study is presented for a sample north american well applied to the lower eagle ford formation  the calculated geomechanical property log is also verified with tests performed on cores in reservoir rock formations   1  introduction  continuous monitoring of rock mechanical and reservoir properties along the wellbore in unconventional horizontal wells demands convenient and efficient logging techniques  the conventional logging techniques involve laboratory core analysis and well logging using sonic and resistivity image logs which are not readily available for all unconventional wells (1 in 10 or 1 in 20) mainly due to associated cost, data uncertainity and time consuming to process  moreover there are possible risks and concerns of trapping logging tools downhole in highly deviated and horizontal wells drilled in unconventional reservoirs  for many years, researchers and engineers have been investigating several models and techniques to obtain geomechanical property logs for the successful development of unconventional resrvoirs and stimulation design for maximum hydrocarbon production  the artificial intelligence and data mining (ai&dm) or data- driven models were developed to generate synthetic geomechanical information from the conventional logs in shale plays (eshkalak et al , 2013)  the conventional log data from a shale well was used for training and calibration during neural network model development to generate the synthelic logs for other wells  this model provides better performance for the wells in proximity of the training well with actual geomechanical properties  a convenient rop model was developed to calculate rock mechanical properties such as, confined compressive strength (ccs), unconfined compressive strength (ucs) and young’s modulus (e) at each drilled depth from the routinely collected drilling data such as rate of penetration (rop), weight on bit (wob) and rpm (hareland and nygaard, 2007)  in horizontal drilling, the actual downhole weight on bit differs from the measured surface wob (obtained from on and off bottom hook load difference readings) due to the friction caused by drill string movement, rotation within the wellbore and wellbore geometry  a previously developed 3d wellbore friction model (torque and drag (t&d) model) was used to estimate the coefficient of friction and effective downhole weight on bit (dwob) from the surface measurements of wob, hook load, surface applied rpm along with the wellbore survey measurement, standpipe pressure and drill string information (fazalizadeh et al , 2010) | 
2017-0593 	 mechanistic simulation of multi-stage, multi-wellbore hydraulic fracturing in naturally fractured reservoirs |abstract: comprehensive mechanism-based investigation of stimulations in naturally fractured reservoirs promotes the development of new hydraulic fracture models in a finite element method platform, abaqus  our triple-stage, triple-wellbore hydraulic fracturing simulations are accomplished using fully coupled pore-pressure-stress analyses, a well-established mechanism-based intersection model based on cohesive zone model, and a novel universal wellbore-perforation model for simultaneous and sequential fracturing scenarios  we quantified cluster stimulation, the activation of a complex natural fracture (nf) network, and fluid infiltration depending on the stimulation scenario, wellbore pressure drop, randomly distributed perforation lengths, and fracturing fluid viscosity  the stimulation patterns are featured by the following: 1) dominant effect of the perforation tunnel lengths in the cluster stimulation in the presence of the wellbore model; 2) doubled cluster stimulation in the absence of the nf network; 3) more control on the cluster stimulation and wider stimulated reservoir volumes in sequential fracturing compared to simultaneous fracturing; and 4) stronger stress shadowing effect in sequential fracturing with hydraulic pressure connectivity of stage clusters through the wellbore  this mechanistic model that integrates the nf network, its intersection with the hydraulic fractures, and the hydraulic connection of perforations through the wellbore clearly demonstrates a technique to refine stimulated reservoir volumes and better explain microseismic anomalies   1  introduction  hydraulic fracturing stimulation has been widely deployed for the economic production from hydrocarbon-bearing ultra-low permeable shale formations  the design and optimization of these stimulation processes strongly depends on robust computational models because of numerous controlling parameters and the complexity of the geological formations  as a dominating complexity in the hydraulic fracturing design, the natural fracture (nf) network and connections to the hydraulic fractures may improve or damage the long-term production from the hydrocarbon reservoir  for instance, the damage to the long-term production may occur due to the fluid flow interference of the offset horizontal wells through the nf network induced by primarily independent hydraulic fractures  this interference can be observed frequently in microseismic surveys, e g  for a four-well pad as shown in fig  1  in this figure, the events associated with the stimulations along each horizontal wellbore are grouped together by a unique color  due to the color overlap between all neighboring well couples, the fracture runaway from one wellbore to the other one is eminent | 
2017-0596 	 a micromechanical model for studying the effect of ductility and micro-crack intensity on rock strength characteristics |abstract: the bonded particle model is a powerful tool in studying the mechanical behavior of rock  the common practice in simulation of rock failure using this model is to allow brittle fracture of the contacts between particles or at most tensile softening at the contact points ignoring the shear softening of the material  to overcome this shortcoming, a plasticity model that allows both tensile and shear softening of the filling material at the contact points of the particles was implemented in the ca2 computer program  the model was calibrated to mimic the elastic behavior of the pennsylvania blue sandstone  it is shown that for a more ductile material, there is less scatter of micro-cracking at the peak load  furthermore, the ductility parameter appears to be a good tool in controlling the ratio of compressive to uniaxial tensile strength of rock  while the ductility of the filling at the contact points of the particles has a drastic effect on the macroscopic post-peak rock behavior in the direct tensile testing, its role in dictating the post-peak rock behavior in compression is negligible and needs further study  the combined effect of ductility and initial micro-cracking on rock strength characteristics was studied as well  the numerical results suggest that the ratio of brazilian to direct tensile strength of the simulated material is affected by the initial micro-crack intensity; this ratio is around 1 for a material with no initial micro-cracks but it gradually increases as the initial micro-crack intensity is increased   1  introduction  the bonded particle model (bpm) has found a variety of applications in rock engineering and rock mechanics owing to its simple constituent analogy to circular discs in two dimensions and spheres in three dimensions and its ability to model complex rock and soil behavior using simple contact models for interaction of the particles (potyondy and cundall, 2004; norouzi et al , 2013; fakhimi and hemami, 2015; lisjak and grasseli, 2014)  while the bpm has been considered as a great tool for geotechnical modeling, it has its own shortcomings and drawbacks  one of the challenges in bpm modeling of rock is the problem with obtaining realistic values for friction angle and ratio of uniaxial compressive strength (ucs) to tensile strength; the friction angle and ucs values are normally underestimated by the bpm model using spherical or circular disks (fakhimi, 2004; wu and xu, 2016) | 
2017-0597 	 experimental investigation on compressibility of karamay oil sands under water injection |abstract: steam assisted gravity drainage (sagd) adopts a stimulation process through water injection to a pair of horizontal wells  two deformation mechanisms named shear dilation and tensile parting occur in this process  triaxial shear and hydrostatic pressure tests were conducted on specimens sampled from field-collected oil sand cores, so as to investigate the compressibility of shear dilation and tensile parting dilation of oil sand under the real water injection pressure as well as in-situ stress and temperature states in the field  it is revealed that the compressibility of the specimens under shear increases with increasing mean effective stress until strain-softening takes place, but displays an opposite trend thereafter  moreover, such a compressibility increases with decreasing effective confining stress and temperature, or an increase in uniaxial strain  the tensile dilation tests, on the other hand, disclosed that the associated compressibility changes inversely proportional to the mean effective stress or temperature  interestingly, an increased temperature of the injected fluid suppresses rather than promoting the compressibility of an oil sand reservoir  a wellpair in the fengcheng oilfield of karamay was examined to predict its ultimate injected water volume, producing a result very close to that recorded in the field   1  introduction  micro-fracturing technology was originally applied in the development of marine oil sands in alberta, canada  here micro-fracturing or water injection instead of hydraulic fracturing is a more appropriate term due to the absence of stress shadow effects in weak rocks (lin et al  2015&2016)  resulting from the historical glacial action, the solid particles of marine oil sands in canada are characterized by an interlocking fracture similar to the over-consolidated soil (oldakowski 1994, yuan et al  2011)  on the other hand, the oil sands in karamay, northwest china, belong to land-facies deposit in absence of glacial activities and their compaction, resulting in a loose fabric with scattered mud stringers (yuan et al  2013, lin et al  2015)  micro-fracturing by water injection has been widely implemented in the steam assisted gravity drainage (sagd) projects on oil sand reservoirs in karamay, aiming to expand the pore space of the domain encompassing the dual wells, such that the preheating period to shorten the preheating stage and improve the propagation of steam chamber (lin et al  2016&2017)  the micro-fracturing physical models of oil sand reservoirs in karamay are given in fig  1 | 
2017-0598 	 case study on design and construction of a urban subway tunnel in karst regions |abstract: the running tunnel section between yanan road station and zhongshan road station of the guiyang metro line 1 is located in the yunyan district of guiyang province, china  in this bid section, construction encountered numerous challenges: karst caves wholly or partially filled, fractured rock masses, substantial water inflow, many adjacent buildings, large numbers of municipal pipelines and under crossings of rivers all added to the construction risk and the complicated geological environment  excavated by a roadheader using the bench method, it is a representative and successful construction project which provides not only a systematic approach for suitable design in karst regions but also appropriate support techniques  this paper is going to analyze the design of this urban subway tunnel section’s main structure based on chinese national specifications and other successful projects’ experiences  furthermore, comparison of different design methods in different countries and analysis of effective support techniques in karst areas will also be summarized   1  introduction  associated with difficulties such as unexpected location and irregular geometry of karst caves, complexity of underground water conveyance, and subjectivity in rock mass classification estimation, the dynamic design and construction of tunnels in karst regions is complicated and challenging   current research focuses of tunnel construction in karst terrains are: advance geological forecast technology (wang c l  et al , 2013), tunnel support and ground treatment technology (cui q l , 2015), analysis of surrounding rock and tunnel structure’s stability, deformation and internal forces under karst caves in different locations and geometries (dong l w  et al , 2014) as well as risk estimation  however, few papers have discussed the relation and interaction between design and construction  based on experiences gained from a real tunnel construction project, this paper describes encountered problems, summarizes the successful experiences of this project as well as other international ones, and proposes systematic solutions in design and construction for future work in similar karstified regions | 
2017-0600 	 balancing productivity and sanding risk in weak sandstones through a size dependent approach |abstract: this paper considers the physics and solid and fluid mechanics relevant to sanding from weak or very weak sandstones, and then uses this understanding to suggest ways of designing screenless completions to take advantage of these aspects to avoid sand production  this is followed by a description of a scale-dependent approach to sand prediction  this takes grain size and production tunnel diameter into account within the conventional framework of in-situ stress, reservoir pressure and rock strength parameters  the influence of these factors on sand failure over the life-of-reservoir is treated  a brief discussion of the problem of predicting the rate of sand production is also included  the approach is demonstrated with a case study showing how wells in an old gas field, which were shut-in because of sand production, were recompleted using the sand failure prediction and design capabilities of the methodology presented to restore production, sand-free, to former rates   1  importance of sand failure  sand failure can have a severe impact on the economics of an oil or gas field  erosion of down-hole or surface components by sand can lead to loss of integrity and hydrocarbon leakage  production rates from screenless completions may need to be reduced to limit solids either flowing to surface or filling the wells  sand handling, either at surface or flushing from downhole, adds expense to lifting costs   sand failure and production can be a problem from the start of production if low sand strength or a high state of stress are not appreciated  alternatively, early production may be sand-free, but as a reservoir depletes solids production can begin  sand production either immediately or at some later stage in the life of the field may require costly intervention, management or retrofitting of exclusion devices (andrews et al , 2005; rawlins and hewett, 2007)  as the number of fields around the world with weak or depleted sand reservoirs increases, these experiences are likely to become more widespread  bp, for example, estimates that more than 60% of its production comes from sand-prone reservoirs (liou, 2014)  to manage the economics of a field and minimise capital expenditure, it is useful to know at the outset whether sand failure is a significant risk  this allows decisions to be made on the most effective completion strategy to manage sand failure for the life of the field | 
2017-0601 	 solid-particulate diverter optimization: coupling perforation-scale particle transport to field-scale fracturing simulation |abstract: recently, industry has been using degradable solid particulate diverters with greater frequency in fracturing, refracturing, and acidizing operations  the main purpose of using diverters is to distribute the stimulation fluid uniformly between all clusters to enhance the ultimate production efficiency  however, although operators have been deploying this technology on a more widespread basis, they have not been as focused on the underlying mechanisms, physics and controlling parameters  the aim of this study is to use perforation-scale models to better understand particulate system plugging under downhole conditions and couple it to reservoir-scale simulations to thoroughly investigate the process and optimize the operational parameters accordingly  the proposed design engine and workflow enables operators to simulate multiple diversion scenarios, to compare the resulting fracture geometries, to assess stimulation efficiency, and to investigate the effect of diversion design on the production performance  based on a field case study, our geomechanical analyses indicate that we can optimize the diverter design and customize operational parameters to enhance fracturing efficiency  through accurate diverter design, operators are better equipped to develop uniform fractures from all planned clusters   1  introduction  hydraulic fracturing and multistage completions along horizontal wells are widely used to improve hydrocarbon productivity from permeability-challenged formations  during a typical hydraulic fracturing operation, fracturing fluid is injected into a wellbore and penetrates a target formation above the formation pressure  depending on the completion and pumping strategy, single or multiple tensile fractures can be initiated from wellbore wall and then extended into the target layers  recent industry practices in north america have demonstrated the success of hydraulic fracturing technology for economic production from low- permeability reservoirs   induced-fracture characteristics and quality (such as length, height, extent, and conductivity) dictate the effectiveness of a hydraulic fracturing operation  however, several field cases indicate that only a limited number of planned clusters can contribute to the overall production [1, 2]  this anomaly can be attributed primarily to hydraulic fracture initiation and propagation in the near-wellbore and far-field regions | 
2017-0602 	 2d and 3d numerical modeling of fault reactivation |abstract: variations of internal pressure within reservoirs structurally compartmentalized by sealing faults induce changes in deformations and stresses  if these changes are significant, they can create favorable conditions for fault reactivation by shear or tensile modes  in that scenario, the conditions that develop within reactivated fault zones can trigger potential geomechanical problems such as oil exudation, seismicity and loss of casing integrity  therefore, it is necessary to forecast the geomechanical behavior of the field and establish limits for pressure changes within the reservoir  this paper deals with a methodology for the evaluation of fault reactivation and fluid migration, using 2d and 3d finite element models  in these models, discrete faults are introduced through zero thickness interface elements  the reactivation mechanisms and fluid migration are controlled by the mohr-coulomb plastification criterion  2d and 3d geomechanical models of a field with a set of faults were built in order to compare their predictions  according to the results, different injection pressure limits can be obtained using 2d and 3d models  furthermore, the 3d configuration of faults that intersect each other can create preferential flow paths for migration of fluids which are not observed in simplified 2d models   1  introduction  oil and gas reservoirs structurally compartmentalized by sealing geological faults are found in different fields of the world  during the production phase, the sealing of stable faults can be compromised by the strains triggered by pressure changes within the reservoir  those strains together with the geomechanical properties and the geometrical configuration of the rocks and faults, can alter significantly the stress state  consequently, sealing faults can become reactivated or hydraulically conductive, causing potential geomechanical problems related to exudation, casing integrity among others (segall et al , 1994; morton, r , 2006; chan & zoback, 2007)   in the literature, several approaches have been used in order to characterize and forecast fault reactivation through the establishment of limits for pressure changes within the reservoir  most of those approaches consider critical sections through 2d models  that avoids the use of complex domains and the high computational effort that the use of a 3d model demands  this strategy has been used by several researchers: cappa and rutqvist (2010), mendes et al  (2010), rutqvist et al  (2013), rueda (2014) and pereira et al  (2014) | 
2017-0603 	 stress cycling and fracture permeability of utica shale using triaxial direct-shear with x-ray tomography |abstract: while it is well appreciated that releasing stress from samples recovered from the subsurface must result in fracture relaxation and dilation, the impact of this on permeability is not well understood  a triaxial direct-shear experiment was performed to evaluate the impact of changing stress conditions on the permeability of a utica shale specimen  the intact specimen was equilibrated at 22 2 mpa isotropic stress and 23°c with pre-fracture permeability < 0 03 md  the specimen was fractured at 105 mpa direct-shear stress, as identified by stress drop and simultaneous x-ray imaging but with negligible effect on permeability  subsequent reduction of isotropic stress to 7 and 4 mpa resulted in a slight increase in permeability to 0 12 md  the specimen was then removed from the triaxial system but was preserved within its teflon sleeve  reinsertion into the triaxial device and retesting yielded permeability of 3 0 md at 2 mpa that then declined to 0 35 md at 8 mpa  concurrent x-ray tomograms showed significant increased fracture apertures after the initial removal of stress and these remained open during stress-reapplication  the release and reapplication of stress resulted in a fracture system that did not reproduce the original, in situ fracture properties   1  introduction  the permeability of fractured rock is a key parameter in evaluating the performance of geologic systems including oil and gas (hydraulic fracturing), co2 storage, nuclear waste disposal and geothermal energy  in these cases, the property of interest is the permeability of fractures at subsurface (in situ) conditions  in general, this cannot be directly measured or observed  in the field, effective permeability of fracture networks can be evaluated using pump tests; however, direct observations of individual fracture properties are limited to apertures, fracture density, etc , as inferred using techniques such as borehole imaging, samples recovered from the subsurface, and surface outcrop studies   laboratory studies of fracture-permeability relations are common and have produced very useful results (e g , cho et al , 2013; davy et al , 2007; edlmann et al  2013; zhang, 2013; zhang et al , 2013), but the fractures are generally produced by saw-cuts or brazilian testing methods that are unlikely to reproduce subsurface fracture properties  in some cases, natural fractures have been studied from borehole or outcrop samples (e g , gutierrez et al  2000); however, these fractures, as with the results of direct field observations of fractures, may have modified properties due to significant stress perturbations that result from the transit of the specimen from subsurface conditions to the laboratory |

2017-0624 	 modeling time-scaling creep deformation of unconsolidated sand |abstract: sand is a common granular geomaterial with significant practical importance in both civil engineering and petroleum geomechanics applications, and creep is an important time-dependent behavior of sand  various models have been proposed in the soil mechanics and granular media disciplines to simulate sand time-dependent behavior, but none have been found to be able to model the time-scaling behavior observed by dudley et al , 1998  this paper presents a substantial review of prior creep modeling efforts in the literature and describes a new model that uses an iterative stress-strain path dependent algorithm calibrated to a set of laboratory creep tests that use a stress step increase and hold period protocol that shows time scaling behavior  the loading and creep behavior are characterized by a normalized density (equation) at a given time t defined as the ratio of current density to the initial one (equation)  the model uses an iterative recursive algorithm of stress-normalized density dependency for both the stress increase and creep portions of the loading steps that is able to capture the complexity of the sand behavior  the creep stage behavior is explicitly modeled using a stretched exponential expression, which has the physical significance of an average macroscopic material response for the time dependent behavior of a large number of coupled elements with a spectrum of local relaxation times  the validity of the proposed algorithm is verified by applying the calibrated model to predict other independent tests that containing varying stress increments and hold periods  the incremental model predictions match very well the independent tests results as well as the entire set of experimental data   1  introduction  sand is a typical member of a wide class of geomaterials, and at the same time is the most commonly used example of a granular media  under certain conditions, it behaves like a solid, when a ‘jammed state’ is achieved, while in other conditions it can behave as a liquid or gas (although as a very unusual solid, liquid or gas) (chakraborty and behringer, 2009; biroli, 2007; goddard, 2014)  we present first in section 2 a substantial review of the modeling efforts of creep in sand to highlight the complexity and wide ranging work in this area, and provide perspective for the particular modeling strategy presented in this paper  section 3 summarizes the experimental unconsolidated sand creep data showing the time-scaling creep behavior previously reported by dudley et al , 1998  section 4 describes a new creep modeling strategy that is able to reproduce this time-scaling behavior, and its calibration to a subset of the test data  section 5 shows the calibrated model’s validation against measured data, including several substantially different tests not used in the model calibration  the paper concludes with a short summary discussion in section 6 |

2017-0627 	 nanoindentation studies on the mechanical properties of bakken formation |abstract: nanoindentation can measure the mechanical properties of samples with very small size  in this study, nanoindentation tests were performed on core samples from middle bakken formation  bedding directions were marked, and nanoindentation tests measured properties of samples parallel and perpendicular to bedding  the measurement results were summarized and compared for the perpendicular indentation and parallel indentation on samples  in addition, mineral composition analysis and scanning electron microscope (sem) with energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (eds) analysis were performed to characterize the microfabric of the samples, and the morphology, size and distribution of the pores for bakken samples  this work is especially useful for the optimization of the drilling activities, as well as the hydraulic fracturing operations in bakken   1  introduction  the bakken formation is one of the oil-bearing strata in the williston basin and it underlies parts of north dakota, montana, saskatchewan, and manitoba (figure 1)  the devonian-mississippian age bakken formation consists of three members: the upper bakken is about 20 ft thick black marine shale; the middle bakken is 30-80 ft thick interbedded layer of limestone, siltstone, dolomite, and sandstone; and the lower bakken is 10-50 ft thick black marine shale (lefever, 2005)   bakken formation is overlaid by the mississippian age lodgepole limestone formation and is underlaid by the devonian age as shown in figure 2  the lithology of the middle bakken varies somewhat unpredictably from a light-to-medium gray, very-dolomitic fine-grained siltstone to a very silty, fine-crystalline dolomite (wang and zeng, 2011)  dark carbonaceous mottles and partings are commonly present  the middle member is often faintly laminated, and occasionally contains fine- scale cross-bedding (wang and zeng, 2011)  the hydrocarbon source rocks are the upper and lower members, which are organic-rich, with total organic carbon (toc) content ranging from 12 to 36 wt%, average 25 to 28 wt% over large portions of the basin (tran et al , 2011)  the middle bakken member, which is the primary oil target, is an organic-lean interval  the average depth of the middle bakken is about 10,000 ft  the porosity of the middle bakken is about 6% and the permeability averages 0 001-0 01 md or less  water saturation varies between 25% and 50% in the middle bakken (cherian et al , 2012)  the average oil gravity is about 42 °api  gas oil ratio (gor) ranges from 507 to 1,712 scf/bbl, and the bubble point pressure varies from 1,617 to 3,403 psi (nojabaei et al , 2013)  the bakken formation is variably overpressured with pressure gradients up to 0 73 psi/ft in the central part of the basin (meissner, 1978) | 
2017-0628 	 artificial neural network modeling of contact electrical resistance profiles for detection of rock wall joint behavior |abstract: the contact area and stress distribution along rock wall joints, play an important role in the behavior and mechanical properties of the rock mass in mining and tunneling  although properties of rock fractures such as aperture, roughness, filling, contact area, and orientation are highly significant, limited effective methods exist for their investigation at a fundamental level  in this study, laboratory contact electrical resistance profiles are generated for limestone samples, and correlated with uniaxial compression stress measurements  further, the observed paired resistance-stress laboratory results are simulated using an artificial neural network  methods, results and analyses are presented to provide insights about complex processes involved in rock wall joint behavior   1  introduction and background  rock joints are important factors influencing rockmass properties, and significant experience and knowledge is required to make estimates of geologically disturbed rock mass properties (hopkins, d  l , 2000)  irregular discontinuities, especially mining-induced fractures behind excavations, can pose large hazards toward mine or tunnel safety  however, there are currently limited approaches used effectively to detect the rock wall joint behavior beyond the exposed surface   electrical resistivity measurements are widely used as an important tool for exploring minerals, fluid content, porosity and degree of water saturation in rocks and soils (loke et al  2013)  in mining and tunneling area, great research efforts have been conducted on the electrical properties of rocks, and the influencing factors of electrical such as water content, stress, fractures and temperature had been recognized (brace et al , 1966, 1967, brown, s r  1986)  for instance, an order of magnitude of changes was observed when saturated rock samples were stressed to fracture from a wide variety of rocks (brace and orange, 1966)  moreover, resistivity of saturated rock samples under compressive stress rises or falls very slightly before half of the peak stress, and it falls rapidly after samples reaching 90% of the peak stress  this large decrease of resistivity results from new-created porosity in a saturated rock (brace and orange, 1968)  water content is the dominant factor affecting electrical resistivity of rocks, thus additional efforts on electrical resistivity of rocks can be done to correlate electrical resistivity with porosity, water content and conductivity of rockmass | 
2017-0630 	 water flow and rock mass coupling analysis of debris flow on a rock slope by dda and mps (moving particle simulation) method |abstract: slope failure is often caused by heavy rain fall and it crashes into small pieces with water  however, this process could not be solved by conventional fem  in this paper we introduce discontinuous dda (discontinuous deformation analysis) and particle mps (moving particle simulation) analysis to solve a complex solid and fluid interaction problem, especially rock and water mixed debris flow  this study presents a new approach in which rock block movement is solved by dda and water flow inside the rock mass is solved by mps (moving particle simulation) method separately  then they are coupled in the calculation to account for the mutual interaction  to analyze the coupling between the water flow and the falling blocks of rock, this study introduces the equivalent external forces for the falling blocks of rock caused by the water flow  the velocities are calculated for the fluid flow based on mps  mps analyzes the part of fluid alone and dda analyzes the part of solid alone to set the initial state of the analysis  after the results is superimposed, the coupling analysis is carried out   1  introduction  topographically the mountainous area in japan occupy about 70% of the whole country and the earthquake and volcanic activities is very dynamic  the disaster due to earthquake and heavy rain has occurred frequently  in particular, the scale of slope disaster due to heavy rain tends to increase in recent years  many researchers and the government have tried to predict the occurrence and damage of slope disasters  the analytic method also has been applied to the estimation of the damage, however it is not always successful  one of the reason is considered that continuum method such as fem is applied to analyze the phenomenon with large movement and a breakdown occurring in slope disasters  on the other hand, discontinuous method such as discontinuous deformation analysis (dda) (shi and goodman, 1989) and distinct element method (dem) (cundall, 1971) has also been used as analyses methods of the slope disasters  however, these methods cannot handle the mixed body of fluid and solid material appropriately  it is known that the water explicitly affect stability of rock slope and debris flow is a mixture of water and rock blocks   recently, a particle method, which is one of mesh free methods, has been used to analyze water movement  the particle method is simple but powerful method to solve the problem of fluid mechanics  in this paper we introduce the discontinuous dda and particle mps (moving particle simulation) analysis to solve a complex solid and fluid interaction problem, especially rock and water mixed debris flow  in the analysis of the coupling between the water flow and falling blocks of rock, the equivalent external for the falling blocks of rock caused by the water flow is introduced | 
2017-0634 	 numerical simulation of roadway squeezing due to time-dep strength degradation |abstract: in underground coal mining practice, a majority of rocks are composed of clay minerals  when roadways are placed in them, clay minerals are exposed to water and humidity and will absorb water rapidly and generate pressures that can break apart the weakly bonded rock, leading to a progressive strength degradation and consequently a severe closure (i e , squeezing) of the roadway  in this study, numerical simulation was carried out to investigate the mechanisms of roadway squeezing using udec trigon approach  the strength degradation is simulated by gradually reducing the cohesion and tensile strength of the contacts between blocks in the udec trigon model  the strength is not reduced everywhere throughout the model but only at failed (either in tension or in shear) contacts because moisture is considered to intrude into rock through cracks  when a contact fails, its cohesion and tensile strength are gradually reduced as a function of calculation time  the numerical study aims to realistically capture the squeezing process of the surrounding rock mass of roadway due to strength degradation   1  introduction  in underground coal mining practice, a majority of rocks are composed of clay minerals, feldspar, quartz clastics, and a small fraction of other silicate and carbonate minerals  shales probably are the most common and can be composed of 50-80% clay materials (molinda and klemetti 2008)  clay materials have a platy structure and can absorb water  water absorption causes swelling, which may loosen bedding and break apart the flat- bedded material structure, resulting in rock deterioration (huang et al  1986)  considerable researches have been carried out to study the swelling characteristics of shale  the propensity for swelling is controlled by the mineralogical composition of the rock, for example the presence of swelling clay minerals and the higher the water absorption, the higher the degree of swelling (olivertra 1990)  huang et al  (1995) carried out a series of laboratory tests and the results showed that the temperature of the shale had the least influence on swelling of shale, while the air humidity and the moisture activity index had a significant influence  zhang et al  (2004) found that the low strength of shale is also correlated with low young's modulus and low shear strength | 
2017-0635 	 properties and formation of mineralized veins in an organic-rich shale formation |abstract: an earlier paper defined mineral and organic matter constituents in weak interfaces in shale formations (ptaszynska, et  al , 2016)  the formation studied in the earlier work and here is the jurassic, early-cretaceous vaca muerta formation in the neuquen basin in argentina  in this earlier work, mineralized "veins" were noted to be prevalent and complicated, sometimes being shear weak interfaces while in other cases they were not  this work looks specifically at the formation mechanisms and composition chemistry of the veins, to better understand why some are planes of weakness  this work shows how observations from core samples of the direction of crystal growth and the vein composition can help predict weak or strong interfaces, and suggests that ultimately high-resolution borehole logs may be better able to predict interfaces  the research focuses on understanding the planes of weakness, as it is now well accepted that such planes of weakness can significantly affect hydraulic fracture propagation during well completions  |1  introduction |experiments of hydraulic fracturing and observations of natural fracturing in outcrops indicate that rock fabric, particularly weak interfaces, plays a significant role in controlling fracture propagation and in the generation of branches or step-overs (thiercelin, 2005; jefferies, 2010; detournay, 2012; suarez-rivera, et al  2006; green, 2013; suarez-rivera et al , 2016; ptaszynska et al , 2016)  the interfaces suppress fracture height growth by absorbing hydraulic energy and are responsible for localized leak off (warpinski, 1987; suarez-rivera et al , 2011 & 2013; green, 2013 & 2014; ptaszynska et al , 2016)  |weak interfaces tend to be the interface between hard and soft sediments  the interfaces are frequent in mudstone reservoirs and exist at multiple scales  the regularity of these interfaces is dependent on the cyclical nature of geological processes  the interfaces between the formation layers may be narrow or thick, abrupt or transitional, depending also on specific conditions of deposition (green, 2013; ptaszynska et al , 2016; suarez-rivera et al , 2016) | 
2017-0636 	 wave propagation in a medium with cavities |abstract: numerical tools were developed which are able to address acoustic wave propagation in dry and saturated porous media  lattice methods, namely the lattice boltzmann method (lbm) and the lattice spring model (lsm), can be successfully used for this purpose  the resulting code can upscale porous media properties or study direct time simulations in complex media  only the second application is detailed here  various media which contain or not a cavity, which possess uniform properties or not, which are flat or not are generated; an explosion is simulated and the accelerations are measured at the surface  the data show that when the medium is simple, the cavity can be easily located, which is not the case when it is random in volume or in surface   1  introduction  propagation of acoustic waves in saturated porous media is of large theoretical and practical interest in many areas of engineering  these studies were initiated by biot (1956a,b) for low- and high-frequency acoustic waves propagating in a porous medium made of an elastic solid material saturated by a viscous compressible fluid   in order to avoid time dependence, the problem can be addressed by the homogenization theory (boutin and auriault, 1990; sanchez-palencia, 1980) in statistically homogeneous saturated porous media  a series of local problems defined on the unit cell are solved and the solutions are averaged over the unit cell in order to calculate the macroscopic parameters characterizing the porous medium, namely the effective stiffness tensor, the dynamic permeability, and the coefficients describing the reaction of the solid matrix to the fluid pressure  then, the generalized christoffel equation (malinouskaya, 2007) is solved in order to calculate the macroscopic acoustic velocities  the three macroscopic propagation modes can be predicted   the direct simulation of the propagation of acoustic waves through saturated (or not) porous media can be done by using lsm and lbm  this approach is adopted here in order to analyze the influence of cavities on wave propagation | 
2017-0638 	 thermal convection in a 3d fractured porous medium |abstract: thermal convection is numerically computed in 3d fluid saturated fractured porous media  fractures are inserted as 2d convex polygons, which are randomly located  the fluid is assumed to satisfy 2d and 3d darcy's law in the fractures and in the porous medium, respectively; exchanges take place between these two structures  after some necessary comparisons with results relative to homogeneous porous media, systematic calculations are performed for rayleigh numbers up to 150 for various values of the fracture density and the fracture aperture  the increase in output flux with fracture density is found to be linear over the range of fracture density tested  moreover, the importance of the percolating character of the fracture network is emphasized  finally, the effective medium approach is found to be precise only for small or large fracture densities   1  introduction  simulation of natural convection in homogeneous porous media has attracted attention for many years (horton and rogers, 1945; lapwood, 1948; nield, 1968; combarnous and bories, 1974)  to these few citations, many could be added  in contrast, only a few references can be cited for studies of natural convection through fractured porous media (kolditz, 1995; blocher et al , 2010; bataille et al , 2006)   recently, detailed determination of flow through fractured porous media has been successfully addressed and adler et al , 2012 provide a systematic account of this theoretical and numerical effort   the present work is also based on a three-dimensional discrete description of the fracture network and of the embedding matrix  isotropic fracture networks are modeled, and the matrix is permeable   our main objective is to provide quantitative information about the influence of the network parameters such as the dimensionless fracture transmissivity and the dimensionless fracture density on the heat released by the whole system   another objective is to assess the validity of an homogeneous approach where the fractured porous medium is replaced by an homogeneous medium | 
2017-0641 	 a numerical study on the effect of loading and randomness on fracture patterns in a tight formation |abstract: hydraulic fracturing has been the most common approach to stimulate tight formations  the geometry of the wellbore and the time history of the hydraulic loading play important roles in induced fracture patterns  for example, generating multiple perforations in a wellbore is nowadays attracting more attention in oil industry to enhance gas recovery  the increased number of fractures can potentially enhance the yield of a reservoir by increasing the regions affected by hydraulic fractures  we use an h-adaptive spacetime discontinuous galerkin method and an interfacial damage model to study the conditions for which the induced hydraulic fractures become effective and propagate in rock  our results show that as the loading rate decreases, only a few of these fractures will propagate  as the loading rate increases, more perforations become active, until ultimately all result in crack propagation  moreover, higher loading rates affect larger zones for each of the initial perforations by dynamic fracture features such as microcracking and crack bifurcation  our study mainly focuses on stimulation techniques that induce fully dynamic loading on rocks; for example, high explosives detonate and sends a shock wave in rock  given the limitations of hydraulic fracturing technique, we study the effectiveness of a hybrid approach where initial perforations similar to those for hydraulic fracturing are used as seeds of crack propagation under dynamic loading  finally for very high rates of loading, we demonstrate that a stochastic approach for crack nucleation predicts more realistic fracture patterns than conventional approaches that assume a macroscopically uniform fracture strength for rock   1 introduction  generating fractures in deep and tight formations has received a high priority in oil industry to enhance the productivity of low permeability reservoirs which are already in operation  the induced fractures interacting with natural fractures form an interface with rock matrix and the borehole to facilitate the oil extraction  in fact, fracture volume induced by a stimulation technique is negligible in comparison with the total reservoir volume; however, they provide an interface with matrix which is larger than the borehole  as a result, very small permeability values are sufficient for production in a fractured tight formation  therefore, the formation of fracture networks with a widespread pattern is a critical key in increasing production of tight oil reservoirs  some geological factors highly affect the formation of fracture networks: rock mineral composition, rock mechanical properties, natural fractures and stress field  the orientation of the natural fractures and the stress anisotropy in fractured formations highly affect the propagation of the hydraulic fracture and the formation of fracture networks [1, 2] | 
2017-0642 	 simulation of refracture and contact mode transitions in tight formations |abstract: transitions between separation and contact modes are prevalent in rock mechanics  for stimulating tight hydrocarbon reservoirs, the transfer of hydraulic load from hydraulically loaded to in-situ cracks, removal of hydraulic load, re-fracturing, and application of cyclic loading are all examples involving contact and separation mode reversal  we propose an interfacial damage model that incorporates all contact and separation modes by combining their corresponding dynamically consistent riemann solutions  instead of commonly used penalty method and lagrange multiplier approach we propose a new regularization scheme—based on the interface displacement and separation velocity jumps— that smoothens contact-separation mode transitions, remedies ill-conditioning that may arise by using penalty methods, and provides a tunable maximum penetration  in addition, we propose an aperture-based regularization approach that enables smooth transfer of hydraulic load to in-situ cracks  numerical results, obtained by an h-adaptive spacetime discontinuous galerkin method, demonstrate accurate modeling of contact mode transitions and intersection of cracks in hydraulic fracturing   1 introduction  given that rocks are often under confinement pressure, contact and friction play a critical role in rock mechanics  for problems involving crack propagation and intersection, transitions between separation, contact-stick, and contact-slip may occur  there are specifically several examples in the area of hydrocarbon reservoir characterization and stimulation  in hydraulic fracturing the interaction of a hydraulically loaded crack with in-situ cracks can result in various mode transitions for both cracks  for example, the hydraulically loaded crack can be arrested or change direction by the in-situ crack or penetrate through it  the fluid flow can also be diverted into the in-situ crack, in which case it experiences a contact to separation mode transition; cf  [1] for the review of such intersections and the types of mode transitions that may be involved   the inverse of the aforementioned mode transition, i e , separation to contact mode transition, occurs when the hydraulic load is released and crack surface are pulled back together  understanding this transition, and the transition back to separation mode due to the re-application of hydraulic load becomes important in refracting applications; cyclic application of the loads that better stimulate a reservoir, as in [2,3], or re-fracturing a reservoir to reactivate hydraulic cracks or increase its productivity, cf  [4], are some applications that involve contact mode transitions | 
2017-0643 	 fracture modeling of rocks based on random field generation and simulation of inhomogeneous domains |abstract: realistic fracture simulations in rock as a heterogeneous brittle material with significant inherent randomness, require the use of models that incorporate its inhomogeneities and statistical variability  since brittle materials do not match ductile materials in dissipating energy in the bulk, their fracture response is highly dependent on the stochastic microscale distribution and strength of defects  the high dependence of their fracture progress on microstructural defects results in wide scatter in their ultimate strength and the so-called size effect  our approach for incorporating randomness in rocks is based on the modeling of stochastic volume elements (sves)  although representative volume elements (rves) are more commonly used in solid mechanics, sves are more appropriate for fracture analysis since they ensure that the material randomness is maintained  they still average microscale features similar to rves, and provide a more economical solution approach than those methods that explicitly model all microcracks in rock  to create a random field for macroscopic fracture strength field, we first generate several realizations of rock with a prescribed crack density and distribution  sves are then constructed with their centers at known spatial position on these random realizations  next, by using a moving window approach, where the sve traverses the known positions in these random realizations, we obtain first and second moments of the target random field  point-wise probability distribution function and spatial covariance function are derived and used to generate consistent realizations of random fields based on the karhunen-loeve (kl) method  finally, such realizations will be used for the analysis of dynamic stimulation of a wellbore in a tight formation  a powerful and mesh adaptive spacetime discontinuous galerkin finite element method is used for dynamic fracture simulations   1 introduction  rocks, having highly random solid aggregates structure, are inhomogeneous at various scales  at microscale, heterogeneity is due to the presence of microcracks, granular microstructures which can include a large number of randomly oriented zones of potential failure in the form of grain boundaries  at macroscale, inherent homogeneity is the results of the matrix containing different rock types, and weak features such as faults and fracture networks  rock inhomogeneities are crucial as they affect the continuum level mechanical characteristics such as strength, toughness, and elasticity properties of the material  these heterogeneities imposed by the rocks microstructure greatly influence the material peek and post-instability responses [1]  this is most evident in (quasi)brittle materials as they lack energy dissipative mechanisms to re-balance stresses induced by microscale stress concentrations  another key aspect of brittle fracture, related to its dependence on material microstructure, is that for the same geometry and loading condition various crack patterns, ultimate loads, and absorbed energies can be experienced [2-5]  these observations emphasize the importance of including randomness in material properties of rock in its fracture analysis | 
2017-0644 	 phase-field modeling of fracture in co2 sequestration |abstract: this work studies fracture propagation in the encasements of wellbores, and how extreme pore pressures and pressure rates affect their damage states  the initiation and evolution of fractures in poroelastic media often gives rise to discontinuous fields within computational problems  such models present computational challenges due to the complexity of sharp discontinuities that arise during the finite element solution and also lack the ability to model fracture initiation  these challenges may be alleviated by using a phase field formulation of fracture mechanics, which introduces a continuous, diffusive scalar damage field around crack surfaces  we make use of a direct computation of the crack’s width, or joint opening, by using the gradient of the phase field in the damaged area  this is useful for determining the material’s fluid-mechanical properties, such as the calculation of poiseuille-type flow that occurs within a sufficiently damaged medium  using this approach, it can be shown that the evolution of such fractures in a porous medium can contribute to the material’s permeability, hence coupling fluid flow and damage within a material  conversely, the movement of fluids through a damaged solid can influence the material’s fracture distribution driven by pore pressures, meaning that there is a two-way coupling of damage and fluid flow  using the sierra mechanics code suite at sandia national laboratories, a phase-field model of fracture is developed which will allow a loose, two-way coupling of these physics for future implementations  we find the model’s ability to predict fractures initiated and propagated by increasing pore pressure to be consistent with fractures that occur from fluid injections  we also find that the joint openings calculated with this model will be helpful for implementing poiseuille flow along fractures   1  introduction  1 1 motivation  the coupled physics of pressurized fluids in porous rock and fracture propagation is essential in subsurface rock mechanics  applications in fields such as hydrology deal with the distributions of contaminants in groundwater, which are often dependent on fracture distributions in the earth’s crust, and the phenomenon of fluid induced fault activation is of great interest in the field of geophysics  the concept of carbon sequestration is contingent upon pressurized fluids, and co2, being contained within poroelastic substrates of the subsurface  in martinez and newell, 2015, it is shown that under certain pressure conditions, co2 and brine will flow along existing joints and faults when an injection occurs at depth  this implies that the co2 intended to be sequestered may leak over time | 
2017-0646 	 applications of the acoustic emission/microseismic monitoring technique in the mining industry |abstract: the acoustic emission/microseismic (ae/ms) monitoring technique continue to play a major role in providing a safe environment for mine operations  be it a surface or underground mine operation, the life and safety of miners is constantly under threat due to uncertainties associated with rock mass stability as mining proceeds  therefore, performing routine ae/ms monitoring in mines leads to the establishment of areas in the mine that are susceptible to seismicity  in this paper, a review of the utilization and importance of the ae/ms monitoring technique as a modern day tool for the improvement of mine safety is provided  the review highlights a brief history, characteristics and objectives of the technique, requirements for an efficient system, and the benefits of the ae/ms technique  also one case study showing successful utilization of the technique is provided  it can be concluded that the discovery of the technology has gone a long way to improve safety monitoring especially in underground mines  again, the reviewed literature showed that major areas of application include but not limited to: the management of ground control problems; mine rescue operations; rockburst studies; verification of mine design and ground control measures as well as risk management   1  introduction  the ae/ms monitoring technique has been and continue to be used widely in the mining industry for slope stability studies in surface mines as well as ground control, rockburst and coal bump monitoring in underground mines  the life and safety of miners are constantly under threat due to uncertainties associated with rock mass stability as mining proceeds  therefore, performing routine ae/ms monitoring in mines lead to the establishment of areas in the mine that are susceptible to seismicity  the information acquired during such monitoring activities can then be used as a planning tool for the prevention and control of possible rock mass instabilities which could lead to rockburst or slope failure (mendecki et al , 1999, mendecki et al , 2010)  mine operations in general involve the breaking and moving of material  as such, the occurrence of seismicity is a regular feature in mine operations  operations in mines notable for producing ae/ms events include (swanson et al , 2008):| 
2017-0647 	 a block oriented cutting algorithm for three-dimensional discontinuous deformation analysis |abstract: discontinuous deformation analysis (dda) is one of the most important numerical methods in rock engineering  the two-dimensional dda has been testified and widely applied in slope stability analysis, underground excavation, etc  however, the development of three-dimensional dda had been slow down due to its complexity  one of the intricate problems is lacking an efficient algorithm to build the computing model of rock systems, especially large-scale rock systems with tens of thousands of blocks  to address this problem, this paper presents a new block oriented cutting algorithm for three-dimensional dda  based on the geographical information, the computational domain and discontinuities, especially faults and joints represented by finite and infinite polygons, are generated at first  then, through sequentially introducing all the discontinuities, the computing model was generated and could be applied for deformation, stability, fluid flow and or coupled analysis  compared with traditional algorithms, the proposed algorithm possessed several advantages such as lower algorithm complexity, better data independence and extremely convenient when dealing with re-cutting project   1  introduction  rock masses, consist of numerous complex rock blocks, play an important role in the field of rock engineering  discontinuities in the rock masses possess irregular spatial distribution, size and orientation but usually follow probabilistic distributions  the discontinuities, especially faults and joints, have a considerable effect on the stability of the rock systems  rock masses divided by intricate discontinuities into smaller rock blocks  thus, rock blocks vary in size, shape and other geographical information  for the purpose of dda computing, a throughout blocks model should be generated at first  the model requires a realistic computing model that should explicitly reflect the rock masses’ complete internal structures, intricate topological information and complicated geological data   broadly, based on how to introduce discontinuities, there exist two approaches to generate blocks system models to represent the rock mass  the first approach is based on sequential subdivision (zhang et al , 2013; boon et al , 2015), it means discontinuities are introduced sequentially  each step just introduce one discontinuity  as shown in figure 1, the first two figures is the result of instructing one joint, and the following two figures is the result of introducing next serval arbitrary joints  this approach mainly consist of two steps  firstly, if one introduced discontinuity intersects with the original block, that block will be divided into two new separate blocks  this operation continues step by step till all discontinuities have been used  as more discontinuities introduced, the number of blocks increases  however, the generated blocks are all convex because this method supposed that each of the discontinuities could divide the block into two separate blocks  so next step aim to contrast more complex block based on the basic convex blocks that we got  in order to generate concave blocks and form more accurate block system model, the finiteness of discontinuities are considered  thus some of the convex blocks combine to become concave blocks  by this means, the data structure of every block is maintained throughout the cutting process, which is very useful when apply this model to dda or dem  however, if large amount of the discontinuities is finite, it would be quite time-consuming to generate the final blocks system model | 
2017-0650 	 a new software for block theory and its applications in rock engineering |abstract: block theory has been invented for more than 30 years, and has become a basic theory in rock engineering  but there is still no mature software based on block theory, which will greatly restrict its development and application  considering this, the paper presents software architecture and implements it as software easykbt  “easykbt” is designed for underground- excavation analysis and slope analysis, and uses computing kernels of classic block theory programs developed by dr  shi as computing core  the software has merits as follows: firstly, software architecture for block theory is designed, and modules of which are reorganized according to the architecture that users can use them seamlessly; secondly, easykbt provides user-friendly interfaces, which reduce the difficulty of learning and using block theory; thirdly, parameters are explained in detail; fourthly, analysis results of the modules are exported automatically which is convenient for users   1  introduction  block theory (goodman and shi, 1985) has been invented for more than 30 years, and has become a basic theory in rock engineering  taking advantages of its practical and simple features, it has been widely recognized by industry  the classic block theory (goodman and shi, 1985) has developed rather mature, so the later researchers made some additions (zhang and wu, 2005; li et  al , 2010) to it, but most of the researchers just use block theory to analyze block stabilities in specific cases (elmouttie and poropat, 2010; daz et  al , 2005; chun et  al , 2005; zhang and wu, 2007)  although block theory has such advantages, lacking mature software for it has greatly restricts its development and application  there are 11 block theory programs developed by dr  shi, one of the inventors of this theory, that all use ascii files as input with different format  furthermore, some programs are related to the others  users need to understand the parameters of every module and know the relationships between these modules, which is not convenient and error prone  considering this, this paper presents software architecture for block theory and implements it as software easykbt: (1)the software reorganizes and encapsulates computing kernels of 8 key programs: 4 tunnel modules, 2 slope modules and 2 block stability analysis modules; (2) this software gives short explanation for every parameter, analyses the relationships between modules and designs a computing architecture for the 8 modules; (3) the software provides user friendly graphical user interface (fig  1) that can help users do block theory analysis seamlessly; (4) analysis results of the modules are exported automatically which is convenient for printing | 
2017-0651 	 in-situ stress measurement at 1550-meters depth at the kismet test site in lead, s d  |abstract: we conducted a series of in situ stress measurements in a 100-meter deep hole (kismet 003) drilled vertically from the 4850-ft level (1478-meters depth) of the sanford underground research facility (surf) located in lead, south dakota  we used the method of hydraulic fracturing for in situ stress measurements (haimson and cornet, 2003) at total overburden depths between 1520 and 1550 meters the minimum horizontal stress magnitudes were taken to be the shut-in pressures obtained from dp/dt analysis (lee and haimson, 1989) of pressurization cycles 3 and 4 in each test  the values ranged between 20 0 and 24 1 mpa (2900 and 3494 psi), and averaged 21 7 mpa (3146 psi)  the direction of maximum principal stress was obtained from analysis of an acoustic borehole televiewer log following the hydraulic fracturing  the fractures are striking at an average of n86°e with a dip of 78° to the southeast  the fact that the fractures are not following foliation but have a non-vertical, though very steep, dip indicates that one of the principal stresses may be inclined slightly off vertical   1  introduction  the university of wisconsin-madison, sandia national laboratories, and lawrence berkeley national laboratory conducted hydraulic fracturing and stimulation experiments as part of the kismet project (oldenburg et al , 2016, 2017) sponsored by the u s  department of energy (doe) subter (subsurface technology and engineering research, development and demonstration) cross-cut initiative  the kismet experiments meet objectives in subter’s “stress” pillar and the “new subsurface signals” pillar by testing the monitoring of fracturing using active seismic, electrical resistivity tomography, and passive microseismic monitoring  the kismet facility is located at the 4850l (1478-m depth) in the west access drift near the davis campus of surf (fig  1)  the tests were conducted in the central hole, kismet-003 of a five-spot pattern (oldenburg et al , 2016, 2017)  the borehole is vertical with a 7 6 cm diameter and 100-m length located in the zone of precambrian metamorphic phyllite | 
2017-0652 	 estimation of rock in-situ strength using rock strength borehole probe (rsbp) |abstract: one of the main parameters that is commonly used for the rock mass characterization is the uniaxial compressive strength (ucs) of the intact rock  this parameter is conventionally measured by diamond drilling to obtain core, and testing core samples in the laboratory, which is an expensive and time consuming process  it would be ideal if the strength of the intact rock could be estimated in the field as an in-situ measurement by running a device inside a borehole  estimation of the rock strength by scratch tests has been reasonably accurate  application of this concept for the assessment of rock strength in a borehole has led to development of a borehole strength measurement probe, namely rock strength borehole probe (rsbp)  rsbp is designed to scratch the surface of rock with a miniature disc cutter inside a relatively slim borehole  the cutting forces are measured and used to estimate the rock strength  this paper discusses the background theories and experimental tests conducted for development of the rsbp, along with formulas developed for estimating the compressive and tensile strengths of the intact rocks  the rsbp probe and its components are briefly explained, and the observations from the initial field experiments with this probe are discussed in this paper   1  introduction  good understanding of rock mass behavior is essential for engineering design of structures in rock mass and related geomechnical analyses  the proper use of rock mass models allows for obtaining meaningful outputs for safe design practices  one of the key properties of intact rock, which is widely used for assessment of rock mass properties and its behavior, is its compressive strength  conventionally, rock strength is measured by testing core samples that are obtained from exploration boreholes or drilling into boulders collected from outcrops  despite all the efforts and costs, the results may not necessarily show the behavior of the intact rock in the field since the test cannot provide the in-situ condition of the ground  moreover, the tested samples are solely representative of few locations along the borehole  moreover, there is always a time lag between the field work and the time where the results could become available for design purposes  therefore, the ideal solution is to measure the rock strength in-situ, and preferably inside closely placed drill holes | 
2017-0653 	 damage quantification of the surrounding rock mass in deep underground cavern group |abstract: numerous hydropower projects build the underground powerhouses in southwest china subject to the topography conditions and structure layout  the underground powerhouse is one of the most significant structures that will be permanent in use  large scale excavation usually poses a threat to the stability of the underground powerhouse and the surrounding rock mass damage is required to be qualified for excavation schedule and support design  various methods such as displacement measurement, acoustic wave test and numerical calculation have been used to quantify the rock mass damage  as a new monitoring method in hydropower underground powerhouse, the microseismic (ms) monitoring technique has been rarely used for quantifying surrounding rock mass damage  in the present study, an ms monitoring system was established to capture the microcracks induced by excavation of the underground powerhouse at the houziyan hydropower station and a damage-driven numerical model based on ms data is adopted to quantify the surrounding rock mass damage  the rock mass is degraded and simulated by a micromechanics-based constitutive model described by the fracture density, which is determined by the amount and size of the microcracks  the material property input for this model are young’s modulus, poisson’s ratio of the intact rock and the ms information such as the location and the source size calculated from seismic source parameters  a typical profile (#2 unit profile) of the underground powerhouse is selected for damage analysis  combined with field excavation process, the related ms data are imported to the numerical model for damage calculation  the results show that the surface displacement of each bench excavation of the underground powerhouse using the damage-driven numerical model is approximately 30-40 mm larger than that using the original elastic model  furthermore, the displacements of rock mass considering the effect of ms damage are in good agreement with the field measurement | 
2017-0654 	 stability analysis and failure evolution of large-scale underground caverns in layered rock masses from microseismic monitoring |abstract: to assess the stability of large-scale underground caverns excavated in a layered rock mass with layers dipping steeply inside the surrounding rock, a high-resolution microseismic monitoring system was carried out in the right underground powerhouse of the wudongde hydropower station in southwest china  the progressive processes of layered rock mass damage including the initiation, propagation, coalescence and interaction of rock micro-fractures, was first demonstrated by analyzing the temporal and spatial distribution of microseismic activities  meanwhile, the microseismic monitoring results were validated using conventional monitoring data and field observations  a typical failure of layered rock masses was fortunately monitored and the evolution of the microseismicity and its corresponding mechanism during the development of this studied failure were also obtained  the results can provide us an overall understanding of the progressive damage and failure evolution of large-scale underground openings in bedded rock masses   1  introduction  layered rock masses, formed by preexisting original materials on the earth crust, are distributed widely over land area  during the forming process of this kind of rock mass, differences in material composition, particle size, color and fabric result in rock stratification  consequently, one set of dominant and parallel discontinuities, called a bedding plane, are generated  as can be expected, well-developed geological discontinuities (i e  bedding planes) of layered rock strata play a vital role on the stability of layered rock-engineering projects and in particular on their modes of failure  hence, the mechanics of the failure mechanism in stratified rock masses has its own distinctive feature  in addition, many large-scale underground openings have to be constructed recently in stratified rock masses due to their universal distribution  therefore, it is of significance to study the failure modes and mechanism of underground openings in layered rock masses   macroscopic deformation or catastrophic failure of the surrounding rock masses usually resulted from the initiation, propagation and coalescence of micro-fractures inside the rock masses  therefore, it is crucial to effectively capture the micro-fractures for understanding the in situ failure process of rock masses  microseismic (ms) monitoring techniques, involving three-dimensional and real-time monitoring of seismic waves generated by the ruptures in rocks, have been successfully developed into an effective approach to understand the progressive damage and failure evolution of surrounding rock masses in many underground engineering projects  for instance, cai et al , (2001) quantified the rock mass damage in underground excavations from ms events that were monitored at the mine-by test tunnel of the canada atomic energy limited company  dai et al , (2016) and ma et al , (2016) investigated the failure mechanisms of surrounding rock masses during the construction phase of large-scale caverns, based on the temporal and spatial distribution of ms events  by analyzing the results of ms monitoring data, a field survey and scanning electron microscopy data, xiao et al , (2016) revealed the mechanism of evolution of stress-structure controlled collapses of surrounding rock in caverns  this suggests that the ms monitoring technique could be employed for better analyzing the stability of large-scale underground powerhouse caverns | 
2017-0655 	 comparison between numerical and experimental observations made in hydraulic fracturing tests |abstract: hydraulic fracturing is extensively used in hydrocarbon extraction and in engineered geothermal systems  however, many aspects involved in the initiation, propagation and interaction of existing and newly-created fractures are not clearly understood  since the data obtained from real-scale stimulations provide solely indirect information on the fracturing processes, laboratory and numerical analyses play a crucial role for better understanding the mechanisms involved in the hydraulic fracturing of rocks  |this paper compares the observations made in hydraulic fracturing experiments performed on prismatic granite specimens into which two flaws were precut, with finite element analyses  both the experiments and numerical analyses used specimens with the double-flaw geometry 2a-30-30 to which 1) only water pressure inside the flaws or 2) water pressure inside the flaws and an external vertical load were applied  two stages of crack development, namely crack initiation and crack coalescence, and the maximum and minimum principal stresses around one of the inner flaw tips, were assessed  |when no vertical load was applied, the hydraulic macro-fractures observed experimentally are tensile, and initiate from the tip end of the studied flaw and propagate to coalesce in the bridge between inner flaw tips  the numerical model results are consistent with these observations, since high tensile principal stresses occur at the tip end of the flaw and in the bridge between flaws  |on the other hand, when a vertical load of 5 mpa was applied, the hydraulic macro-fractures observed experimentally are tensile but initiate from the upper face of the flaw tip and propagate in a vertical direction and not towards the bridge between inner flaw tips  this is also consistent with the numerical results, since maximum tensile stresses only occur at the upper face of the flaw, and both maximum and minimum principal stresses are compressive in the bridge between inner flaw tips, a condition which would not lead to the development of tensile cracks|

2017-0663 	 discrete element modeling of micro-scratch tests on rocks altered by co2 |abstract: co2 geological sequestration can help mitigate greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere  the injection of co2 can alter mechanical properties of the host geological formation due to the interaction between co2, resident fluid in the pores, and rock minerals  however, the underlying mechanism responsible for such alterations are still not fully understood  this study explores mechanisms of rock alteration due to exposure to co2-rich brine through the modeling and analysis of micro-scratch tests  the discrete element method (dem) and bonded-particle model (bpm) are used to perform numerical modeling of the scratch test simulating a sphero-conical stylus scratch on a random packing of bonded spherical grains  the microscopic parameters used in dem/bpm are calibrated by conducting numerical triaxial compression tests  numerical results of the scratch test are compared against experimental results on entrada sandstone  scratch toughness is correlated positively with the cement bond size, which appears to be the most appropriate parameter to explain the alteration of entrada sandstone caused by co2  there appears to be a transition from brittle to ductile failure in the scratch failure mode as the bond size decreases  this work provides insight on how microscopic bond properties alters macroscopic mechanical properties of cemented sandstones   1  introduction  co2 capture and sequestration in deep geologic formations is considered as an economical and environmentally sound approach to mitigate anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel consumption  the injection of co2 into host formations will shift the subsurface geochemical conditions away from equilibrium  this shift can lead to reactions between rock minerals and co2-water mixtures (hovorka et al , 2006, 2013; bachu et al , 2007; carroll et al , 2011)  the petrophysical and geomechanical properties of reservoir and caprock formations at co2 storage sites can be significantly altered due to long-term contact with co2-rich brine (rutqvist and tsang, 2002; espinoza et al , 2011; rinehart et al , 2014; renard et al , 2008; rohmer et al , 2016)  chemo-mechanical coupled processes are expected to be triggered by co2 injection into brine aquifers  for example, chemically aided fracture growth could be a detriment to caprock integrity, facilitating leaks of buoyant co2 | 
2017-0664 	 conversion of dynamic mechanical property calculations to static values for geomechanical modeling |abstract: relationships between “dynamic” mechanical properties (calculated from seismic or acoustic log velocities) and “static” mechanical properties (measured during triaxial testing of core samples) are important because dynamic values are more prevelant and easier to obtain but static values are critical for geomechanical, reservoir, and completions modeling of likely deformation and stresses in the subsurface formations  a large number of studies over the past few decades have examined both the relationship between static and dynamic moduli and the causes of the differences between the moduli  we have compiled and analyzed the results from over 50 published studies to determine both a set of correlations to determine static moduli from dynamic measurements and to see if there is a consistent rationale for the differences between them  the correlations developed here can serve as a good “80% solution” to determine static properties from dynamic measurements when field specific data is not available   1  background  for perfectly elastic materials, the mechanical properties calculated from measured compressional and shear acoustic velocities through the materials (dynamic moduli) are the same as those calculated from measurements of strain response of the material due to an applied stress during standard triaxial compression testing (static moduli) (ledbetter, 1993)  however, nearly all geomaterials are not perfectly elastic and thus the dynamic properties calculated from log or seismic velocities can be quite different from static properties calculated from triaxial testing of core material   the static properties are much more indicative of the deformation that occurs in the subsurface due to the production or injection of fluids into the subsurface, the deformation of subsurface formations due to tectonically applied loads, or the removal of material from the subsurface due to mining  therefore, correlations between the dynamic and static properties are critical to using log or seismic based measurements to get a much wider understanding of mechanical properties in the subsurface than can be obtained from limited sampling and testing of core materials brought up from the subsurface  geomechanical modeling to predict deformation and stress development in the subsurface needs both the broad understanding of the variability of moduli throughout the subsurface formations of interest as well as the most accurate values of properteis representing the type of deformation being modeled | 
2017-0673 	 3d graphical visualization for block theory |abstract: block theory is one of the most important methods of stability analysis in computational rock mechanics  it uses whole-space stereographic projection as its principal means to reduce the dimensions of the problems from three to two, thus analyzing and solving them with graph tools  however, for the common technical personnel, the results of stereographic projection analysis are too abstract to understand and use  to solve this problem, a three-dimensional graphical visualization solution is presented in this paper, which restores the results back to the sphere in three-dimensional space and makes a clear visualization of the analysis process of block theory   1  introduction  as a direct object of slope, foundation and underground caverns, the rock mass is a kind of natural geological body, which has been subjected to various geological processes in the course of a long geological history and has retained various permanent deformation signs and geological structures in the interior  due to the existence of various joint planes in the rock mass which control the stability of the rock mass, the engineering rock mass is far from the continuous deformation body, and whether a method can be widely used in rock stability analysis depends largely on whether the joint planes of the rock mass are simulated and calculated in a reasonable way   block theory (also known as key block theory) is such an effective method for engineering rock mass stability analysis  since it was proposed and established by goodman and shi gen-hua, 1985, many researchers have promoted it from the joints geometric characteristics of distribution, physical properties, mechanical behavior of blocks and other factors (li et al , 2010)  combined with modern mathematical methods, they analyzed the stability of rock mass and recognized the law of deformation and failure process of rock mass, for providing scientific and reasonable suggestions for engineering planning, design, construction and reinforcement | 
2017-0677 	 effect of scalping on shear strength of aggregate |abstract: the scalping of crushed rock produced in a quarry is required to produce aggregates of a range of sizes, for various applications such as use in road pavements and retaining walls  large-scale (300 mm by 300 mm by up to 190 mm high) laboratory direct shear box tests were carried out on a crushed aggregate scalped to pass 75 mm, 37 5 mm, 19 mm, 9 5 mm, 4 75 mm and 2 36 mm, to study the effect of scalping on its shear strength  scalped specimens were air-dried and loosely-placed in the shear box to represent loose-dumping of dry aggregate in the field, and were then subjected to single-stage testing under applied normal stresses of 250 kpa, 500 kpa or 1000 kpa  in general, the failure envelopes obtained tended to flatten with increasing degree of scalping (i e , reducing maximum particle size)  both the inferred friction angle and the apparent cohesion tended to decrease with increasing degree of scalping  in addition, sieving analyses were carried out before and after the direct shear tests on the 75 mm, 37 5 mm, and 19 mm scalped specimens, to assess the degree of particle breakdown on loading and shearing  the results imply that small-scale laboratory testing of aggregates, necessitating scalped specimens, will generate conservative shear strength parameters   1  introduction  shear strength parameters of granular soil are commonly determined by carrying out single-stage laboratory direct shear tests; for example, according to astm d3080  the shear strength parameters are essential for safe design for many geotechnical applications, such as bearing capacity, lateral earth pressures on retaining walls and pavement design  however, mainly due to the relatively small scale of a conventional direct shear box (60 mm by 60 mm or 100 mm by 100 mm, and a height of only about 20 mm, in particular), granular soils often need to be scalped prior to testing, involving the removal of particles larger than a nominal maximum of five times the height of the shear box  this is to ensure that there will be sufficient particles over the height of the specimen to generate shear along the interface between the two halves of the direct shear box, without forcing shear through particles  when testing coarse-grained aggregates, a large-scale direct shear box is preferred over a small-scale direct shear box, since it better represents the full-scale samples (astm d5321; bauer and zhao 1993, alfaro et al  1995; bakeer et al  1998; yu et al  2006, abdelrahman et al  2008; nakao and fityus 2008; liu et al  2009a, b; arulrajah et al 2013)   the shear strength characteristics of coarse-grained aggregates are related to their particle size, shape, hardness, crushability, surface roughness and other aggregate properties (vallerga et al  1957; cerato and lutenegger 2006; wu et al  2008; gupta 2009; ueda et al  2011; wang et al  2013; kim and ha 2014)  given that scalping can significantly change the particle size distribution of the sample, it is expected that scalping would also impact the shear strength characteristics of aggregates  in this paper, the effect of scalping on the shear strength of aggregates was investigated by carrying out single-stage, large-scale direct shear tests on various scalpings under applied normal stresses of 250 kpa, 500 kpa or 1000 kpa  in addition, sieving analyses were carried out before and after the direct shear tests on selected scalpings to assess the degree of particle breakdown on loading and shearing under an applied normal stress of 1000 kpa | 
2017-0678 	 investigation of shear strength and breakdown of mine waste rock |abstract: to investigate the shear strength of mine waste rock, large-scale laboratory direct shear tests were carried out on breccia, weathered shale, breccia on weathered shale, and weathered shale on compacted clay, under applied normal stresses of 250 kpa, 500 kpa or 1000 kpa  the breccia, weathered shale and breccia on weathered shale samples were loosely-placed and tested dry, representing the bulk of the waste rock dump volume in the field  the weathered shale on compacted clay was tested under both dry and wet (the worst case) conditions to represent the interface between weathered shale and compacted clay liners within waste rock dumps  the peak shear and normal stresses were corrected for area reduction and plotted to provide the shear strength envelopes, from which shear strength parameters were recommended  to assess the potential for breakdown of the waste rock on wetting, particle size distribution curves were obtained by dry and wet sieving  also, slake durability indices were obtained for breccia and weathered shale by carrying out slake durability tests  overall, the results indicated negligible potential for breakdown of the breccia and weathered shale on wetting   1  introduction  as a part of the mining of metalliferous ores, excavated overburden needs to be dumped in a nearby storage, usually a surface waste rock dump  the side slopes of a surface waste rock dump form at the angle of repose of the mine wastes, which is typically in the range from 35° to 40° (williams, 2001, 2014, and 2015)  such slopes are normally not compacted and are subjected to rainfall, making the geotechnical stability of loose-dumped waste rock slopes a significant concern for mining and geotechnical engineers  figure 1 shows a photograph of a slope formed by end-dumping mine waste rock from a truck   the angle of repose of a dump is often simply adopted as the friction angle of the mine waste  however, the angle of repose represents the loosest possible packing under virtually no normal stress or the friction angle at the critical state (williams 1996)  the waste rock would be expected to have a friction angle of typically 4° to 6° higher than the angle of repose of the material on loose-dumping, due to the effects of overburden stress (williams, 2015)  at angle of repose of the mine waste, the dumps are generally geotechnically stable, at least in the short-term  in the long-term, however, water and weathering of the material are the major causes of slope instability, and it has been found that subsequent failures are generally rainfall-related (chowdhury and nguyen, 1987; fourie, 1996; williams, 2015)  it is also well documented that the shear strength of dry material is higher than that of saturated or submerged samples (kjaernsli and sande, 1963; fredlund et al , 1978)  in waste rock dump slopes, the shear strength decreases significantly with decreasing matric suction associated with increasing moisture content caused by rainfall infiltration (fredlund and rahardjo 1993)  therefore, when the dumps regularly experience high infiltration rates due to prolonged rainfall events over the wet season, failures will be more likely to occur  rainfall-induced slope failures in waste rock dumps are common hazards in the wetter regions of the world | 
2017-0679 	 mixed-mode dynamic crack propagation in rocks with contact-separation mode transitions |abstract: we propose an interfacial contact/damage model for simulating dynamic fracture in rocks  an interfacial damage parameter, d, models the evolution of damage on fracture interfaces, while relative contact and contact-stick fractions model contact-separation and stick-slip transitions  the damage rate is determined by an effective stress, written as a scalar function of the normal and tangential components of the riemann traction solution for assumed bonded conditions  we propose alternative definitions of the effective stress that generate failure criteria that resemble the tresca and mohr-coulomb criteria for compressive stress states, and we compare their compressive strengths and fracture angles under a compressive loading  we adopt a stochastic weibull model for crack-nucleation in which cracks nucleate at points where the effective stress exceeds the probabilistic fracture strength  we implement the nucleation model with an h-adaptive asynchronous spacetime discontinuous galerkin (asdg) method that captures accurately the complex fracture patterns that arise under dynamic loading conditions  numerical examples illustrate the effects on fracture response of varying the stochastic nucleation parameters and the alternative definitions of the effective stress   1 introduction  understanding the stress states that cause rock failure is critical to the reliable analysis and safe design of structures in rocks  in situ rock is typically subjected to compressive stress fields, and experimental observations indicate that the compressive strength of rock increases with increasing confining pressure  failure occurs by shearing along planes oriented at a rock-type-specific angle, <u+03b8>, defined relative to the direction of maximum compressive stress [1]  failure criteria describe the variation of compressive strength with confining pressure and, in general, the stress states at which rock fails   a number of failure criteria have been proposed in rock mechanics  the tresca criterion assumes that a material fails on planes with maximum shear stress  while it is sometimes used for failure analysis of rock [2], the tresca criterion is more appropriate for ductile materials as its corresponding shear strength is independent of the confinement pressure  the mohr-coulomb (mc) failure criterion depends linearly on the normal and shear stress components  this implies a linear relation between confinement pressure and compressive strength  however, this straight-line relation does not always fit experimental data [3], and the extension of the linear relation into the tensile loading regime generally over-predicts the tensile strength of rock  experiments show that the rates of increase of the shear and compressive strengths decrease as confinement pressure increases  in fact, beyond a certain confinement pressure, rock reaches a critical state at which the shear strength no longer increases, similar to the constant shear strength of the tresca model [4]  beyond the limitations associated with linearity of the mohr-coulomb model, various studies demonstrate that fully three-dimensional failure criteria are required to capture the influence of the intermediate principal stress [5-8]  however, due to its simplicity and the challenges involved in calibrating the more advanced models, the mohr-coulomb model is still the most popular and widely used-failure criterion for rock | 
2017-0686 	 extension failure mechanisms explain failure initiation in deep tunnels and critical heights of cliff faces and near-vertical mountain walls |abstract: brittle rock can fail due to extension strain over-coming the tensile limit, even when all stresses are compressive  two related topics can thereby be addressed  the first is extension strain-induced failure in deep tunnels and mines, with fracture initiation in tension but subsequent propagation in shear  the familiar ratio of maximum tangential stress <u+03c3><u+03b8> / ucs of 0 4 ±0 1 signifying rock fracture initiation, and the initiation of acoustic emission, are each explained by the ratio of tensile and compressive strength and by poisson’s ratio, using a classic elastic equation and simple arithmetic  the maximum critical tangential stress <u+03c3><u+03b8> can actually be expressed as the ratio of tensile strength and poisson’s ratio <u+03c3>t/<u+03bd>, hence the ratio 0 4±0 1  the second related topic is the limited heights of mountain walls, seen from the perspective of rock climbing  limited in this case is a relative term: 1,000m to 1,350m of almost vertical meters challenge all rock climbers  this ‘big-wall’ range of heights is not exceeded anywhere in the world  although strong granites are often involved, large-scale tensile strengths are apparently no larger than about 5 to 10mpa, due to weakening from temperature-cycling  at the other end of the spectrum, cliff houses in cappadocia tuffs in turkey may become exposed at intervals, due to extension failure of 15-20m high cliffs, with in situ tensile strengths of only 0 1mpa  mountain heights limited to 8-9km can be explained by non-linear critical state rock mechanics: maximum shear strength is the limitation   1  introduction to tunnel fractures  why do tunnels in massive rock start to exhibit fracture initiation when the ratio of the assumed maximum tangential stress <u+03c3><u+03b8> reaches approximately 0 4 x ucs? why does acoustic emission in a laboratory compression test initiate at a similar ratio of principal stress and uniaxial compressive strength? why do vertical cliffs in the ultra-weak cappadocia tuffs in central turkey tend to fail and expose underground dwellings or churches at intervals of a few decades or centuries, when their heights are even as little as 10 to 20 m? why do the highest vertical mountain faces in the world of rock climbing range from ‘no more’ than 1,200 to 1,300m in height? why did the first tbm tunnel in the world (1880) fail at its haunches when it curved beneath only a 70m high chalk cliff next to the channel tunnel, which was built 110 years later?| 
2017-0688 	 ultrasonic properties of creepy shales |abstract: natural barriers formed by e g  creeping or plastic shale may provide a solution to plugging and abandonment of old oil and gas wells  in order to qualify a sealing barrier outside the casing, it has to be identified by sonic and ultrasonic logging through casing methods  rock mechanical laboratory experiments accompanied by ultrasonic velocity measurements on soft overburden shales from north sea fields have been analyzed in order to provide possible attributes that can be related to shale barriers  shale failure and plastification is associated with small velocity changes  this means that velocities of plastic and creeping shales may be assessed by e g  comparison with open hole log data   1  introduction  sealing of new wells, in addition to plug and abandonment (p & a) of old hydrocarbon wells, are required in order to prevent future leakage of fluids from the reservoir to the surface  traditionally, cement plugs have been placed at the casing shoe during the drilling operation, while requirements for permanent sealing barriers are generally much stricter  the associated costs of p & a with today's technology could be huge  as an example, estimates show that 15 rigs will need 40 years full time operation to seal all wells on the norwegian continental shelf (straume, 2013)  it is therefore a growing demand from the oil industry to establish new technology that may reduce the costs and the time required for qualified p & a operations   field experience has validated that shales may form natural barriers around cased wells (williams et al , 2009)  since most shales in nature have permeabilities in the nanodarcy range, while oil well cement permeability is of the order 1-100 <u+03bc>darcy (goode, 1962), shale barriers are potentially more reliable seals than cement  since nature does most of the job by itself, it is also a far cheaper solution to plug and abandonment than conventional cement plugging | 
2017-0691 	 using high resolution, continuous profiles of core properties for the upscaling of rock mechanical tests results and the accurate calibration of geomechanical models |abstract: reliable quantitative data on the mechanical properties of hydrocarbon reservoir rocks can only be obtained from the testing of core samples  consequently, the geomechanical characterization of reservoir rock formations is mostly based on wireline log indicators, calibrated against values measured on limited and potentially biased populations of core samples   best practice for the geomechanical characterization of reservoirs should start with the careful verification of selected empirical models against relevant, project specific core data  unfortunately the available core data is in most cases not fit for this purpose and the choice of an empirical model for the upscaling of core data becomes somewhat arbitrary  in this paper we review some of the main sources of uncertainty pertaining to standard core analysis workflows relying on sparse measurements obtained from the testing of plug samples and describe how continuous high resolution profiles of properties such as rock strength and ultrasonic velocity profiles obtained from the scratch test should be combined in order to reduce the uncertainty inherent to the upscaling of mechanical properties  examples from real case studies show these enhancements include precise core shift estimates, early and adhoc recommendations for the selection of plug samples dedicated to complex and expensive rock mechanical testing programs, the quality-checking and the selection of the most appropriate wireline logs for the upscaling of data measured on plugs, and the building of robust empirical relationships for a better prediction of rock mechanical parameters in nearby offset wells   1  introduction  case studies for subsurface geomechanics offer many examples of the critical importance of reliable core data for the calibration of well and reservoir models  unfortunately in many instances, measurements taken for the purpose of reducing key uncertainties are too scarce and come too late in the workflow to have a real impact on the quality of models and their predictions  under these circumstances, models are poorly conditioned, reactive instead of predictive, and sometimes too inaccurate to assist engineers for necessary decisions about well designs and field management options | 
2017-0694 	 monitoring and mitigating downhole vibration with mse in xinjiang oil filed of china |abstract: further improvement in rop is highly challenging due to the increasing drilling difficulty with the hydrocarbon reserves increasingly going into deep formations with poor drillability and unconventional reservoirs in china  the industry payed more attention on tool damage and bit dysfunctions, resulted from downhole vibrations  great efforts have been put on the development of cost-effective technologies and tools to mitigate and evaluate the downhole vibrations  this paper correlates the energy required to excavate a unit volume of rock with the rock breaking efficiency of drilling bit, a quantized evaluation method for drilling performance and a real time vibration evaluation and mitigation process was established with the introduction of mechanical specific energy (mse)  |taking drilling process as an energy balance system, the relationship between drilling parameters and mse has been derived from the comprehensive analysis of rock breaking mechanism  to enhance the effect of specific energy drilling optimization, the skempton pore pressure model is used to infer confined compressive strength ccs based on calculated ucs  finally, the systematic approach with vibration risk management based on mse was established  this approach provided vibrational founder identification by mse to monitor downhole environment in real time and enabled field personnel to react immediately to damaging vibrations by adjusting drilling parameters  |field validation for the systematic approach was performed in xinjiang oil field by comparing high-frequency downhole memory sensor data (100samples/second data rate)  it is an effective method for mitigating stick-slip in drilling process, and has been shown about 20% rop improvement  |as an effective tool for further excavating the potential of rop, the optimized drilling system might achieve satisfactory outcomes that overcome the drilling challenges of carbonate formation, igneous rocks and shale in china  |1  introduction |low rates of penetration and reduced drilling efficiencies have always been a challenge due to the increased drilling difficulty with the hydrocarbon reserves (deep formations with poor drill ability and unconventional reservoirs in china) | 
2017-0696 	 evaluation of cutoff time on slide-hold-slide process of single rock joint in consideration of the heating influence |abstract: it is important to consider the influence of temperature when evaluating the frictional behavior of a single rock joint since it may change due to the geochemical processes occurring at the asperity contacts such as mineral dissolution  it is thought that the chemical processes may be accelerated under thermal conditions  in this study, the direct shear tests under a slide-hold-slide process, using artificial rock (mortar), granite and andesite with a single natural rough joint, have been performed at 20 and 60 °c  through the experiments results, the shear strength healings can be evaluated  moreover, the log-linear equation and the rate- and state-dependent friction law are applied to the experimental results  in particular, the cutoff time of rate- and state-dependent friction law shows the response with the difference of the thermal conditions  1  introduction  the fluctuation of rock fracture friction has been recognized as one of the major causes in fault mechanical behavior  in previous studies, dieterich (1979) and ruina (1983) proposed a famous empirical rate- and state- dependent friction (rsf) law  this law could well describe the variation of rock friction as observed in the slide-hold-slide direct shear test  since, then a large number of researches related to the earthquake’s occurrences were conducted based on this friction law [e g  stuart and tullis, 1995, marone 1998]  the authors has been carried out the slide-hold-slide(shs) type direct shear tests of rock fracture including natural joint surface roughness under relative low confining (kishida et al , 2011; kawaguchi et al , 2009)  kishida et al  (2011) have confirmed that the shear strength recovery during short-time holding may be attributed to a purely mechanical process, like creep deformation at the contacted asperities, while the shear strength recovery during long-time holding is affected by both mechanical and chemical processes  kishida et al  (2011) and kawaguchi et al  (2009) were conducted under room temperature, and then, the influence of various thermal conditions was not considered   in this research work, direct shear tests have been carried out under two different temperature conditions following a shs process in a residual state employing mortar replica specimen, granite and andesite with a single joint surface roughness  then, the rsf law has been applied to the experimental results and the influence in temperature has been discussed | 
2017-0697 	 effect of water-oil saturation on fracture toughness of reservoir rocks during long-term production |abstract: the reservoir saturation of oil and water changes during the long-term injection and production  thus, the fracture toughness of rocks changes, which affects the extension of the hydraulic fracture  in order to research the fracture toughness of rocks with different water-oil saturations, the authors put forward a new method to saturate the samples, and a series of experiments on sandstone with different saturations ranging from 100 percent oil to 100 percent water were carried out, with the modified three-point bending test  after the experimental works, several interesting conclusions were reached: (1) the fracture toughness of specimen containing water and oil decreases by 30-50 percent compared with the dry specimen; (2) when there is only one kind saturated fluid, the fracture toughness of the oil-saturated rock is higher than that of water-saturated; (3) in the saturant fluid of water-oil two-phase system, as water saturation goes up the rock fracture toughness decreases drastically  basing on experimental data, the authors give the theoretical analysis from two aspects: energy conservation and chemical reactions   1  introduction  the oil reservoirs are the porous rocks filled with fluids  during the long-term production, the properties of the rocks would change with changing of oil and water saturation, which in turn affects the later reproduction   many researches on rock properties affected by water have been done over a long time  najmud (najmud et al , 1990) proposed the experiment method and concluded that as water saturation goes up, the rock cohesive strength, shear strength, young’s modulus and compressive strength decrease, based on measurements on sandstone under dry condition and different levels of saturation ranging from 100 percent oil to 100 percent brine  gaussmann used equations to predict changes in seismic properties resulting from different pore-fluid saturations (han and batzle, 2004)  lai (lai et al , 2015) studied the effects of mineralogy and the water content on tensile strength of organic-rich shales, and discovered that the imbibed water significantly reduces the tensile strength  vernal h  kenner (kenner et al , 1982) conducted a series of tests to determine the effect of moisture content on fracture toughness, and an obvious decrease in ki with increasing storage relative humidity was observed  meng (meng et al , 2005) concluded that increases in water content could lead to higher molecule activity, which suggests that the water content affects rock strength and elastic properties | 
2017-0698 	 digital rock mechanics: a discrete way of approaching failure |abstract: rock mechanics modeling based on 3d <u+03bc>c<u+03a4>-generated images at pore and grain scale can be used to compute mechanical behavior  the discrete particle modeling approach provides a tool to simulate complex behavior, such as rock failure, based on relatively simple laws describing the relevant inter- and intragranular contact mechanics  in this paper, challenges in building models, calibrating the required model parameters, and analyzing the results of simulations, are described  the numerical results are compared with controlled laboratory experiments on three different sandstones  strength at different confining pressures and the transition between dilatant and contractant behavior appears well described by the model, as does stress dependence of ultrasonic p- and s-wave velocities  accounting properly for sub-grid features and upscaling to core scale and beyond remain challenges primarily limited by computational efficiency   1  introduction  rocks are geologic materials which are heterogeneous and discontinuous when examined at different scales  heterogeneity and discontinuities are essential to the mechanical properties of rocks when they are considered as construction materials in engineering, such as around a wellbore in petroleum engineering or a tunnel in rock engineering  therefore, it is common knowledge that usually faults and joints, both their geometrical settings and surface properties are dominating factors to be considered when evaluating, e g , the stability of tunnels   even for a piece of so-called intact rock as studied in the laboratory, the rock specimens are still heterogeneous and discontinuous, e g , when looking at the grain scale  heterogeneity and discontinuity influence the mechanical properties of a rock specimen as well as those of a rock mass  therefore, in order to understand the mechanical properties of rock at large scale, it may be necessary to understand it in the small scale   using 2d or 3d pore scale images as a basis for estimating petrophysical properties of rocks is by now well-established (e g  bakke and oren, 1997; dvorkin et al , 2009; andra et al , 2013a and 2013b)  computation of rock mechanical parameters and rock behavior during failure on the basis of similar data is less well developed  most approaches so far have been based on finite element numerical techniques (e g  arns et al , 2000)  in this paper, we will present an approach utilizing discrete particle modeling (holt et al , 2006; li et al , 2015), discuss its limitations and view its potential for further development  in section 2, we summarize previous work to demonstrate the applicability of discrete particle modeling towards a qualitative understanding of the impact on the grain scale on rock behavior  section 3 will focus on the road towards quantitative modeling of rock properties based on real microstructures from <u+03bc>ct data  challenges relate to resolution (fine details of contact geometry are important for mechanical behavior), sample size (large representative elementary volumes), computational time (linked to the above), grain partitioning and description of multi-mineral composite rocks, plus selection of input parameters for the grain contacts  in section 4, results of simulations will be shown, including stress - strain curves and associated behavior of static moduli and strength parameters  simulated stress dependence of p- and s-wave velocities will be shown, and the numerical predictions will be compared with results from corresponding laboratory tests  finally, concluding remarks are made on section 5 | 
2017-0700 	 impact of clay mineralogy on geomechanics of shale caprocks |abstract: shale cap rocks are nature’s best hydraulic barrier geomaterials  they are effective seals for underground hydrocarbon bearing formations as well as co2 storage formations in carbon capture and storage (ccs) projects  the sealing properties of shale rocks are directly related to its minerals and the internal arrangement of clay and non-clay minerals  this is known as the microstructure  since shales are predominantly composed of clay minerals, the type and amount of clay minerals contained within the rock are the key factors of its sealing properties  the goal of this study is to gain a better understanding of how different types of clays behave in a typical co2 storage reservoir condition   clay minerals have layered structures which often carry negative surface charges  the combination of large reactive surface areas and charge bring complexity in terms of their reactivity to fluids  therefore, even the same type of clays can have different properties depending on their depositional environment, which was influenced by different fluid properties (ph, t, p, salinity)  the same is also true of the exposure of clay-rich rocks to reactive fluids during geologic times as well as under subsurface engineering conditions (nuclear waste storage, injection of waste water and fracking fluids in oil&gas, and carbon sequestration)  for this study, artificial shale rock samples were designed using purified natural minerals in different ratios  these samples allowed us to observe the impact of the mineralogical composition on mechanical properties and obtain a systematically quantified comparison between samples  indentation tests were conducted to evaluate changes in mechanical properties as a result of composition alteration, while scanning electron microscopy (sem) was used to probe any changes to microstructures  observations in this study indicate: a) high clay content shale formation has better sealing properties because its mechanically more stable and has lower permeability due to the low porosity; b) increasing the salinity of pore fluid can decrease the thickness of double layers of clays, causing an increase in permeability because of the increase of effective porosity  salinity has an additional weaker effect on the mechanical properties because as the sample dries, salt crystallized within the sample and creates an internal expansion force resulting in integrity failure   1  introduction  caprocks are essentially defined as low permeability formations, and sometimes, but not necessarily, with low porosity  more than 60% of effective seals for geologic hydrocarbon bearing formations which act as natural hydraulic barriers constitute shale caprocks (allen and allen, j r , 2005)  the effectiveness of cap rock depends on its ability to immobilize fluids, which include a low permeability and resilience to the in-situ formation of fractures as a result of the pressurized injection  the alteration in sealing properties of shale rocks is directly related to the differences in its mineralogical composition and microstructure | 
2017-0701 	 deformation of siliciclastic stringers in a layered evaporite sequence (les): insights from geomechanical forward modeling |abstract: layered evaporite sequences have been documented from various rifted margins, including the south atlantic and the red sea  the intervening sedimentary layers in such sequences can undergo large deformation and present drilling hazards associated with high pore fluid pressures and/or rubble zones  although physical and numerical models provide insights to the deformation of such layers, the former are limited in terms of scalability of material failure parameters to natural examples, while the latter predominantly focus on massive salt and adjacent frictional-plastic sediments  in this paper we present a 2d evolutionary large strain finite element model of a salt diapir in an idealized layered evaporite sequence (les)  gravitational loading and sedimentation provide the driving force for halokinesis  salt is assigned a temperature-dependent non-newtonian rheology, whereas the sediments are assigned a non-associative cap-plasticity model that supports both compaction and shear localization  the model results suggest that mechanical stratification plays an prominent role in the evolution of a les  stresses and strains in the sediment layers evolve in a complex manner and are predominantly controlled by their structural position  the presence of multiple salt layers in a les decouples the deformation at different depths such that poly-harmonic folds can develop near the salt diapir  structural dip and position, in addition to curvature, impact the deformation within the sedimentary layers  geomechanical forward models also provide directional guidance on the likely variations in in-situ stresses and in well planning in les settings   1  introduction  a layered evaporite sequence (les) is a compositionally stratified heterolithic sequence comprising salt(s) and sediments  some examples of salt basins containing layered evaporites are the brazilian salt basins (fiduk and rowan, 2012), levant basin (cartwright et al , 2012), north sea (strozyk et al , 2012), south oman salt basin (li et al , 2012) and lower permian basin (raith et al , 2016)  the stratification in a les could be due to spatial variations in salt composition (e g , halite, anhydrite, tachyhydrite, carnallite) or inter-layering of salt with sedimentary inclusions or ‘stringers’  during geological loading, evaporites in a les could undergo viscous deformation while the inter-layered sediments deform by frictional-plastic processes  the bulk mechanical response of a les to geological loading can be significantly different, than when the salt is compositionally homogeneous, such as in the massive allochthonous halite structures in the gulf of mexico | 
2017-0702 	 measurement and implications of the dynamic fracture width in hydraulic fracturing using fbg strain sensors |abstract: fracture width and its variation are of significance to hydraulic fracture model validation  and it is also important to determine how the fracture extends as well as the properties of fracturing fluid and proppant in hydraulic fracturing  hydraulic fracture width is 3-4 orders of magnitude less than the length and the height  because fracture width is very tiny and the reservoir is at great depth, fracture width can only be determined through model estimation or numerical simulations  at present, even in the laboratory conditions, no direct measurement of fracture width is possible  this article is based on fiber bragg grating (fbg) strain sensor and strain transfer theory  the hydraulic fracturing is controlled by great stress difference and prefabricated fracture direction in the true-triaxial rock test equipment  fbg strain sensors are distributed in the fracture propagation direction to monitor fracture behavior  so dynamic monitoring hydraulic fracture width in concrete materials can be realized in laboratory  the entire process of hydraulic fracture initiation and propagation is recorded by fbg strain sensors during hydraulic fracturing, with various stages of micro-fractures, macro-fractures and width changes  by multiple fbg strain sensors, displacements of fracture process zone before hydraulic fracture reaches fbg and fracture widths when the hydraulic fracture is crossing fbg are obtained  then we found the speed and the shape of fracture in the process of hydraulic fracture propagation  data show that fracture width does not increase monotonously with hydraulic fracture extension in the process of hydraulic fracturing  it fluctuates within a certain range along with the fracture extension   1  introduction  in the 1950s, with the emergence of hydraulic fracturing technology, oil and gas development has entered a new stage (hassebroek and waters, 1964)  hydraulic fracturing as an unconventional oil and gas extraction technique, high pressure water-sand slurries are pumped into reservoirs to fracture rock with low permeability to extract oil and gas(nolte, 2000)  this technology has led to a significant increase in oil and gas production (t g  fan and g q  zhang, 2014)  in this process, the hydraulic fracture width has a great effect on the fracturing effect  monitoring the accurate value of the fracture width is of great significance to study the fracturing process and fracture models (perkins and kern, 1961) | 
2017-0703 	 blast fragmentation in rock with discontinuities using an equation of state gas model coupled to a transient dynamics fracturing and fragmenting femdem model |abstract: in quarries and mines, blocky rock masses are transformed by fracture of intact rock by the action of the detonation pressure of explosives, the blastpile fragment size distribution ultimately controlling the economics  rock fragmentation prediction and blast design continues to this day to follow largely empirically calibrated equations  one source of inaccuracy of models such as kuz-ram is likely to be the lumping together of so-called uncontrollable i e  geological parameters into one blastability factor to characterize the rock mass  recent developments in numerical modelling have introduced the sophistication necessary to capture more of the key nonlinear and coupled processes that occur during rock blasting and to consider intact rock properties and jointing or discontinuities independently  the discontinuous computational approach adopted here is based on the combine finite-discrete element method (femdem) coupled to a fem multi-phase gas flow model with full equation of state  the fragment size distributions are compared for idealised scenarios drawn from simulated blasts with isotropic intact rock, rock with persistent and impersistent discontinuity sets i e  with rock bridge ratios and different discontinuity spacing, all for identical detonation gas pressure  results are discussed in the context of the rock structure’s effect on the dominant mechanisms of fragmentation   1  introduction  rock fragmentation by blasting is employed widely in mining and quarrying and is by far the most efficient initial method of comminution, see for example the extensive literature on blasting, e g  persson et al  (1993), jkmrc (1996), jimeno et al  (1997)  the economic and environmental drivers of these industries are highly dependent on the fragmentation size distribution as downstream load and haul and crusher efficiencies depend on such yield curves  fragmentation prediction models are typically designed to combine practical bench and drill-hole layout geometries, sound physical principles based on explosive energy concentration to provide empirically derived size distribution outputs often characterised by best-fit two- or three-parameter cumulative distribution functions  the rock mass properties are acknowledged to be problematic for the prediction  on the commonly made assumption that a mine site or quarry site has a certain local geology, the blast designer is often content to use just one composite index for the blastability parameter in the model and perform field site adjustments based on actual blasting results  prediction of blasted block size distributions, bbsds (fragmentation curves, yield curves) is the subject of significant research effort as the possible error in prediction remains very high  accuracy is limited because the geological conditions cannot easily be determined for every blast and the implementation of the blast design may suffer from practical constraints  four approaches to fragmentation prediction were discussed in the context of quarry aggregates and large block (armourstone) production in latham et al , (2006) | 
2017-0705 	 injector completion performance under hydraulic fracturing and matrix flooding conditions into a sand pack |abstract: this paper presents experimental results on the mechanism and performance of two injector completion designs with cohesionless sand pack  tests are performed in 61-cm (2-foot) cubic sand packs with controlled 3-d confining stresses  each test consists of multiple water injection stages, at hydraulic fracturing and flooding conditions  fluids are injected through the wellbore containing a wire mesh screen wrapped outside or inside of a section of pre-drilled liner, representing an open hole stand-alone screen (oh-sas) or open hole pre-drilled liner (oh-pdl) completion, respectively  wellbore injection pressure and pore pressures inside the sand pack are measured to enable calculations of skin pressure drop as a function of injection rates  results show wellbore pressure and skin pressure drop increase with injection rate  oh-sas shows lower pressure than oh-pdl while the morphology of invaded zone are similar  a mechanism for the increasing skin pressure drop as a function of injection rate and completion design is proposed  practical implications to injector design and surveillance operations are discussed   1  introduction  water injectors with injectivity decline (olatunji et al , 2014) and out of zone fracturing injection (schultz et al , 2016) impact recovery and present possible environmental risks  to help understand the physics of high rate injection into unconsolidated sands and mitigate the associated risks experimental and numerical studies (chudnovsky et al , 2015, golovin et al , 2011 and 2010) have been reported  this paper presents experimental results on the mechanisms and performance of two injection completion designs with cohesionless sand pack  in section 2 we describe the equipment, experimental setup, sand pack preparation and testing protocols  the post-test data evaluation is described and discussed in section 3  the summary and conclusions constitute the final section 4   2  experimental setup and testing program  the equipment used in this study has been specifically developed for conducting matrix flooding and fracturing experiments under true 3-d stress conditions, with variable injection rate and injection fluid composition  in particular, the cubical testing chamber has a removable top plate, heavily reinforced side and bottom plates and turning mechanism facilitating the initial loading and compaction of the sand pack, as well as post-test excavation and analysis of the sand pack  although the experimental setup used in this study has been described previously (golovin et al, 2011), improvements and changes have been made to carry out experiments in this study  an overview photograph of the equipment and schematic drawing of the experimental setup are shown in fig  1 and fig  2, respectively  an overview of the experimental equipment, sand pack preparation and testing protocols are provided in the sub-sections below | 
2017-0706 	 influence of drilling fluid with solid plugging materials on stress intensity factor when drilling in naturally fractured formations |abstract: the one of the biggest risks, when drilling in the naturally fractured formation, is the lost circulation that could result in wellbore instability  this risk is mainly caused by natural fracture propagating  therefore, drilling fluid with solid plugging materials is used to plug the natural fractures to prevent them from propagation  however, the prevention may fail when the drilling fluid leaks through the solid plugging material and alters the fracture tip  once the drilling fluid effect is strong enough, the natural fracture would be instable and begin to grow  this paper investigated this influence of the drilling fluid on the fracture tip, especially on the stress intensity factor, which is a parameter to determine the stability of the fracture  a model was developed to describe stress distribution in the fracture where is filled with the solid plugging materials and drilling fluid  the stress intensity factor was studied using this model to test the fracture instability  the paper could also help with evaluation and optimization of solid plugging materials when drilling in the naturally fractured formations   1  introduction  lost circulation is a serious problem during drilling  in naturally fractured formations, this problem is mainly caused by the regrowth of the natural fracture  thus, solid plugging materials, like walnut shell, are necessary to plug natural fractures (feng and gray, 2017)  this paper is to develop a compressible, two-phase, water-gas flow system to investigate the influence of the drilling fluid on stress intensity factor (sif) at the fracture tip when the fracture is filled with solid plugging materials   sif is a mathematical parameter and used to describe the stress intensity of the fracture tip  the sif is relevant to the geometry (size and shape) and stress distribution near the fracture tip  liebowitz (1971) indicated that fractures became unstable once the value of sif at the fracture tip reached a critical value  this critical value was called fracture toughness  hence, sif could be used to predict fracture stability  erodogan et al  (1973&1974) studied the stability of fractures in layered medium when considering materials of the medium, sizes, and positions of the fracture  yew and lodde (1983), based on a mathematical model, investigated the propagation of hydraulically induced fractures in layered medium  yew and chiou (1983) studied the influence of in-situ stress and layered materials on fracture propagation  biot and medlin (1983) developed a mathematical model, based on laplace's equation, to study the prerequisite of the fracture penetration through the interface  lu and yew (1985) considered the sif as the standard to determine the fracture stability and to predict the direction of crack growth  morita et al  (1988) evaluated sif in a three-dimensional fracture model that was applied to arbitrary planar cracks  chen z  and chen m  (1997) studied the vertically hydraulically induced fracture and analyze the effect of fracture toughness  martin (2000) found that the zone of plastically deformed material around the fracture tip could affect sif and crack growing  chen et al  (2001, 2002, 2003) analyzed wellbore stability in naturally fractured formations when mud invades fractures  they investigated sif when the fracture propagation was simulated  overall, sif is a significant factor when studying fractures  however, few previous studies considered the effect of solid plugging materials on sif | 
2017-0711 	 advances in identification of nonconvex blocks from the view of combinatorial theory |abstract: the classical key block theory is mainly used for the convex blocks on the roof, floor or the walls, and is not applicable for the non-convex blocks  from the view of combinatorial theory, recent advances in block theory are discussed in this paper  especially the intersecting ways and combination relationships between the free planes of the rock blocks are analyzed generally  therefore, the convex blocks in the classical block theory can be extended to the non-convex blocks which include the concave intersections between the free planes  viewing a non-convex block as a combination of several convex blocks, the identification criteria of finiteness and removability for non-convex blocks can be established through analyzing the relationships between the combined block and its sub blocks  aiming at the redundancy in the combination algorithm of exhaustive enumeration method, a new symbolic representation of blocks can be established  then a cutting algorithm for the residual block is designed  finally, the optimized combination analysis for the non-convex block can be realized   1  introduction  in the process of excavation for rock engineering, a frequently encountered problem is the stability of rock mass  the essence of studying the stability is to study the change mechanism and the stress distribution of rock mass after excavation  block theory is a kind of rock mass stability analysis method based on limit equilibrium theory  but geometric analysis by the occurrence of joint planes is a major feature of it  block theory has the advantages such as strict mathematical basis, less input parameters, fast calculation and practical results  and it has been widely applied in many large-scale projects like three gorges project   the publication of the paper “stereographic projection method for the stability analysis of rock mass” (shi, 1977) in chinese by gen-hua shi at scientia sinica in 1977 marks the preliminary formation of block theory  and then a rigorous mathematical proof was made for it (shi, 1982)  in 1985, the publication of the book, “block theory and its application to rock engineering” (goodman and shi, 1985), which is written commonly by r  e  goodman and genhua shi, marks the formal formation of the system of block theory  since the block theory proposed, many scholars including dr  shi himself have put forward some new development, which is considered from the geometric and the physical characteristics of joint planes (shi, 2006), mechanical behaviors of blocks combined with the modern mathematical methods  these developments can be summarized as six kinds of methods [4-7], that is, discontinuous deformation analysis (shi, 1988), numerical manifold method, stochastic network simulation (zhang et al , 2007), key group method, fractal geometry and stereo-analytical method, elastic-viscous-plastic method (li et al , 2010) | 
2017-0715 	 numerical simulations of fracture reorientation in the vicinity of a producer |abstract: pore pressure reduction, caused by reservoir fluid production, will alter the stresses in the vicinity of a producer  these stress alterations affect the propagation of hydraulic fractures that originate e g  during water or polymer injection into injector wells as part of enhanced oil recovery (eor) or improvement of geothermal well productivity  in this study, we use a modified discrete element model (mdem), coupled to the fluid-flow simulator tough2, to investigate how hydraulic fractures are affected when growing into a zone of altered pore pressure  the study shows that flow induced stress changes can have a significant effect on hydraulic fracture propagation  hydraulic fractures tend to bend around the producer, and the degree of deviation from the far stress field is dependent on several factors, including production rate, time, reservoir permeability, stress anisotropy and poisson’s ratio  the stress alterations show a high sensitivity to stress anisotropy and are also affected by poisson’s ratio   1  introduction  local stress alterations can cause deviation from the far-field stress and are important to identify for accurate reservoir management  the stress regime is commonly believed to govern fracture propagation, and local changes in the stress regime can influence hydraulic fracturing treatments and fractures created as a result of water or polymer injection  injection treatments relevant to enhanced oil recovery (eor) operations, as well as to operations in the geothermal industry  for example in the case where well stimulation is performed on the margins of a geothermal field with a history of prior operations   pore pressure changes in the reservoir during production or injection affect the effective stresses, and can cause a rotation of the principal stresses  generally, production will increase the compressive stresses in the tangential direction and injection will increase the compressive stresses in the radial direction (hidayati et al, 2001)  if the rotation is great enough, hydraulic fractures growing in the affected region can deviate from what is anticipated by the far-field stress  it is therefore of importance to look at how hydraulic fractures are affected when growing in the vicinity of pressure-depletion induced stress changes, and under what conditions the effect is significant | 
2017-0717 	 permeability of fractures created by triaxial direct shear and simultaneous x-ray imaging |abstract: rock fractures in the subsurface have the potential to act as fluid flow pathways but the permeability of existing, new, or future in-situ rock fractures is difficult to characterize  we perform triaxial direct shear experiments to evaluate the permeability potential of freshly created fractures as a function of stress/depth using specimens of carbonate-rich marcellus shale  applied confining stress ranged from 2 to 30 mpa, specimens were 25 mm diameter and 25 mm length, shearing displacement of at least 2 mm was imposed, and measured permeability ranged between 10<u+2212>3 and 104 md as dependent on stress and fracture conditions  simultaneous x-ray video and computed tomography were used to directly measure fracture displacement and apertures  results show that the stress at which fractures form is likely the most significant factor controlling fracture permeability, with higher stresses causing significant 2 to 4 orders of magnitude permeability reduction  the effect of creating fractures at high stress on permeability reduction was significantly stronger than the effect of increasing the confining stress on an existing fracture  results included analysis of transient fracture permeability following renewed shear displacement, a process which resulted in rapid permeability enhancement followed by a slower decay in permeability   1  introduction  permeability of existing and/or potential fractures in the subsurface is a key parameter for subsurface fluid flow modeling, as relevant for a sustainable energy future and preservation of potable aquifers  previous studies have investigated fracture permeability in relation to the so-called ‘cubic-law’ (witherspoon et al , 1980; zimmerman and bovarsson, 1996) in which fracture aperture can be related to fluid conductivity if complexities arising from surface roughness and asperity contacts are adequately taken into account  this ‘effective’ hydraulic aperture is dependent upon the state of stress on the fracture (barton et al , 1985, brown, 1987; cho et al , 2013; gutierrez et al , 2000; pyrak-nolte and morris, 2000; zhang et al , 2007) and shearing displacement along the fracture (bandis et al , 1983; detwiler and morris, 2014; gentier et al , 1997; lee and cho, 2002; olsson and brown, 1993; yeo et al , 1988)  in addition there are temporal effects including chemical dissolution and precipitation (armitage et al , 2013; detwiler, 2010; noriel, 2015), mobilization and filtering of fines (oliveira et al , 2014; you et al , 2015), and mechanical self-sealing (bastiaens et al , 2007; elkhoury et al , 2015)  no previous studies, known to the authors, have attempted to investigate the permeability of fractures that are created at in situ stress conditions  such conditions are directly relevant for evaluating the potential for stimulation or creation of permeable fractures, whether by natural phenomena, such as faulting, or by human activity, such as fluid injection | 
2017-0720 	 modeling hydraulic fractures propagation considering changing in the primary energy loss mechanism |abstract: accurate modeling of the hydraulic fracturing treatment is important to design a successful treatment and prevent screenout  an innovative numerical method is presented, here, for modeling fluid-driven fractures propagation considering changing in the primary energy loss mechanism during propagation  the proposed method is based on the extended finite element methods with modifications to incorporate variable stress singularity at the crack tips for the transition between toughness-dominated and viscosity-dominated regimes  moreover, a consistent enriched function is introduced for fluid pressure calculations close to the fracture tips to catch its singularity  the numerical results were validated against the analytical solutions for two extreme hydraulic fracture propagation regimes  mesh independency and convergence rate of the proposed method are verified  comparison between fracture volumes assuming changing in the primary energy loss mechanism and constant primary energy loss mechanism during hydraulic fracture propagation is provided   1  introduction  hydraulic fracturing plays an important role for economic production from low-permeability reservoirs around the world (holditch, 2006)  to make hydraulic fracturing treatment more effective and avoid possible losses of reserves due to screen out, it is crucial to simulate the treatment before its execution  however, even for simple fracture geometries many commercial available simulators do not consider coupling between the rock deformation and fluid flow  the proposed method covers this drawback and proposes an accurate method to simulate hydraulic fractures propagation for different regimes dictated by rock and fracturing fluid parameters   the main struggle while modeling hydraulic fracturing problems comes from coupling the fluid flow inside the fracture and the rock deformations  other difficulties are moving boundary conditions while hydraulic fracture propagates, non-linearity of governing equation for the fluid flow inside the fractures, and pressure singularity near the fracture tips  moreover, the analytical solutions are only available for simple geometries and limiting assumptions (detournay, 2004)   nevertheless, analytical solutions of the hydraulic fracturing problems allow us to identify three main energy dissipation mechanisms are existing during hydraulic fracturing treatment  the first mechanism is related to fracturing the rock, the second mechanism is related to energy losses because of the friction losses, and the third mechanism is due to leak off  in this work, we are focusing on the toughness and viscosity dominated regimes in an impermeable media  adachi (2001) introduced dimensionless toughness (equation) or dimensionless viscosity m as the dimensionless number that allow determining primary dissipation mechanism| 
2017-0724 	 laboratory measurements of strength parameters for fracturing |abstract: fracture toughness and tensile strength are rock parameters that have influence on hydraulic fracture initiation and propagation, and that to various degrees are implemented in fracture modeling tools  laboratory measurements represent a valuable source of such data  in particular, the relation between the two parameters is of interest, since both parameters are rarely measured with the same rocks  here, experimental data obtained with weak sedimentary rocks (castlegate sandstone, mons chalk and mancos shale) are presented, including unconfined mode i fracture toughness and direct tensile strength  the angular dependence of both parameters is explored with the shale samples and compared to previously measured anisotropy of the brazilian tensile strength  the new data are in accord with previous correlations between tensile strength and fracture toughness  the need for performing such measurement under stress conditions realistic for in situ fracturing is pointed out  |1  introduction |hydraulic fracturing is a key to make unconventional (shale gas and shale oil) reservoirs profitable  in general, hydraulic fractures can make an important contribution to increased recovery in conventional low permeability reservoirs  identification of so-called sweet spots for placing of fractures is often based on the ability of the rock to fracture, expressed in terms of various parameters referred to as e g  "frackability" or "brittleness"  however; mathematical modeling of hydraulic fracture initiation and propagation depends on rock parameters like tensile strength and fracture toughness, in addition to in situ stress conditions  to what extent the pragmatic "frackability" approach and the more fundamental fracture mechanics approach may be brought to convergence is not clear  meanwhile, the question remains as to what kind of input data that is required and how they should be used for optimizing fracturing operations in the field  |in this paper, we present standardized laboratory measurements with three relatively weak rocks, including castlegate sandstone, mons chalk and mancos shale  fracture toughness was measured using the chevron bend (cb) method with three point loading  direct tensile strength tests were performed and compared to previous tests of brazilian tensile strength (simpson et al , 2014)  a primary aim was to identify possible correlations between these differently measured strength parameters, and to evaluate the reliability of the various measurements for realistic modeling of fracture initiation and propagation | 
2017-0725 	 effect of fluid rheology on proppant transport in hydraulic fractures in soft sands |abstract: we have developed a new frac-pack model to simulate power-law fluid flow coupled with proppant transport inside the fracture  two empirical correlations of the relative velocity between the fluid and proppant for the vertical direction (settling) and the horizontal direction (retardation) are incorporated in the model  this model can simulate fully 3-d fracture growth in poro-elasto-plastic materials with tensile and shear failure  a cohesive zone model is used for fracture propagation along with a dynamic and adaptive meshing procedure  we investigate the effect of fluid viscosity, injection rate, proppant diameter, and reservoir permeability on proppant placement  higher apparent viscosity fluid and injection rate results in wider fractures with better proppant placement, when the fracture is expected to be contained within the payzone  in the case of fracpacks, utilizing larger diameter of proppant leads to settling-dominant proppant placement rather than the retardation-dominant due to the relatively wider induced fracture  the effect of fluid leak-off and the pore pressure diffusion in the reservoir is captured  higher leak-off in the high permeability sands leads to a poroelastic backstress that builds up around the fracture, and results in a shorter fracture due to larger leak-off  this new frac-pack model allows us to design and analyze hydraulic fracturing stimulations in soft, elasto-plastic formations when rheologically complex fracturing fluids are used  our results also provide guidelines for the selection of fracturing fluid rheology, proppant size, and injection rates   1  introduction  hydraulic fracturing is a widely applied well stimulation technique that has been utilized for more than 60 years in the oil and gas industry (king, 2012)  this stimulation technique has been mainly used for hard and tight rocks which exhibit low permeability and linear-elastic behavior  unconsolidated or poorly consolidated reservoirs also require hydraulic fracturing operations, so-called frac-pack completions  frac-packing combines fracturing and sand control into one technique (marquez et al , 2013)  the fracture induced by a high-viscosity fluid helps to improve production rates, and to place proppant within fractures and in the annulus between the screen and casing in order to prevent formation sand production | 
2017-0727 	 finite-element simulations of hydraulic fracture height growth on layered mudstones with weak interfaces |abstract: numerical simulations of hydraulic fracture (hf) propagation through layered rocks show the effects of rock layering and interfaces on fracture height growth  when the contrast in properties between adjacent rock layers is high and abrupt, the resulting interface between these layers is often weak, exhibiting low tensile strength, low friction coefficient, and high hydraulic conductivity  thus, they easily detach (in tension) and slip (in shear), as the hydraulic fracture crosses them, creating localized obstacles for fracture propagation as well as localized zones of fluid loss  numerical simulations were conducted using the newly-implemented pore pressure cohesive elements as certain predefined hydraulic fracture and interface opening paths in abaqus 2016  to validate the model and for comparison we conducted simulations on elastically-homogeneous and elastically-layered rocks and, for the latter, we used a range of tensile strength and fluid flow properties at the interfaces between layers, to understand their impact on vertical hydraulic fracture (height) growth  our results show a systematic decrease in fracture height and fracturing fluid efficiency with increasing interface hydraulic conductivity  this relationship is important because of its potential impact on improving fracture diagnostics in the field  we also observe that the interface strength directly affects fracture height growth as well as fluid efficiency  these findings are important for a proper assessment of fracture height growth, a better assessment of the created fracture surface area, and better predictions of well production   1  introduction  hydraulic fracturing (hf) treatments have been widely used to enhance oil and gas production (economides and nolte, 2000; holditch, 2006)  improving the representation of these treatments with more adequate numerical modeling is important because it helps to increase the created fracture surface area, to reduce completion costs, and to improve well production  when considering more complex reservoirs, such as shale and mudstone, numerical simulation of the hydraulic fracture treatments is considerably more challenging because of the layered nature of the rock and the impact of the associated interfaces of contact between layers, inhomogeneity, and pre-existing natural fractures on hydraulic fracture growth |

2017-0733 	 stress measurements in crystalline rock: comparison of overcoring, hydraulic fracturing and induced seismicity results |abstract: in preparation of a decameter-scale fault stimulation experiment at the grimsel test site, switzerland, a comprehensive rock stress characterization survey was conducted  the survey combines overcoring of csiro-hi and usbm probes with hydrofracture measurements with concomitant monitoring of the induced microseismicity  impression packer surveys were run following the hydrofracture tests to determine the orientation of the induced fracture at the wellbore  the orientation of the fracture away from the wellbore was determined from the pattern of the microseismicity  the use of a transverse isotropic model for inverting the strains measured during overcoring was essential to obtain stress solutions that were consistent with the hydrofracture and microseismicity results  the indicate that the minimum principal stress, <u+03c3>3, is sub-horizontal and oriented north-south  the maximum principal stress, <u+03c3>1, dips at 30-40° to the east and has a magnitude of 13-17 mpa  the magnitude of <u+03c3>2, is similar to <u+03c3>3, and lies in the range 8-10 mpa   1  introduction  to accelerate the development of enhanced geothermal system (egs) technology, the in-situ stimulation and circulation (isc) experiment is being conducted at the grimsel test site (gts), switzerland to investigate fundamental processes activated by injections into preexisting faults and shear zones  this decameter scale experiment aims to address open questions concerning induced seismicity, permeability enhancement, and hydro-mechanical fault response during deep egs reservoir stimulation operations  further information can be found in amann et al  (2017)   knowledge of the in-situ stress situation within the rock mass is crucial to the design of the experiment and the eventual interpretation of the data, since stress dictates whether slip will occur on pre-existing discontinuities in response to the elevated pressure of the injections, and also controls the magnitude and direction  thus, a stress measurement campaign that combined stress relief and hydraulic methods was conducted in three differently oriented boreholes (figure 1)  borehole sbh-1 was drilled with a slight inclination to vertical of 15° towards n260°e, the best-estimate for the direction of <u+03c3>3 suggested by pahl et al , (1989) and konietzky (1995)  the sbh-3 borehole was drilled sub-horizontally towards the “best-estimate” direction of <u+03c3>2 with the goal of obtaining a direct measure of the sub-vertical stress from the hydrofracture stress tests  sbh-1 and sbh-3 were drilled into nearly undisturbed rock to observe the stress conditions in the ‘far-field’ of the shear zone  the sbh-4 borehole was sub-horizontal and drilled orthogonal to sbh-3 so as to penetrate one of the shear zones that were the target for the stimulations with the objective of identifying potential stress changes towards the fault | 
2017-0734 	 estimating rock mass elastic modulus from seismic resonance measurements |abstract: measuring the elastic modulus of in-situ rock masses over scales of tens of meters remains an important challenge in experimental rock mechanics  we present a new approach using ambient resonance measurements of freestanding rock masses to identify vibrational modes, which are then matched with numerical models implementing bulk, globally representative material properties  the result is an experimentally determined, albeit numerically calibrated, estimate of rock mass elastic modulus  we demonstrate the approach at four natural rock arches in southern utah where we have acquired resonance data and been able to match experimental resonant modes using 3d numerical analysis  two material properties can be varied to match experimental data, density and modulus; we hold the former constant applying measured or common values and solve for modulus using a forward approach  the resolved modulus is representative of the global small-strain dynamic behavior, integrating rock mass heterogeneity over the scale of the feature  the technique works well for freestanding geological features that exhibit clear vibrational modes  errors arise with uncertain mechanical boundary conditions  we propose the resolved global value of modulus adds relevant information describing the variation of elastic properties over scales from lab samples to in-situ rock masses   1  introduction  measurements of rock mass elastic modulus are scale-dependent (heuze, 1980), complicating efforts to translate laboratory results from core sample testing to scales relevant for most rock engineering problems (cai et al , 2004)  micro- and macroscopic discontinuities separating intact rock fragments are variably compliant features (li, 2001; zangerl et al , 2008), making the rock mass deformation (em) and elastic (ee) moduli (sensu isrm, 1975) well below the young’s modulus obtained from corresponding intact rock specimens (ei) (farmer and kemeny, 1992; wyllie, 2003)  accurate prediction of rock mass deformation is crucial in a wide variety of rock engineering applications (e g  tunnel support, foundations), highlighting the relevance of modulus measurements at engineering-relevant scales   different approaches have been proposed to measure or estimate the deformation and elastic moduli of in-situ rock masses (isrm, 1979; palmstrom and singh, 2001; cai et al , 2004; hoek and diederichs, 2006)  in-situ tests, such as plate jacking, measure stresses and strain over relevant scales (usually by diametrically loading a small tunnel or test adit), but they are time consuming and expensive to perform, and the results are affected by excavation damage  a more common approach is to estimate rock mass modulus from empirical relations, often non-linear, developed by comparing in-situ test measurements with rock mass classification schemes, e g  rmr, gsi, and q (hoek and diederichs, 2006)  for massive rock (i e  rock masses containing few joints), palmstrom and singh (2001) proposed the simplified relationship em = 0 5 • ei  in all cases, a high degree of variability is anticipated between the estimated and performance-based rock mass modulus | 
2017-0735 	 a comprehensive 3d geomechanical model used to deliver safe hpht wells in the challenging shearwater field |abstract: the shearwater field located in the uk central graben represents one of the most challenging high-pressure, high-temperature (hp/ht) developments of its kind in the north sea  during production, the strong depletion of the fulmar reservoir caused a number of geomechanical-related problems, including the failure of the initial development wells, and consequently, loss of production  in order to reinstate production at shearwater, five infill wells have been drilled and completed successfully  this success was largely attributed to a multidisciplinary effort to understand the post-production changes of the overburden  in this paper, a comprehensive 3d geomechanical model is presented that was used as a key design foundation for safe hp/ht well delivery  the model results and interpretations are discussed, and a summary of the current understanding of the evolution of the overburden from a geomechanical perspective is provided  the challenges associated with infill drilling and, in particular, the loss of fracture gradient and the closure of the drilling mud weight window between this and pore pressure, and how these have added complexity to the drilling practices are described  finally, key technologies implemented to overcome these issues including managed pressure drilling, drill-in liner and wellbore strengthening are discussed   1  introduction  the shearwater field located in the uk central graben represents one of the most challenging high-pressure, high-temperature (hp/ht) developments of its kind in the north sea  at the time of the initial development, elevated pressures in excess of 15,000 psi and temperatures greater than 350°f, and structural geology complexity, posed major technical challenges to shearwater  these challenges involved all aspects of well construction and production in hp/ht conditions  despite the challenges, all initial development wells were drilled successfully   during the first years of production, and similar to other hp fields, reservoir pressures dropped rapidly to 8,000 psi on average  the strong depletion of the reservoir, in combination with the high compressibility of the reservoir rock, resulted in compaction of the fulmar sandstones and led to displacements, deformations and stress changes in the overburden rock  compaction-induced stress changes in the overburden (“stress arching”) were the driving force for a number of geomechanical-related subsurface problems  during 2004-2007, it resulted in four production liners being sheared due to slippage along faults or bedding planes near the crest of the structure  furthermore, over time, some initial development wells then experienced rapid a-annulus pressure increases, suggesting a leak of the production casing at hod chalk formation level | 
2017-0737 	 proxy-based optimization of hydraulic fracturing design in horizontal wells through co2 flooding in shale oil reservoirs |abstract: in this paper, a pseudo-component black oil reservoir model was constructed to simulate co2 flooding in shale oil reservoirs  the co2 flooding was conducted using two different approaches: cyclic injection with 10 wells (5 producers and 5 injectors) and huff-n-puff with only 5 wells for injection and production with same number and length of fractures  the cyclic injection obtained 38% more cumulative oil during the thirty-year prediction period than the huff-n-puff process  next, design of experiments and proxy modeling was adopted for the optimization of hydraulic fracturing design through the cyclic co2 flooding  four factors were considered in the optimization: fracture half-length, primary width, permeability, and effective width  many experiments were designed by mixing the levels of these four factors using latin hypercube sampling  the optimization approach significantly improved the cyclic injection cumulative oil production by 12%  two proxy models were constructed to obtain a simplified alternative metamodel to the large reservoir simulator  the rbf neural network created a much more accurate matching of cumulative oil production calculated from the simulator and predicted from the proxy model than the polynomial regression  the most influential fracturing factors were also identified for their effects on the shale oil reservoir performance   1  introduction  of the astounding 400 billion barrels of shale play oil in the united states alone, less than 15% has been recovered through primary production (yu et al , 2014)  with such a large quantity of reserves still unrecovered, new and inventive enhanced oil recovery (eor) processes are required to continue production  one of the possible efficient eor processes in unconventional reservoirs is co2 flooding through hydraulic fractured horizontal wells  there are two main approaches of co2 flooding: huff-n-puff and cyclic injection  the huff-n-puff process is made up of three steps: first, co2 is injected (huff); second, the well is shut in to allow the co2 to propagate throughout the reservoir; third, the well is reopened and production resumes (puff)  the cyclic gas injection method is performed in the same manner with one key difference: separate wells are used for injection and production  these processes are well known in conventional sandstone reservoirs, but are very new technologies for shale formations with horizontal wells using hydraulic fracture modeling | 
2017-0739 	 energy analysis of roof sag and fracture in stratified ground using beam theory: static loading |abstract: excavations associated with the production of stratified resources by longwall mining are of interest to the study of mining induced seismicity  by establishing the possibility of vertical displacement of overlaying strata into the void space opened by underground excavation, longwall mining inherently mobilizes a large quantity of gravitational potential energy  potential energy is initially expended through strata deflection and a portion of this expended potential energy is released by fracture in roof strata, which have undergone elastic deformation  a portion of this released elastic energy is a source of seismic energy   considering an idealized mining geometry, a theoretical model accounting for the energy states associated with elastic deformation and brittle failure of roof strata has been developed  an increase in elastic strain energy, induced in single roof beams by self-weight, is shown to account for a corresponding decrease in the gravitation potential energy of the beams, which results from beam sag  expressions for elastic strain energy released by brittle failure in single roof beams are developed  these analyses demonstrate that the elastic energy released by fracture of roof beams in strong, stiff, and thick strata is sufficient to release measurable seismic energy   1  introduction  caving of overlaying strata behind an advancing longwall face constitutes a transformation of gravitational potential energy, due to the possibility of vertical displacement of overlaying strata into void space opened by underground excavation, to other forms of energy including strain energy, fracture energy, frictional energy, kinetic energy, and seismic energy  for catastrophic failures in underground mines, whyatt and varley, 2008, have proposed a direct relationship between seismic energy induced by mining and the change of gravitational potential energy in the overburden   this work seeks to quantify the transformation of gravitational potential energy into strain energy using a simplified two-dimensional analysis, and considering the theoretical elastic behavior of roof strata induced by longwall excavation  the analysis assumes linear elasticity, material homogeny and isotropy, and static loading, and is simplified by considering roof strata as simply supported, built-in, and cantilevered beams | 
2017-0740 	 low-rate injection and stimulated zone geometry |abstract: injection rate (q) and viscosity (<u+03bc>) are key operational input parameters that can be varied to help attain a desired hydraulic fracture (hf) geometry  putting viscosity effects aside, many have discussed the upper limit of injection rate and have uncritically promoted higher injection rates as leading to higher productivity in all cases  more recently, this approach has come into question as the links between injection approaches and rock mass properties (natural fractures, heterogeneity…) are explored and are becoming better understood  this paper focuses quantitatively on fluid injection rate and elastic modulus only, in the context of hf, through use of a commercial discrete element method software program  results indicate that low injection rates in different formations with different moduli of elasticity may lead to more desirable outcomes   1  introduction  with increasing use of hydraulic fracturing (hf) techniques in the oil and gas (o&g) industry, a greater need for more precise design and optimization is emerging, especially as low commodity prices squeeze profit margins are squeezed by  hf stimulation is considered successful when maximum o&g extraction rates (higher productivity) are achieved with minimum stimulation costs and environmental risks  design is based on a sequential and iterative workflow rooted in exact (deterministic) simulations within regulatory and operational guidelines, informed by experience (oyarhossein & dusseault, 2016)   intrinsic (e g  stiffness, permeability) and extrinsic (e g  stresses, pressures) parameters are needed to apply design workflows, so that the operational parameters during hf stimulation (rate, viscosity, pressure…) are appropriately chosen  hf stimulation may target a goal of higher short-term production (good for rapid payback), a goal of higher recovery factor (rf), or some combination of the two generally dictated by discounted cash flow analysis  in as much as can be ascertained, the goal of higher short-term production has dominated the shale gas and shale oil hf stimulation goals because of the sharp drop-off in well productivity with time | 
2017-0741 	 modeling the effect of fracture interference on fracture height growth by coupling 3d displacement discontinuity method in hydraulic fracture simulator |abstract: in this paper, we present a hydraulic fracture model that integrates 3d displacement discontinuity method for computing the induced 3d stress field around the propagating hydraulic fractures and incorporates the changes in induced stress into the fracture height calculations and propagation criterion  examples show that for parallel fractures, the height growth may be promoted or suppressed depending on the relative fracture height  for fractures initiated from different formation layers, the fracture growth into the layer occupied by the other fractures is reduced due to the vertical stress shadowing effect   1  introduction  interaction among multiple propagating hydraulic fractures or the so-called stress shadowing effect, especially its influence on fracture propagation path, has been previously studied for fractures initiated and growing in approximately the same formation layers  the stress shadowing effect can influence the height growth for fractures propagating in the same layer or in the different layers in depth  the interactions between fractures propagating in height in different vertical layers, has not been investigated yet and can have major implications on the success of a fracture treatment   in this paper, we present a hydraulic fracture model that integrates the constant 3d displacement discontinuity method (3d ddm) for computing the induced 3d stress field around the propagating hydraulic fractures and incorporates the induced stress into the fracture height calculations and propagation criterion   the displacement discontinuity method is currently widely used to model fracture propagation and interaction  starting from the work of crouch and starfield (1983) this approach has been evolved from two dimensional constant ddm, to 2d quadratic and higher order ddm, accounting for the different element shapes  the 3d ddm approaches with constant, quadratic, and higher order discontinuities have also been investigated and attract great interest lately (shou, 1993; shou et al, 1997, wu, 2015)  due to the excessive numerical computation cost associated with the implementation of the full 3d ddm approaches, several simplifications have been made  these simplifications include using 2d ddm with 3d correction factor to account for fracture height effect (olson, 2004), using a simplified form of 3d ddm by neglecting the vertical displacement component, and using 3d height correction factor based on vertically uniform displacement discontinuity (wu and olson, 2015)  the correction factors are derived from the analytical plane strain solution for a uniformly loaded vertical fracture of a finite height (sneddon, 1946), so they are applicable mostly for the cases when the fractures are well contained in the same formation interval | 
2017-0744 	 quantifying rock mass behavior around underground excavations |abstract: a quantitative assessment of rock mass behaviors around underground excavations is essential in mining since it can assist engineers in selecting appropriate mining methods and implementing reliable ground control measures  in this paper, the interactions between the factors affecting the rock mass behaviors around underground excavations are quantified using the rock engineering systems (res) and artificial neural network (ann) approaches  to this end, the ground behavior index (gbi) is developed  the res is applied as a practical tool for determining complex and highly nonlinear correlation among the input parameters via the interaction matrices while ann is implemented to objectively assign weights to the input parameters of the gbi  fall of ground (fog) of rock mass surrounding the excavation comprising gravity induced structurally controlled, block movement and stress induced failure cases were investigated and a comprehensive database on the fog characteristics was compiled  several parameters related to the fog including the rock mass characteristics, the excavation geometry, the excavation supports, the mining methods and the fog size, were selected to establish the gbi  the bamangwato concession limited (bcl), an underground mine located in selibe-phikwe, botswana was used as case study to compute the proposed gbi  overall, the validation results showed excellent agreement between the gbi and the field observations  it was concluded that the gbi could be used to provide engineers with reliable quantitative information on the fall of ground as well as the corresponding the hazard level   1  introduction  falls of ground (fog) or ground falls can be refereed as to the fall of loose rocks from excavation faces (roofs and side walls) typically unintentionally induced (as opposed to those purposely induced in some mining methods such as caving rock behind a longwall face, collapsing roof in a retreat room-and-pillar mine or caving rock in a block-caving hardrock mine)  fog combined with rockbursts have been responsible for numerous deaths and injuries in underground mines across the world (adoko et al , 2013, griffith et al , 2014)  mining operations have long recognized these hazards and have developed comprehensive programs, procedures, and ground support standards to address them  fog in underground mines takes place in a wide range of geological and operational situations  the rock mass surrounding mine openings can collapse in different ways even if primary and secondary support systems are employed  these include rock falls, cave-in, raveling ground, squeezing ground, rock spalling, slabbing or bursting etc…from the roof and the sides/ribs of openings which can be structural or stress-induced  the potential types of ground instabilities are gravity induced structurally controlled, block movement and stress induced failures influenced by geological discontinuities and in situ stresses  it is imperative to examine the fall of ground mechanisms, failure mode, ground conditions and consequences to eliminate the hazards linked with this unwanted problem by coming with reliable and practical ways of enhanced technology and systematic engineering structure  ground control measures which consist of ground characterization, ground support and reinforcement, work as a line of resistance line to lessen any form of ground movements (kaiser and cai, 2012)  ground control involves maintaining and preventing ground movements and predicting rock behavior in underground mine openings to a level that is deemed acceptable in terms of safety and serviceability  therefore, the characteristics of fog the assessment of rock mass behaviour around openings is essential in a mine since they have a great significance not only on the long term stability of underground excavations but also selecting appropriate mine design methods and implementing ground control measures | 
2017-0747 	 numerical analysis of thermal crack growth due to cold-water injection using the boundary element method |abstract: the problem of thermal crack growth due to cold-water injection has been an important issue as a means of reservoir permeability enhancement in geothermal reservoirs  in this paper, we present numerical investigation of thermal crack growth in the vicinity of a borehole and a fracture during an injection period  the single and multiple fracture propagation caused by transient cooling are numerically modeled using the 2d boundary element method  first, we show the stress and temperature distributions on and near a single crack in an elastic domain to demonstrate the effect of transient cooling on the thermal stresses in a cooled zone  then, we increase the number of cracks in the domain and consider interactions from multiple fractures and their propagation direction is investigated  in order to increase the accuracy of stress intensity factor calculation, the special crack tip displacement discontinuity element is implemented at the crack tip  also, maximum principal stress criterion is used to determine crack growth trajectory  numerical results indicate that the high thermal stresses due to cold-water injection can lead to initiation and propagation of secondary crack growth perpendicular to the main crack  furthermore, the faster cooling rate produces longer crack growth of the thermal cracks   1  introduction  thermal cracking has been regarded as a conventional reservoir stimulation technique to enhance reservoir permeability by thermal gradients in geothermal reservoirs  thermal stress can change physical properties through thermal crack growth (menendez et al , 1999) and can be initiated by the thermal expansion of the rock minerals as well as temperature gradients (siratovich et al , 2015)  knowledge of how the thermal stresses influences surrounding rock formations is an essential key to understand the fracture permeability of these environments  in geothermal reservoir, when the rock is cooled by injection fluid colder than reservoir rock temperature, the rapid decrease in temperature induces thermal stresses which cause the thermal crack to initiate and propagate into the rock matrix  as the rock is kept cooled, the in-situ stresses near the cooled zone tend to decrease because of the induced tensile stresses and depending on the geometry of the zone, the orientation of the principal stresses can be reversed (perkins and gonzalez, 1985)  cooling can exceed the in-situ stresses in the reservoir, which results in the formation of secondary thermal crack growth  these cracks can also propagate into the rock formation, increasing reservoir permeability  on the other hand, this thermal loading not only changes the total stresses but also alters the pore pressure causing additional variation in an effective stress  in conventional reservoir stimulation (hydraulic fracking), the thermal coupling effect evolves quickly (time scale of hours to days), thus this effect may not have a huge influence on thermal cracking  however, if the injection has long periods (time scale of weeks to month), the coupling effect is hardly to be negligible (tarasovs and ghassemi, 2011)  in this paper, the analysis of thermal crack growth due to transient cooling by cold water injection is numerically investigated  propagation and interaction among thermal cracks in an elastic rock are considered  for the numerical approximation in this study, the elastic displacement discontinuity boundary element method is mainly used to solve thermal cracking problems  also, the special elastic crack tip element is implemented for accurate crack tip modeling and stress intensity factor computation | 
2017-0752 	 diagenetic fluid transport in fractured shale using laboratory rock/fluid interactions data to analyze sealing potential |abstract: subsurface fluids that are super-saturated can influence the extent to which defective natural caprocks are sealed  the convective transport of such fluids are of interest in other to provide effective containment for sequestered co2 in targeted repositories  fracture geometry largely govern fluid flow characteristics in deep micro-fractured formations, it has been postulated that the effect of mineralization can lead to flow impedance in the presence of favorable geochemical and thermodynamic conditions  simulation results suggested that influx-induced mineral dissolution/precipitation reactions within clay-based sedimentary rocks can continuously close micro-fracture networks, though injection pressure and effective-stress transformation first rapidly expand the fractures  this experimental modelling research investigated the impact of in-situ geochemical precipitation on conductivity of fractures under carbon sequestration conditions  geochemical analysis were performed on four samples of natural shale rocks, effluent fluids and recovered precipitates both before and after co2-brine flooding at temperature and pressure conditions similar to that of the subsurface  bulk rock geomechanical hardness was determined using vickers’ micro-indentation  differential pressure drop data across fractured composite core were also measured with respect to time over a five day period  this was used in estimating the conductivity of the artificially fractured cores  the estimates of 1st order pressure derivative and dimensionless fracture conductivity indicated that reactive transport of dissolved minerals in aqueous fluids can occlude micro-fracture flow paths in naturally fractured shale rocks   1  introduction  shale caprocks constitute the majority of effective seals for geologic hydrocarbon bearing formations and are therefore of considerable interest in underground co2 storage into depleted oil and gas formations (vialle et al , 2016, pawar et al , 2015)  porosity, permeability, fracture conductivity and other petrophysical properties of the seal rock are of importance in seal integrity analysis and can be numerically or experimentally determined (wang et al , 2016, and noh and lake, 2002)  organic-rich shale is considered to have limited potential as membrane seals in co2 containment (hellevang et al , 2013, olabode and radonjic, 2013) shale rocks are predominantly composed of clay (olabode and radonjic, 2014 and wendler et al, 2012)  they might also have other silica and carbonate based minerals that contribute to their geomechanical strength  the mineralogical components of a typical pierre shale consists of quartz, feldspar, calcite, dolomite, pyrite, siderite and clays such as chlorite, kaolinite, illite and smectite  reaction trends are very difficult to identify at any temperature in shale rock-fluid interaction  as the complex natural mineralogical composition envelops all reactions (olabode and radonjic, 2017)  furthermore, the instability of clay minerals in the presence of low-ph fluids has been observed when using subsurface fracturing fluids  low-ph fluids are capable of dissolving clays and silicates  as temperature increases, the solubility of silici-clastic minerals is significantly increased especially in low-ph environment (vialle et al , 2016)  these findings are often observed when immersion tests are run on whole cores samples in the laboratory  this type of fluid-mineral reactions included dynamic processes that involve many effects: complex fluid flow, pore space changes, surface chemistry, and the mineral composition  several clays have been observed swelling rapidly in the presence of depressed ph conditions and elevated temperature including sloughing or disappearance of swellable clays (hensen and smit, 2002)  after minerals are dissolved in the low-ph fluids, they can precipitate in the formation pores, restricting fluid flow and leading to scaling and progressive geochemical aggregation (armitage et al , 2010)  clay solubility and geochemical precipitation in dry-gas, low permeability formations have a definite effect on decreasing conductivity of proppant packs and fracture walls; formation matrix and surface chemistry play a significant role in this as well as ph, ionic strength and adsorption processes  water from these fluids may exhibit hydrogen bonding effects with formation clays and cause swelling and sloughing | 
2017-0757 	 laboratory evaluation of induced seismicity reduction and permeability enhancement effects of cyclic hydraulic fracturing |abstract: a new concept of cyclic hydraulic fracturing with cyclic injection was suggested to replace the conventional hydraulic fracturing with continuous injection to help reduce induced seismicity during fracturing  proof of the concept was done in laboratory  test results showed that 80% of the average breakdown pressure in continuous injection is able to induce hydraulic breakdown by cyclic injection, and the total number of cycles generally decreased with increasing maximum injection pressure  induced seismicity reduction was confirmed based on acoustic emission monitoring results  apertures of induced fractures in granite specimen were estimated through computed tomography (ct) images and they were relatively smaller in case of cyclic fracturing compared with conventional hydraulic fracturing  moreover, injectivity index was calculated based on re-injection tests  the results of fracture aperture and injectivity index indicate that permeability enhancement effect for cyclic hydraulic fracturing is not as effective as conventional hydraulic fracturing considering isostatic loading condition  hydraulic fracturing efficiency is expected to be improved by both modifying the cyclic injection style and considering hydro-shear by applying confining pressure and differential stresses to the samples   1  introduction  deep geothermal energy is renewable energy with great potential for future use  however, intact rocks in deep underground are usually low permeable and hydraulic stimulation is necessary to create a permeable reservoir for extracting geothermal energy through water circulation  the induced seismicity during stimulation is a main concern and sometimes causes a controversy in public acceptance  new stimulation methods with less induced seismicity and at the same time ensuring permeability enhancement are necessary  cyclic hydraulic fracturing or fatigue hydraulic fracturing, as it sometimes is called, is a stimulation method to achieve a fatigue failure through cyclic loading  this concept is firstly presented by zang et al  (2013)  the key point in fatigue hydraulic fracturing is the frequent lowering of the injection pressure by cyclic injection to allow stress relaxation at the fracture tips  as a result, it is expected induced seismicity will be relieved due to release of stress  preliminary studies on the concept of the cyclic hydraulic fracturing have been done in recent years based on experiments and numerical simulations (yoon et al  2015; zimmerman et al  2015; zhuang et al  2016a)  differences in injection style and fracturing results between the cyclic hydraulic fracturing and the conventional hydraulic fracturing have been presented in these studies  zang et al  (2017) performed underground fatigue hydraulic fracturing experiments on avro granodiorite at the aspo hard rock laboratory (hrl) and proved that total number and magnitude of seismic events are found to be smaller in the progressive treatment with frequent phases of depressurization compared to the conventional fracturing case with continuous water injection | 
2017-0760 	 study of scale effects of rock quality designation (rqd) measurements using a discrete fracture network approach |abstract: rqd (rock quality designation) is a parameter that describes rock mass quality in terms of percentage recovery of core pieces greater than 10 centimeters  the rqd represents a basic element of several classification systems  in this paper, scale effects for rqd measurements are studied using synthetic rock masses generated by means of discrete fracture network (dfn) models  rqd measurements are performed for rock masses with varying fracture intensity and by changing the orientation of the simulated borehole to account for orientation bias  the objective is to demonstrate the existence of a representative elementary length (rel, 1d analogue of a 3d representative elementary volume, or rev) above which rqd measurements would represent an average indicator of rock mass quality  for the synthetic rock masses, calculation of rqd measurements were also performed using the relationship proposed by priest and hudson (1967) and compared to the simulated rqd measurements along the boreholes  a dfn generated for a room-and-pillar mine using mapped field data is then used as an initial validation of the results, which are preliminary in nature  it is planned to use several other case studies to further validate the results of the current study   1  introduction  assigning numbers to geology requires a delicate balance between the commonly held opinion that geology cannot be quantified and an engineering approach that attempts to assign precise mathematical terms to every physical quantity (hoek, 1999)  rock mass classification systems can be viewed as attempts to formalize this balance in terms of the ratings given to several rock mass parameters  for instance, the rock quality designation index (rqd) was developed by deere (deere et al , 1967) to provide a quantitative estimate of rock mass quality from drill core logs  rqd is defined as the cumulative length of intact core pieces longer than 10 cm as a percentage of the total length of core (figure 1); rqd ratings are given in table 1  rqd represents a fundamental parameter in several rock mass classification systems, including the rock mass rating (rmr, bieniawski, 1976) and the rock quality, q index (barton et al , 1974)  more recently, hoek et al  (2013) have proposed a quantification of the original geological strength index (gsi, hoek et al , 1995) that incorporates rqd  the advantage of the rqd is largely due to its simple definition; however, the rqd index is known to be sensitive to the relative orientation of the fractures with respect to the orientation of the borehole (or scanline)  rqd values may also depend on the experience of the engineer logging the core and the ability to distinguish natural fractures from drill and core handling induced fractures | 
2017-0761 	 telegraph hill rock slope improvements |abstract: a 2012 rock slide event from san francisco’s telegraph hill damaged adjacent property and prompted the city of san francisco department of public works (city) to initiate emergency slope stability measures  immediately after the rock slide event, the city utilized on-call geotechnical consultants to rapidly mobilize to site to perform an initial evaluation  ground-based lidar, vegetation surveys and visual surveys were performed to make general assessments of rock slope stability, risk to property and building residents, and to provide the city with recommendations for temporary mitigation measures  initial evaluations were also used as a basis for work plans for detailed geological mapping and to determine appropriate long-term remediation and ground support strategies  empirical and kinematic methods were used to design long term rock slope stabilization measures using permanent rock anchors, shotcrete and rock mesh  construction included extensive work performed on ropes, including vegetation grubbing, rock scaling, drilling for and installing double corrosion rock anchors, the grouting, tensioning and testing of rock anchors, shotcrete placement and high tensile strength steel wire mesh installation   1  introduction  a major rock fall occurred in the telegraph hill area of san francisco on january 23, 2012, causing property damage to the parc telegraph building at 240 lombard street (fig  1, 2)  a team of geological and geotechnical engineers from san francisco public works (sfpw), arup and robert y chew geotechnical (rycg) responded by visiting the site on the day of the rock fall and completing an emergency evaluation of the existing rock slope, including geological conditions, potential threat from further falls, and proposed temporary mitigation measures   in the months following the rock fall, further assessment of the site was performed to determine appropriate long-term remediation strategies that would reduce the potential for future rock falls which could impact the surrounding area, including the parc telegraph residential complex  plan, specification and cost estimate packages were prepared for the center slope and upper slope by the arup/rycg joint venture and for the lower slope by cotton, shires and associates  city budget limitations prompted the sfpw to split the work into two phases based on a high level risk assessment  the center and lower portions of the rock slope were prioritized as they were considered to pose a greater hazard to human life and property at the base of the slope (fig  3)  construction of the phase 1 rock slope improvements (central and lower slope) were completed in early 2015  construction of the phase 2 rock slope improvements (upper slope) were completed in late 2016 | 
2017-0762 	 complex fracture network model for stimulation of unconventional reservoirs |abstract: this paper presents numerical simulations of hydraulic fracture propagation in a naturally-fractured rock at large scale using the displacement discontinuity method  the model has been developed to address hydraulic fracture propagation; it’s interaction with natural fractures (crossing/arrest) and transition of natural fractures (closed joint elements) to hydraulic fractures  the natural fracture elements (fracture opening supported by asperities and fluid pressure) and hydraulic fracture elements (fracture opening supported fully by fluid pressure) are treated separately in the model  using a relationship between fracture closure and effective stress and by specifying stiffness of asperities, the amount of the closure experienced by natural fractures is determined  the effect of pore pressure distribution and induced stresses due to fracture deformation on natural fracture slip is studied  the results include injection pressure response, network geometry and fracture conductivities for the rock masses under different in-situ stress anisotropy  we find fluid diversion into natural fracture can initiate wing fracture growth while the parent fracture is still mechanically closed  induced stresses alone have negligible effect on slippage of isolated natural fractures  also, small deformations of natural fractures due to the initial in-situ stress state has negligible impact on hydraulic fracture propagation   1  introduction  the potential of unconventional plays has greatly improved with the recent advancements in hydraulic fracturing technology  unconventional reservoirs such as shales are naturally fractured rock systems  micro-seismic events are often associated with stimulation of these reservoirs, which can be attributed to shear displacement of natural fractures due to induced stresses and pore pressure changes  interpreting fracture characteristic alone from micro-seismic monitoring (msm) can be difficult since the proper cause of events is unknown and also the uncertainty associated with the location of observation well  as a result, complex fracture models are used in conjunction with micro-seismic imaging to estimate reservoir stimulation volume, hydraulic fracture and natural fracture characteristics (e g , lu and ghassemi, 2017)  however, the present large scale complex fracture models usually are simplified to reduce computational cost and increase robustness  semi-analytical models (weng et al , 2011) cannot take stress shadow between fractures into account accurately  models based on predefined fracture locations (mcclure, 2012) and discrete fracture networks (e g , willis-richards et al , 1996; wang and ghassemi, 2011; raihi and damjanac, 2013) are more suitable for injection extraction problems than hydraulic fracture stimulation  fem based models (fu et al , 2011) are not suitable for field scale simulations  fully coupled fluid flow - fracture deformation models (zhang et al , 2009; sesetty and ghassemi, 2012; dahi-taleghani and olson, 2011) exists but are limited to few small scale fractures | 
2017-0763 	 simulation of hydraulic fracture clusters considering viscosity and toughness dominated propagation |abstract: in fluid driven fractures, energy is dissipated by creating new fracture surfaces and overcoming viscous resistance to fluid flow  it is known that when fluid driven fractures propagate in a rock with a finite amount of resistance to fracture, the toughness (<u+03be>1/2) and viscosity (<u+03be>2/3) solutions for the fracture aperture co-exist near the fracture tip  depending on the ratio of viscous dissipation and fracture resistance, the region for the validity of each tip asymptote varies  in this paper, we developed a 2d displacement discontinuity based hydraulic fracture propagation model for multiple large-scale hydraulic fracture propagation while taking into account the multi-scale nature of the fracture tip  the numerical model is capable of distinguishing between viscosity and toughness dominated propagation regimes, and takes into account their corresponding solutions as boundary conditions near the fracture tips  we provide numerical examples of large-scale multiple fracture propagation in a rock with finite fracture toughness using injection fluid viscosities range from 1-1000 cp  the results include fracture geometry, aperture distribution and regime of fracture propagation  to study the effect of fracture tip asymptote on the resulting fracture cluster, we approximated multi-scale fracture tip asymptotes with toughness asymptote showing that for a rock with finite toughness and for the range of fluid viscosities considered, the toughness solution provides sufficiently accurate results irrespective of the regime of fracture propagation   1  introduction  the fracture propagation problem according to lefm theory assumes square root variation of crack opening displacement (or square root asymptote u <u+2248> x1/2), near the crack tips, where u is the opening near crack tip and x is the distance from crack tip  this behavior is modeled by a special crack tip element in boundary element methods  in lefm, fracture propagation is governed by a material property called fracture toughness which is related to fracture energy  but fracture energy is only one of the sources of energy dissipation mechanisms during hydraulic fracture propagation  energy is also consumed to overcome the resistance of flow of viscous fluids in the fracture channel, which is called viscosity dissipation  if the viscous energy dissipation is significantly larger than the energy dissipated in creating new fracture surfaces, the fracture is assumed to be propagating under a viscosity dominated regime  in this scenario, fracture propagation is assumed to be completely governed by fluid dynamics of viscous flow and is independent of fracture toughness (spence and sharp 1985, lister 1990, desroches et al , 1994)  this kind of behavior could be observed when fluid is injected into pre-existing fractures (where fracture resistance is negligible) or flow of magma in fractures (spence& turcotte 1985) or inducing hydraulic fractures using high viscous fluids in petroleum reservoirs  on the other hand, if viscous dissipation is negligible compared to the energy required to create new fracture surfaces (in the cases of rocks with very high fracture toughness), the fracture propagation can occur under toughness dominated regime where the propagation behavior is completely controlled by fracture toughness  therefore the main controlling parameters of fracture propagation regime are viscosity of the fluid and the rock fracture resistance | 
2017-0766 	 anisotropic strength of poorman formation rocks, kismet project |abstract: as part of lawrence berkeley national laboratory’s kismet (permeability (k) and induced seismicity management for energy technologies) project, laboratory rock mechanics experiments were conducted on cores taken from the sanford underground research facility (surf) (formerly of homestake mine) in lead, south dakota  strength properties and their anisotropy were investigated in order to aid the interpretation of the hydraulic-fracturing stress measurements conducted in boreholes drilled down 70-meters from the 4850’ level (1478 meters depth) of the mine  brazilian disc and triaxial lab tests were conducted on these cores as well as cores previously obtained as part of the deep underground science and engineering laboratory (dusel) program  emphasis on how the orientation of the foliation in the schist relative to the loading direction affects the respective strengths of the rocks was monitored  brazilian disc tensile strengths ranged between 2 7-4 84 mpa when loaded parallel to the foliation, whereas strengths ranged between 5 82-12 01 mpa when loaded perpendicular to foliation, indicating tensile strength anisotropy  triaxial tests also indicated anisotropy in static and dynamic elastic properties and strength anisotropies when loaded parallel and perpendicular to the foliation direction  ucs results yielded an average value of 107 4 mpa for triaxial samples loaded parallel to foliation, and 88 1 mpa for samples loaded foliation perpendicular to foliation  young’s modulus results indicated a 17 5% increase between samples loaded parallel to foliation compared to perpendicular   1  introduction  under the kismet project, supported by the department of energy (doe) subter (subsurface technology and engineering research, development and demonstration) crosscut initiative, fluid injection tests were performed in the sanford underground research facility (surf), formerly known as the homestake mine, in order to monitor the behavior of hydraulic fractures using in-situ geophysical monitoring  the motivation behind the kismet project was to study stress measurements and fracture stimulation with accompanying borehole monitoring to characterize relations between stress, induced fractures, and rock fabric (intermediate-scale hydraulic fracturing in a deep mine, kismet project summary, 2016) prior to the main fluid injection, several hydraulic fracturing stress measurements were conducted in boreholes drilled down 70-meters from the 4850’ level (1478 meters depth) of the mine to characterize the in-situ stress state needed for later interpretation of the geophysical data | 
2017-0769 	 shale discrimination with machine learning methods |abstract: one of the most important tasks at the beginning of geomechanical workflows is the classification of lithological units based on well log data  in particular, the discrimination of shale vs  non-shale layers significantly influences the quality of pore pressure prediction and wellbore stability analyses  shales are typically associated with a combination of relatively high densities, relatively high gamma ray signals and low resistivity, with relatively good consistencies within a formation  therefore, relationships obtained from one well can oftentimes be employed in nearby wells  however, exact relationships do not usually apply to wells in other formations  local calibrations are therefore required  when done by humans, the careful and considerate picking of shale intervals is often very time consuming, and different practitioners frequently produce different interpretations  in this paper we evaluate whether these drawbacks can be resolved by employing a machine learning method  linear logistic regression is evaluated as a method for binary classifying of shale vs  non-shale lithology using log data from vertical wells located in a basin within the united states that contains predominantly gas resources  the lithology column characterization is based on sandy - shale formations throughout the reservoir; it was interpreted by analyzing the behavior of density, gamma ray, resistivity, compressional and shear slowness logs  prediction results with training and test data from a single well and cross-well predictions on new, unseen data demonstrate remarkable performance  our results indicate that machine learning methods with adequately trained classifiers have the potential to automate shale picking   1  introduction  machine learning methods are increasingly deployed to benefit our daily activities  these methods are frequently performed to expedite operations or to assist with laborious assignments  the benefits of employing machine learning methods include increased speed of execution, reproducibility and consistency   these methods have also been evaluated for petrophysical and geomechanical analyses and interpretations, which are commonly performed by human experts on the basis of log data and, when available, seismic and coring data  comparing several classification methods zhao et al  (2015) have concluded that supervised learning methods can provide accurate facies classification, and that unsupervised learning methods can expose features that might otherwise be overlooked  support vector machines (e g , torres and reveron, 2013; zhao et al , 2014; al-mudhafar, 2015) and a neural networks (smith et al , 1991; wong et al , 1995; westphal and bornholdt, 1996) have been applied with various levels of success | 
2017-0770 	 study on distribution of acoustic emission and inelastic region in hydraulic fracturing |abstract: with the extensive application of hydraulic fracturing technology, researches on nonlinear responses of rocks before hydraulic fracture initiation and during hydraulic fracture propagation have become increasingly thorough  a large-scale true triaxial physical simulation device of hydraulic fracturing was adopted to carry out hydraulic fracturing for natural cores with/without of confining pressures  meanwhile, acoustic emission (ae) signals during the acquisition test were monitored  on this basis, distributions of ae events and the real morphologies of hydraulic fractures were compared to qualitatively analyze the relation between spatial distribution of ae events and hydraulic fractures  in the entire process of hydraulic fracturing, with/without confining pressures, the distribution region of micro-fractures had a tendency to concentrate on the fracture plane with the increase in pumping pressures  in addition, with confining pressures, the range of the inelastic region was always larger than that without confining pressures  analysis on nonlinear region varying with time indicated that the inelastic region inside the rock dynamically developed during hydraulic fracturing and it also had a preferable consistency with fracture morphologies   1  introduction  since 1949 when the hydraulic fracturing technology was applied in north america for the first time (clark, 1949), it played a critical role in unconventional reservoir stimulation (king, 2010)  in recent years, this technology is also adopted to develop geothermal resources based on the enhanced geothermal systems (egs) (mit, 2006)   soon after the application of hydraulic fracturing, a mathematical model related to it is proposed (zheltov and khristianovich, 1955)  during studies on rock fracturing, labuz et al  (1985) present a modified barenblatt (1962) model targeted at it by means of a series of tests  based on previous suppositions, the nonlinear region existing on crack tip during hydraulic fracturing attracts more and more attentions (desroches et al , 1993; papanastasiou and thiercelin, 1993; gardner, 1992)  in line with large quantities of laboratory hydraulic fracture tests by johns and cleary (1991), non-linear region generate on the crack tip had an influence on pressure distributions in the fracture, which is differentiated from the original elastic model  similarly, the study on magma-driven dike propagation also proves that confining pressure is able to exert significant impacts on the nonlinear region during fracture propagation (rubin, 1993) | 
2017-0771 	 an artificial intelligent approach to predict static poisson's ratio |abstract: static poisson’s ratio plays a vital role in calculating the minimum and maximum horizontal stresses which are required to alleviate the risks associated with the drilling and production operations  incorrect estimation of static poisson’s ratio may wrongly lead to inappropriate field development plans which consequently result in heavy investment decisions  static poisson’s ratio can be determined by retrieving cores throughout the depth of the reservoir section and performing laboratory tests, which are extremely expensive as well as time consuming  the objective of this paper is to develop a robust and an accurate model for estimating static poisson’s ratio based on 610 core sample measurements and their corresponding wireline logs data using artificial neural network  the obtained results showed that the developed ann model was able to predict the static poisson’s ratio based on log data; bulk density, compressional time, and shear time  the developed ann model can be used to estimate static poisson’s ratio with high accuracy; the correlation coefficient was 0 98 and the average absolute error was 1 3%  in the absence of core data, the developed technique will help engineers to estimate a continuous profile of the static poisson’s ratio and hence reduce the overall cost of the well   1  introduction  linear elastic behavior of a rock is represented by two parameters, i e , young’s modulus and poisson’s ratio  these are the key parameters for constructing 1d and 3d geo-mechanical earth model (chang et al , 2006)  poisson’s ratio is the ratio of lateral expansion to longitudinal contraction (jaegar et al , 2007)  it is the material property that plays a vital role in assessing the deformation of elastic materials and can be defined as the behavior in which a substance tends to elongate in the direction perpendicular to the direction of compression  the common example of poisson’s ratio is rubber band, which on stretched becomes markedly thinner | 
2017-0775 	 tensile stress close to a wellbore in the high pressure gas well considering of shear stress |abstract: although there have been relatively successful modifications to darcy's law to account for inertial effects, for example, the forchheimer equation, none of these relationships are valid when the flow is compressible  the importance of gas acceleration which is a part of inertial effects is quantified in terms of a dimensionless parameter  when the gas acceleration is important, the tensile stress including of effective radial stress and shear stress is examined  it is shown that the magnitude of the effective tensile stress for the accelerating darcy-forchheimer flow is higher than that for the darcy and darcy-forchheimer flows for the same wellbore pressure  for the same mass flux, the shear stress for the accelerating darcy-forchheimer flow is the largest tensile stress  for the same wellbore pressure, the shear stress for the accelerating darcy-forchheimer flow is the smallest tensile stress  the results about the tensile stress, together with compressive strength of rock, can be used to predict sand production of sandstone reservoir in the high pressure gas well  |1  introduction |it is serious trouble of the sand production from the high-pressure gas well, and it reduces production rate and economic benefit  although there have been relatively successful modifications to darcy’s law to account for inertial effects, for example, the forchheimer equation (du plessis, 1994; skjetne and auriault, 1999; handren et al , 2001), none of these relationships are valid when the flow is highly compressible (de ville, 1996; ciarletta and straughan, 2006; straughan, 2008; jin et al , 2011a, 2012a,b; jiang et al , 2015a,b,c, 2016)  recently, jin et al  (2011b) studied the development of the tensile stress in the high pressure gas well considering the high compressive gas flow  the gas acceleration effect plays an important role in the high compressive gas flow, and can induce the large effective tensile stress  however, the tensile stress is not large enough to exceed the tensile strength of the rock which cannot cause the tensile failure | 
2017-0776 	 rock physics and geomechanics of 3-d printed rocks |abstract: in last several years, 3d printing technology has been gradually applied to civil and petroleum engineering, although remains to be tentative  this study used two different cylindrical samples in size which are printed by gypsum powder to investigate the feasibility and reliability regarding rock-like behavior  as the substitutes of rock specimens, elastic properties of the samples are investigated through the velocity measurements and uniaxial compression test  the p-wave velocities and the attenuation coefficients of the 3d printed samples are obtained to estimate the quality factor of this special material, which aims to behave like a natural rock specimen  the mechanical parameters are also measured by uniaxial testing system, exposing the rock-type similarity in modes of deformation and failure  the size effect on the elastic properties is also analyzed  the results indicate that the feasibility and availability of 3d printing technology if applied to rock physics experiments and geomechanical testing, will provide the potency to better understand fundamental concepts   1  introduction  as one of the major accomplishments of recent years, 3d printing, also known as additive manufacturing (wohlers, t  and t  gornet, 2014), is invented and extensively applied in multiple subjects, including biological medicine, electronic components and modern handicraft (murphy, s v  and a  atala  2014; lee, v k  et al , 2014)  for the purpose of engineering, versatile 3d printed models, whose materials mainly include the sand-powder and polylactic acid (pla), were created to be tested for various types of analysis   these artificially created models have the following advantages: precise, flexible, controllable, repeatable, time saving, effort saving, and economical  thus, recent rock mechanics and petroleum engineering research is targeting to use 3d printing in physical modelling experiments  recent publications of modeling rock specimens through 3d printing has revealed its advantages in producing complicated samples with special external forms and internal structures (jiang, q  et al , 2016)  with the use of x-ray tomography, 3d pore structures inside a reservoir rock is extracted and imaged  then, these images become the reference substance and prototype to be used for printing 3d artificial porosity models, which are further laboratory rock tested (ishutov, s  et al , 2015)  hydraulic fracturing is the main technology to produce from shale reservoirs in the recent years, where the fundamental research related to this topic also introduced utilizing 3d printing into the laboratory  with the aim of investigation of fracture effect on rock properties, 3d printing technology is used to generate specimens that have cracks with variable density, inclination angles and combination forms (jiang, c  et al , 2016)  while, most of the printing inks, or materials, belong to the category of plastic materials such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene(abs) or polylactic acid (pla)  the printing material of gypsum powder bonded with visijet clear agent, which is called “full color sandstone”, is commercially spread and not fully investigated for rock related studies | 
2017-0778 	 a review of the application of numerical modelling in the prediction of depth of spalling damage around underground openings |abstract: spalling and rock bursting are two common modes of failure in underground civil and mining excavations under high in-situ stress regimes  depth of spalling failure around underground openings is stress-driven and proportional to the size of the tunnel  various modelling approaches based on continuum, discontinuum and hybrid methods have been proposed in recent years to predict the depth of spalling around underground openings  this paper initially reviews results of numerical approaches based on continuum and discontinuum methods in reproducing the spalling damage around the url mine-by tunnel  the importance of micro-heterogeneity on the mechanism leading to the spalling failure in massive lac du bonnet granite around the mine-by tunnel is studied using an integrated hybrid finite/discrete element-discrete fracture network (fdem-dfn) approach  the fdem-dfn numerical results showed that the presence of micro-heterogeneity plays an important role in the in-situ strength reduction of the massive lac du bonnet granite, leading to spalling failure at a stress level around 50-60% of the laboratory uniaxial compressive strength (ucs)  the shape and depth of spalling failure obtained from the fdem-dfn approach agrees well with in-situ observations   1  introduction  failure of underground openings in hard brittle rocks is a function of the in-situ stress magnitudes and the characteristics of the rock mass i e , the intact rock strength and the fracture network  failure at low in-situ stress magnitudes is controlled by continuity and distribution of the natural fractures in the rock mass matrix [1]  as the magnitudes of the in-situ stress increase, the failure process is dominated by new stress-induced fractures growing parallel to the excavation boundary  rock bursting and spalling are two common failure modes in underground civil and mining excavations under high in-situ stress regimes  spalling damage is described as the development of visible extension fractures (mode i) under compressive loading that can be either violent or non-violent [2]  high induced tangential stress acting at the periphery of underground openings, where the confining pressure is very low, results in spalling and rock bursting failure  this type of brittle damage leads to the formation of the closely-spaced slabs around a tunnel wall oriented parallel to the major principal stress (tangential) direction |

2017-0782 	 shaking table test for estimating the effects of seismic loading on the mobility of rockfall |abstract: rockfall is one of the most frequent geo-hazards, which often occurs in mountain areas and along land transportation  it often causes serious consequences in terms of lives lost, homes destroyed and infrastructures disrupted because its high energy and significant mobility, although it usually impacts only small areas compared to other geo-hazards  rockfall could be activated by various triggers, in which earthquake is one important trigger  estimate the run-out of earthquake-induced rockfall is important for choosing suitable protection measures  a growing body of evidence, including site videos and eyewitness testimonies, suggests that the ground still intensively quake when the process of rockfall  the main purpose of this paper is to clarify whether the seismic loading has any influence on the mobility of rockfall through shaking table test  thousands of tests are conducted to investigate the effects of the amplitude and the frequency of simple harmonic seismic loading on the horizontal and the lateral displacements of triangular prism, quadrangular prism, pentagonal prism and hexagonal prism  the results show the significant effects of seismic loading on the run-out distance and the lateral displacements of rockfall   1  introduction  rockfall is one of the most frequent geo-hazards, which often occurs in mountain areas and along land transportation  it often causes serious consequences in terms of lives lost, homes destroyed and infrastructures disrupted because its high energy and significant mobility, although it usually impacts only small areas compared to other geo-hazards (guzzetti et al , 2002)  in addition, rockfall event occurs accidently in most cases, that is hardly unpredictable and usually without any obvious warnings (masuya et al , 2009)  as for examples, there are many reports on rockfall induced fatalities and economic losses particularly along roads from china, japan and other parts of the world (hungr et al , 2004)  therefore, in order to mitigate rockfall risk, it is important to clear the disaster-caused mechanism and take preventive measures correspondingly   different rockfall analysis methods have been proposed at different scales through empirical models, process-based models and geophysical information system (gis)-based models  however, most of these approaches assess the rockfall using heuristic approaches, expert judgement or analysis of relatively small historical datasets  this makes them inapplicable in seismic areas, where the rockfall is mostly caused by earthquake events (valagussa et al , 2014) |

2017-0788 	 mechanism analysis of earthquake induced extreme motions: clarifying extreme acceleration |abstract: earthquake induced extreme motions are classified as the extreme large acceleration, the extreme large velocity and the extreme large displacement  in this paper, a sudden braking model is proposed for the mechanism of the extreme large acceleration, i e  the extreme large acceleration can easily occur when a moving body is suddenly braked  the model is verified by theoretical analysis, laboratory experiments and numerical simulation using dda  it is successful to reproduce the unprecedented vertical surface acceleration of nearly four times gravity, recorded at the west ichinoseki station during the 14 june 2008 iwate-miyagi earthquake (ms6 9) in japan, by dda simulation   1  introduction  extreme motions are often observed during strong earthquakes  they can be classified as the extreme large acceleration, the extreme large velocity and the extreme large displacement   for example, an unprecedented vertical surface acceleration of nearly four times gravity was recorded at the west ichinoseki station, 3 km southwest of the epicenter, during the 14 june 2008 iwate-miyagi earthquake (ms6 9) in japan   as an example of extreme large velocity motion, a huge rock was found ejected from a slope and flied across an unbelievable long horizontal distance comparing with the corresponding slope height after the 12 may 2008 wenchuan earthquake (ms8 0) in china  the initial ejecting velocity is estimated as large as 17m/s   for examples of extreme large displacement motions, many large scale landslides induced by strong earthquakes were found with extreme long run-out distances which are more than 10 times the average runout distance of ordinary landslides   why and how these extreme motions occurred are still incomprehensible problems  it is important and necessary to clarify the mechanisms of these extreme motions induced by earthquakes for disaster mitigation in earthquake engineering as well as seismology   we have studied on the mechanism of each extreme motion phenomenon  a sudden braking model is proposed for the mechanism of the extreme large acceleration  a ping pong model is proposed for the mechanism of extreme large velocity  a multiplex acceleration model is proposed for extreme large displacement  the above mentioned extreme motions can be explained by using these models and they have been successfully simulated by using dda simulations  in this paper, we only focus on discussing and clarifying the mechanism of the extreme acceleration due to the paper length limitation  the mechanism of the other two phenomena will be analyzed in a separated paper | 
2017-0796 	 numerical sanding risk assessment considering cement bond coverage |abstract: this paper investigates how the cement bond behind the casing affects the sanding risk by using a numerical sand production prediction approach for cased and perforated completions  a finite element sand production prediction workflow was used as the basis of the model setup, which includes a three-layered model considering the rock, well, casings and perforations  additional detail for the casing and partial cement coverage was implemented in these models to capture the changed loads, stress and boundary conditions affecting both the wellbore and perforations  modelling considered a number of different conditions: 1) amount of cement coverages; 2) depletion stages; and 3) rock strengths  the prediction results were compared with the standard sand production prediction results assuming a perfect cement bonding  it was found that for partial cement coverage, increase of plastic strain on wellbore depends on the location of the cement void: if the void is in a low stress concentration location, the risk of sanding on wellbore wall only increases slightly comparing to fully cemented cases; if the void is in a high stress concentration area then the risk of sanding will be as high as in the no cement case  compared to the great increase in the sanding at the wellbore wall, the increase in sanding risk on the perforations is minor and mainly for perforations in high stress concentration areas  the results of the study can be used to support a selective perforation strategy based on cement bond logs to identify the casing-cement bonding conditions and the target area parameters such as rock strength and orientations   1  introduction  predicting the onset of sand production in oil and gas fields is an important aspect of sand management and has been the focus of numerous researchers over the past decades  laboratory measurements, field calibrations, and different prediction methods including both analytical and numerical (okland et al  1996, van den hoek et al  2000, veeken et al  1991, volonte et al  2013, willson et al  2001) have been developed to define the conditions at which the reservoir rock will fail and start to produce sand  however, simplified and idealized assumptions were usually used in the chosen methods to get a faster solution for a larger number of cases  although it might be fast and effective, it could also increase uncertainty for some predictions and may lead to wrong decision-making in some extreme cases  among all the complications caused by either operations or hostile field conditions, completion integrity, such as the cement bond condition for cased and perforated completion, has been commonly neglected during sand production prediction  borehole condition and cement sheath are sometimes considered as part of the sand management by using rule of thumb methods (addis et al 2008), however, the effect of cement bond quality towards the risk of sand production has not been investigated properly in previously published references | 
2017-0813 	 permeability testing using pressure pulse loading and the consolidation induced transient deformation |abstract: this study presents the feasibility of performing permeability measurement by interpretation of consolidation-induced time-dependent deformation of sample when an instant pore pressure pulse is applied  for the interpretation of measured transient behavior, a procedure to back-calculate permeability from measured consolidation strain is developed  the estimation shows promising results that gave similar order of magnitude of permeability compared to that measured from steady state method  however, this study shows that creep behavior affects the interpretation of permeability significantly as the effective stress increases  this study indicates that proper calibration of creep effect is important to get reliable values  this study also present some recommendations to optimize the results   1  introduction  permeability measurement using the steady-state method requires much time for low permeable lithologies (e g  shale or mud stone), leading to very long experimental time if the aim is several permeability measurements per test  for example, it may take more than one week for one permeability measurement for low permeable rock  however, if an instant pressure pulse loading can capture the transient/consolidation behavior within some hours and the measurement can be converted to the permeability, it can provide a cost and time effective alternative test method   change in pore pressure of porous material change the stress conditions acting on its grain structure, which is known as the effective stress  consequently, the pore volume changes due to expulsion/influx of the pore fluid that occupies the void spaces, a process known as consolidation (or primary consolidation) (biot, 1941; terzhaghi, 1943)  thus, hydraulic parameters, especially the permeability, can be deduced from the consolidation-induced deformation, which is strongly coupled with hydraulic behaviour   as schematically illustrated in figure 1a, we can assume two-way 1-d consolidation condition when the pore pressure at the top and bottom boundaries change rapidly with a step function of <u+0394><u+03a1>, which is labeled ‘pulse-loading’ hereafter  after the pulse loading, the pore pressure will be gradually dissipated from the top and bottom to the middle of the specimen over time (i e  red curves in left figure 1a)  consequently, as shown in figure 1b, associated volume changes may continue until the pore pressure becomes fully dissipated or reaches steady-state condition | 
2017-0814 	 development of new design tools for open stoping underground mines |abstract the stability graph method has been used for more than three decades for the design of stopes in sublevel stoping mining operations  this method estimates the stope size required to reduce operational hazards and achieve continuous production  over time several improvements have taken place, as well as the addition of new cases  these new cases are relevant and need to be collected in order to update the stability graph, improving its reliability in predicting the stability state of open stopes   the addition of new case studies involves two main stage, that systematically performed allow to update the graph and delineating more reliable stability boundaries  the first stage required the collection of geotechnical data, and the second one, consider a back analysis of stopes, performance parameters and the assignation of stability state to each case   the main problems related to both stages have been identified by the authors in chilean mining operations: the geotechnical data is frequently collected and stored under different conditions and the calculations of performance parameters do not accurately performed  for this purpose, several computational tools have been developed and integrated into a software, mineroc  mineroc allows defining the optimal open stope size and the stability graph method can be adapted to a particular local mining context, based on local case studies and own definitions of stability  the software includes four modules: acquisition, performance, database and design   in this work, an application of the software is performed and the main features of mineroc are presented  new chilean case studies have been collected and used to establish new stability boundaries  finally, it's possible to evaluate the benefits of the software, and its positive impact on the mine planning a design process, since more accurate predictions of stopes stability and incorporation of overbreak can be performed   1  introduction  in sublevel stoping, the potential for instability in the rock surrounding underground mine openings is an ever present threat to the safety of both people and equipment  to counteract these threats, several tools for the design of open stopes have been developed through years  mathews et al ,1981 proposed the stability graph method in which a qualitative stability state for each stope wall is given based on visual evaluations and/or reconciled data | 
2017-0815 	 ultrasonic method for estimation of crack initiation stress |abstract: stress strain behavior of low-porosity crystalline rocks is divided into four characteristic stages: crack closure, elastic region, stable crack growth and unstable crack growth which leads to brittle failure  the beginning of stable crack growth is called the crack initiation stress while the beginning of unstable microcracking is called the crack damage stress  this laboratory study presents a new technique for estimation of crack initiation threshold  the technique is based on the interpretation of measured ultrasonic attenuation  the attenuation method was tested on the set of 4 granite specimens during the uniaxial loading  the attenuation based crack initiation stresses were comparable with those determined by interpretation of stress-strain data and acoustic emission data  |1  introduction |the process of failure of low-porosity rocks depends on their mechanical properties and actual stress and temperature conditions  at low pressure and low temperature, brittle failure is most common  this is a progressive process requiring the initiation, growth and coalescence of cracks (lockner, 1993)  stress strain behavior of low-porosity crystalline rocks during laboratory compression experiments is divided into four characteristic stages: crack closure, elastic region, stable crack growth and unstable crack growth which leads to brittle failure, (brace et al , 1966; bieniawski, 1967; lajtai, 1974)  |the fracturing process of stressed rock begins with crack initiation (<u+03c3>ci), which for low-porosity rocks occurs approximately at 40-50% of peak strength (<u+03c3>p) (cai et al , 2004; nicksiar and martin, 2013)  after <u+03c3>ci, dilatancy begins and stable crack growth follows up to the crack damage threshold (<u+03c3>cd), which is approximately at 80% of <u+03c3>p (cai et al , 2004)  after crossing the <u+03c3>cd, there is unstable crack growth accompanied with nucleation of the failure zone (<u+03c3>n) at 97-100% of <u+03c3>p (rao et al , 2011)  the stress drop accompanied with the formation of a macro-scale shear failure follows after peak stress is crossed  |throughout stable crack growth, the generation and propagation of tension cracks is supposed to be dominant (tapponnier and brace, 1976; martin and chandler, 1994)  because the tension cracks are parallel to the maximum compressive stress, they cause a nonlinear increase in lateral strain while the axial strain remains linear with increasing stress  in the plane perpendicular to maximum stress, these tension cracks also decrease elastic wave velocities while increasing elastic wave attenuation, velocity anisotropy and shear wave splitting (stanchits et al , 2006)  after crossing <u+03c3>ci, there is an onset in acoustic emission (ae) activity (eberhardt et al , 1998)  when isotropic material is fractured, random space distribution and dominance of tension source types is characteristic for ae events at this stage of loading (stanchits et al , 2006) | 
2017-0817 	 geometric effects on ultrasonic pulse velocity measurements in mortar specimens |abstract: non-destructive ultrasonic evaluation (nde) is commonly used for assessment of civil infrastructure and characterization of construction materials  among the acoustic methods the impact echo, ultrasonic pulse velocity (upv), and surface waves can be distinguished  in this paper, we focus on the upv method as an astm standard test method for concrete specimens  upv method has different applications such as the assessment of the relative quality of concrete, the detection of voids and cracks, and the evaluation of the effectiveness of repairs  upv measurements can be also used for monitoring changes in the condition of a specimen  in spite of the simplicity of the method, its results highly depend on the type of transducers, the coupling transducer-specimen, and the specimen dimensions  in this article, we investigate the effects of the sensor and the specimen dimensions  the results for upv tests on 9 mortar specimens of different heights and diameters are presented  the specimens are tested with 54 khz and 850 khz resonant frequency (fc) transducers and a state-of-the-art 5mhz laser vibrometer   1  introduction  concrete is a popular structural material used in civil engineering applications  as for any material, condition of concrete may be affected by the quality of design, manufacturing, loads applied to a structure, character of the loads, environmental deterioration, or aging  condition of concrete plays a key role for safety of structures (kim et al , 2005)  non-destructive ultrasonic evaluation (nde) is commonly used for assessment of civil infrastructure and characterization of construction materials  among the acoustic methods the impact echo, ultrasonic pulse velocity (upv), and surface waves analysis can be distinguished (mccann and forde, 2001), (popovics, 2003)  the latest trends focuses more on attenuation of wave front (aggelis et al , 2005), (kirlangic et al , 2015) and more sensitive methods for detecting changes in velocity (e g  coda wave interfefometry (dai et al , 2013), (planes and larose, 2013), (snieder, 2006))  wave velocity depends on the medium properties, therefore upv method is a very popular technique used in nde in civil engineering  propagation velocity of the longitudinal (p-wave) through the material (vp) can be calculated as:| 
2017-0818 	 can heating-induced creep result in shale barriers for p&a applications? |abstract: it has been shown that some shale formations form barriers around a casing of a well due to shale creep that results in closure and sealing of the annulus around the casing  the existence of such shale barriers facilitates plug and abandonment (p&a) operations, which includes significant cost reductions  the question is whether barrier-forming shale creep or plastic deformation can be stimulated if no barrier has been formed over the lifetime of the well  recent laboratory experiments with core plugs from different field-shale facies as well as numerical simulations suggest that controlled heating may help stimulate plastic deformation in shale that may result in shale barriers  the experimental results show that undrained heating under deviatoric stress may result in large plastic shear strains  thermo-hydro-mechanically coupled finite-element simulations confirm that heating of a well may result in a sufficiently strong reduction of the borehole radius to close the gap between shale formation and casing   1  introduction  long-term sealing of oil/gas-production wells at the end of field life, so-called plug and abandonment (p&a) operations, is very costly for off-shore wells, and the oil industry is therefore looking for low-cost solutions  previously, it was demonstrated that some shale formations in the overburden have the ability to form seals around a casing (williams et al , 2009), which is attributed to shale creep (fj<u+00e6>r et al , 2016)  in this case, the casing could be left in the ground within a plugging zone, and significant costs for casing removal could be saved  however, not all shale formations form seals, and the question is if shale creep and seal formation can be stimulated to prevent the need for casing removal, e g  by pressure drawdown in the annulus around the casing  another possibility for stimulating plastic deformations in shales, as investigated in the present study, is controlled heating  heating may result in enhanced creep rates and/or reduced rock strength  maybe more importantly, heating of a low-permeability shale formation results in a pore pressure increase in the heated zone since thermal expansion of the pore fluid is generally larger than that of the rock matrix (often by one or two orders of magnitude for shale permeabilities in the nano-darcy range)  for shales, heat diffusion is usually faster than hydraulic diffusion, which limits or nearly suppresses pore fluid drainage during heating  a thermally induced increase in pore pressure leads to a reduction of effective stress, which under the shear stresses present around a wellbore, may result in plastic shear deformation  in this work, we show that moderate heating may result in sufficiently large plastic deformations to close the annulus between shale formation and casing (typically a few cm)  whether such deformations would also result in a hydraulic seal remains to be studied | 
2017-0820 	 active ultrasonic monitoring of rocks under uniaxial compression |abstract: an intact rock specimen when subjected to uniaxial compression experiences multiple stages of deformation  this begins with the formation of micro-fractures at low stresses and subsequent transition into the development of a macroscopic failure plane at its ultimate strength  these fractures, when monitored through active ultrasonic signals, tend to act as low-pass filters that attenuate the waveforms  in present study, active seismic monitoring was conducted on lyon’s sandstone specimens while they were subjected to uniaxial compression  a lab-view controlled seismic system with sampling frequency of 100 mhz was used to acquire seismic waveforms in real time  in the experiments, the effect of ultrasonic transducers on the seismic measurements was investigated using two different p-wave transducers  the transducers were coupled to the rock specimen at different locations along its axial length so that the wave transmission is normal to the major principal stress direction  under the application of load, changes in seismic velocities and amplitude of the active signals with respect to the stress magnitudes were processed for characterization of crack initiation (ci) and crack damage (cd) stress thresholds  the possible mechanisms for seismic attenuation based on the friction dissipation model and displacement discontinuity model have also been put forward   1  introduction  the formation of extensile micro-fractures is associated with yielding of brittle rocks at stresses below the ultimate compressive strength  the stress corresponding to the initiation of the cracks is defined as the crack initiation (ci) threshold, while crack damage (cd) is the stress threshold at which the accumulated cracks in the rock begin to coalesce, ultimately leading to formation of a failure surface at the peak strength (ghazvinian, 2015)  traditional shear failure criterions over-estimate the in-situ strength of brittle rocks at low confining stresses by not accounting for damage caused to the rock by the formation of these micro-fractures (martin, 1997; diederichs, 2003)  characterization of damage thresholds is therefore vital for an accurate prediction of brittle rock strength  the present study focuses on identifying rock fracturing processes and the associated damage mechanisms which consequently can lead to a precise determination of these rock damage thresholds  in this paper, the terms fractures, cracks and discontinuities have been used interchangeably | 
2017-0826 	 investigation of wellbore breakouts in deviated wells - a 3d numerical modeling approach |abstract: borehole breakout is one of the major wellbore instability problems in both vertical and deviated wells  it usually presents a time-dependent failure process consisting of initiation, propagation, and stabilization stages  most previous numerical modeling studies of this problem focused on vertical wells, whereas numerical simulation of breakouts for deviated wells is rare  in this paper, fully coupled hydro-mechanical models are developed using the finite element method for predicting borehole breakouts in both vertical and deviated wells  effects of well inclination and fluid seepage from wellbore to formation during overbalance drilling are investigated  the simulation results show that the breakout direction of a deviated wellbore is not necessarily parallel to the direction of the minimum principal stress as compared to that of a vertical wellbore  after an exposure time with overbalanced drilling mud pressure, the wellbore can have a final breakout shape that is much larger than the initial one due to seepage induced stress changes around the wellbore  the proposed models provide a useful tool for understanding and predicting time-dependent wellbore breakouts for drilling practices   1  introduction  borehole breakouts are one of the major wellbore instability problems in both vertical and deviated wells  field observations have shown that breakout is a phenomenon where falling rock spalls from the wellbore wall (bell and gough, 1979; gough and bell, 1982; peska and zoback, 1995; zoback et al , 1985)  specifically, borehole breakouts are time-dependent failure processes, which consist of three stages: initiation, propagation, and stabilization (cheatham, 1993; moore et al , 2011; olcott et al , 2013; zheng et al , 1989)  the breakout initiation is caused by stress concentrations around wellbores  the breakout propagation and stabilization are caused by fluid flow in near-wellbore formations (cheatham, 1993)  borehole breakouts are normally time-consuming and expensive to fix in drilling operations  therefore, there is a need to develop a comprehensive hydro-mechanical model for accurate prediction of time-dependent wellbore breakouts | 
2017-0829 	 3d distribution of p-wave velocity and attenuation in antigorite serpentinite |abstract: seismic velocity and attenuation anisotropy is an important property of many crustal and mantle rocks  the velocity anisotropy characterizes a directionally dependent propagation velocity of seismic waves, whereas attenuation anisotropy controls directionally dependent dissipation of seismic energy  we present a detailed study on the pressure dependence of p-wave velocities and amplitudes on a spherical sample of antigorite serpentinite from val malenco, northern italy  measurements were done at room temperature and hydrostatic pressures up to 400 mpa in a pressure vessel with oil as a pressure medium  the transducer/sample assembly allows simultaneous velocity and amplitude measurements on the spherical sample in 132 independent directions  three significant directions of the foliated sample were selected to study changes of the directional dependence (anisotropy) of velocity, amplitude and q-factor with increasing pressure  remarkable differences are observed in the changes of velocity and attenuation anisotropy as pressure is increased  |1  introduction |seismic velocity and attenuation anisotropy is an important property of many crustal and mantle rocks  the velocity anisotropy characterizes a directionally dependent propagation velocity of seismic waves, whereas attenuation anisotropy controls directionally dependent dissipation of seismic energy  the role of velocity and attenuation anisotropy in understanding the evolution of the earth crust and upper mantle is becoming increasingly important, because the measured anisotropy has a structural origin  major constituents of the upper and lower crust are felsic and mafic gneisses  seismic anisotropy observed in upper mantle rocks (peridotite, pyroxenite) is mainly due to crystallographic preferred orientation (cpo) of olivine and pyroxene, respectively (e g  babuska, 1984)  whereas the cpo-based calculated velocities and anisotropy describe the intrinsic (matrix) properties of a rock, the experimental velocity data describe the seismic properties of the real rock, controlled by the rock matrix and the effect of microcracks and grain boundaries  these extrinsic effects are strongly affected by pressure and temperature  in the last years, the minerals of the serpentine group (chrysotile, lizardite and antigorite) have received increasing interest because they play an important role in the dynamics of subduction zones (see morales et al , submitted and references therein)  the different types of serpentine are a result of mantle wedge hydration and represent different levels in subductions zones, according to their different stability at p and t conditions (e g  ulmer and trommsdorff, 1995; hacker et al , 2003a, 2003b)  antigorite is stable up to pressures of 5 gpa and temperatures around 600°c (ulmer and trommsdorff, 1995) and antigorite-rich serpentinites are characterized by a strong cpo of antigorite (e g  ji et al , 2013; shao et al , 2014, kern et al , 2015)  compared to the numerous papers referring to modeled (e g  jung, 2011; watanabe et al , 2014) and measured seismic properties (vp, vs) of antigorite serpentinites (ji et al , 2013; shao et al , 2014, kern et al , 1997), the papers reporting experimental measurements of velocity anisotropy and its pressure dependence are very rare  as regards attenuation of rocks, the papers reporting measurements of attenuation anisotropy and its pressure dependence are quite exceptional  measuring and determining anisotropic attenuation and its parameters is complicated from the technical as well as theoretical points of view  klima et al , 1962 investigated the pressure dependence of the attenuation of the p-waves in diabase and greywacke  to our knowledge the only measurements of wave attenuation of antigorite serpentinite are reported by kern et al  (1997)  they measured the p- and s-wave velocities and their attenuation on a sample cube in three fabric-related orthogonal directions at pressures up to 600 mpa and temperatures to 700°c  this paper presents a unique laboratory study of joint measurements of velocity and attenuation anisotropy of antigorite serpentinite in 3d coverage together with their pressure dependency up to 400 mpa  since ray velocity and ray attenuation are measured in the experiment, the ray quantities are recalculated to the phase quantities, and then inverted for parameters of general triclinic velocity and attenuation anisotropy  the variations of the pressure-induced velocity and attenuation anisotropy are analyzed in detail in the symmetry directions of velocity and amplitude extremes which relate to the mineral fabric (foliation, lineation) and of microcrack fabric (microcrack alignment) | 
2017-0830 	 the effect of saturating fluids on tensile and compressive strength of quarzitic sandstones |abstract: we report on a series of compression and tension tests in berea, bandera, lyons, and tennessee sandstones to investigate the effect of saturating fluids on rock strength  we tested three different samples of each sandstone under dry and liquid (brine, and dodecane) saturated conditions using a multistage triaxial test (pagoulatos, 2004)  in this multistage technique, we define a crack propagation threshold based on the net volumetric strain at the onset of dilatancy as termination criterion between axial loading stages  each of the multistage experiments allowed us to define a linear failure envelope using a single sample  we measured the tensile strength using a separate suite of samples for brazilian tensile testing  our findings suggest a reduction of compressive and tensile rock strength by up to 40% and 45%, respectively in fluid saturated rocks; the magnitude of this strength reduction is fluid type and lithology dependent, greatest reduction happened in more porous rocks while saturated with brine   1  introduction  this experimental study provides insight of the dependence of rock strength on saturating fluids  fluid saturated rocks are generally weaker than dry rocks, although the magnitude of this difference is lithology and fluid dependent  more often than not, mechanical tests under liquid saturated conditions are rare, and strength measurements in dry samples are typically extrapolated to strength at in-situ reservoir saturations   the compressive strength of rocks depends on confining pressure  however, the vast majority of compressive strength measurements reported in the literature come from unconfined tests  multiple conventional triaxial tests, in as many samples, are necessary to define a failure envelope that describes the dependence of compressive strength on confining pressure  this study uses a multistage triaxial following the protocol presented by pagoulatos (2004)  the multistage test eliminates sample variability and overcomes the limited availability constraint of the conventional triaxial tests   another usual practice is to use the unconfined compressive strength measurements to calculate the tensile strength of rocks as typical rule of thumb, assuming that the tensile strength is 10% of the uniaxial compressive strength  direct tensile strength measurements are far more unusual than confined compressive strength measurements; either because of sample availability constrains or because of the difficulties associated carrying out the tests (nova and zaninetti, 1990; barla and goffi, 1994)  this study uses the brazilian test introduced by carneiro (1943) as an indirect testing technique to overcome the limitations associated to the direct tensile strength measurements | 
2017-0834 	 modified brazilian test for indirect measurement of tensile strength of brittle materials |abstract: the applicability of a new test method involving semi-circular (truncated) brazilian disc specimens is examined in this study to effectively eliminate the unwanted high shear stresses at the loading points, as well as the multiple cracking that commonly occurs in the testing of standard brazilian dicks comprising hard and brittle materials  a series of tests with a wide range of hard and brittle materials, including various types of rocks and ceramics, was carried out  in all tests performed, a single straight plane of fracture was observed  through finite element numerical modelling and high-speed photography of the fracture process, the rupture mechanism was further confirmed to be the result of an indirect tensile stress induced inside the specimens  based on the results, it is concluded that truncated brazilian specimens can conveniently be adopted to determine the tensile strength of a target material, rather than the standard disc profiles in which catastrophic local cracking makes the procedure unreliable   1  introduction  the brazilian (splitting) test has been studied extensively in the literature since it was first introduced in the early 1940s  it is now a popular and preferred indirect method to measure the tensile strength of rock, pavement, concrete, and similar building materials  the test simply involves splitting a thin solid disc loaded by a compressive line load to generate a compression-induced tensile stress inside the disc until it fails across its loaded diameter into almost two equal hemi-cylinders (isrm, 1978; astm, 2016)  however, despite the test being widely accepted in geomechanics, test results with rock-like geo and construction materials having a large brittleness index (i e  a high ratio of compressive to tensile strength, as in hard rocks, ceramic, alloys, and diamond composites) have been extensively criticised and proved not to be generally reliable (fairhurst,1964; hudson et al , 1972; cranmer and richerson, 1988; yu et al , 2009; swab et al , 2011; serati, 2014)  the main reason for the lack of reliability in testing such materials is the concentration of unwanted cracks developed in the vicinity of the contacts, which adversely interfere with the tensile breakage of disc specimens through the formation of triple-cleft fractures, inverse conical shear plugs, and multiple cracking (ovri and davies, 1987; fahad, 1996; serati et al , 2015)  therefore, the flexural tensile strength measured at the centre of a brazilian disc often tends to overestimate the actual tensile strength in such hard and brittle engineering or natural materials  nevertheless, this failure to achieve the standard breakage in the brazilian test has been ignored in most cases since the reasons responsible for such catastrophic crushing are not yet fully understood | 
2017-0836 	 evaluating natural fracture growth in shale caprocks during cold co2 injection at the heletz pilot site |abstract: the potential growth of multiple fractures is investigated during the deformation of the caprock of a reservoir during the subsurface sequestration of co2  multiple scenarios of the interaction of pre-existing natural fractures are investigated, as a function of induced stress changes due to the temperature contrast between the injected co2 and the reservoir  simulations are performed at the field scale, on a simplified geologically-informed model of the heletz pilot test site, israel, in the framework of the eu-sponsored trust project  the potential reactivation and growth of pre-existing natural fractures is investigated  during cold injection, changes in the strain field around the well are tracked  the progression of the temperature plume is observed to cause a local release of stresses that in turn causes short propagation episodes, which mostly focus on downward growth  although some upwards growth is modeled, growth is expected to prominently occur towards the reservoir   1  introduction  co2 sequestration aims to stabilize atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and mitigate anthropogenic climate change (ipcc, 2005)  one of its major risks at the industrial scale, is reservoir caprock failing to contain co2  considering that injected subcritical co2 is buoyant in brine, containment relies on the caprock continuity and integrity (bachu, 2008)  identifying operational parameters for co2 sequestration, e g  injection pressure and temperature, which can alter the stress state of the caprock and create leakage pathways, is key to achieving an efficient and secure long-term storage (oldenburg, 2007)   the coupling of thermo-hydro-mechanical processes is approached by numerical simulators using different techniques that allow to combine the solution of flow and deformation equations either iterative or simultaneously, by using either a single or multiple numerical methods  in iterative coupling geomechanical and flow modules exchange information after each iteration, and so, change in porosity due to geomechanics is added to the flow module as a boundary or initial condition (settari and walters, 1999)  this method often requires two different grids to be used in the mechanics and flow modules, which may introduce errors in the pressure and strains (goumiri and prevost, 2010)  the second approach, is fully coupled, where on the basis of poroelasticity, differential equations for mechanics and fluids are solved simultaneously (zimmerman, 2000)  a more detailed representation of the physical problem, is offered by fully coupled thm models with the incorporation of two-phase change phenomena for co2, i e  gas and vapor, achieved by solving explicitly their mass conservation equations (tong et al , 2010)  the two different coupling approaches produce different results in the case of co2 sequestration modelling (preisig and prevost, 2011); especially when analyzing temperature contrast between caprock and reservoir these can be significant  modeling thermo-hydro-mechanical effects with the highest level of accuracy is crucial as to capture changes in the stress field of the caprock that can eventually cause failure of the seal | 
2017-0838 	 elasticity of clay shale characterized by nanoindentation |abstract: shales are mainly composed of clay minerals and other secondary minerals (e g , quartz and pyrite), as well as organic matter (e g , gas and kerogen)  microscopic observations show that non-layered, relatively coarser and hard silicate minerals are embedded within a mixed clay and organic matrix  different from the relatively coarser silicate minerals, the tiny sizes of clay particles make the selection of indentation depth important in determining the elasticity of the clay matrix (that may include the organic in the pores)  in this study, the young’s moduli of core fragments of shales obtained from a borehole of shale formation located in sichuan, china were probed by the continuous stiffness measurement (csm) method of nanoindentation using a massive indentation scheme  the young’s modulus of each indent was obtained as a continuous function of indentation depth  statistical deconvolutions were respectively conducted based on the data obtained at different depths of each individual indent  the results show the young’s moduli of diverse phases and show further that the elasticity of each phase exhibits depth-dependent behavior  this study provides a reliable guidance for selecting the appropriate indentation depth to characterize the elasticity of shale as well as the moduli of each individual phases   1  introduction  shale, a type of fine-grained sedimentary rock, is mainly composed of clay minerals and other secondary minerals (e g , quartz and pyrite), as well as organic matter that exists primarily in the voids within the clay matrix  young’s modulus of shale is one of the most important parameters for geophysical subsurface exploration in the oil industry, and the conventional method for the determination of elastic modulus requires the industry to carry out static or dynamic experiments on core samples  in the past two decades, nanoindentation has been widely used to probe the small-scale mechanical properties (e g , young’s modulus and hardness) of different materials (hou et al , 2016; li and bhushan, 2002; liu, 2015; oliver and pharr, 2004; saha and nix, 2002; song et al , 2017; zhang et al , 2009), which also shows its applicability to the testing of shales  to determine young’s modulus of shales, nanoindentation testing can be performed on small pieces of shales making it much less expensive when compared with the conventional methods  furthermore, since nanoindentation testing is often considered to be non-destructive, it allows more than one test to be performed on each specimen and helps minimize the potential of random errors | 
2017-0843 	 size dependency of intact rocks with high brittleness: a potential solution to eliminate secondary fractures in brazilian test |abstract: the brazilian test is one of the most established techniques used for indirect measurement of rock tensile strength  when the test is applied to soft to medium strength rocks, the rupture mechanism is always through the formation of a single diametrical crack initiated at the centre of the disc, where the induced tensile stress is the maximum  however, when applied to disc specimens of harder, stiffer and brittle rocks, secondary shear fractures often interfere adversely with the diametrical (characteristic) tensile crack in the brazilian test  to prevent such undesirable shear cracking, a series of brazilian tests on specimens of different sizes was carried out with four different brittle rocks, including granite, basalt and two types of monzonite  from the results, it is concluded that the problem associated with the undesirable shear failure developed in the vicinity of the contact points can be effectively eliminated through a change in the size of the disc in the brazilian test   1  introduction  the split cylinder test, also known as the brazilian test, is the preferred laboratory technique for measuring the tensile strength of a wide range of rock-like materials  the test simply involves compressing a thin solid disc through the application of two diametrally opposite point (line) loads until the disc fails along its loaded diameter into two roughly equal halves (isrm, 1978; astm, 2016)  however, despite its ease of use and continued popularity, the validity of the test for materials having a high ratio of compressive to tensile strength, e g  as in hard rocks, has been questioned in the literature by many researchers (fairhurst,1964; hudson et al , 1972; cranmer and richerson, 1988; swab et al , 2011)  the main concern is the type of failure reported for such materials, due to the typical formation of multiple cracks and shear ruptures in the vicinity of the contact points, rather than a single crack at the disc’s centre (ovri and davies, 1987; serati et al , 2015)  obtaining a measure of the tensile strength where there is not a single central splitting crack is generally believed to be erroneous, unreliable and misleading  as partial solutions to this dillema, the brazilian test has been continuously modified over the years, and new testing techniques have been proposed  these include development of the ring test (ripperger and davids, 1947) and the flattened brazilian disc test (wang et al , 2003), as well as introducing loading arc platens for strip (distributed) loading of the brazilian disc (erarslan and williams, 2012)  all these tests have been shown to be able to successfully eliminate the shear fracturing and crack branching in the brazilian test, but each also has its own limitations  for instance, the available closed-form solutions for the ring test are often limited to simplified stress assumptions at the boundaries that may not properly represent the true contact conditions (serati and williams, 2015)  the flattened brazilian disc requires additional machining to prepare the flat ends, and the results are highly affected by the flatness and parallelness of the flat ends prepared | 
2017-0845 	 modifications for the smooth joint contact model in the particle flow code |abstract: this paper deals with the following two shortcomings of the smooth joint contact model (sjcm) used in the particle flow code (pfc): (a) use of a constant value for joint normal stiffness instead of allowing actual non-linear behavior between the joint normal deformation and joint normal stress; (b) the so called “interlocking problem”  the first one is solved by imposing a linear relation between the joint normal stiffness and the normal contact stress in a new modified smooth-joint contact model (msjcm)  a good agreement obtained between the results from the experimental tests and the numerical modeling of the compression joint normal test, shows the accuracy of this new model  the second shortcoming occurs due to a lack of an updating procedure in the pfc software related to the contact conditions of the particles that lie around the intended joint plane during high shear displacements  this problem increases the shear strength of the joint when the shear displacement of the joint exceeds a specific value and creates unwanted fractures around the intended joint plane  to solve this problem a new approach termed joint side checking (jsc) is proposed  numerical modeling of the direct shear test shows jsc can solve the interlocking problem and proves to be more consistent with the theory compared to the regular approach   1  introduction  nowadays, through the development of commercially available distinct element method (dem) software packages on one hand and accessibility to extremely fast computers on the other hand, dem has become popular in geomechanics (cundall, 1971 & 1980; cundall strack, 1979; cundall 1988; itasca, 2016; kulatilake et al , 1993; wu and kulatilake 2012; kulatilake and biao, 2015; shreedharan and kulatilake 2016)  dem is a discontinuum mechanics based method in which material is modeled by rigid or deformable blocks/particles, and newton’s second law acts between blocks/particles  the particle flow code (pfc) as a dem software package uses rigid disks and spherical elements to represent particles in 2d and 3d, respectively  since pfc can properly model the fracture initiation and propagation between particles by bonded-particle models (bpms) as well as sliding along joints by smooth-joint contact model (sjcm), it is a powerful technique to model jointed rock masses (potyondy and cundall, 2004; mas ivars, 2011; potyondy, 2015) | 
2017-0854 	 from lab to field: rock mechanics properties assessment for a 3d mem |abstract: in petroleum, civil and mining engineering, designing structures dealing with rock mass is a day-to-day activity  in order to carry on such projects, it is essential to know the strength and deformability of rocks, as well as their in situ stress state  in petroleum engineering, especially, obtaining rock samples from a well and carrying out lab mechanical tests is costly and time consuming  thus, petroleum engineers have been attempting to determine rock mechanical properties through index tests or log-based correlations as to expedite this process and reduce the global cost of the activity  besides a comprehensive literature review regarding empirical correlations for predicting rock mechanical properties, this article presents results of uniaxial and scratch tests on a highly heterogeneous limestone sample from offshore wells in brazil  by comparing ucs results of uniaxial and scratch tests, it was possible to validate the outcomes of the scratch tests  ucs scratch test profile presents a high resolution, in the present work this profile was averaged over intervals around each plug of conventional core analysis  finally, ucs and young modulus empirical correlations for limestones are proposed  using those correlation one can estimate ucs and static young modulus of limestones from their porosities and speed up the mem assemblage   1  introduction  the assemblage of a mechanical earth model (mem) encompasses data gathering and analysis of information regarding in situ stress state, rock properties and underground geometry  an mem can be seen as a bridge over the gap between earth science and engineering disciplines  the assemblage of an mem is, intrinsically, a multidisciplinary task and a team with geologist, geophysicists and engineers must be formed in order to create such models   a wide range of structural analysis during drilling, completion and production phases can be performed after the mem assemblage  in reality, an mem should be used even after the field abandonment, in order to ensure zonal isolation beyond the production lifetime of a reservoir  depending on local rules, the wellbore seal must last many years beyond the well’s production lifespan  by performing a post-mortem structural analysis of a reservoir, wellbore failure can be predicted and mitigated, avoiding environmental and safety problems | 
2017-0855 	 characterization of naturally fractured reservoirs using drilling mud loss data: the effect of fluid leak-off |abstract: a novel theoretical model is introduced to characterize the invasion of bingham plastic drilling fluid into natural fractures  the effect of fluid leak-off into the formation matrix is incorporated using carter’s model  various injection profiles from wellbore to natural fracture are accounted for by modeling both radial and linear flow for fluid invasion within the fractures  a finite difference scheme is employed to predict the invasion of the drilling fluid into the fracture  the results of the numerical solution were validated using well-known analytical solution for the mud invasion problem  several parametric studies were conducted to demonstrate the effect of fluid leak-off and fracture width on the fluid invasion depth and mud loss volume for both radial and linear flow cases  the obtained results indicate that the fluid leak-off reduces the rate of fluid invasion within the fracture  however, it does not affect the maximum depth of the fluid invasion over long time periods  it is shown that the mud loss volume may be significantly varied using different flow types (radial or linear) and leak-off coefficients  the results of the theoretical model are also compared - and found to be in excellent agreement - with the field data of a drilling mud loss incident  it is shown that consideration of fluid leak-off effect can significantly improve the accuracy of the mud loss prediction, and thereby results in a more realistic characterization of naturally fractured reservoirs   1  introduction  accurate characterization of natural fractures is of crucial importance for well construction and reservoir stimulation  a reliable estimate of the natural fracture size is essential for the design of remedial mud loss treatments (razavi et al , 2015, 2016, and 2017)  also, the knowledge of pre-existing natural fracture properties can significantly improve the application of hydraulic fracturing treatments and enhance the overall productivity of the reservoir (olson et al , 2009, bahorich et al , 2012, lee et al , 2015 and 2016) | 
2017-0857 	 experimental study of hydromechanical behavior of fracture of vaca muerta gas shale |abstract: total e&p has developed an experimental set-up allowing creation shear fracture within a cylinder sample in a conventional triaxial cell thanks to two specific heels placed on the top and bottom of the sample  permeability tests to gas and to water, as well as measurements of normal and shear displacements can be carried out using existing facilities of a triaxial cell  in the post-failure phase of shear fracturing, dilatancy angle of a fresh fracture measured on a vaca muerta shale is about 24° to 38° under 30 bars of confining pressure  mechanical opening (normal displacement) induced by fracturing is about 400 <u+03bc>m  hydraulic opening to water or to gas decreases significantly when confining pressure increased from 10 bars to 120 bars  alteration of a fresh shale fracture surface by water is characterized by the change of the hydraulic opening to gas  after presentation of the experiment set-up, the main results obtained on the mechanical behavior of the fracture and the hydraulic behavior of fracture to water and to gas flow under various stress and injection conditions are presented and discussed   1  introduction  the vaca muerta formation of neuquen basin, argentina, is considered the most interesting hydrocarbon shale play in the world, and is currently the subject of intense exploration and research works and the first unconventional development projects in this country (su k  et al 2014, varela et al 2014)  the mineralogical of the vaca muerta formation is reported by askenazi et al (2013) to consist of a important, but highly variable portion of carbonate and quartz, ranging both from 10 to 80%, and consistently low clay content within the 5 to 35% range  in the area investigated by total e&p, the average total organic carbon content (toc) is ~4 0% in the upper part and around 6 0% in the lower part  the in situ pore pressure of the vaca muerta ranges from 1 7 to 2 1 sg | 
2017-0858 	 the effects of flame-heating on rock strength: towards a new drilling technology |abstract: the applicability of a combined thermo-mechanical drilling technique is investigated  the working principle of this method is based on the implementation of a heat source as a mean to either provoke thermal spallation on the surface or to weaken the rock material, when spallation is not possible  thermal spallation drilling has already been proven to work in hard crystalline rocks, however, several difficulties hamper its application for deep resource exploitation  in order to prove the effectiveness of a combined thermo-mechanical drilling method, the forces required to export the treated sandstone material with a polycrystalline diamond compact (pdc) cutter are analyzed  the main differences between oven and flame treatments are studied by comparing the resulting strength after heat-treating the samples up to temperatures of 650°c and for heating rates ranging from 0 17 °c/s to 20 °c/s  for moderate temperatures (300-450°c) the unconfined compressive strength after flame treatments monotonously decreased, opposed to the hardening behavior observed after oven treatments  thermally induced intra-granular cracking and oxidation patterns served as an estimation of the treated depth due to the flame heat treatment  therefore, conclusions on preferred operating conditions of the drilling system are drawn based on the experimental results   1  introduction  the exploitation of hydrocarbons and deep geothermal resources relies on finding cost-effective solutions to increase the drilling performance in hard crystalline rocks (gill, 1983, bejerano et al , 2006)  conventional rotary drilling techniques, based on mechanical rock abrasion and exportation, result in high rates of drilling tool wearing, causing significant costs (fay, 1993, pessier et al , 1992)  additionally, rotary drilling is characterized by low drilling speeds in hard crystalline basement rocks targeted for enhanced geothermal energy utilization  further, even lower overall drilling rates result when considering tripping times required to exchange worn drill tools  therefore, alternative drilling methods, such as hammering (han et al , 2005, teodoriu, 2011), thermal spallation (rudolf von rohr, 2015), electro-pulse (anders et al , 2015), plasma drilling (timoshkin et al , 2003, kocis et al , 2015), and hydraulic jetting processes (pekarek et al , 1963) are investigated worldwide in order to enhance the drilling capabilities for exploration of deep geological resources | 
2017-0863 	 two methods for development of rock shear strength parameters for risk-informed evaluation of concrete gravity dams founded on clean discontinuous rock |abstract: implementation of dam safety portfolio risk management requires risk assessments on all projects operated by the us army corps of engineers (usace), including those previously reanalyzed and modified, to ensure modifications adequately reduce risk within usace tolerable risk guidelines  examples of such projects include delaware dam, modified in 1993 for a stability deficiency, and bluestone dam, which is currently being modified for stability and hydrologic deficiencies  the risk assessment requires selection of upper and lower bounds and expected values of bedrock shear strength parameters representative of all potential sliding failure planes  because of improvements in laboratory testing equipment and changes in analysis methodology over the past approximately thirty years, older data from direct shear testing of intact rock specimens used for analysis with the shear friction method was discarded and new testing programs were conducted to estimate shear strength parameters for analysis by limit equilibrium method  the shear strength parameters assigned to the structural wedge at both projects are represented by the sliding strength of a clean discontinuity  the basic phi angle can be obtained from testing data, but selection of an appropriate inclination angle (i-angle) is generally difficult  for bluestone, site-specific first order i-angle measurements were made from excavations of foundation rock downstream of the dam toe  selection of the first order i-angle for delaware proved more challenging because site-specific first order i-angle measurements were not available  instead, optical televiewer logs and data from direct shear tests of natural fractures were used to inform the selection  this paper explains the rationale used in selecting upper and lower bounds and expected shear strength parameters for the structural wedge of these two dams, and contrasts the methodology variations employed due to differing levels of available site data   1  changes in state of practice  in 2005, the u s  army corps of engineers moved from a primarily standards-based approach for its dam safety program (dam safety assurance program, or dsa) to dam safety portfolio risk management  implementation required risk assessments to be performed on all corps dams, including those which had been previously evaluated under the dsa program with completed modifications such as delaware dam and projects that were undergoing modification like bluestone dam, to ensure that breach risk was reduced within usace’s tolerable risk guidelines  the risk assessment requires (among other parameters) upper and lower bounds of shear strength parameters as well as expected values that are representative of all identified potential failure planes | 
2017-0866 	 robust estimates of rock strength parameters via improved analysis of rock strength data |abstract: this paper investigates the effect that small sample sizes have on uncertainties associated with intact rock strength parameter estimations, using various combinations of strength data (namely, uniaxial and triaxial compressive, uniaxial compressive and indirect tensile, and uniaxial and triaxial compressive together with indirect tensile)  the analysis applies recently developed bayesian nonlinear regression models to small sample sizes (n = 9, 12 and 15) drawn from an extensive published data set to obtain hoek-brown strength parameters  the results show how the uncertainty in parameter estimations, particularly the correlation between estimated m and <u+03c3>c are affected by the data combination  the paper further discusses how using a combination of three data types could result in significant reduction of uncertainties associated with strength parameter estimations, and concludes with suggestions for allocation of resources to different types of laboratory testing   1  introduction  the introduction of geotechnical limit states design (lsd) standards such as the canadian highway bridge design code (chbdc) (csa, 2006) and en-1997 (cen, 2004) requires the basic philosophy of rock engineering design to change from that of traditional safety factors to the more rational reliability-based design (rbd) (e g  lemaire, 2006)  a key element of rbd is robust statistical characterization of design parameters (e g  macgregor, 1976; cen, 2002; gulvanessian et al, 2002, lemaire, 2006)   in rock engineering, strength of intact rock is a fundamental design parameter, and is often presented in terms of the well-known empirical hb criterion  however, for the most part, the uncertainties associated with both the fitted criterion and strength predictions based on it have historically been ignored  one aspect of fitting the hb criterion to strength data that has received much attention is that of combining compressive and tensile strength data (e g  zuo et al , 2008; sari, 2010; cai, 2010; read and richards, 2011; sari, 2012; langford and diederichs 2015)  one recent report exists that addresses both of these issues (langford & diederichs 2015) | 
2017-0867 	 visualizing well system breakdown: experimental and numerical analyses |abstract: leaky wells are expensive to plug, provide a potential pathway for subsurface fluid migration, and are difficult to study in the field  because of the inherent cost and risk associated with researching well integrity at the field-scale, a novel approach is being developed to increase our understanding of cement failure within the well system  this paper presents the approach, which combines a scaled experimental technique with an analytic model to rapidly and repeatedly simulate conditions that lead to failure in the well system  the experimental approach consists of a loading apparatus that can apply confining loads and internal “casing” pressures independently to a scaled-down (< 50 mm) model of a complete well system  the apparatus is contained in an industrial x-ray ct scanner, which is capable of collecting 3d scans while loads are applied to the scaled well system  the ability to collect 2d radiographs, pressure data, and ct scans on the model well system during loading provides a unique and valuable means of performing destructive testing with non-invasive, in-situ imaging  for this study, the internal casing pressure was increased by 3 45 mpa (500 psi) increments until failure was observed in the form of radial cracks within the cement   1  introduction  preventing the vertical flow of formation fluids is necessary for maintaining an efficient, cost-effective well operation free of negative environmental impacts  primary well cementing—the act of filling the annulus between the casing and the formation with cement—is done with the aim of providing long-term, durable zonal isolation  the shift toward focusing on the cement annulus as a potential leakage pathway was relatively recent considering the age of the oil and gas industry  for decades after the first well was cemented, the sole strength parameter considered was the uniaxial compressive strength (ucs) of the set cement (ravi et al , 2002)  ucs was a primary design parameter because of its relation to many strength criterion, but also because it, along with cement setting time, are important factors for scheduling drilling | 
2017-0868 	 gas permeability of granular salt during consolidation |abstract: gas permeability measurements have been made on granular samples during consolidation under hydrostatic stresses up to 40 mpa and temperatures up to 250 °c  the initial porosity of the samples prior to consolidation was as great as 0 40; depending on the test conditions and duration, the resulting final porosity was between 0 08 and less than 0 01  although these tests were conducted at different temperatures, pressures, durations and salt types, a similar reduction in permeability was observed  the permeability steadily decreased from the initial relatively large value around 10<u+2212>14 m2 until after some critical porosity is reached (between 0 02 to 0 05); below the critical porosity, the permeability decreased at an increased rate  this response is attributed to loss of pore connectivity within the consolidating salt sample  the data suggest a very low porosity will have to be reached before the permeability of consolidating granular salt will be comparable to intact salt for conditions considered here   1  introduction  granular (or crushed) salt is being considered as a seal material for shafts, drifts, and boreholes associated with mined nuclear waste repositories in salt  the eventual consolidation of granular salt in a repository to a condition comparable to intact salt would encase stored waste in an impermeable material and effectively erase penetrations through the salt formation  in this way, long-term isolation would rely only upon the characteristics of a massive salt deposit rather than maintaining an effective seal between dissimilar materials for thousands of years  because the premise of using granular salt is that it will eventually achieve a permeability equivalent to intact salt, it is critical to understand how its permeability will change during consolidation   permeability measurements have been made on granular salt by numerous researchers, including case et al  (1987), holcomb and shields (1987), brodsky (1994), cinar et al  (1996), spangenberg et al  (1998), bechtold et al  (2004), salzer et al  (2007), and stuhrenberg and schulze (2012)  the measurements have been made on samples with wide range of grain size distributions that have been consolidated under a variety of stress states and moisture conditions to varying porosities  permeability measurements have principally been determined with the use of gas, but some measurements have been made with nonreactive liquids in addition to brine | 
2017-0873 	 effect of injection rate on hydraulic fracturing of opalinus clay shale |abstract: for hydraulic fracturing operations in the field, the pumping rate is generally controlled but it is not fully understood how this affects the resulting fracture processes  this paper presents the results of an experimental study using a laboratory hydraulic fracturing setup, in which the injection rate was varied across four experiments, and the fracturing process was observed visually as well as with acoustic emission sensors  prismatic 2 <u+00d7> 4 <u+00d7> 1 in  specimens of opalinus clay shale, with a pre-cut 0 33 in  width flaw, were subjected to hydraulic pressure under constant biaxial far-field loading conditions  the pressure was measured internally inside the flaw as well as at the pressure volume actuator  both a high speed- and a high resolution camera were used to visually record changes on the face of the specimen (i e  fracturing)  acoustic emissions were recorded with an array of eight piezoceramic sensors embedded in specialized platens  the results of the experiments were then used in an analysis of the peak pressures and fracture propagation speed related to the injection rate  higher peak pressures, fracturing speeds and fracturing accelerations were observed with higher injection rates  additionally, the spectral analysis of the largest ae events showed that the highest injection rates resulted in higher power at lower frequencies  the highest injection rate was also associated with greater ae activity in general   1  introduction and background  for hydraulic fracturing operations in the field, the pumping rate is generally controlled but it is not fully understood how this affects the resulting fracture processes  recently, there has been an increase in the number of experimental studies being conducted on hydraulic fracturing in the laboratory  experiments on natural rock typically use external displacement measurements, acoustic emission observation and post-failure inspection often combined with resin to capture the fracturing behavior during hydraulic fracture (casas et al , 2006; lecampion et al , 2015; stanchitis et al , 2015a; stanchitis et al , 2015b)  other researchers have used transparent model material, such as pmma, to visualize the fractures (rubin, 1984; bunger et al , 2005; lecampion et al , 2015)  visualizing the fractures in a natural rock, in real-time while applying confining pressures, has been difficult to achieve in the laboratory | 
2017-0876 	 influence of pore pressure on the reconsolidation of crushed salt under hydrostatic creep conditions |abstract: results from three compressive creep tests on dried crushed salt, focused on identifying the influence of pore pressure during reconsolidation, are presented  all tests were completed under a macroscopic hydrostatic confining pressure of 30 mpa while the internal pore pressure varied from zero to 20 mpa across the tests  all tests were held under constant creep conditions for approximately 24 hours at an elevated temperature of 170°c, and isotropic volumetric plastic deformations were observed as the sample porosities decreased by over 3%  plastic volumetric strain rates during the creep tests varied from 3 • 10–5 down to 4 • 10– 8sec –1, and the combined results from these tests indicate the volumetric deformations of a crushed-salt sample under creep conditions is influenced by the application of pore pressure within a bulk sample   1  introduction  deformation of crushed salt is of interest to both the mining and waste repository industries because crushed salt could economically be used as a backfill and sealing material in these environments  however, the design for backfilling a drift in a salt mine along with the sealing of a room or borehole of a waste repository all depend upon understanding crushed-salt's constitutive properties, i e , the relationship between stress and strain over a bulk volume of crushed salt  the constitutive response of crushed salt is nonlinear, as its response varies greatly with bulk porosity and is heavily influence by water content, particle size, and temperature  to date, numerous models have been developed in a continuing effort to accurately describe crushed salt's constitutive properties (butcher, 1980; sjaardema and krieg, 1987; holcomb and zeuch, 1990; zeuch, 1990; spiers and brzesowsky, 1993; callahan et al , 1998; olivella and gens, 2002; krohn et al , 2015)  these existing constitutive models have been developed based on a wide range of approaches that aim to reproduce the characteristics observed during laboratory experiments | 
2017-0877 	 evaluation of the influence of uncertainty between predicted and measured ground water and in-situ stress on the stability of a large open pit using a three dimensional distinct element method |abstract: this study focuses on the use of a predictive three dimensional distinct element numerical model to assess the potential for large-scale failure; mechanisms at a diamond mine in canada  the; upper portion of the kimberlite pipe has been exploited by traditional open pit mining method and currently mining continues underground beneath open pit with a vertical glory hole extending down to the active underground mining levels  underground mining adopts sub-level retreat (slr) methods  the objective of this study is to assess the stability of the open pit as underground mining progresses  the influence of uncertainties in two key input parameters, the in-situ stress field and groundwater pressures, was evaluated using a three dimensional distinct element method software 3dec  a hydrogeological model has been developed to evaluate groundwater pressures and flows at the mine site  in-situ stress testing has been carried out to confirm a historical in-situ stress field based on the understanding of the tectonic history and geological settings  sensitivity analyses have been carried out to determine the influence of these two key parameters on the stability of an identified critical wedge in the pit wall  the potential impact of groundwater depressurization on stability of the identified critical wedge is also evaluated  |1  introduction |in strong, brittle and massive rock, the failure mechanism is dominantly governed by the strength and orientation of geological structures  under these conditions, failure is generally initiated by sliding along structures that may subsequently be followed by rock bridge failure  |in this study, the stability of an open pit and vertical glory hole as sub level retreat mining progresses at a diamond mine in canada has been assessed using three dimensional distinct element method software 3dec [1]  the primary failure mechanism at the mine is structurally controlled block failure that results in a release and detachment of large blocks from the contact wall as persistent discontinuities are daylighted in the contact wall at depth  the result of this block failure is increasing dilution to the slr operation, as well as adversely impacting the overall stability of the remaining pit slopes | 
2017-0879 	 creep characterization of marcellus shale |abstract: for fundamental understanding of the roof fall, this research is focused on determining the time-delayed deformation  a series of triaxial single-stage creep tests was performed on marcellus shale  the specimens were cored parallel and perpendicular to the bedding plane  x-ray diffraction tests were performed to determine the mineralogical composition of shale  the tests showed that the specimens were rich in carbonate content with minor percentage of clay minerals  a suite of uniaxial and triaxial compressive tests was performed on both parallel and perpendicular that determined their strength in different confining conditions  finally, triaxial creep tests were performed to estimate the strength variation with orientation  results from x-ray diffraction (xrd), uniaxial and triaxial tested specimen showed the brittle behavior of shale  specimens cored parallel to the bedding plane was found to be stiffer than the perpendicular specimens at different confining stresses  higher confining stress led to the failure of specimens at higher angle of major shear failure plane to major principal stress  this was accompanied with lesser number of axial cracks and increase in the deformation of the specimen  value of creep strain rate was found to be in correlation with differential stress on horizontal and vertical specimens   1  introduction  the fundamental behavior of long-term strength deterioration in shale rock is not known  various rock engineering structures such as underground coalmines have operating life of 30 years or greater and the challenge to maintain a stable roof is prime concern of ground control researchers  mine health and safety administration’s (msha) reports show that roof fall and rib rolls are the leading fatality factors  operators have also left rider coal in the roof to prevent exposure of shale roof from humid mine environment  the approach has reduced the occurrence of roof failure however, long-term deformation of roof rock constituted with shale is still lacking  presence of moisture and its effect on strength degradation has not been investigated at pore scale | 
2017-0880 	 a coupled iterative hydromechanical analysis of a stress sensitive brazilian carbonate reservoir |abstract: the production of a petroleum reservoir is a coupled process between stress variation and fluid flow phenomena, which affects the reservoir and its surrounding rocks  this study aims to assess production and geomechanical aspects of an oil field located in campos basin - brazil, called field b, by different hydromechanical coupling schemes  in this work, one-way and two-way coupled hydromechanical simulations were carried out by using a methodology developed by the research group gtep/puc-rio, which enables to run coupled hydromechanical simulations between a commercial black-oil simulator and an inhouse, stress analysis software (chronos)  two sets of coupling parameters were used to introduce the geomechanical effects in the reservoir simulation on the two-way coupling  the first set is constituted by porous compressibility and porosity  furthermore, the second was constituted by porous compressibility, porosity and absolute permeability  then, flow and geomechanical results were compared  in this particular scenario, the results of the two-way simulation that used the first set of coupling parameters were similar to the one-way coupling  on other hand, diverged significantly from the second, mainly by the predicted oil production rate  therefore, in this case, neglecting permeability reduction due to depletion can lead to significant errors   1  introduction  the production of a hydrocarbon reservoir changes the original in-situ stress condition of a petroleum field, which affects the reservoir and its surrounding rocks equilibrium  as a response to that, there are deformations that change the porosity and absolute permeability of the reservoir  the pore pressure and the production are influenced by these changes  therefore, the development of a reservoir is a coupled process between flow and geomechanics, that is, a hydromechanical coupling phenomenon (wang, 2000)   some reservoirs are more sensitive to this coupling process because there are rocks very deformable due to stress variations caused by pore pressure changes  these deformations have a high impact on its porosity and especially on its permeability | 
2017-0881 	 geomechanical effects of a highly permeable sand layer in a salt basin |abstract: we study the effects of a highly permeable sand layer on pore pressure and stresses near a salt diapir by using a forward hydro-mechanical finite-element model  we compare a salt basin entirely composed of mudrocks to the same basin but with a highly permeable sand layer across its bottom  we show that the sand layer causes a significant increase in pore pressure near the diapir by transmitting overpressure from deep sediments far from the diapir  this pressure increase makes it difficult to safely drill wellbores near the diapir  we examine the stress history of mudrocks at the crest of the sand layer and show that the pore pressure increase near diapir causes unloading of sediments, which is a crucial finding for seismic prediction of pore pressure in these sediments  overall, our results offer an insight into the effects of basin sand layers on pore pressure distribution, seismic pore pressure prediction, and wellbore design near salt diapirs   1  introduction  many hydrocarbon reservoirs are trapped against salt diapirs  the stability and safety of wellbores drilled to produce from these reservoirs are controlled by the pore pressure and stress state near diapirs  inverse, reverse, and forward modeling are approaches that are typically used to predict pore pressure and stresses  the first two methods predict pore pressure and stresses for the present geometry of the salt system  however, they are based on assumptions that may not be valid, particularly near salt diapirs and sand layers in the basin  forward modeling may not fully honor the present geometry of a system but, because it does not make assumptions, its predictions can be used to evaluate the assumptions made in the first two methods   seismic methods are well-known inverse methods for pore pressure prediction in basins  these methods predict the present magnitudes of pore pressure and stresses based on seismic velocity of sediments measured across the basin  the predictions of these methods, however, depend highly on the loading/unloading status of sediments, that is, whether the sediment present stresses are the maximum stresses ever experienced by the sediments  this status is particularly unclear for sediments at the crest of sand layers near a salt diapir  because the permeability of sand layers is orders of magnitude higher than the permeability of mudrocks, they behave as conduits and transmit significant overpressure generated in deep sediments far from the salt diapir to shallow sediments at the crest of the sand layer near the diapir  the transmitted overpressure can be high enough to cause unloading of the crest sediments  because seismic methods predict only the present pore pressure and stresses, they are unable to determine and hence assume this status  furthermore, seismic methods can predict pore pressure only in mudrocks; they are unable to predict pore pressure in embedded lithologies such as sandstone or carbonate layers  because of their significantly different permeability, considerably different pore pressures can develop in these layers and their adjacent mudrocks over the basin evolution (dickinson, 1953, traugott, 1997 and bowers, 2001)  seismic methods often assume that pore pressure in these lithologies equals pore pressure in adjacent mudrocks | 
2017-0882 	 wellbore stability analysis under drained conditions using anisotropic cam clay model |abstract: different from the prevalent methods that treat rock formation as isotropic elastic, poroelastic, and/or elastoplastic materials, this paper presents a set of semi-analytical solutions for the wellbore stability problem by adopting the widely used anisotropic critical state plasticity model originally proposed by dafalias, 1987  this model is capable of taking mechanical anisotropy into account and therefore the wellbore stability analysis presented in this paper is more realistic  by carefully choosing an independent auxiliary variable, the plastic zone solution is reduced to solving a system of seven partial differential equations with the three stress components, specific volume, and three anisotropic hardening parameters being the basic unknowns  parametric studies have been conducted to explore the influence of overconsolidation ratio and inherent anisotropy  the results show that both these two plasticity features exert pronounced effects on the response of the drilled wellbore  in addition, the feature of anisotropy has also been discussed  it is found that there is a distinct difference between the results with and without considering the anisotropy in the wellbore stability problem   1  introduction  wellbore stability has long been recognized as one of the main issues in petroleum engineering because of its great importance in successful production of oil and gas  currently, solution to this problem is sought mainly through numerical method (muller et al , 2009; veeken et al , 1989) instead of analytical approach, largely due to the great complexities involved in the derivation of closed-form solutions  this is particularly the case when complicated constitutive model is adopted to describe the stress-strain behaviour of rock formations during wellbore drilling   probably because of the complexities mentioned above, few studies have been conducted analytically to analyze wellbore drilling problem, and almost all the existing analytical solutions have generally been presented in an approximate manner  graziani and ribacchi (1993) proposed an analytical approach to determine the state of stress and strain for a circular opening excavated in a rock mass, where the rock is assumed to obey the nonassociated strain softening mohr-coulomb model with the softening behavior linked to a simple plastic shear strain through the so-called softening modulus parameter  charlez and roatesi (1999) derived an analytical solution for the wellbore stability problem under undrained condition using a simplistic cam clay model where the elliptical yield surface was replaced by two straight lines, and the solution is restricted to the volumetric strain hardening rocks with overconsolidation ratio less than two  it should be mentioned that in the recent work by chen and abousleiman (2016), a set of rigorous semi-analytical solutions were obtained for undrained and drained problems of cylindrical cavity contraction using bounding surface plasticity model, which made no approximations in the derivation of the closed-form solutions | 
2017-0884 	 consideration of stress shadows in stacked plays |abstract: stress shadows, the colloquial term used to describe the stress field change associated with hydraulic fractures, is a fundamental part of hydraulic fracture optimization in horizontal wells  the authors, and others, have written extensively about stress shadows and their potential influence on breakdown pressures, isip increases from toe to heal in horizontal wellbores, on hydraulic fracture rotation and asymmetric propagation, on perforation cluster efficiency, and on their potential impact on multi-well completion schemes  however, as many of the current unconventional plays, like those in the permian basin in texas, in the stack/scoop in oklahoma, and the bakken in north dakota, involve sufficient vertical thickness that stacked laterals are being used or considered, the impact of stress shadows needs to also be considered for these developments   within this paper, the authors present numerical hydraulic fracture simulation results for a bakken-type stacked play considering the impact of stress shadows on fracture propagation (both height and length) as well as fracture rotation  the results show that, under certain field conditions, there may be a benefit to optimizing lateral landing location, job design, and the vertical completion sequencing of the laterals (i e , stimulating from shallow to deep rather than deep to shallow)   1  introduction  the authors, and others (nagel, et al , 2011; nagel, et al , 2013 a; nagel, et al , 2013b; wong, et al , 2013; peirce and bunger, 2014; dohmen, et al , 2015; skomorowski, et al , 2015; and zangeneh, et al , 2015), have written fairly extensively about stress shadows - the colloquial or common term used to describe the stress changes induced by hydraulic fractures  furthermore, the topic of stress shadows has been included in a patent application (patent wo2015069817a1, 2015) and as a society of petroleum engineers distinguished lecturer topic (nagel, 2016)   in an elastic formation, stress and deformation are coupled  that is, if the formation is stressed, it will deform and if the formation is deformed, it will alter the local stress field  this concept was known and applied to a crack (i e , a hydraulic fracture) in an elastic medium by sneddon (1946)  this points to one of several key understandings about stress shadows: stress shadows are a result of hydraulic fracture-induced deformations (e g , hydraulic fracture width or natural fracture width) and any temporal changes in these deformations (e g , closure of the hydraulic fracture on proppant) will alter the stress shadows  furthermore, this means that stress shadows occur from all hydraulic fractures, whether initiated from a horizontal or a vertical wellbore | 
2017-0885 	 numerical study of the contact between a chamfered cylindrical pdc cutter and the rock |abstract: numerical rock cutting simulations are performed for different cutter configurations  special attention is given to the contact region between the cutter and the rock  frictional contact is solved using a gap based augmented lagrangian approach, in order to minimize the interpenetration error that is present in the less expensive penalty approach, while reducing finite element accumulation time compared to the standard lagrangian method  numerical experiments are performed with a single cylindrical cutter of radius 16 mm, a back rake of 15°, a depth of cut of 4 mm, and two different chamfers: a 0 3 mm chamfer at 15°, and a 0 5 mm chamfer at 45°  the number of uzawa iterations required for the interpenetration error to have minimal impact on cutting forces is estimated, and the accuracy of the penalty approach is emphasized  contact tractions are shown, suggesting areas where the mesh should be refined  a suitable mesh size is given for both chamfer geometries  the influence of the friction coefficient on cutting forces is evaluated, suggesting a cutter configuration insensitive to the value of the friction coefficient within a realistic range   1  introduction  many attempts have been made to numerically model rock cutting  the different approaches used include the boundary element method [tan et al 1998; liu 2002], the finite element method (fem) [jaime et al , 2010; zhou et al , 2011; zhou et al , 2014], the discrete element method [huang, 1999; rojek et al , 2011] and the discrete-finite element method [onate and rojek, 2004]  huang [1999] showed the potential of the discrete element method to explain the reduction of the interfacial friction coefficient up to a critical back rake angle, due to the flow of material on the cutter face  rojek et al  [2011] predicted cutter forces and chip size, for a point attack pick at 1 4 m/s and 10 mm depth of cut, and showed that these can be correlated to the frequency spectrum of cutting forces  onate and rojek [2004] modeled the tool considering thermo-mechanical effects on model cutter wear  helmons and miedema [2013] considered flow between the discrete spherical elements  however, discrete models require non-conservative numerical damping parameters to dissipate kinetic energy, and extensive calibration in order to macroscopically represent material behavior  guo et al  [1992] used the finite element method (fem) and assumed a pre-existing crack, but did not account for the crushed zone in front of the cutter  jaime et al  [2010] showed fem to be accurate for rock cutting, considered several chipping cycles, and solved for contact between the cutter and an irregular rock surface  these authors used a plastic cap model included in a plastic-damage model implemented in the commercial software ls- dyna  damaged elements beyond a certain threshold were removed, leading to unrealistic force drops | 
2017-0886 	 coal rib failure and support in longwall gate entries |abstract: rib falls are serious safety hazards in underground coal mines  studies of injuries and fatalities caused by rib falls have shown that the significant mining conditions that contribute to rib falls are mining height, depth of cover, and stress resulting from mining of multiple seams  in longwall mining, rib stability in gate entries is also influenced by the induced abutment pressures  to reduce the risk of rib injuries and fatalities in longwall mining, it is important to understand the mechanisms of rib failure under different geologic and mining conditions, and the requirements for rib support in the gate entries  rib scoping was performed by niosh researchers to detect fractures in the ribs of the gate entries in the pittsburgh coal seam  rib fractures and failures were observed for various loading conditions throughout different mining cycles  numerical modeling was performed to calibrate a coal mass model to the field data and to further predict rib fractures under different abutment stress levels  based on field monitoring and numerical modeling, a conceptual model is proposed for considerations of rib support in longwall gate entries   1  introduction  in the past several decades, the installation of roof support in underground coal mines has been a priority in preventing potential roof falls as entries and crosscuts are developed  conversely, rib support has not been taken as seriously as roof support in the past, especially under the conditions where rib sloughage is not so pronounced  although the scale of rib falls is usually smaller compared to the scale of roof falls, a chunk of coal or rock falling from rib could be a potential risk of injury  the current practice in coal mines in the united states is to choose rib bolts of specific diameter and length as a reactive action; that is, the rib bolting is designed in response to the scale of rib falls and injuries that have occurred (mohamed et al , 2015)  in some cases, whether or not to implement rib support can be easily determined through observations of rib sloughage, while in other cases, the rib may be over-supported or undersupported based on what is perceived through observations  rib stability is primarily influenced by entry height, overburden depth, and stress resulting from mining of multiple seams  in longwall gate entries, rib stability is also affected by the induced abutment pressures created by longwall retreating | 
2017-0888 	 in-situ behavior of weak immediate floor materials in the illinois basin underground coal mines |abstract: when a coal seam is underlain by weak strata and experiences stresses in excess of floor’s bearing capacity, the foundation materials will fail  three different modes were identified in the past for such failures: local shear, general shear and punching  while existence of these different failure modes is reasonably well known, in-situ test data describing the conditions under which the failure modes develop is scarce  in this paper, results from a large in-situ plate testing program conducted in some mines of the illinois basin are presented  the modes of floor failure at the plate test sites are examined with a goal to understand the conditions leading to each type of failure  field observations at the test sites confirm existence of the three modes of floor failure  however, it was discovered that the response of floor depended on the nature of loading applied and the moisture content of the floor  data is also presented on the load bearing capacity of the floor as determined by in-situ plate tests  the 132 different plate tests from 17 coal mines form the largest database of its kind for the illinois basin mines, which helped develop new strength relationships for use with pillar design   1  introduction  all major mineable coal seams in the illinois basin contain weak immediate floor materials  when stressed to the limit state, the floor response is normally manifested by large plastic movements that appear in the mine opening called ‘floor heave’  the limit state could be reached due to excess mining induced stresses, or significant increase in the moisture content or both  floor heave can cause both short- and long-term problems  depending on the location, in the short-term, the unstable floor movements may result in inaccessible work areas, unavailability of escape ways, reduced ventilation, roof falls and increased operational cost  in the long-term, floor failure is the main reason for unplanned surface subsidence in a majority of cases in the illinois basin  excess deformation of floor in the long-term can also affect the integrity of mine seals used to isolate working sections from abandoned areas  for both the short- and long-term cases, normally the surface will not be affected unless the underground instability occurs over a reasonably large area  if floor heave occurs in a single entry or in a few isolated spots in a panel, such instability may not cause noticeable damage to the surface  the size of the unstable area needed to induce visible surface damage principally depends on depth of cover, width of the panel, nature of materials in the overburden, and the amount by which coal pillars settled | 
2017-0890 	 temporal changes in stress state in a sill pillar imaged through seismic tomography |abstract: in order to understand how the rock mass evolves with extraction in the particularly highly-stressed environment of a sill pillar in a hard rock mine in north america, we investigate the utility of seismic tomography as an interpretive tool  we use a rich dataset of blasts to highlight the compressional wave variations in the rock  although tough there are areas within the sill pillar that are prone to smearing, we are able to resolve subtle variations in velocity structure  by considering different time periods, we image temporal changes in seismic velocity that we relate to the stress state and damage in the rock  specifically, we consider data recorded during three sequential time intervals associated with the excavation of a stope during the start of the second interval  we observe a high-velocity anomaly in the first interval that is located to the edge of the future stope  after mining, the high-velocity regions migrate to the other side of the stope and then disperse to the edges of the resolvable area  equating high-velocity anomalies with high-stress gives us the ability to characterize the evolving stress state in the mine and potentially an approach that can be used to avoid hazardous situations   1  introduction  underground excavations in mines entail a detailed understanding of the stress state to mitigate the risk of rockbursts and other seismicity that may cause damage to infrastructure and potentially casualties to personnel  depending on the overall mining methodology, the highly-stressed areas become more focused in sill and crown pillars  as a mine reaches the end of its life-cycle, the need to safely excavate these areas becomes critical, and techniques that constrain the stress state are essential to enable the safe extraction of the resource   the rock mass responds to variations in the stress state of the mine; high-stress areas have the effect of closing microcracks in the rock mass and, thereby, increasing seismic velocities  by mapping the velocity variations as a function of space and time we can start to understand the stress variations associated with extraction  tomographic imaging of mines has been used to relate to the stress distribution in mines in several studies (e g  young & maxwell 1992; maxwell & young 1996; silver et al  2007; ma et al  2016)  a number of studies have shown promise in using these techniques to monitor the stability of block caving operations (westman et al  2012; mercier et al  2015) | 
2017-0891 	 evaluating absolute specimen straining from clip gage extensometers in confining pressure varying tests |abstract: tests in triaxial cells are usually performed on cylindrical specimens, for which axial and circumferential devices are required  a clip gage clips onto the specimen at distinct reference points and integrates the observed straining over a reference (gage) length  since the clip gages are installed in-vessel and are subjected to the same confining pressure variations of the test procedure, their elastic response and other sensor element related deviations mask the displacement readouts  this paper proposes a model to compensate these effects in the test registers that can be implemented in the test machine controller, so that any controller action might benefit from real strain measures  the model consider each clip gage element separately to account for its mechanics  it includes a jacket (membrane) model to account for its effects on the circumferential strain readings  a procedure to evaluate the clip gage parameters is presented, as well as a fit example  the final model is versatile, as it may be applied to any test setup using a single set of clip gage parameters  |1  introduction |conventional triaxial tests on rock specimens require their immersion in a confining chamber, namely the triaxial cell  the confining pressure is exerted on the specimen walls by a confining fluid at the desired pressure level  once the confining chamber is closed, direct access to the specimen being tested is lost and the information is transmitted to the testing machine controller via telemetry  |testing information, such as test temperature, axial force, confining pressure and specimen strains, for instance, are preferably measured inside the triaxial cell and close to the specimen for better accuracy  the accessories intended to measure these testing variables are hence subjected to the same pressure variations of the testing program and may therefore be affected by them  triaxial tests may also require the specimen to be enveloped by an impervious membrane or jacket to isolate the porespace from the confining chamber fluid  this jacket prevents direct mechanical contact of some accessories to the specimen walls, thus incorporating its mechanical response in the final measurements | 
2017-0894 	 upscaling of hydraulic and mechanical parameters in coupled flow deformation simulation problems |abstract: we investigate the effective elastic properties of heterogeneous rocks  this is done by using the finite element method (fem) on systems with different types of heterogeneity  we look at configurations with known analytical solutions, namely, laminate composites and demonstrate that our numerical formulation produces a reasonable match for multiple combinations of elastic properties  we show that the stress component transversal to the composite is homogeneous, while the longitudinal component is piecewise constant in agreement with the theoretical assumptions  next, we consider a system subdivided in nx times ny regions and investigate two types of heterogeneity: continuous and discrete  the former consists of systems with parameters sampled from a continuous probability density function (pdf), while the latter correspond to systems with a finite number material types  for the first case, we use a uniform pdf for the young’s modulus and poisson’s ratio and observed that the resulting distribution of effective moduli follow a strongly skewed distribution towards low values and, in addition, the distribution of local stresses is smeared out  in the case of a discrete distribution of properties, we consider a two-phase material with contrasting properties and distributed with a stiff background, and softer material distributed in isolated clusters  we observe that, in this case, the distribution of effective moduli follow a normal pdf while local stresses exhibit regions with extremely high values   1  introduction  upscaling of flow parameters for reservoir flow simulation has been extensively studied [1, 2]  the reason for the interest lies on the fact that oil and gas reservoirs are usually very heterogeneous systems and, while computer power now allows the simulation of very large models [3], it is either impossible or impractical to represent details at all relevant scales   many methods have been suggested for the upscaling of flow parameters [4-7]  most methods published to date, start with the assumption of a finite difference discretization and target the upscaling of transmissibilities  alternative methods rely on the effective medium theory, which can only be applied to specific geometries [7]   traditional approaches are based on analytical solutions, under the assumption of a specific connectivity and a given set of boundary conditions (local approximations)  to remove these assumptions, global methods have been proposed [8] which involves the computation of a coarse representation that minimizes the global norm  a more practical approach, which in turn is more amenable for generalization, known as the global-local method has also been proposed [4] | 
2017-0895 	 laboratory testing of casing-cement interface and multi-scale modeling of casing integrity within salt |abstract: solution mining of a potash bed beneath a 40-m-thick salt bed at a depth of cover of 1100 m was planned for a potash project  because each solution-mining cavern’s planned life was several years and due to salt creep, assuring casing integrity within the salt bed above the caverns was a major engineering challenge   to assist in the design of the casing and slip joints, small-scale ucs and punch-through shear tests were performed on a variety of casing-cement samples  these tests were used to determine cohesive and frictional behaviors of the casing-cement bond  after testing, a numerical modeling study was performed to better understand and predict the behavior of the casing-cement bond  numerical analyses included cavern-scale and casing-scale models at various resolutions   the laboratory test results suggested that a weak casing-cement bond could be achieved by using relatively low-strength cement and greased, lubricated, or friction-reducing coated casings  numerical analysis results showed that the weak casing-cement bond would prevent both high tensile and compressive stresses from forming in the casing  these analyses also demonstrated that slip joints were effective when used with the weak casing-cement bond  the cohesion and friction angle of the casing-cement bond and the location of slip joints were recommended based on the laboratory testing and model observations herein   1  introduction  selective and non-selective solution mining of a potash bed was planned for a potash project, located at a depth of about 1100 meters (m) below ground and covered by an approximately 40-m-thick salt bed  the planned life for each solution-mining cavern was several years  based on previous cavern stability, subsidence assessment, and wellfield and casing design studies for the project, it was noted that because of the long cavern life and due to salt creep, assuring casing integrity within the approximately 40-m-thick salts above the caverns was a major engineering challenge | 
2017-0896 	 geophysical and geological characterization of core materials in support of the kismet experiment at the sanford underground research facility (surf) |abstract: the kismet experiment included drilling monitoring holes (50 m deep) and an injection hole (100 m deep) at the 4850 level of the sanford underground research facility in lead, sd, usa  the core from two of the hq-size monitoring holes was examined to determine petrologic, acoustic velocity, and magnetic susceptibility properties  the core was characterized as being a graphite carbonate phyllite with the carbonates being both calcite and dolomite  regular variations with depth in the acoustic velocities were recognized and will provide information to inform the analysis of the hydraulic fracturing results   1  introduction  field operations for the kismet (permeability [k] and induced seismicity management for energy) project were conducted in the underground of the sanford underground research facility (surf) during the summer of 2016  five holes were drilled at 3 m intervals on the 4850 level of the facility in a drift that connects between the yates shaft and the ross shaft  the four hq- size monitoring holes were drilled to a design depth of 50 m and the nq-size injection hole was drilled to a design depth of 100 m (fig  1)  the holes were designated as k-001 through k-005 with k-001 being the furthest to the north  this report is confined to geophysical results from k-001 and k-004  hydraulic fracturing experiments were conducted in the middle (k-003) injection  2  rock description  caddy and others (1991) estimated that the entire poorman fm  has a thickness of 1500 m, and steadman and large (2016) suggested that the metasedimentary rocks of the ross member have a thickness ranging from 200 – 1,000 m  therefore, the present drilling only investigated a portion of the metasedimentary portion of the poorman fm  these metamorphosed sedimentary rocks are tightly folded, but in general the rock package plunges to the south in this area  the sequence consists primarily of graphite, carbonate phyllites  the rocks are rhythmically bedded with alternating sequences of more massive graphitic phyllites alternating with thin (< 2 cm) bands of carbonate, although some variation in the more graphitic units can be recognized as well based on subtle color changes  figure 2 shows two thin-sections taken from core k-001 at 12 2 m and 42 7 m  the thin sections are colored with alizarin red staining agent, which is sensitive to the calcium content of the calcite  as a result, the locations of the calcite in the thin sections are well-defined by the staining  although not visible in the sections of figure 2 due to the small grain-size, the opaque graphite grains are typically less than 0 25 mm in diameter and are irregular in shape  depending upon the graphite concentration, the rock varies in color from white in the thinly bedded carbonate units to black in the heavily graphitic units  the results of the hydraulic fracturing are being analyzed and reported elsewhere  this report deals with descriptions of the rock in which the fracturing was performed, the acoustic velocities measured on core recovered during the construction of the monitoring holes, and magnetic susceptibilities of the core  figure 1 is adapted from golder (2009) and shows the 4850 level in the vicinity of the kismet holes  the pertinent units in the figure include the proterozoic rocks of the yates unit of the poorman fm , the upper poorman fm , called the ross member by steadman and large (2016), and the tertiary-age rhyolite dikes  figure 1 also shows that the holes for the kismet project were drilled in the upper unit of the poorman fm  above the contact with the amphibolite of the yates member of the poorman formation  no rhyolite was intersected during this phase of the project | 
2017-0897 	 limit loads for pipelines and cylinders partially embedded in frictional materials |abstract: accurately assessing the forces and reactions on cylindrical objects partially embedded in soils is fundamental in pipeline engineering as well as the analysis and design of off-road vehicles  with a view towards understanding the limiting forces acting over the contact area between the cylinder and the soil, this paper compares two different theoretical approaches for predicting ultimate loads under combined vertical and horizontal loading  the first is an approximate method based on idealizing the contact interface as a flat shallow strip footing, and the second is based on finite element limit analysis (fela)  focus is on purely frictional material and plane strain conditions, assuming a rigid cylinder and perfectly plastic material obeying the mohr-coulomb yield condition with associated plastic flow  the approximate method based on an analogy to an equivalent shallow foundation (with no overburden) predicts results that are reasonably close to those from fela but only when small embedment is considered  moreover, the discrepancy between the two approaches for the case of free cylinder rotation is attributed to the existence of a contact moment over the soil-cylinder contact interface  practical implications for pipeline engineering and off-road vehicle engineering are discussed   1  introduction  the evaluation of ultimate contact force between partially embedded (on-bottom) cylindrical structures and soil is a fundamental problem for applications in various branches of engineering, from assessing the stability of offshore pipelines (small, 1971; gao et al  2015) to determining the forces on wheeled vehicles operating on soils (collins, 1972; hambleton and stanier, 2017)  for instance, soil resistance against lateral buckling of pipelines is critical for the design of oil pipelines which can buckle due to thermal expansion, mechanical actions or geo-hazards  accurately predicting resistance not only creates economic benefits but also prevents potentially significant impacts on the environment resulting from oil leakage (oliveira et al  2010)   a literature review shows that various approaches have been proposed to assess the ultimate (limit) loads on partially embedded cylinders  based on limit analysis, murff et al  (1989) derived upper bound and lower bound solutions for the ultimate vertical load acting on a pipeline embedded in perfectly plastic cohesive material  using the upper bound approach of limit analysis, randolph and houlsby (1984) and martin and randolph (2006) studied the capacity of a pile against lateral loading in perfectly plastic cohesive soil, which can be used to analyze very deeply embedded pipelines whose bearing capacity is independent of the embedment depth and the loading direction  by idealizing soil as a perfectly plastic cohesive soil, randolph and white (2008) proposed an upper bound solution to evaluate the bearing capacity of shallowly embedded pipelines subjected to combined vertical and horizontal loading  their theoretical predictions were presented as v-h failure envelopes, where the variables v and h refer to the vertical and horizontal components of the ultimate load, respectively | 
2017-0900 	 method for determining permeability in sandstone and shale reservoirs from typical drilling parameters |abstract: this paper describes a method for determining permeability variations for a continuous interval utilizing conventional drilling data for sandstone and shale reservoirs  the drilling data is used to find the unconfined compressive strength (ucs) within a well using an inverted rate of penetration (rop) model  previously published core and cuttings data for sandstone and shale reservoirs are used to create correlations for ucs and porosity as well as porosity and permeability  porosity values can be calculated at any ucs values, and applied to the porosity and permeability correlation for the specific reservoir  this yields a permeability value for a specific reservoir at a given ucs  the verification of the correlation was done with permeability data from two wells penetrating the montney shale and nikanassin sandstone formations in british columbia, canada  the permeability calculation for the montney and nikanassin formations was compared to the permeability obtained from core and cuttings analysis data and a comparison between trend and accuracy can be done   1  introduction  permeability determination can be a challenging task, but has proven advantageous to stimulation design and reservoir characterization  determination of shale permeability has proven to be vastly different from the techniques employed for finding permeability in conventional reservoir rock (moghadam and chalaturnyk, 2015)  the most common technique used to determine shale permeability is the gri technique, but one of the downsides associated with this method is that the sample sizes used can alter the permeability results (tinni et al , 2012)  civan et al , 2013, investigated the effect of darcian flow on shale permeability and proposed that this method has the potential to predict shale permeability for a variety of conditions  one way that sandstone permeability can be determined is through the use of sonic and electrical logs, but these logs can be ineffective if shales are present (jiang et al , 2013)  well logs can be used in conjunction with artificial neural networks or multiple regression analysis for permeability estimation (pereira, 2004)  there are also numerous correlations that utilize well logs to empirically determine permeability, including but not limited to the timur, tixier, and coates-dumanois, and coates methods (mohaghegh et al , 1997)  many of these empirically calculated permeability methods require knowledge of the irreducible water saturation, and often these correlations can be vastly different from core analysis results (hunt and pursell, 1997)  one common issue with log methods is that depth correction between logs and core samples must be performed in order to obtain accurate results (deng et al , 2013)  pressure transient data obtained from wireline formation testers (wft) can also be used for permeability determination, but it has been observed that this method may not be accurate in heterogeneous formations (ramaswami et al , 2016)  the cost of running wft’s can reduce the number of measurements taken in a well and can sometimes misrepresent the permeability for the entire zone in question (li et al , 2016) | 
2017-0901 	 the lateral force in a sedimentary layer under gravity using dem |abstract: in current design analysis of tunnels in cemented granular materials, both the vertical and lateral force distribution are assumed to be uniform  this analysis does not consider the effect of the gravity induced irregularity of the lateral forces on the tunnels  the intensity and irregularity of these lateral forces on the tunnel can also be influenced by the shape of the tunnel  using the dem approach, the gravity induced lateral forces on a vertical boundary near tunnels in cemented granular materials were obtained  it was determined that these lateral forces were irregularly distributed not only in their values but in their allocation as well  the irregularity of the force distribution and their allocation were evaluated using the fractal dimension concept from fractal theory  different shaped openings affected the lateral force distributions, which leads to different values of the ratio between the values of the lateral and the vertical loads  therefore, the irregularity of the lateral force distributions in boundaries near tunnels of different shape should be used in their design   1  introduction  tunnels are an important type of underground structures and has been widely built for public transportation, flood discharge, and other purposes such as network, communication and electricity cable installation  when designing these tunnels, the simplifying assumptions made by the designers are that both the vertical and lateral loads are uniformly distributed on the boundaries, and the lateral load is a fraction of the vertical load  models of tunnel excavations in this stress state, namely far-field stress state, are often discussed in the text books of rock mechanics and engineering geology due to its significance as basic teaching and learning tools for understanding the mechanisms of underground excavations [1-3]   based on these assumptions, a number of theoretical solutions have been developed to analyze problems associated with underground constructions  the complete solutions for stress and displacement distributions around circular and elliptical opening were originally given by kirsch [4] and bray [5], respectively  theoretical solutions for stress distribution of different shaped tunnels [6, 7], lined tunnels [8, 9], arbitrary cross section of tunnels [10, 11], tunnels considering the influence of ground reinforcement [12] and groundwater [13] have also been presented  these analytical solutions explain the mechanics of generation of stress and deformation that occur due to the excavation of tunnels in rock and soil  many stress analysis of tunnel behaviour have been developed using numerical methods  finite element method (fem) was employed to model the excavation of deep tunnels [14] and to investigate the in-situ rock stress near excavation boundaries [15, 16] | 
2017-0902 	 numerical modeling of fluid flow, heat transfer and induced mircoseismicity in three dimensional fracture networks |abstract: reservoir stimulation in naturally fractured reservoirs is significantly impacted by the presence of fractures  this paper presents an improved 3d numerical model for fluid flow, heat transfer and injection induced microseismicity in a network of fractures  a stochastic fracture network model accounting for fracture spatial distribution and detailed individual fracture properties such as aperture, size and orientation is generated  the connectivity of the fracture network is then identified using a searching algorithm  fluid is assumed to flow within the interconnected set of fractures  pressure distribution within the interconnected network is solved from a set of mass balance equations written at each fracture center  the flow pattern on individual fracture planes is then obtained analytically  to model heat transfer, energy conservation is written for each fracture as a balance between convected energy, energy dissipated by conduction and the change of energy retained by the volume of fluid within the fractures  fracture propagation and shear slippage are simulated integrally to account for their combined effects on fracture network response  fracture shear slippage is assumed to be governed by the mohr-coulomb failure criterion and the corresponding microseismic events are identified  this model is applied to simulate the response of a large scale fracture network to fluid injection  simulation results show that during injection, the increase in pressure inside fully connected fractures could lead to slip events and cause some fractures to propagate  the hydraulic conductivity of the fracture network is improved through fracture shear dilation and fracture propagation   1  introduction  naturally fractured reservoirs contain a significant portion of the world’s petroleum and geothermal reservoirs  fractures are usually stress sensitive, and they could dilate and slip in shear and possibly propagate as a result of injection induced stress changes, which plays an important role in reservoir permeability enhancement  numerical modeling of these phenomena can help understand how fractures contribute to the stimulation outcome, which is essential for stimulation optimization  the objective of this study is to develop a numerical model for fluid flow, heat transfer, fracture deformation and induced micro-seismicity in three dimensional fracture networks, and to simulate the response of large-scale natural fracture networks to injection | 
2017-0909 	 fault reactivation induced by temperature and pressure changes in the life of a deep geological repository  |abstract: the potential of inducing fault reactivation by a synthetic nuclear waste repository in a clay-stone formation is here investigated  the target clay formation may be expected to be almost impermeable, having self-healing and long-term plastic properties, to make sure the canisters, loaded with high-level radioactive waste, are confined and kept in place, with no migration of radionuclides from the storage tunnels  however, in the initial phase of the storage, the radionuclide decay is responsible for a sharp increase in temperature of ~100°c, expected to peak after about 10-100 years  concurrently, a fluid pressurization of up to ~10mpa is predicted to peak around 1000-5000 years as a consequence of a temperature increase as high as 20°c in a larger volume surrounding the repository   some faults with no significant offset may remain undetected and additionally in-situ stress state may show strong variation for the rock units above and especially below the target storage unit: the combination of pressure and temperature change can then induce relevant stresses on fault planes even outside the storage rock unit  a correct characterization of the potential reactivation of faults depends on the evaluation of the in-situ stresses, the induced stress changes, as well as on the characterization of the failing material  a numerical coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical approach is here proposed to compute stress changes due to radiogenic heating and induced pressurization  failure takes place following the mohr-coulomb criterion and sudden slip is simulated on the reactivated faults by accounting for a strain-softening friction evolution   1  introduction  long term storage of nuclear waste is a problem that must be addressed at the industrial scale in the near future  the long term mechanical and hydrological confinement of the radionuclides must be guaranteed  this requires the construction of an underground geological repository, where the sealing properties of the hosting geologic formation may be enhanced by one or more engineered barriers  for example, in the swiss geological and tectonic settings the opalinus clay formation is the preferred hosting formation, with additional sealing provided by an engineered barrier, including a buffer of swelling bentonite clay surrounding the waste canister (nagra, 2002; delage et al , 2010) | 
2017-0911 	 modeling of fluid-driven fractures using xfem |abstract: the extended finite elements method (xfem) refers to a simulation technique where a fracture is modeled via splitting of special enriched finite elements during the course of a simulation  xfem, unlike cohesive zone method (czm), allows simulating nucleation and growth of a fracture along an arbitrary, solution-dependent path without re-meshing the material in the bulk  in this work, we have used 2d xfem coupled with pore-pressure degrees of freedom to simulate a variety of boundary value problems related to fluid-driven (hydraulic) fractures in a permeable medium  specifically, through these simulations, we investigate the influence of critical geomechanical and operational parameters on hydraulic fracturing, including (a) creation of fracture-tortuosity due to a misalignment between initial perforation and maximum in situ stress direction, (b) impact of in situ stress anisotropy on the near-wellbore fracture geometry, (c) deflection of fracture path due to a spatial pore-pressure gradient, (d) refracturing of an already existing hydraulic fracture, and (e) merging of a hydraulic fracture with a pre-existing natural fracture in the formation  for each of these cases, the predicted fracture geometry is compared with the respective experimental result available in the literature  the simulated and the measured fracture geometries are found to be in good agreement   1  introduction  hydraulic fracturing refers to the process of nucleation and growth of fractures inside rock formations by means of flow-induced pressurization (hubbert and willis, 1957; khristianovic and zheltov, 1955)  hydraulic fracturing is primarily used in the oil and gas industry as a means of stimulating unconventional reservoirs  examples of unconventional reservoirs include oil and gas shales, tight sandstones, and heavy oil and tar sands  the ease of recovery of hydrocarbons from a given reservoir depends upon the mobility of the hydrocarbons in that reservoir, which is defined as the ratio of formation permeability to the viscosity of the host fluid (hydrocarbons)  the mobility of hydrocarbons in unconventional reservoirs is typically several orders of magnitude smaller than that in conventional reservoirs  because of such ultra-low mobility, the recovery of hydrocarbons from such reservoirs is much more challenging compared to a conventional reservoir  therefore, often an assertive recovery method such as hydraulic fracturing is required to make the extraction of hydrocarbons from such reservoirs economically viable  hydraulic fracturing facilitates the recovery of hydrocarbons from unconventional reservoirs by creating conductive channels which provide an easier escape route for the hydrocarbons | 
2017-0913 	 numerical modeling of the step rate test using fully coupled hydraulic fracturing capabilities |abstract: this paper presents a fully coupled finite element model to simulate hydraulic fracturing (hf) in rocks  the step rate test, a common diagnostic test for designing hf treatments, is simulated to demonstrate the model’s capabilities  in the model, the rock deformation is fully coupled with the pore-fluid darcy flow and the fracture is modeled using specialized cohesive zone elements that simulate darcy flow in undamaged state which smoothly transitions to a tangential poiseuille flow when fully damaged  fluid leak-off into the formation and near wellbore damage effects are also accounted for  specialized pipe elements are used to model the wellbore fluid flow including the frictional losses  using this model, a field-scale step rate test is simulated, with thoroughly calibrated material properties and in-situ stresses  it is shown that the model can match the entire pressure history of the test, including the flow regime transition from pure matrix flow to fully developed fracture growth and the shut-in leak-off response  it can also predict the formation breakdown pressure, showing it to be higher than theoretical estimates, which is critical for injection system pump design  the model is further used to gain insights on the fracture behavior   1  introduction  the technology of hydraulic fracturing today has revolutionized the global energy landscape by enabling economic production of fossil fuels from very low permeability reservoirs  it has also proven to be very useful for several other applications, such as drill waste and produce water disposal, wellbore integrity analysis and formation in-situ stress measurement  this has led to significant research contributions towards understanding the mechanics behind it and the development of numerical modeling capabilities (adachi et al , 2007; carrier and granet, 2012; hu and garagash, 2010; hunsweck et al, 2013; lecampion, 2009; peirce and detournay, 2008; warpinski et al , 1994)  many of these full physics based capabilities developed in academia have been verified with 2d problems, but not quantitatively applied to and validated at a full 3d field scale  consequently the fracture modeling in industry predominantly has to rely on pseudo-3d fracture geometry assumptions (meyer, 1989) being unable to fully reap the benefit of these developments   recently, a fully coupled 3d finite element modeling capability to simulate hydraulic fracturing was co-developed by exxonmobil and dassault systemes (searles et al , 2016) using the finite element software abaqus®  this capability was verified via comparisons with published analytical solutions as well as successfully validated against a suite of laboratory scale hydraulic fracture experiments (zielonka et al , 2014; ning et al, 2015)  in this paper the goal is to demonstrate the 3d, field-scale predictive capability of this model by simulating the step rate test (nolte, 2000) - a typical diagnostic test used in the oil and gas industry to design various aspects of a hydraulic fracture treatment | 
2017-0917 	 influence of temperature and anisotropy on creep behavior of mancos shale |abstract: growing energy demand over the few last decades has led to a great deal of attention to unconventional shale gas reservoirs  the production from these reservoirs are feasible through hydraulic fracturing  an important issue regarding hydraulic fracturing is the production loss due to the creep-induced closure of fractures  this paper reports a study on the influence of elevated temperature on the creep deformation of shale rocks  to this end, a series of multi-stage triaxial creep tests differing in stress conditions and temperature is carried out on two samples of the mancos shale, one cored parallel and the other normal to the bedding  results indicate a significant increase in the creep rate due to increasing the temperature  it is also observed that the sample cored parallel to the bedding exhibits higher stiffness and a lower creep strain rate compared to the one cored normal to the bedding   1  introduction  recently, a great deal of attention has been drawn to unconventional shale gas reservoirs  hydraulic fracturing, and horizontal drilling makes production from these reservoirs possible  the main characteristics of these reservoirs include low permeability, high organic content and small grain size  therefore, it is essential to create an effective network of fractures to provide enough surface area in such reservoirs  this has been achieved through hydraulic fracturing   creep deformations result in a reduction in the effectiveness of hydraulic fracturing over time [1]  creep also impacts the stress state around the wellbore, resulting in its deformation and occasionally serious damage or instability   creep deformation and its rate have been shown to be significantly influenced by environmental conditions [2]  one of the environmental conditions that can substantially impact the creep rate is temperature, which is generally believed to increase the strain rate and potentially promote failure  this is particularly the case at depth where the temperature and stresses around the wellbore increase  therefore, it is essential to investigate the influence of elevated temperature on the creep deformation of rocks | 
2017-0928 	 laboratory visualization of hydraulic fracture propagation induced by variable-rate fluid injection within analogue rock samples containing preexisting fractures |abstract: laboratory hydraulic fracturing visualization experiments on transparent rock analogues containing preexisting fractures are presented  soda-lime glass cubes (10 cm<u+00d7>10 cm<u+00d7>10 cm) containing pre-existing, partially open fracture networks are subjected to true-triaxal stress state while viscous fluid is injected through a small (~3 mm diameter) analogue borehole to induce fractures in the sample  the preexisting fractures consist of either laser-etched microcracks or thermal-shock-induced fractures which are partially healed by re-heating of the glass  initiation and propagation of the hydraulic fractures are monitored and recorded visually via webcams and acoustically using acoustic emissions  a series of experiments conducted with different fluid injection rates of the fracturing fluid show that the injection rate can have a significant impact on the interactions between hydraulic fractures and pre-existing fractures—fast injection results in less interactions—, affecting the overall geometry of the resulting hydraulic fracture network  experiments involving time-varying (frequency-modulated) injection rate are also conducted, yielding different complexity and characteristics of the hydraulic fracture network   1  introduction  propagation of fluid-injection-induced fractures within rock can be affected by weak interfaces, such as bedding and foliation planes, and open and healed fractures  how they interact with each other results in different fracture network geometry (e g , fisher et al, 2002), determining the success of oil and gas and geothermal reservoir stimulation   over the past decades, only a limited number of field observations (e g , warpinski & trufel, 1987) have been made to understand the geometry of injection-induced fractures in real rock  in recent years, laboratory experiments involving large, meter-size rock samples have been conducted (e g , suarez-rivera et al , 2013) to understand the fracturing behavior of heterogeneous shales  usually, fracture growth is monitored via microearthquakes (in the field) and acoustic emissions (in the laboratory)  however, the location of the fracturing events do not necessarily agree with the propagation of hydrologically connected (i e , stimulating) fractures from the wells  therefore, a better understanding of the relationships between the evolution of the fracture network and accompanying seismic signals is needed, through concurrent optical and seismic visualization | 
2017-0929 	 failure of rock under tensile-compressive loading |abstract: failure data from compression and extension testing of dunnville sandstone and webatuck dolomite were analyzed using three different criteria: mohr-coulomb, hoek-brown, and paul-mohr-coulomb  an emphasis was placed on the details of the failure criteria under tensile-compressive loading conditions, which was possible due to a dog-bone specimen geometry  tension cut-offs were implemented when using mohr-coulomb and paul-mohr-coulomb due to unrealistic predictions of (theoretical) tensile strength  it was determined that under tensile-compressive loading conditions, a tension cut-off provided a better match than hoek-brown to the data for the two rock types examined  hoek-brown overestimates the uniaxial tensile strength by a factor between 2-3 and has the greatest overall least absolute residual error in the low mean stress region   1  introduction  for isotropic rock, many failure criteria have been studied using a mohr diagram, from the linear mohr-coulomb [1] to the nonlinear hoek-brown [2, 3]  in terms of principal stresses, it is convenient to express failure criteria of isotropic rock in terms of principal stresses with respect to magnitude (<u+03c3><u+0399> > <u+03c3>ii > <u+03c3>iii) or direction (<u+03c3>1, <u+03c3>2, <u+03c3>3), and the disregard of magnitude allows the representation of pyramidal failure surfaces  most criteria do not perform well over a large range of stress states, from uniaxial tension with mode i fracture to large hydrostatic stresses with possible yielding  several researchers have performed statistical analyses and other types of descriptive fitting methods to failure criteria of rock [4-7], but almost all the data in these studies have been generated under all three principal stresses being compressive   perhaps the most common test in rock mechanics is uniaxial compression, where the mean stress p at failure is p = c0/3 and co = uniaxial compressive strength (ucs)  test conditions are rare for p < c0/3  a few exceptions are the experiments by brace [8], who used a dog-bone geometry from voigt and bridgman [8], and applied it to crystalline rock  due to the difference in cross-sectional area, a tensile stress can be generated in the axial direction due to the force from fluid (confining) pressure acting in the axial direction  failure can be developed with <u+03c3>i > 0 and <u+03c3>iii < 0 (the minor principal stress is tensile)  chester and ramsey [9] used a particular type of dog-bone specimen, where the crosssectional area varied along the axis of the specimen  from experiments on carrara marble, they observed a transition from extension to shear fracture as mean stress varied  you [10] generated tensile-compressive stress states by performing direct tension tests under confinement, a special type of triaxial extension tests (<u+03c3>iii < <u+03c3>ii = <u+03c3>i) | 
2017-0930 	 limiting drilling parameters to control mud losses in the dammam formation, south rumaila field, iraq |abstract: lost circulation is a challenging problem particularly in the dammam formation of the south rumaila field, iraq  drilling engineers are challenged to select the optimum value for key drilling parameters such as ecd, yp, mw, wob, rop and rpm to mitigate mud losses in this zone  many of these drilling parameters are inter-related and the overall impact of changing key parameters requires extensive drilling experience or study  a multi-regression analysis was performed on mud loss event data for more than 75 wells drilled in the dammam formation  from this analysis, a model was developed to predict total mud losses  mud loss was found to be significantly affected by mw, ecd and rop  models for these key parameters were also developed from multi-regression analysis  the models were confirmed with additional well data from new wells drilled in the field  the models developed in this work provides a method for setting predicted mud losses, then limiting the operational drilling parameters to mitigate such losses in the future wells in fields with similar lithology   1  introduction  drilling mud accounts for a major expense in drilling oil and gas wells  the drilling mud is circulated through the drill string and drill bit, to remove cuttings from the borehole and to enable drill bit performance  drilling mud is specifically formulated to develop a thin coating on the borehole wall, referred to as a ‘mud cake’ which limits fluid losses to the formations already drilled and exposed in the borehole, as drill bit proceeds deeper and deeper  the concept of lost circulation or lost returns can be defined as “the partial or total loss of circulating fluid from the wellbore to the formation  it is the loss of whole fluid, not simply filtrate, to the formation  losses can result from either natural or induced causes and can range from a couple of barrels per hour to hundreds of barrels in minutes  lost circulation is one of the drilling’s biggest expenses in terms of rig time and safety  uncontrolled lost circulation can result in a dangerous pressure control situation and loss of the well” (baker hughes, 1999) | 
2017-0932 	 probabilistic-analysis of deviated wellbore stability in carbonate formations of se iraq |abstract: probability theory has been increasingly applied to address the uncertainty of geomechanical parameters for prediction of allowable drilling mud weight  when conducting wellbore stability analysis, input parameters are estimated from well log data and empirical correlations  in depleted reservoirs, and deviated infill drilling, the uncertainty of these parameters is magnified with stress contrasts  a field case in se iraq, which highlights this issue, was studied post drilling operations, to assess the impact of this uncertainty in wellbore stability analysis  sensitivity analysis showed that the maximum horizontal stress magnitude had the greatest effect on estimated conditions at failure, followed in decreasing order by internal friction angle, rock cohesion, vertical stress, minimum horizontal stress and pore pressure  applying p90 as a threshold on the estimated minimum mud weight proved to be conservative  field data showed wells drilled without observed instability issues with mud weights even below the p50 value  for fracture mud weight, on the other hand, the field data showed the p50 threshold for maximum mud weight did not prevent fluid losses  this illustrates the issue of applying threshold of p50 for selection the mud weight window to ensure wellbore stability analysis   1  introduction  in recent years, the traditional deterministic wellbore stability analysis (e g , aadnoy and chenevert, 1987; anderson et al , 1973; bradley, 1979) has been expanded to include the probabilistic techniques for identifying the likelihood of instabilities (e g , aadnoy, 2011; al-ajmi and al-harthy, 2010; gholami et al , 2015; mclellan and hawkes, 1996; moos et al , 2003; morita, 1995; sheng et al , 2006; udegbunam et al , 2014)  the rationale of this shift is the uncertainty of many influential parameters, namely the in-situ state of stresses, rock strength and pore pressure  well log measurements are a great contributor to this uncertainty through instrument and interpretation error (gholami et al , 2015)  the heterogeneous nature of the geological strata is another source which may be produced errors in predicting formation tops prior to drilling  carbonate reservoirs by nature have complex depositional environments and diagenetic processes (chilingarian et al , 1992)  this results in a complex pore structure in which ductile, brittle, fractured rocks and vugular pores may all exist within small interval  this huge variance in rock mechanical properties can cause drilling problems, such as differential pipe sticking, tight hole and lost circulation  the common lack of core samples and rock mechanical tests to calibrate well log based strength increases the importance of including uncertainty when applying empirical correlations to estimate the mechanical rock properties along the borehole  also, insufficient calibration data and erroneous interpretation of in-situ stresses is an issue when conducting wellbore stability analysis (aadnoy, 2011)  another source of error results from the assumptions of constitutive models combined with failure criteria to describe rock deformation and failure as resulting from applied stresses  however, these uncertainties are often omitted when applying deterministic models to assess the output (i e , mud weight) as a single value which is not fairly reasonable for post drilling planning | 
2017-0936 	 vertical propagation law of hydraulic fracture in sandstone-mudstone interbedding reservoirs based on discrete element method |abstract: vertical propagation geometry of hydraulic fracture is one of the important considerations of hydraulic fracturing design which to some extent influences the efficiency of hydraulic fracturing  in this paper, discrete element software pfc2d is used to establish the particle flow model of sandstone-mudstone interbedding reservoirs taking into account the influences of in-situ stress difference, rock interface properties and construction parameters on the initiation and propagation mechanism of hydraulic fractures  the result shows that in-situ stress is the key factor that controlling the fracture propagation path  when in-situ stress is lower than 5 mpa, hydraulic fractures can easily cross the interface  the strength of rock interface has a huge impact on the fracture propagation path, and shear slide would happen in the interfaces when they are penetrated by hydraulic fractures  by increasing the value of q <u+03bc> (the product of viscosity and injection rate), the probability of fracture penetrating the interface is also increased  when using pfc2d to simulate the initiation and propagation process, there is no need to preset fracture propagation paths and divide meshes  the simulation results is accuracy and conform to the experimental results   1  introduction  hydraulic fracturing stimulation in tarim oil filed in west china has many problems, such as deep burial, thin oil layer, sandstone-mudstone interbedding, large sand distribution in both horizontal and vertical direction and cannot satisfy the requirements for slicing mining  to communicate the multiple sandstone layers through integrated fracturing, it is needed to clarify the propagation rule and influencing factors of hydraulic fracture in layered mediums   recently, many scholars had studied hydraulic fracture vertical propagating in layered medium through laboratory test and numerical simulation  in the aspect of laboratory test, anderson [1] studied how the friction property between lithological interfaces affects the propagating of hydraulic fracture, and they found that the lower friction factor is, the higher normal stress is needed to make hydraulic fracture penetrate lithological interfaces  warpinski [2] concluded that instead of lithology difference, the minimum horizontal stress difference has decisive effection on hydraulic fracture propagation; cases [3] studied interfacial bonding material in fractures, fracture tip fluid lag and fracture propagation shape in geologic discontinuous reservoirs  athavale [4] researched how lithology difference and stress difference in layered medium affects fracture propagating geometry  the research shows hydraulic fractures geometry in layer is complex, such as bifurcation, diversion and shearing slip between interfaces  russel [5] analyzed fracture propagation model in layered medium through laboratory observation and acoustic emission monitoring, the results indicates symmetrical penny-shaped fracture geometry was formed, and there is no slip between interfaces  li [6] researched how natural fractures and in-situ stress difference affact the hydraulic fracture propagation path with specimens composed of sand stone, limestone and coal  in the aspect of numerical simulation, most simulation based on finite element software abaqus, mahdi [7-8] simulated initiation and propagation of 3d hydraulic facture with soil module in abaqus  guo [9] researched the interference mechanism between hydraulic and natural fractures and hydraulic fracture propagation behavior under different horizontal stress difference, approaching angle and cementing strength of natural fractures  because of the difference between artificial specimens without cement or cemented artificially and real layered rocks, these tests could not simulate the interfaces effection on fracture propagation  besides, the model based on finite element need to set propagation path previously which creates apparent difference with real propagation process | 
2017-0937 	 the role of bedding planes on fracture behavior and acoustic emission response of shale under unconfined compression |abstract: discontinuities such as bedding planes and natural fractures reduce the strength and stiffness of the rock mass and facilitate failure  in this study we conducted initial tests on the impact of the natural fractures and bedding angle on failure and the generation of acoustic emissions (ae) of opalinus shale during unconfined compression  cylindrical shale specimens were prepared with their long axis at varying angles to natural fractures and bedding  first, we measured the velocity, amplitude, and energy of 100 khz acoustic waves transmitted along the sample axis  each of these increased strongly as the angle incident to bedding decreased from 0 to 90 degrees  these observations will help to provide useful corrections for source location, focal mechanism studies, and for calculating the radiated seismic energy  the strength of the opalinus showed a classic “u shape” strength anisotropy as the loading direction varied  during loading, we used wideband sensors to measure acoustic emissions, which became measurable at about 80% of the peak stress  the cumulative energy of acoustic emissions during failure were greatest when <u+03c3>1 was normal to bedding; about 60% less when <u+03c3>1 || bedding; and least for intermediate angles  based on visual observations of the cracking patterns, tensile cracks were most numerous when the greatest compressive stress was parallel to bedding, fractures in shear orientations dominated when bedding was oriented at 300, 450, 600  when the greatest compressive stress was normal to bedding, the damage had a combination of shear and tensile orientations   1  introduction  in addition to being as the source of unconventional oil and gas resources, due to its low permeability, shale has been considered as a host rock for co2 sequestration, wastewater injection and nuclear waste disposal, e g  opalinus formation from mont terri, switzerland  however, most shales have bedding planes and natural fractures that strongly influence their physical properties, and this anisotropy must be included in planning for many engineering applications | 
2017-0938 	 subcritical fracture process of sandstone with ae energy analysis |abstract: understanding of subcritical fracture process in rocks remains a challenging and crucial task  traditionally the fracture process analysis is based on equivalent fracture approach, without any information of local responses surrounding the crack tip  in this paper, a semi-circular bend (scb) specimen was tested under cyclic loading to create subcritical fractures, and acoustic emission was employed to characterize the fracture process  ae energy analyses reveal that ae energy is concentrated in a small zone, where 70%-90% of ae energy is focused, and it can be regarded as fracture process zone (fpz)  indeed, ae locations occupy a much larger one for different cycles  experimental results show fpz growth rate dl/da is related to equivalent stress intensity factor keff as c(<u+0394>keff)m, where c and m are the constants  it implies that the rate of fpz advance per cycle obeys the paris law, and m is determined as 8 6  interestingly, the relation between ae energy increasing rate de/dn and <u+0394>keff is found almost the same as dl/dn and <u+0394>keff  therefore, fpz growth rate can be associated with ae energy increasing rate by l2(dl/dn)=b*+a* ln(de/dn)  a theoretical model, containing fracture energy and fpz growth rate, is proposed as (equation) to interpret the experimental results   1  introduction  cyclic stress is one of the most common mechanisms associated with subcritical crack growth in rock (atkinson, 1995)  for example, the rocks have been subjected to cyclic stresses over a long period of time in the bridge structures (el-ragaby et al , 2007; zhang and cai, 2007) and the oil and gas reservoirs (zang et al , 2013; fan and zhang , 2014; xing et al , 2016), such that fatigue can be regarded as the principal mechanism for structure failure   burdine (1963) first showed that compressive cycling of rock eventually results in failure with a systematic weakening process  afterwards hardy and chugh (1970) and haimson and kim (1972) clearly demonstrated the time-dependent progressive weakening of rock due to cyclic loading  scholz and koczynski (1979) performed a series of tests to research the relationship between the numbers of cycles to failure and the amplitude of the stress cycle (sa), in which crack growth due to fatigue is an increasing function of sa  kim and mubeen (1981) verified the westerly granite follows the law da/dn=c(<u+0394>k)m during fatigue, which was proposed by paris et al  (1961) to describe metals  thus, determining the crack length is important for subcritical fracture process  shah (1990) proposed a widely used method to determine crack length calculated from global responses of three-point bending specimen, and kolluru et al  (2000) revealed that crack growth owing to constant-amplitude fatigue loading comprised two stages: a deceleration stage obeyed the r-curve concept and a following acceleration stage followed paris law  recently, several models of improved paris law type (shah and kishen ,2012; le et al , 2014) were proposed to describe the fatigue behaviors of rock materials via acoustic emission (ae) and digital image correlation (dic) methods, but the model for characterizing subcritical fracture growth based on the direct measurement results was not available | 
2017-0942 	 well log based geomechanical and petrophysical analysis of the bakken formation |abstract: the detailed knowledge of reservoir properties in the first step in developing a reservoir  this paper discusses the derivation of reservoir and geomechanical properties from well logs in the unconventional reservoir of middle bakken in williston basin, nd  the study was performed on the middle member of the bakken formation in the blue buttes field  reservoir analysis consisted of determining the lithology and petrophysical properties such as porosity, permeability, water saturation, and shale volume calculations  we included xrd analysis for more precise analysis of the reservoir behavior  geomechanical properties were calculated using existing correlations and relation  those properties included the young’s modulus, poisson’s ratio, tensile strength, ucs, and pore pressure   1  introduction  the advancements in hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling enabled production from the low porosity, low permeability middle bakken reservoir  the focus of this study is to add to the pool of information on the bakken that will help with understanding of the properties and create a methodology for future similar studies  this case study will help with getting an additional information on the bakken formation and geomechanical properties in the blue buttes field in particular as a major producing field  middle bakken is the producing part of the formation; therefore, it has been the attention of many geologists and reservoir engineers in order to characterize it in great details  knowing these properties is important as they are used in the beginning of the oilfield development for reservoir simulation and geomodelling purposes as well as the geomechanical and mechanical earth modelling (mem)   well log based modeling is the efficient way of getting different reservoir properties in the absence of actual core measurements, and it is considered more cost effective to get the data compared with conventional core measurements  the work started with well logs gathering from the designated field  the reservoir properties to identify were: porosity, permeability, effective permeability, water saturation, shale volume, lithology, and mineralogy  various methods and approaches were used to acquire those properties | 
2017-0943 	 damage characterization due to microcracking near coalesced hydraulic fractures with acoustic emission |abstract: nanodarcy permeability is common in many oil- and gas-bearing unconventional formations requiring stimulation technologies, such as hydraulic fracturing, which can connect the isolated hydrocarbon-rich pores to a wellbore through induced fracture networks  even though a dense induced fracture network is capable of accessing economic amounts of hydrocarbons, much of the rock between and very close to the fracture network is still un-accessed  inducing fracture networks into rock can create large amounts of micro failures in surrounding regions that are not connected to the wellbore  regions of rock containing microcracks near coalesced macro-scale fractures oftentimes behave differently than the original matrix material due to the permanent structural changes  these changes can manifest themselves in mechanical and petrophysical alterations from the original matrix conditions  understanding that the coalesced fractures must drain the reservoir rock through these regions containing microcracks requires the characterization of damage within rock in terms of mechanical and petrophysical changes  in this study, a laboratory hydraulic fracture test was performed on a two-block system separated by a discontinuity as an analogue to a large natural fault  the induced hydraulic fracture was monitored with acoustic emissions (ae) throughout initiation, propagation, and interaction with the large fault  individual ae event source characterization was performed to obtain mode of failure and relative volumetric deformation  source characteristics were used in conjunction with cloud-based event density techniques to determine regions of differing damage within the cloud of microcracks  quantitative three-dimensional event density imaging results were compared with permeability measurements on sub-cores taken from the sample post-test  inverse relationship between ae event densities and permeability of sub-cores was observed, meaning that reductions in permeability were found nearest coalesced hydraulic fractures in the crystalline rock tested   1  introduction  hydraulic fracturing has become a standard practice in oil- and gas-bearing formations with low permeability reservoirs especially in unconventional hydrocarbon resource development  fracture complexity and/or fracture network generation is desired to create a dense hydraulically conductive pathway reaching as many isolated hydrocarbon-rich pores as possible  although economic amounts of hydrocarbons can be reached, much of the rock very near the fractures, and sometimes within the network, is not accessed because of the very low permeability of the reservoir rock  it has become desirable to understand the changes induced within the surrounding rock not directly or hydraulically connected by a conductive pathway or fracture  this rock is typically associated with the longer-term fluid transport commonly seen in the slow tail of well production curves | 
2017-0944 	 performance of fiber optic sensing technologies for distributed monitoring of ground deformation and temperature in an underground facility |abstract: recent research at montana tech has focused on demonstrating the effectiveness of the emerging fiber-optic-based distributed strain and temperature (dst) and distributed acoustic sensing (das) technologies in an underground environment, facilitating their adoption by the mining industry and thereby contributing to mine safety  deployment of a fiber optic array underground was used as base to compare the performance of this new technology to that of traditional instruments deployed at the site, and to compare performance of different brands of fiber optic cable  from the lessons and techniques learned during this deployment, an underground fiber optic array protocol has been developed to aid future engineers in the utilization of this tool   1  background  traditional sensors used in the underground mining industry are capable of collecting strain, temperature, or acoustic data from a single point or close proximity to the instrumentation  this single point sensing limits the engineer knowledge to the direct vicinity of their instrumentation, and requires an engineer to have a multi-sensory array in order to measure at multiple points  a distributed sensor on the other hand is capable of collecting data along the entirety of its length, thereby increasing the spatial resolution and amount of data that is collected  specialized fiber optic sensors utilize distributed sensor technology to collect temperature, ground deformation, and acoustic data depending on the desired information  this project comprises the deployment of fibers capable of sensing all three targeted signal modifiers: temperature (distributed temperature sensing, or dts), ground deformation (distributed strain and temperature sensing, or dst), and vibrations (distributed acoustic sensing, or das)   although these technologies have been used successfully in other industries, they have yet to be adopted in the mining industry due to risk associated with investing in expensive equipment that may not provide satisfactory results  the main purpose of this project is to deploy dst fiber optic system at the underground mining education center (umec) located on the montana tech campus in butte montana, and show that it can survive in the underground environment and provide good data, thereby demonstrating its potential to contribute to mine safety | 
2017-0946 	 characterization of the peak strength of rough rock joints using limited displacement multi-stage direct shear tests |abstract: current standard multi-stage direct shear test methods for rock joints do not consider the individually unique asperity profile and nature of the testing specimens  these techniques require either the shearing of a single sample under multiple normal loads, or the shearing of individual “similar” specimens also under multiple normal loads  “similar” specimens of natural rock joints with identical asperity profiles are extremely difficult or impossible to locate, and continuous shearing of the same specimen causes damage to the asperity profile which will impact successive test data  seeking to minimize this testing-inherent error, previous research at montana tech has demonstrated the alternate method of limited displacement multi-stage direct shear (ldmds) testing to yield more accurate strength parameters when shearing a single unique specimen under multiple normal stresses  the ldmds test procedure minimizes initial shear displacement and corresponding specimen surface damage, allowing the specimen to more closely retain its original asperity and strength profile as observed via undamaged single-stage testing  replicas of a granitic rock joint (specimen m3) were cast with type iii cement and sheared at normal stresses of 90, 180, and 270 kpa via standard multi-stage, ldmds, and undamaged single-stage methods  average friction angle (<u+03c6>) and joint shear intercept (sj) values yielded by ldmds tests (<u+03c6> = 45°, sj = 49 kpa) were significantly more similar to values calculated by undamaged single-stage tests (<u+03c6> = 51°, sj = 22 kpa), as compared to the standard multistage parameters which, as expected, produced a significantly underestimated friction angle (<u+03c6> = 22°) and overestimated joint shear intercept (sj = 100 kpa)   1  introduction  obtaining accurate shear strength parameters for rock mass discontinuities through the use of direct shear tests is of critical importance to the design of safe slopes and underground openings  evaluation of the standard mohr-coulomb strength parameters (joint friction angle and joint shear strength intercept) requires determination of the shear strength at a minimum of three different normal stress values | 
2017-0957 	 induced stresses and srv calculation near a hydraulic fracture in the naturally fractured reservoir |abstract: the effectiveness of a hydraulic fracturing technology has been primarily attributed to the geometry of the primary fracture  this concept however has been challenged particularly in low-permeability formations in which the srv creation becomes the most important issue  unlike the primary fracture, the area in the srv is controlled by the fundamental geomechanics behavior of the formation and secondary fracture propagation with possible different modes, and more importantly by the induced stresses near the primary fracture  in this paper, the induced stresses near a hydraulic fracture in a pure elastic, poroelastic single and dual-porosity media are analyzed and compared in order to characterize the low-permeability, sandstone and fractured formations, respectively   1  introduction  hydraulic fracturing has been widely applied in the petroleum industries effectively in the past a few decades and is showing great potential in the geothermal extraction in hot dry rock (hdr) formations  a hydraulically created fracture can be used to transport oil or gas from adjacent formation far away from a wellbore and productivity can be enhanced significantly by such a fast flow channel  this process however may be compromised by the fact of that the permeability in the formation may not be improved, particularly when it can be reduced due to stress changes induced in the vicinity of the fracture created  the evaluation on the range of the stimulated reservoir volume (srv) and the enhanced permeability radius (epr) subsequently become a critical issue in the design and development of hydraulic fracturing technology  such an issue become increasingly important in low-permeability reservoir and naturally fractured formations, where permeability inside the formation is extremely sensitive to the stresses induced and therefore critically controlling the success of a fracturing project  in this paper a hydraulic fracture inside a naturally fractured formation is simulated  stresses in the vicinity of the fracture and the displacement on the fracture surface are calculated  our objective is to analyze the stresses change and their impact on the permeability inside the formation so that their ultimate role on productivity in a hydraulic fractured well can be quantified  flow in naturally fractured aquifers is normally characterized and modeled by the well-known sugar cubic model proposed by barenblatt et al , [1960] and warren and root, [1963]  extensive studies follow by mixture theory focusing on stress-sensitivity and loosely geomechanics coupling [wilson and aifantis, 1982, beskos and aifantis, 1986, huyakorn and pinder, 1983, elworth and bai, 1992, bai et al 1993, nair et al  2005] and by an alternatively conventional reservoir-geomechanics coupling model following biot’s theory, respectively [biot, 1941, duguid and lee, 1977, vallianppan and khalili-naghadeh, 1990, khalili-naghadh and valianppan, 1996, 1996, chen and teufel, 1997]  focusing on a single phase and isothermal condition with a constant fracture-matrix transfer coefficient case, the general coupling formulations in deformable poroelastic media with dual porosity, the general numerical procedure, and stresses and deformation inside a hydraulic fracture and in the vicinity of the fracture inside the naturally fractured formation are presented | 
2017-0962 	 mechanical, hydraulic and seismological behavior of crystalline rock as a response to hydraulic fracturing at the grimsel test site |abstract: several meter-scale hydraulic fracturing (hf) tests (total 12 hfs in three different boreholes) were conducted in the crystalline rock mass of the grimsel test site (gts), switzerland, as part of a stress characterization survey prior to an in-situ stimulation and circulation (isc) experiment  the main goal of this stress measurement campaign was to estimate the magnitude and orientation of the in-situ principal stresses, to understand the variation of the minimum stress towards existing shear zones, and to estimate the jacking pressure required to open existing fractures  in this study, the effect of mini-hfs on permeability of the experimental volume has been quantified via conducting a series of low pressure (< 1 mpa) conventional hydraulic tests, such as pressure pulse and constant rate injection tests before and after each hydraulic fracturing test  the results reveal a variety of hydraulic responses for different stimulated intervals  for most of the hf intervals, the results suggest an increase in transmissivity of up to two orders of magnitude as well as an increase of the non-integer flow dimension  the hydraulic results were then compared with micro-seismicity measurements during each hf test in order to link the hydraulic response to the extension and geometry of the stimulated volume obtained from microseismic clouds  the number of seismic events was found to correlate well with the injected volume and permeability enhancement  this comparison also suggests that the geometry of the stimulated volume as inferred from hydraulic test methods is consistent with the volume inferred from microseismicity   1  introduction  energy extraction from deep subsurface reservoirs has become a common practice during the last century  the accumulated subsurface energy has been stored in various forms, such as oil/gas and heat  in order to produce these resources economically, the reservoir should have sufficient hydraulic conductivity and connectivity toward the production well  however, the in-situ hydraulic conductivity of the rocks typically decreases with depth (e g , rutqvist and stephansson, 2003) which reduces the productivity of the reservoir  numerous stimulation techniques have been used to increase the hydraulic conductivity of the low-permeable reservoirs such as rock solution using acid (muecke, 1982; economides et al , 2000) and rock fracturing using hydraulic/thermal stimulation (economides et al , 2000; evans et al , 2005)  acid stimulation is usually used in the oil and gas industry to enhance the injectivity and productivity of the wellbore in the near field (i e  meter scale)  however, in order to increase the hydraulic conductivity of the reservoir at remote locations, hydraulic stimulation (i e , the injection of fluids under high pressure) has become the most common practice, especially in the geothermal industry  although not considered in this study, it should be mention that the hydraulic stimulation will have a thermal component as soon as non-isothermal fluid with respect to the in-situ temperature is injected into the reservoir | 
2017-0966 	 a quantitative microstructural investigation of depleted and undepleted reservoir sandstones |abstract: we conduct a quantitative microstructural investigation of slochteren sandstones recovered from the groningen gas reservoir in the ne netherlands, aiming to identify the micromechanical processes controlling inelastic strain accommodation  core samples were provided by the nederlandse aardolie maatschappij (nam), from the stedum (sdm)-1 and zeerijp (zrp)-3a wells, respectively drilled before and after gas depletion in 1965 and 2015  sectioned samples were imaged using a scanning electron microscope for constructing section-scale, backscattered electron micrograph mosaics, which were interpreted by manual grain tracing and image processing to obtain digital phase and crack maps  digitization of the sandstone microstructure in this way yields data on grain mineralogy, shape, (contact) size and orientation, as well as on coordination number and crack density and orientation  we investigated ways to improve the microstructural digitization method, including preparation of thin sections using au vapor deposition, injection of copper sulphate (cuso4) at elevated pressure, and etching using hydrogen fluoride (hf)  finally, an image analysis method was developed to enable semi-automatic phase/ crack mapping, which we first applied to a layered sample from the zrp-3a core  comparison of phase/ crack maps of layered sandstone samples may provide the key to help identify the processes controlling pore pressure depletion-induced compaction   1  introduction  hydrocarbon production causes changes in the effective stress state of the reservoir rock, frequently leading to compaction (geertsma, 1957; segall and fitzgerald, 1998; hettema et al , 2000) and surface subsidence (geertsma, 1973; nagel, 2001; doornhof et al , 2006), causing major economic damage and social upheaval (e g  chan and zoback, 2007; muntendam-bos and de waal, 2015)  models predicting surface subsidence rely on constitutive relations describing compaction  linear poroelastic compaction models are frequently insufficient (hettema et al , 2002; van thienen-visser et al , 2015), suggesting that inelastic processes also play a role  an improved understanding of the strain-accommodating processes operating on the grain-scale, and how this scales to reservoir compaction, is necessary for adequate forecasting of surface subsidence | 
2017-0968 	 in-situ characterization of backfill at mechanized driven tunnels in hard rock using a novel testing device - first applications |abstract: when shield tbms in hard rock conditions are applied, pea gravel is used to fill the gap between lining and rock mass  a sound knowledge of the deformation properties is required as only the backfill is considered to be relevant for the bedding effectiveness  at present, no measurement method for the in situ determination of these parameters is available  based on the static load plate test a prototype for the in situ determination of the deformation properties of pea gravel has been designed and manufactured  the stiffness of the backfilled material can be calculated using the recorded measurement data of applied force and load plate displacement  first tests under controlled laboratory conditions confirm the suitability of the presented testing method  furthermore, the test results have been verified using two independent testing methods  thereby, the results show that used stiffness parameters in the design stages are generally overestimated  this research focuses on the evaluation of the laboratory tests and verification tests   1  introduction  at mechanized driven tunnels, using single or double shield tbms (s-tbm/ds-tbm), prefabricated lining segments are used as outer lining  thereby, the load-carrying rings are assembled within the protection of the shield  due to the construction method, a gap between lining and rock (i e  excavation boundary) exists after an installed ring leaves the shield tail  this so-called annular gap needs to be backfilled using a suitable material in order to allow for load transfer  ideally, the occurring rock loads are evenly distributed  in terms of tunneling in hard rock, a fine grained and closely graded gravel, termed as pea gravel, is used as backfill  thereby, injection into the annular gap is performed pneumatically through radial openings in the lining segments  the invert area is backfilled using a pea gravel-mortar-mixture   in the german speaking area, the lining design is mainly carried out using the bedded frame model method  thereby, the bedding modulus (kr) expresses the interaction between lining and rock mass being simulated by radial bedding springs  the bedding modulus is usually calculated using the stiffness of the ground (es,g) and the theoretical radius of the lining (r) as shown in eq  (1)  according to eq  (2), the radial bedding stress (<u+03c3>r) can be calculated using a linear relationship between the radial displacements (ur) and the bedding modulus  however, this simple linear relationship does not fully cover neither the ground-structure interaction, nor any stiffness differences between backfill and rock mass (behnen et al , 2012) | 
2017-0969 	 well landing zone decisions in unconventional plays: a rock mechanistic approach |abstract: revisiting the fundamentals of hydraulic fracturing theory has assisted in rebuilding a log-based methodology that estimates the likelihood of vertical fracture growth  the suggested method can be used as a quick screening tool to support landing zone decisions in unconventional plays  the workflow combines the essential elements of fracture mechanics for rock mechanical applications to provide a more realistic vision of how a hydraulically induced fracture may grow in the vertical dimension  it incorporates the use of a density log, a log-derived stress profile along with the elastic properties, and the injection pressure to estimate the probability of fracture growth vertically through horizontal bedding planes  the workflow can identify a preferred landing zone for horizontal wells, or alternatively, preferred perforation intervals in the case of vertical wells  the paper illustrates two case studies in shale formations that assess the advantages and limitations of the suggested approach   1  introduction  the determination of well landing zone for horizontal wells or the selection of perforation intervals for vertical wells is a critical decision in unconventional plays  traditionally in highly permeable formations, rock properties such as porosity and hydrocarbon saturation were adequate for targeting a high quality reservoir  in tight formations with ultra-low permeability, well stimulation is required to improve reservoir conductivity  this warrants accessing the reservoir beyond the borehole via creating hydraulic fractures  in such cases, perforations need to carefully be placed in order to enhance fracture initiation and propagation within a good reservoir quality interval  the problem is graphically shown in fig 1   choosing appropriate landing zone will also assist stimulation design optimization and well pad arrangement in the next stages of field development  the ultimate goal is to achieve well completions with consistent and repeatable fracture geometries with dimensions that maximize accessibility to, and recovery from these tight unconventional reservoirs to deliver profitable long-term production operations (e g , azad et al , 2017) | 
2017-0973 	 geomechanical analysis of fault reactivation due to hydraulic fracturing |abstract: felt induced seismicity due to hydraulic fracturing has been observed at many fields in the past few years  though spatial and temporal correlations establish the link between hydraulic fracturing activities and felt induced seismicity, the underlying stress/pressure change mechanisms that cause fault reactivation are unclear  this study reports a systematic analysis of several felt induced seismicity field observations using geomechanical models to understand the mechanisms that cause the fault reactivation  the field observations indicate that felt induced seismicity occurs at 100s of meters to few kms away from the wellbore and there is a time delay of hours to days  the numerical modeling results of hydraulic fracturing in a low permeability homogeneous medium show that stress and pressure changes attenuate rapidly with distance, unable to explain reasons for the felt induced seismicity at few kms away from the wellbore  also wells in close proximity, completed similarly produce vastly different seismicity, indicating that local heterogeneity is important  an alternative mechanism, such as a direct hydraulic connection between a hydraulic fracture and fault, found to be consistent with the field observations  the insights gained from the numerical modeling of fracture fault interaction models can be used to develop felt induced seismicity mitigation plans   1  introduction  it is well known that microseismic events (magnitudes of <u+2212>2 and <u+2212>3), which are not felt at the earth’s surface, are created by hydraulic fracturing and that knowledge is used to identify the extent of stimulation  however, felt induced seismic events (magnitude > 2 5) due to hydraulic fracturing have historically been rare, with only 70 felt events for 3 million hydraulic fractures up to early 2010s (us national academy, 2012)  also, felt induced seismicity due to hydraulic fracturing has been observed in many unconventional plays in recent years  the magnitude 3 8 event in year 2011 in the united kingdom (de pater and baisch, 2011), magnitude 3 0 event in year 2013 in ohio (skoumal et al , 2015) and magnitude >4 events in alberta and british columbia in years 2013-2016 (schultz et al , 2017, bc o&g commission, 2012 and 2014) are some of the recent examples of felt induced seismicity due to hydraulic fracturing | 
2017-0974 	 adaptive finite element modeling of structure and stress evolution in regions experiencing transtensional deformation |abstract: the evolution of regions exhibiting strike-slip deformation has been explored extensively in bench scale modeling studies [1], [2]  in such studies, analogue materials are used to represent the constitutive behaviour of rocks - typically graded sand is used to represent brittle sediments and silicon polymer gum is used to represent viscous, creeping rheologies e g  decollements  via modifying boundary conditions, such experiments are able to study pure strike-slip deformation as well as introduce components of transtension and transpression  the experiments are quite successful in their ability to replicate structures associated with these deformational regimes e g  flower structures, pull-apart basins, pop-up anticlines  via newer interrogation methods some quantitative information regarding displacement and strain may be extracted  regions experiencing transtension typically exhibit regions of strike-slip faulting juxtaposed with extensional structures - grabens and normal faults  these observations are indicative of a complex and potentially non-intuitive stress state which locally may be very different from the ‘regional’ stress state  numerical modelling offers the opportunity to obtain quantitative information regarding stress, temperature, pore pressure and material state which may be used to assist in planning for exploration and production in such complex regions  however, application of geomechanical modelling to study the evolution of stress in transcurrent settings is limited, likely due to the large deformation, difficult treatment of model boundaries, and the requirement for a fully 3d representation  this paper explores large deformation in transtensional settings using a finite-strain, adaptive finite element code – elfen fm  the study outlines the underlying computational framework and specifically technology that is used to treat the boundary of the presented models  the adopted material models are described in detail  the models are fully three-dimensional and information regarding the stress and material state both temporally and spatially is shown and discussed  the implications of the findings for exploration and production are emphasised  submodelling techniques are additionally used to demonstrate how the regional stress state can be used to define higher resolution models for detailed local studies | 
2017-0976 	 a novel approach to predict collapse volume using image processing |abstract: ensuring wellbore stability is of major importance during any well completion  wellbore collapse as a result of severe borehole breakouts represents a major problem in many cases  in order to quantify the risk associated to wellbore collapse a reliable estimate of the collapse volume is necessary  in this study, a novel approach determining the area/volume of collapse failure by using image processing techniques, is presented  the image processing matches results from exemplary data sets, based on a mohr coulomb failure criterion, where an analytical solution exists  since image processing can be applied to any result set, the proposed approach is independent of any failure criterion and very versatile  the determination of breakout width and collapse volume can be used as a proactive tool to estimate the required minimum mud pressure to minimize the resulting collapse volume   1  introduction  the obvious goal for drilling operators is to drill economical, safe, and stable wells by reducing the non-productive time (npt) due to borehole problems such as stuck pipe  a key issue for successful drilling operations in geomechanically challenging zones is considering all relevant factors including—formation strength properties, in-situ stresses, pore pressure, and applied pressure by the drilling mud  if collected, these data sets of rock strength and stress can be used to generate a mechanical earth model (mem; e g  goodman and connolly, 2007; kristiansen, 2007; gholami et al , 2014)  once the mem is validated, it can be used to predict applications such as wellbore stability (cheatham, 1984; kaushik et al , 2016; alkamil et al , 2017)   one common source of data for stress determination is based on the analysis of borehole breakouts (fjaer, 1992)  there are different methods for breakout identification such as the conventional four and six arms caliper logs, micro-resistivity logs, and borehole image logs (e g  tingay et al , 2008)  while these log based data sets are commonly used to infer the orientation of the maximum horizontal stress, sh (aadnoy and looyeh, 2011), and can be used to estimate the magnitude of sh (zoback, 2010), the occurrence of breakouts can also be used to calculate the collapse volume, either analytically using the kirsch equations or numerically utilizing finite element analysis (chatterjee and mukhopadhyay, 2003)  one recently presented analytical method approximates the caving area to the area of a triangle and uses the caliper reading as an indicator of the breakout radius (escobar et al , 2014)  however, as also shown in their study, when compared to a numerical model predicting the area of borehole failure, a significant discrepancy of 27% between the analytical and numerical solution remains | 
2017-0979 	 size effect and fracture: a discrete modeling perspective |abstract: because of the presence of fracture process zone, fractures in quasi-brittle materials are structural size dependent  this is also the underlying reason for the ductile to brittle failure mode transition when the structure size increases  an exponential displacement-softening model was introduced via contact bonds in the bonded discrete element representation of continuums  this facilitated the dem modeling of micro-cracks ahead of crack tip, and thus capturing the fracture process zone  a regularization of softening parameters based on fracture energy and particle size was also introduced to reduce the impacts of particle size  direct tension tests were carried out to investigate fracture process and size effect of mode-i fracture on similar single edge notched beams  a wide range of structure size was used, which was reflected in the depth of beams being used spanning from 1 mm to 2000 mm  these beams are constructed using 2d uniform circular particles packed in square arrangement  results show that the present dem model is capable of capturing the size effects, and the ductile to brittle failure mode transition was captured  the changes of the maximum nominal stresses with structural sizes were also well modeled by the general size effect law proposed by bazant and pfeiffer   1  introduction  the bonded-particle model (bpm) developed by potyondy and cundall (2004) makes it possible to model fracture in the discrete element method  a bond between a pair of particles breaks if the stress reaches the bond strength  as a bond breaks, fracture is formed and a sustained loading would lead to the propagation of macroscopic crack  bpm has been widely used for rock failure analysis (potyondy and cundall, 2004; hazzard et al , 2000; fakhimi, 2004; al-busaidi et al , 2005; cho et al , 2007; zhao et al , 2007; park and song, 2009; xia and zhou, 2010; zhang and wong, 2012, 2013; galouei and fakhimi, 2015)  but most of these simulations focused on macroscopic strength of intact samples, and only a few of them were focused on fracture process and related properties | 
2017-0985 	 earth stress and seismic hazard from the size-frequency distribution of seismic events |abstract: an important component of being able to assess the hazard associated with naturally-occurring or induced earthquakes, is a prediction of the likelihood and size of the largest earthquake that could occur in a region  the size-frequency distribution of seismic events, also known as the b value is found to be consistent globally since the seismology community has been measuring and maintaining earthquake data; for this general population of earthquakes b=1  the fact that the b value can vary when earthquake population subsets are made by time, location, and method of occurrence, has led workers to seek a causal relationship to explain that variability by suggesting parameters related to earth stress, hypocenter depth, fluid pumping rate (in the case of induced earthquakes), for example  this paper uses three case studies to propose that the main determinant of the b value is the pre-existing fault and fracture character of the regional geology  showing this relationship to be true allows the use of surface and subsurface geological mapping to serve as a proxy for earthquake occurrence and prediction of seismic hazard   1  introduction  the parameter b (gutenberg and richter, 1942) that describes the size-frequency distribution of earthquakes is equal to 1 when considering a global catalog of earthquakes  the b value can be greater than or less than 1 when analyzing subsets of earthquake populations by depth (mori and abercrombe, 1997, gerstenberger et al , 2001), time (el-isa and eaton, 2013, el-isa, 2013), or stress regime (schorlemmer et al, 2005, farrell et al 2009)  for microseismicity populations from wellbore stimulation treatments b values as high as 2 are commonly observed (maxwell et al, 2011, wessels et al, 2011)  most of the correlative relationships explored in prior work ignore the impact of pre-existing heterogeneities in the geological setting of the earthquakes, except for the obvious relationship of large earthquakes to large existing faults  in contrast, langenbruch and shapiro (2013) addressed the pre-existing structure by modeling the b value is impacted when modeling rock failure a fractally-heterogeneous volume  if the b value can be shown to be characteristic of the structural setting in which prior tectonic faulting styles define the geometry of earth heterogeneities, it could prove to be a useful tool for predicting induced earthquake hazard in previously aseismic areas and in areas where seismicity was very low prior to the start of earthquake-inducing activities | 
2017-0987 	 simulating two-phase flow coupled to geomechanics in fractured reservoirs by petrov-galerkin finite element method  |abstract: simulating pressure changes and production processes in natural fractured formations has been commonly performed by the classic dual-porosity model  geomechanics can be crucial for pressure change and production as both formation deformation and locally induced stresses may contribute to skeleton deformation and the pressure change thus production significantly, particularly in low-permeability and fractured formations  multiphase flow in both the matrix and fractured system can significantly affect the production and pressure results, particularly near a wellbore or a hydraulic fracture  the key parts on developing this model are to come up an efficient algorithm and to define the parameters characterizing the geomechanics coupling to the flow on top of the explicit coupling to the saturation, where upstream weighting normally is applied  the proposed algorithm coupled the pressures from both system with the corresponding volumetric strain and subsequently explicitly coupled to the saturation  both a generalized galerkin and petrov-galerkin finite methods are used in which mixed quadratic and linear shape functions are implemented respectively for the displacement and pressures, yet only quadratic weighting function is used in the calculation of saturation and for the entire weighting function  a unique weighting function with different p-g coefficient is also proposed and tested for saturation calculation  results for saturation and pore pressure near a wellbore during a pressurization are generated and discussed, simulating fracturing process in naturally fractured reservoirs   1  introduction  flow in naturally fractured reservoirs is normally characterized and modeled by the well-known sugar cubic model proposed by barenblatt et al , [1960] and warren and root, [1963]  extensive studies follow by mixture theory focusing on stress-sensitivity and loosely geomechanics coupling [wilson and aifantis, 1982, beskos and aifantis, 1986, huyakorn and pinder, 1983, elworth and bai, 1992, bai et al 1993] and by an alternatively conventional reservoir-geomechanics coupling model following biot’s theory [biot, 1941, duguid and lee, 1977, vallianppan and khalili-naghadeh, 1990, khalili-naghadh and valianppan, 1996, 1996, chen and teufel, 1997]  following vallianppan and khalili-naghadeh, 1996, chen and teufel [1997], an extended biot theory coupled the fluid flow to deformation is proposed and implemented  those critical parameters between stresses and pore pressure and the deformation coupled between pore volume, bulk volume, porous matrix, solid particle, and fractured volume are highlighted  studies on dual porosity model have been extended into two phase flows [nair et al , 2005, bai et al , 1999] by a mixture theory  following wang and chen [2001] in which only a single poroelastic model is proposed, a two phase flow model with extended biot formulation will be the focus in this paper  two phase flow during hydraulic fracturing in a fractured formation is of great interest to engineers in petroleum engineering and hydrogeology  both the over-all production and flow back fluid after a fracturing job are heavily depending on the saturation change near a hydraulic fracture or in the vicinity of a wellbore  coupling to geomechanics is another important aspect of the issues in the naturally fractured reservoirs  a generalized finite element approach with an extended galerkin method in which the weighting function consistent with the shape function in pore pressures are used is implemented  a general formulation with four pore pressures and one bulk displacement as the primary variables are presented  results from an approximated formulation in which an average pore pressure in each medium is used by adding two mass balance equations for different phase, i e  water and oil are presented  saturation calculation is validated by an analytical solution | 
2017-0991 	 neutron diffraction measurement of pore pressure influence on lattice strains in geological materials |abstract: the laboratory experiments typically performed to measure poroelastic properties evaluate the macroscopic deformation of samples  while these techniques are adequate for capturing bulk effects, they fail to capture fine detail related to the actual deformation of constituent mineral phases because the measurement captures the combined effect of pore network geometry change and polymineralic deformation  a more precise measurement of mineral deformation in fluid saturated porous media has the potential to improve understanding of poroelastic behavior and material failure where pore pressure is present   neutron diffraction has emerged as a unique and powerful technique for measuring the localized lattice strains of mineral phases inside of geological materials  the highly penetrating nature of neutrons also permits interrogation of the interior regions of geological samples even when they are contained in otherwise difficult to access or opaque structures such as pressure vessels  this paper summarizes a set of neutron diffraction experiments that were performed with geological materials of varying porosity and permeability using a custom-designed triaxial pressure cell  the results confirm that neutron diffraction has the potential to become a useful tool for quantifying the behavior of distinct crystalline phases within porous media   1  introduction  poroelastic behavior in rock mechanics has been studied in great detail since the foundational works of terzaghi and biot (biot, 1941)  there have been a number of prior efforts focused on experimental measurement of poroelastic parameters, including comparative approaches (lion et al, 2004)  the classical biot formulation of poroelastic constants used to represent bulk material response may also be represented as combinations of distinct elastic moduli related to material porosity, grain compressibility, and pore fluid compressibility (gassman, 1951)  this formulation is useful for calculating expected property variation for changes in pore, matrix or fluid composition  these component moduli can be individually measured in a straight-forward manner via traditional drained, undrained and unjacketed tests when isotropic assumptions are made  the measurements result in an overdetermined number of poroelastic parameters and so some work has attempted to develop procedures for fitting moduli to the obtain the traditional four poroelastic parameters for the isotropic material system (hart and wang 1995; hart and wang, 2001) | 
2017-0994 	 monitoring the growth of hydraulic fractures with fiber optic strain technology |abstract: tracking the development of hydraulic fracture (hf) propagation in the laboratory and in the field has always been difficult, especially in cases where multiple hfs are propagating simultaneously  a new method is presented using fiber optic (fo) technology to monitor the hydraulic fracturing process during real time  the method has been proven using fo cables ‘woven’ in a grid pattern and cast inside 46 cm (18 inch) cubic blocks of cement  some of these blocks were then placed in a large cubic polyaxial load frame and subjected to a true triaxial state of stress during the fracturing operation  the fo cable acts essentially as a long continuous ‘strain gage’ in the direction of the cable  as a hf propagates across each fo cable segment it sharply strains each one  this process allows a real time tracking of the position of the growing hydraulic fracture crack tip during testing  the technique is being used to track single hfs, multiple hfs, and leak- off haloes in polyaxial hf block testing   1  introduction  most of the technologies employed in the laboratory to track the propagation of single fractures involve acoustic active techniques such as: (1) pulse transmission through the crack (stanchits et al , 2012); (2) pulse-echo off the crack itself (glaser and hand, 1998); (3) diffraction off the crack tip (glaser and hand, 1998; de pater et al , 2001); (4) shear wave shadowing (dudley et al , 1995 and de pater et al , 2001); and (5) velocity tomography (scott and abousleiman, 2005)  acoustic emission, a passive technology, also has been used to track the evolution of hydraulic fractures (hfs) (scott et al , 2000)   each of these techniques was considered when undertaking a laboratory rock mechanics research project to track the evolution of simultaneously propagating hydraulic fractures during polyaxial block testing  preliminary attempts were made with acoustic emission and some of the ultrasonic pulse techniques  all the acoustic technologies were eventually rejected for use because they have the same inherent problem - if more than two fractures are propagating side by side then the outer fractures effectively ‘shield’ the inner fractures from being accurately detected  this is due to attenuation, wave splitting, and the complex diffraction patterns of waves created by passing through and reflecting off of multiple fractures | 
2017-1000 	 prediction of minimal rock mass grouting pressure based on newton’s second law and principles of fracture mechanics |abstract: though employing low grouting pressure in rock mass results in a decrease of length of grout penetration and ends up with an incomplete grouting process, conversely, high grouting pressure may cause undesired fracture initiation  hence, prediction of minimum required rock mass grouting pressure to overcome these two consequences is crucial  the paper describes an application of newton’s second law along with the principles of fracture mechanics to predict the minimal rock mass grouting pressure for khairabad earth dam rock foundation in iran  the results of quality control of post grouting based on drilling of the grouted rock mass at the dam foundation revealed that, further grouting information is required to verify the applicability and credibility of the proposed method   1  introduction  rock mass grouting is used to fill the joints, voids, cavities of porous and discontinuous media to provide improved continuity and strength properties  the resulting continuous rock mass exhibits significantly reduced deformability and hydraulic conductivity yet revealing increased strength properties and load baring capacity   an evaluation of rock mass grouting by proper interpretation of the grouting procedure and grouting performance requires a reliable design-construction criterion by which one can consider the extent of grout penetration and the time to be stopped  to achieve these, a predictive mathematical tool is required  hence, the paper presents an analytical method to predict the minimal required rock mass grouting pressure   2  a new proposed method for determination of minimal rock mass grouting pressure  in the course of rock mass grouting, there are two major sources of forces which act upon grout particles; the clockwise force that is exerted by the grout pump source, and the force that initiated due to joint’s walls or surfaces friction which acts upon grout particles counter clockwise  the later force may halt the grout movement, if it exceeds the pumping force  in other words, the grout particles motions or their stops are merely dependent upon the resultant or the net force of these two sources | 
2017-1004 	 heterogeneity and damage mapping in geomechanical evaluation of a shallow reservoir sandstone using x-ray ct imaging |abstract: this study reports on strength measurements performed on sandstone samples from a shallow offshore field and is part of a larger petrophysical evaluation including static and dynamic elastic properties under various stress conditions  the samples tested were retrieved from three one-foot-long preserved core sections spanning a depth range of about 20 meters  for each depth, three types of mechanical tests were performed: brazilian tensile test, unconfined compression test (ucs) and confined compression test with ultrasonic wave velocity monitoring along and perpendicular to the plug axis  the mechanical data are augmented with x-ray ct image volumes acquired pre-test and post-test in order to elucidate some of the observations as well as to outline possible elements of a laboratory workflow that would comprise image-based heterogeneity assessment and prediction  we emphasize in particular the fact that if such workflow is to be standardized, care should be taken in acquiring properly calibrated plug scale x-ray images in order to allow heterogeneity quantification and its use as an input into future predictive models   1  introduction  geomechanical testing of rock samples in the laboratory is typically limited in that every measurement accounts for the sample behavior as a whole with seldom acknowledgement of its internal degree of preexisting or induced heterogeneity  preexisting heterogeneities such as mechanically weak layers in strongly laminated rocks may cause early failure  this effect, which causes a rock to behave in a strongly anisotropic fashion since the weaker surfaces need to be presented at an appropriate angle to the maximum stress to fail, is exemplified with the data of figure 1 borrowed from paterson and wong [1]  in order for such an effect to be predicted, weak layers need to be identified, which involves imaging since no bulk measurement such as porosity, density or composition is able to capture that information  on the other hand, induced heterogeneity such as localized shear bands formed during brittle failure is known to strongly impact fluid flow, and cannot be accurately predicted in terms of e g  number, thickness and orientation  nondestructive 3d imaging greatly complements laboratory measurements by providing access to the internal make-up of a rock at various stages of a test  moreover, it does seem sensible to expect that a core plug will often exhibit some degree of heterogeneity, as plug dimensions are not determined based on an assessment of the representative elementary volume (rev) for the material of interest | 
2017-1005 	 slope stability enhancement through slope monitoring data interpretation |abstract: slope stability and maximum productivity are critical to the success of any open pit mine  to achieve a profitable balance of the two, the slope has to be steep enough to minimize waste stripping and gentle enough to ensure slope stability  one means to this end is careful interpretation of slope monitoring data  this paper presents a real life case study of a platinum open pit mine which had been plagued with slope stability challenges and how slope monitoring data interpretation techniques were used to restore and enhance stability  through monitoring data analysis the investigation identified that the hangingwall of the north pit of the mine showed progressive movement with maximum movement found to be 8 5 mm/day  this proved a hypothesis that there is a crack existing behind the slopes  routine inspections of the mine were done with the purpose to identify geological structures, hazardous conditions and review the quality of the highwall  the conditions of the footwalls were found to be fairly good and it is recommended that the same mining technique carried out when blasting trim benches in the footwall need to be carried out in hangingwall  the implementation of new technology in slope monitoring manages to solve slope failure challenges, however there is also need to optimise costs such that the most effective less costly technologies are implemented  in this light, this study highlights the practical applicability of different slope monitoring technologies including groundprobe slope stability radar, ibis radar systems and geomos   1  introduction  slope monitoring data is an asset an established open pit can utilize to gain insights into the stability of mine slopes  much value can be driven from the data when it is accurately interpreted  well considered slope monitoring data interpretation is the bases for sound slope management as noted by several researchers (afeni and cawood (2013), hearn (2011), read and stacey (2009), hutchinson et al (2007), leonardos (2004), hustrulid et al (2000) among others)  safety and maximum productivity are key goals for any mining operation  in open pit mining, the slope has to be steep enough to allow maximum productivity and gentle enough to allow safe mining   the overall slope angle of a pit has direct influence on the cost of a mine, the steeper the pit angle the cheaper to mine, but also means higher probability of failure (little, 2006)  the slope angle has to be designed in such a way that it is safe and economic to mine  well considered slope monitoring data interpretation becomes pivotal in achieving such a balance  slope monitoring during mining gives better understanding of rock behaviour and alerts mining personnel of impending failures  this study is based on an investigation done at an open pit platinum mine and practically illustrates how enhanced slope stability can be achieved through careful slope monitoring data interpretation | 
2017-1006 	 influence of faults and natural fractures on fracture stimulation in the vaca muerta formation using full 3d modeling |abstract: the role of faults and natural fractures on hydraulic fracture stimulation in the vaca muerta play, of the neuquen basin, argentina, is investigated using a 3d, fully coupled, fracture and fluid flow simulator  during the development of the vaca muerta shale, and due to the complex nature of the geology and geomechanical conditions of the play, well interference has been observed while pumping a vertical well  microseismic events recorded during stimulation show a map-view “z” pattern that has not been observed before and potentially identifies a trend of preexisting natural fractures/faults striking ne-sw and nw-sw, and steeply dipping that could hydraulically connect adjacent wells  we used a 3d coupled flow and geomechanical simulator to evaluate the geometric characteristics and material and fault properties that could produce well interference using the field parameters utilized during the stimulation operations in the study pad, and that would produce comparable synthetic microseismicity  simulation results show that fluid pressure can communicate through sufficiently conductive faults for relatively long distances between 300 m and 700 m  in the case investigated here, hydraulic fractures can be arrested by faults and reinitiate from its tip  fracture height growth exceeds the estimated propped height, consistent with the distribution of microseismicity  results also indicate that the microseismic event cloud distribution follows large-scale structures, and therefore the presence of conductive faults could explain the well interference problems observed in the field   1  introduction  the vast majority of the oil-and-gas-bearing reservoirs in the world contain rock discontinuities such as faults and fractures (bratton et al , 2005) that affect how fluid is distributed in the reservoir  the properties of the faults and the rock surrounding them, such as fault gouge, fluid pressure, fluid types, lateral sedimentary facies variations, reservoir architecture, and stresses, dictate whether faults act as barriers or transmitters of fluid flow (barr, 2007) | 
2017-1011 	 case study: rock slope remediation at mayo ‘a’ powerhouse, yukon, canada |abstract: the mayo ‘a’ powerhouse was constructed in 1951 and has brought clean efficient power to the central yukon since this time  the powerhouse at mayo was constructed adjacent to a 70 m high heterogeneous rock and soil slope with minimal catchment between the slope and the powerhouse building  following a series of near misses and actual impacts from rock fall onto the roof and sidewall of the building, tetra tech were commissioned to assess and remediate the rock fall hazard  to mitigate the hazard in such a spatially constrained site, with critical infrastructure both at the base and on the slope, required a departure from the traditional scaling and remediation approach  instead, a staged construction and hazard mitigation schedule was adopted, requiring a number of innovative techniques and solutions  the resulting design included the installation of a passive mesh system around very unstable masses of poor quality rock, prior to the construction of a catch fence, and use of a construction chute for scaling of rock immediately above the powerhouse  this paper details some of the unique challenges and solutions adopted on this site, allowing for successful construction completion within three months of initial assessment   1  introduction  mayo ‘a’ powerhouse is part of the ‘mayo hydro facilities’ located approximately 5 km north of the town of mayo, yukon, canada  the facility is owned and operated by yukon energy corporation (yec), and provides reliable cost effective energy to customers throughout the yukon   the facility provides power to the yec grid, which connects a number of hydro facilities around the yukon, and provides power directly to the town of mayo   the original powerhouse, commissioned in 1951, remains, and was constructed adjacent to a 70 m high heterogeneous rock and soil slope with minimal catchment between the slope and the powerhouse building   during the spring of 2016, a series of rock fall events occurred, resulting in a number of near misses, and actual impacts to the roof and sidewall of the powerhouse  the damage caused, and the resulting repair work led to minor disruption to the plants operation, and highlighted the inadequacy of existing rock fall hazard mitigation measures existing up slope of the powerhouse | 
2017-1012 	 understanding stress reorientation process in shale gas play and its impact on refracturing time window |abstract: the potential of refracturing horizontal wells to boost production in unconventional gas development is getting more attention  after a refracturing candidate is identified based on a certain criteria, it is important to evaluate whether the planned fractures at the selected locations can propagate in the desired direction  hydraulic fractures generally propagate in the direction of maximum horizontal stress (relatively larger horizontal compression stress)  therefore the feasibility of refracturing can be evaluated based on the time-varying stress state or stress reorientation of the maximum and minimum horizontal stresses due to pre-existing fractures and subsequent production  to capture this stress change process, a numerical model with detailed formation layers based on poroelasticity is developed  the model includes some pre-existing sharp-tip fractures and the fracture geometries were estimated using a separate hydraulic fracture simulator  also the fracture surfaces are defined as contact pairs and allowed to contact or separate depending on the deformation continuity in the formation  several load steps are used in the model, which can subsequently calculate the in-situ stresses and overpressure in pay zone, stress state change due to pre-existing and new fractures’ openings, and the most concerned ones during fracture production process  the numerical model can capture the whole picture of stress reorientation process due to hydraulic fracture treatment and reservoir production  based on the stress change due to fracture opening and production rate, the right refracturing time window can be evaluated for planning new fractures at the desired locations  numerical sensitivity study to key parameters was conducted to understand their impacts on refracturing time window   1  introduction  during the past few decades, technology development of multistage hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling has significantly increased the reservoir contact for economic production of unconventional reservoirs  recent advances in hydraulic fracturing with slickwater fluid have resulted in economic production from shale gas reservoirs  effective fracturing can make low permeability shale gas reservoir economic because of a large volume of rock being stimulated  most horizontal shale gas wells will produce at a fraction of their initial rate after a certain production time, yet large volumes of hydrocarbon remain in the rock that could be produced through necessary and timely refracturing  the potential of refracturing shale gas reservoirs to boost production has been well understood recently [1-4] | 
2017-1014 	 strength characteristics of jointed rock matrixes with circular opening under triaxial compression |abstract: presence of fissures, faults and cuts of various types in rocks has considerable influence on shear parameters and modulus of elasticity of rocks under different confining pressures  every ground/rock mass has a preexisting stress state and we need to understand it, both directly and indirectly as the stress state is important from analysis and design point of view of civil engineering structures, mainly tunnels  this research work is an attempt to analyze the effect of pre-existing stress under varying confining pressures by artificially introducing the cracks, fissures pattern into rock mass by varying size of circular opening, their location pattern made in sandstones sample collected from two locations (rajasthan, dholpur and dhrangadhra gujarat )  the diameter of circular opening is 6 mm, 10mm and 14 mm, with horizontal cut and inclined cut of 200 into cylindrical rock specimen(45mm dia <u+00d7> 90mm height of sandstone)and sheared using rock triaxial test system to obtained true strength characteristics viz  shear parameters and modulus of elasticity  the paper contains comparison of shear parameters and modulus of elasticity of rock specimens with varying circular opening size, their relative heights, angle of cut and confining pressures for the sandstone specimen collected from different locations  the results were also compared with those for corresponding intact cylindrical rock specimens   1 introduction  rock differs from most other engineering materials in that it contains discontinuities such as joints, bedding planes, folds, sheared zones and faults which render its structure discontinuous  rock mechanics may be applied to many engineering applications ranging from dam abutments, to nuclear power station foundations, to the manifold methods of mining ore and aggregate materials, to the stability of petroleum wellbores and including newer applications such as geothermal energy and radioactive waste disposal   rock mechanics is mostly concerned with rock on the scale that appears in engineering and mining work, and so it might be regarded as the study of the properties and behavior of accessible rock due to changes in stresses or other conditions  two distinct problems are always involved: (i) the study of the orientations and properties of the joints, and (ii) the study of the properties and fabric of the rock between the joints  in any practical investigation in rock mechanics, the first stage is a geological and geophysical investigation to establish the lithologies and boundaries of the rock types involved  the different types of matrixes are available on site such as (1) polyhedral block (2) equidimensional block (3) prismatic block (4) tabular block (5) rhombohedral block (6) columnar block  in present investigation sandstone is used for laboratory investigation to know the shear and compression capacity of this rock samples with simplest matrix pattern viz | 
2017-1015 	 comparison of three source types for calibrating ae sensors used in fracture coalescence tests |abstract: fracture coalescence tests in rocks and rock-like materials have been extensively conducted in the laboratory over the past 40 years  its mechanism has not been fully understood  acoustic emission monitoring and moment tensor inversion technique cast a light in investigating the accumulation of micro-meso-scale fracture (damage) before the macro-fracture-propagation-stage of fracture coalescence  to this end, reliable sensor calibration is highly warranted to ensure the ae information is readily usable in moment tensor analysis  this paper presents and compares the calibration attempts by three types of sources, namely, breaking pencil lead source, ball drop source, and the source generated by the electrically energized piezoelectric sensor  by comparing these three source types for calibration, their advantages and disadvantages are identified  the ball drop source is the most suitable source among these three types of sources for the calibration in small scale prismatic rock blocks containing preexisting flaws for fracture coalescence tests  the polarity of the pencil lead source is its major disadvantage  the source generated by piezoelectric sensor has the highest repeatability among the three  however the aperture of the sensor and the strict requirement on the over-determined condition of the calibration equation system are the major problems in using it   1  introduction  fracture coalescence processes have been extensively studied in rocks and rock-like materials, e g  einstein and hirschfeld (1973), shen et al  (1995), bobet and einstein (1998), wong and einstein (2009a) over the past 40 years  in these studies, the influences of flaw inclination angle, bridging angle, ligament length, and loading conditions (uniaxial, biaxial; monotonic, cyclic loading) on coalescence behavior were systematically investigated (wong and einstein 2009a)   in recent years, researches focusing on the observation of micro-fracturing contributed further knowledge to fracture coalescence behavior  wong and einstein (2009b) used the scanning electron microscope (sem) to analyze the micro-fractures in fracture coalescence test  in their research, they observed the formation of an array of micro-fractures parallel to the loading direction  these micro-fractures are located along the path of the subsequently formed macro-scale shearing fracture  cheng et  al  (2015) conducted research on specimens containing pre-existing parallel en-echelon fractures  in the tests, they observed the fracture coalescence between neighboring flaws of an en-echelon flaw series using fluorescent dying method  again in their observation, micro-fractures whose arrangements are similar to that reported by wong and einstein (2009b) were formed at a time before the appearance of macro-fracture | 
2017-1016 	 reservoir stimulation in naturally fractured poroelastic rocks |abstract: stimulation mechanisms in unconventional geothermal and petroleum reservoirs are poorly understood  permeability enhancement via shear slip is commonly accepted as the main stimulation mechanism  on the surface, this appears to exclude the propagation in tensile and shear mode of the natural fractures that experience slip  the misconception, has led to some even claim the discovery of a new stimulation mechanism via the formation of wing cracks  but, wing cracks are an integral part of the shear slip stimulation mechanism because shear slip increases the stress-intensity at the fracture tips, potentially leading to fracture propagation  this is particularly the case when natural fractures are subjected to direct fluid injection  on the other hand, natural fractures subjected to pore pressure through diffusion in the rock matrix could respond differently during stimulation  in an effort to better understand the impact of pore pressure and poroelastic stresses on the stimulation of naturally fractured reservoirs, a poroelastic displacement discontinuity model is developed and used in this study to illustrate various stimulation mechanisms  mohr-coulomb contact elements are used to represent pre-existing natural fractures  our results indicate that natural fracture propagation is less likely to occur when water is injected in the rock matrix outside the natural fractures  moreover, the orientation of natural fractures with respect to the wellbore is found to significantly impact their response  we also observe local destabilization and non-uniform distribution of shear deformation which is usually neglected or greatly simplified in other models   1  introduction  unconventional resources are produced by reservoir stimulation by water injection  the pore pressure change due to injection/production can trigger shearing on critically-stressed natural fractures  permeability enhancement through shear slip is a commonly accepted stimulation mechanism (pine and batchelor, 1984; murphy et al  1999)  at times, this has been misunderstood to exclude the possibility of slip induced fracture propagation leading to the suggestion that a new and different stimulation mechanism is operating  in fact, some have even claimed the discovery of a new stimulation mechanism via the formation of wing cracks (mcclure and horne, 2013)  but, the formation of wing cracks is an integral part of shear slip stimulation mechanism when fracture shear slip increases the stress-intensity at the fracture tips which can cause fracture propagation  it was this understanding that motivated the development of mixed mode fracture propagation models for geothermal reservoir development (huang et al , 2013; min et al , 2010)  this is particularly the case when natural fractures are directly subjected to fluid injection at pressure below the minimum in-situ stress  several studies have addressed the possibility of natural fracture propagation and coalescence as a stimulation mechanism (min et al , 2010; huang et al , 2013; jung, 2013; kamali and ghassemi, 2016a; kamali and ghassemi, 2016b)  jung treated the subject analytically and provided field evidence for wing crack formation but did not consider the possibility of propagation in the “shear” mode  the wing crack is a well-established concept (hoek and bieniawksi, 1984; horri and nemat-nasser, 1986; shen and stephansson, 1994; rao et al , 2003), describing the extension in tension or shear mode of mechanically-closed cracks under applied compressive stresses  kamali and ghassemi (2016) have explicitly simulated the phenomenon during injection and have shown shear slip occurs at injection pressures below the minimum in-situ stress and triggers the out-ofplane wing cracks (min et al , 2010; huang et al , 2013; kamali and ghassemi, 2016a)  further propagation and coalescence might be achieved by maintaining the injection at pressures slightly higher than the minimum in-situ stress | 
2017-1017 	 empirical estimation of the mode-i fracture toughness of brittle rocks using brazilian tensile strength |abstract: rock engineering applications require a more efficient and dependable approach to estimating mode-i fracture toughness (kic) than is currently available  herein, we develop an empirical relation between mode-i fracture toughness and tensile strength according to data from laboratory tests and previous researches on several kinds of brittle rocks  the tensile strengths were determined from brazilian disc (bd) specimens, and the mode-i fracture toughness data were determined from cracked chevron-notched brazilian disc (ccnbd) specimens, as suggested by the international society for rock mechanics (isrm)  in contrast to the previously published linear and exponential relations, our empirical relation exhibits dimensional unity between the two sides of the empirical formula, which is preferable in terms of both physical meaning and mathematical form  furthermore, the previously published linear relations are only applicable in special cases premised on a uniform specimen radius  using our proposed empirical relation, the mode-i fracture toughness of brittle rocks can be quickly estimated from the known tensile strength   1  introduction  mode-i fracture toughness is increasingly recognized as critical to rock engineering applications  this parameter has informed project designs in hydraulic fracturing, rock slope construction and modification, underground tunneling and construction, and others  rock engineering cases in which mode-i fracture toughness (kic) data are not available require estimates of mode-i fracture toughness based on the tensile strength parameter   previous studies indicate that mode-i fracture toughness and tensile strength are two related parameters in rock materials, both denoting the rock’s resistance to tensile fracture (litwin et al , 2012)  it is therefore likely that mode-i fracture toughness can be estimated from tensile strength once the empirical relation between the two parameters is known (zhang, 2002)  in general, the rock’s tensile strength is more easily measured than its mode-i fracture toughness, both in the laboratory and at the site of an engineering project, and there are cases in which the mode-i fracture toughness cannot be determined other than by the estimation based on tensile strength | 
2017-1021 	 parametric analysis for underground metal mine working stability |abstract: fully grouted rock bolts are considered the most economical support system for exposed unsupported rock in various mining operations  the paper presents parametric study of an underground metal mine with the horizontal cut-and-fill method of mining at the depth of 150 meters from the surface through numerical simulation using fast lagrangian analysis of continua (flac3d)  four different height of extraction i e  3m, 5m, 6m & 7m has been excavated numerically to evaluate the induced stress value and its parametric variation with the different height of extraction  factor of safety was calculated numerically for estimating the stability of different stope height  the performance of the bolts were studied by conducting series of in-situ pullout tests, and parametric analysis of stress along the length of the bolt at different extraction/stope height  the load-deformation curve of bolts indicates the de-bonding nature of bolt with axial deformation of 42-46 mm  from the parametric study, it can be apprehended that with lode width of 8m and average height of extraction/stope (5m) the underground working does not experienced any pronounced ground control problems  at extraction height more than 5m the induced stress values are more and the chances of roof fall and failure of rock bolts are higher   1  introduction  strata control is a major problem affecting safety, productivity and mechanization in underground coal and metal mines  with the advent of modern techniques associated with increased mechanization, roof bolting has gained prominence as a primary means of support in place of traditional supports, a hindrance for achieving higher production rate and productivity apart from economic and socio-ecological considerations  rock bolts and dowels have been used for many years for the support of underground excavations and a wide variety of bolt and dowel types have been developed to meet different needs which arise in mining and civil engineering  the principle component of reinforcement system is the rock, reinforcing bar, internal fixture and external fixture (a plate and a nut) (windsor and thompson, 1993)  they are generally tensioned after installation so as to make them an active support  when bolts are not tensioned or tensioning is not possible then they act like a passive support and are generally called dowels  rock support is the term widely used to describe the procedures and materials used to improve the stability and maintain the load bearing capacity of rock near to the boundaries of an underground excavation  thus, rock bolts not only support the weight of the unstable rock mass but also mobilize and enhance the inherent strength in the rock mass so as to control the movement of strata surrounding an opening in such a way that the availability of the opening to perform its desired function is not impaired  the support and stability of any underground mining excavation operation are of great concern for the engineer as any failure of strata would lead to severe concerns and loss of life of men working in certain cases  in order to stabilize any structure or strata, the condition associated has to be understood with a scientific approach  there are plenty number of techniques developed over the years to support and stabilize the structure, of which rock reinforcement by bolting is a very common technique either mechanical, grouted, or anchored, and is considered to be one of the important support member, being used all over the world for more than a century  the usage of rock bolts worldwide increased extensively over the decades and was in excess of 500,000,000 annually (winsdor, 1997)  a rock bolt support system assembly consists of a ribbed bar inserted in a drilled hole into the rock or roof of mine and anchored to it by means of mechanical or grouting material  such system is very efficient in applications such as stabilization of blocky rock masses, rock confinement and improvement of the mechanical properties of the rock (chappell, 1989)  easy and quick installation procedure and also the low cost as compared to other reinforcement systems are also responsible for its huge success (stillborg, 1986)  the main function of roof bolting is to bind together roof rocks consisting of natural joints and fractures, or rocks with artificial fractures and cracks caused by the use of explosives (peng and tang, 1984)  experience throughout the world by many researchers, to understand the mechanism of bolting assembly, behavior and assessment of grouted bolts performance have shown that de-bonding during the axial loading of rock bolt takes place either at the bolt-grout interface or at the grout-rock interface, depending on which one is weaker (farmer, 1975; freeman, 1978; indraratna and kaiser, 1990; benmokrane et al , 1995; fuller et al , 1996; li and stillborg, 1999; cai et al , 2004; hagan, 2004; moosavi et al , 2005; carranza-torres, 2009; ivanovic and neilson, 2009;

2017-1025 	 prediction of microscale rock mechanical performance from microct images: heterogeneous coal as an example |abstract: the prediction of rock mechanical performance is very important as it is directly related to safety issues and geological engineering design  however, there is a lack of understanding at the micrometer scale  thus we introduce a new method to predict micro scale rock mechanical properties based on microct imaging, combined with nanoindentation testing and discrete element method (dem) modelling  essentially microct scanning and nanoindentation testing provide the morphology and mechanical property inputs for the dem simulation  as an example the co2-swelling effect of a highly heterogeneous coal sample is presented, and we were able to correctly predict the internal stresses, and the failure mechanisms of the unswelling (mineral) phase, consistent with lab experiments  we thus conclude that the proposed method can accurately and efficiently predict the rock mechanical performance at microscale   1  introduction  laboratory rock mechanical testing has been widely used on standard core samples to examine rock mechanical performance under different axial and confining pressures, typically at centimeter to meter scale  however, the micro-scale rock mechanical performance is very important; e g  in hydraulic fracturing of coal or shale, where small changes in effective stress can significantly affect the micro fractures’ morphology, which can result in dramatic changes in permeability  it is thus of key importance to predict the micro-scale rock mechanical performance  one way to achieve this is by combining x-ray micro-computed tomography (microct) imaging (e g  iglauer et al , 2011; zhang et al , 2016a, b, c, e; jing et al , 2016) - where the microstructure inside the rock can be imaged in 3d at high resolution - with nanoindentation testing, where the mechanical properties of the material can be obtained at micro/nanoscale (zhu et al , 2009; bobko et al , 2011; lebedev et al , 2014; vialle and lebedev, 2015; zhang et al , 2017) and discrete element (dem) simulations - which can predict the mechanical behaviour of the rock |

2017-1030 	 geomechanical characterization of a sheared coal seam and implications for open pit slope design |abstract: a coal mine in southeastern british columbia, canada is planning an open pit which will include a highwall up to 400 m in height  a thick (20 to 40 m) weak, sheared soil-like coal seam will be exposed near the base of the proposed highwall slope  a wall-scale slope instability occurred previously at a nearby pit; whether a similar weak seam contributed to the previous instability is being investigated  as part of this investigation, the geomechanical properties of the seam and its anticipated behavior during mining activities are crucial to the assessment of highwall stability  published information about the elastic properties of this seam is scarce  initial strength testing of the seam was carried out at a rock testing laboratory with limited success  subsequent testing at a soils laboratory was more successful  this paper presents the tests conducted at the soils laboratory  the estimated strength and stiffness properties are presented  the results from the testing are compared with typical coal properties in the region  the results contribute to a robust database compiled for the region, which is deficient in testing of this weak sheared coal seam   1 0 introduction  a coal mine in southeastern british columbia (bc), canada is planning an open pit, which will include a highwall up to 400 m in height  the highwall will expose a series of coal seams within a sequence of interbedded sandstone, siltstone, and mudstone  a geotechnical study is underway to develop appropriate pit slope design criteria for the proposed highwall  the final highwall design will have an impact on site safety, project economics, and risk management   during a geotechnical investigation, it was discovered that the location of the proposed highwall may exhibit more structural, geological, and hydrogeological complexity than other pit areas  this includes a thickening of a coal seam (herein referred to as the weak sheared coal seam) near the toe of the proposed slope due to shearing along thrust faults  a corresponding reduction in strength of the seam is observed in response to this shearing  thrust repetition has thickened the weak coal to between 20 and 40 m  the ability of such a thick sequence of soil-like material to support up to 400 m of highwall slope is therefore being evaluated | 
2017-1031 	 combining traditional core logging and televiewer imaging to target fractures for grouting purposes-advantages and disadvantages  |abstract: grouting rock mass requirements typically involve having an extensive understanding on the location of fractures, their apertures, persistence and transmissivity  traditional core logging, although useful at providing accurate information, often leads to low confidence in the spatial distribution of the discontinuities or errors in the structural data gathered  televiewers are becoming essential to record structural data for use in engineering projects  combining manual core orientation techniques with televiewer data allows for an excellent understanding of lithological units, orientation, and thicknesses of the structures  this paper covers the use of traditional core logging in combination with acoustic and optical televiewer methods and hydraulic data from packer testing to target specific fractures and zones where grouting may be required  advantages and disadvantages of using both methods when undertaking grouting programs are presented and correlated with a theoretical case study   1  introduction  historically grouting of hard rock has followed empirical techniques and has relied on the use of geotechnical data estimated from traditional core logging and water tests to target areas where grouting is recommended  routinely, grouting programs are undertaken following an empirical procedure, where water tests are carried out every 10 ft  (~3 m) along a borehole without understanding the exact location of fractures, and their conditions (aperture, fillings, etc ) which in many cases does not fulfill a thorough assessment regarding the groutability and location of zones requiring grouting  moreover, traditional core logging, which in many cases is used to help grouting programs; in many occasions does not reveal all data and underestimates the main “in-situ” characteristics necessary to carry out a grouting program in a timely and cost efficient manner, i e  one of the big challenges of traditional core logging is the estimate of joint apertures (due to drilling disturbance) and infill (due to drilling flush/fluids)   not considering “in-situ” conditions on the rock surfaces to determine apertures might lead to misconceptions on whether stresses are increasing these areas of contact, tending to reduce the flow uniformity, or if in reality the aperture found through matedness correspond to the real aperture of the fracture  therefore, describing and classifying apertures by means of solely traditional core logging is a challenging process  if the joint matedness is high, the aperture variations over the surface will be small  the matedness of a joint is essentially the degree to which the two surfaces of the joint can be fixed together without any voids between the upper and lower joint surface (spross, 2016) | 
2017-1032 	 maintaining quality control in the preparation of geotechnical and geological mapping for hard rock tunnelling projects |abstract: the preparation of technically correct tunnel mapping sheets which present accurate factual geological and geotechnical information consistently throughout a project with differing mapping geologists or engineers, is a continual challenge  the importance of these records for construction support evaluation, as a record which might be used in litigation, or as a factual record for long term maintenance are factors that necessitate high quality, consistent mapping  the challenge is taking differing mapping geologists and engineers of varying experience, and ensuring they map geology and evaluate geotechnical parameters accurately and consistently  this can be especially difficult in poor ground which is regularly shotcreted, or for example, ensuring standards are kept to cover the course of a three year project where staff changes are inevitable  the paper presents procedures and methodologies which can achieve the aims described above as part of a quality management plan  in essence the aim of the paper is to form a practical guide to tunnel mapping with tailored quality control and assurance procedures  the paper is based on the authors working on numerous tunnelling and mining projects in south east asia, europe and north america where both drill & blast and tunnel boring machines (tbm’s) were used   1  introduction  the recording of geological information to recognized standards has become an increasingly important function of engineering geologists or geotechnical engineers working on tunneling projects  frequently the use of this data is of vital importance not only to assess ground conditions and thence support requirements, but as a relied upon record of the geological and geotechnical conditions found on a project  the use of the records are often for comparisons to the envisaged geology contained within a baseline report, or alternatively, used for maintenance purposes and assessment of potential issues in the longer term life of the tunnel  recording the information systematically is therefore a very important function of the engineering geologist or geotechnical engineer | 
2017-1034 	 rock cut design and construction optimization for the trans-canada highway 1 – pritchard to hoffman’s bluff project in british columbia, canada |abstract: the trans-canada highway1 in british columbia, canada, between kamloops, bc and the bc border is in the process of being upgraded  as part of this work, two 0 5 kilometer intervals of the highway were re-aligned and widened (from two to four lanes), by pushing back two steep bluffs on the upslope side of the existing highway using side hill cuts into rock  even though the rock consists of very competent granitic rock, during the project inception it became evident that steepening the rock bluffs to push back the highway alignment was going to be challenging, and if not designed and constructed appropriately the newly formed rock slopes could be susceptible to mass movements  also, during the design stages, it was identified that kinematically stable slope angles were too flat, and that it was not practical to adopt such angles  therefore, steeper slope angles than kinematically stable slope angles were designed and constructed, but this required ongoing assessment and stabilization of the newly excavated rock cuts as these got exposed   1  introduction  the trans-canada highway 1 (tch) is the primary east-west connection through british columbia, canada  it is the main gateway to the rest of canada, and a vital route for travel, tourism and trade   despite a lot of work to improve the tch highway 1 in recent years, it consists mostly of a two-lane highway, and there are still many sections with sharp curves, steep grades and narrow bridges   the bc ministry of transportation and infrastructure (moti) is in the process of upgrading the tch in british columbia, canada, between kamloops, bc and the alberta border  upgrades have been conducted in a series of separate projects, to complete a modern, 100 km/h, four-lane highway, which will allow traffic to move more safely and efficiently  upgrades will allow communities to be better connected, and businesses will be better able to move their products throughout the province | 
2017-1042 	 a numerical analysis correlating a mining induced seismic event with released kinetic energy |abstract: an ongoing hazard to safety and production exists in the potential for sudden failure of underground room and pillar mine workings  in order to better understand these events, the study of instability must encompass brittle material behavior and the capacity for sudden displacements in the overburden  this paper presents the results of a case study in which the 5 3 local magnitude seismic event associated with a documented mine collapse is correlated with the results of a numerical simulation through calculations of released kinetic energy  the approach includes a calibration of strain softening properties at the pillar scale to accommodate an unstable response and match deformations observed at the time of the collapse  widespread pillar failure is then simulated in a mine scale model using a 2d finite difference software  calculations of released energy are recorded throughout the simulation, and the results are compared to estimates of released energy associated with the seismic event through empirical relations  the analysis shows that the sudden reduction in average support pressure observed at the pillar scale accommodates a release of energy in the overburden of the mine scale model that correlates well with the documented seismic magnitude  the method of analysis illustrated in this study may be useful in future studies concerning the potential for unstable pillar failure   1  introduction  the sudden failure of underground room and pillar mine workings can endanger the lives of miners and halt production  pillar design is routinely based on empirical methods and numerical analysis, but unforeseen geologic conditions may result in higher-than-anticipated loads or insufficient pillar strengths  this paper illustrates a back analysis of the collapse of the southwest panel of the solvay trona mine, which occurred in february of 1995  an area of mine workings encompassing nearly two square kilometers collapsed in a matter of seconds and was accompanied by a 5 3 local magnitude seismic event (swanson, 1995)  the collapse resulted in the death of one miner and significant delays in production (ferriter, 1996) | 
2017-1043 	 advances in geomechanical subsidence modeling: effects of elasto-visco-plastic constitutive behavior  |abstract: o&g companies, during normal activities of field development planning and execution, have to assess their projects in terms of environmental sustainability in addition to technical and economic feasibility  with such a primary aim, eni’s commitment to both monitoring and modeling of subsidence has been very strong since the early nineties   most offshore development platforms have been equipped with gps stations, able to continuously monitor horizontal and vertical displacements, and radar images are constantly acquired and interpreted for onshore fields  to complete the internal approach, a workflow based on elasto-plastic finite element modeling has been implemented in order to properly reproduce the measured data and to accurately predict the future evolution of the settlement phenomenon   in some cases, it is beneficial to enrich classical elasto-plastic constitutive models to fully reproduce the time evolution of subsidence as recorded by continuously monitoring instruments such as gpss  actually, the extension of those models with the introduction of a viscosity component allows for a more detailed match of the recordings, with an increased reliability of the forecasted evolution scenarios   in this paper, the elasto-visco-plastic law by vermeer and neher (vnm) is evaluated as a possible constitutive model for the simulation of subsidence occurring above gas and oil reservoirs  this elasto-visco-plastic model can be regarded as a natural extension of the modified cam-clay model (mccm), usually employed by eni for subsidence modeling  furthermore, its parameters have a clear physical meaning and can be easily determined from laboratory tests  oedometer and creep tests performed on sand samples from gas reservoirs are first introduced together with model predictions  then, a synthetic, nevertheless realistic, case study is analyzed to assess the capabilities of this elasto-visco-plastic model in the simulation of subsidence  elasto-plastic (mccm) and elasto-visco-plastic (vnm) simulations are compared to outline the implications of the elasto-visco-plastic modelling in the simulation of subsidence evolution | 
2017-1044 	 finite elements simulation of the interaction of a hydraulic fracture with a natural fracture |abstract: the interactions between natural fractures (nfs) and a hydraulic fracture (hf) are most relevant to generate a stimulated reservoir volume in unconventional reservoirs  understanding these interactions and embedding them into models is essential for predicting their effect and thus optimizing stimulation treatments  we present a finite elements (fe) model of hydraulic stimulation, focusing on the interaction hf-nf  the model is based on the full elasticity problem and established cohesive zone models, guaranteeing its abiding by fracture mechanics theory  the preexisting discontinuity is endowed with distinct interface properties, and the interaction is fully resolved within the fe simulation  the model is first validated with experimental data (blanton, 1982)  a parametric analysis is performed to elucidate the competition between crossing and reactivation regimes  calculated and experimental results are in good agreement  the model is then used to carry out a parametric analysis of the interaction for the case of an argentinean unconventional reservoir  a range of behaviors is predicted for this case   1  introduction  unconventional tight reservoirs are characterized by their extremely low permeability  quite often, these reservoirs have a complex network of natural fractures that, despite of potentially being hydraulically conductive, depending on their degree of cementation, need to be stimulated in order to provide a permeable path between them and the producing well   a typical stimulation process includes water injection at high pressure, together with chemicals (friction reducers, jellifiers to increase the viscosity, etc ) and proppant  as the fluid is injected and the hydraulic fracture continues growing perpendicular to the minimum principal stress, it reaches the surrounding natural fractures and may connect them to the well  if this happens, the stimulated reservoir volume is enhanced   due to the complexity of the mechanical system and the challenging problem of modeling the hydraulic fracture’s propagation, the behavior of the hydraulic fracture (hf) as it approaches to a natural fracture (nf) is unclear and therefore has been focus of research for many years, including field (warpinski and teufel 1987), laboratory (blanton, 1982, 1986; bahorich et al , 2012, etc ), analytical (renshaw and pollard 1995; gu et al , 2011) and numerical work (dahi-talegani and olson, 2011, 2014) | 
2017-1045 	 step path rock bridge percentage for analysis of slope stability |abstract: step path (“en-echelon”) slope failures form as a combination of sliding on fracture surfaces and tensile failure of rock bridges between those fractures  this paper presents a new method for estimating rock bridges using a searching algorithm that identifies potential failure pathways through discrete fracture network (dfn) models which more realistically represent the spatial pattern of fracturing, with realistic fracture sizes, intensity variation, and orientation  the approach differentiates between rock bridges failing under shear and those failing under tension  without the need for complex numerical simulations, the approach can analyse multiple slope sections to provide a probabilistic assessment of the rock bridge percentage and slope stability  the resulting step path “rock bridge percentage” can also be applied to conventional continuum approach as an anisotropic rock mass strength  1  introduction  rock mass strength for slope stability analysis is defined as a combination of the strength of fractures and also the intact rock and the strength of intact rock  typically there are one or more well-developed fracture sets that provide preferential planes or orientations of weakness within the rock mass  if one of these sets is oriented adversely with respect to the slope, the analyses need to consider their impact on stability  these joint sets are commonly incorporated into the analyses as ubiquitous joints (or anisotropic strength orientations) that are assigned strength values based on the estimated shear strength of typical discontinuities  this approach may lead to overly conservative estimates of the factor of safety of the slope particularly when it is assumed that the structures are infinitely continuous   critical failure surfaces through the rock mass form partly along discontinuities and partly through the rock mass and it is the magnitude of this rock ‘bridging’ that often governs the stability of the slope yet has remained a hard to define property  this problem is illustrated in figure 1  it is complicated by the fact that this is a composite failure mechanism involving both shear and tensile failure mechanism |

2017-1048 	 modeling of fracture opening by explosive products |abstract: in traditional hydraulic fracturing stimulation, the effective conductivity of low permeability rock is increased by generating/activating fractures through injection of pressurized fluid  one possible extension of traditional hydraulic fracturing is to increase the loading rate that the driving fluid applies on the formation  methods that use dynamic loading potentially extend stimulation to previously inaccessible geological resources  in contrast to pump-driven hydraulic fracturing methods, dynamic stimulation can generate stresses in the source region that may be significantly larger than the in-situ stress, which helps to create fractures that may grow in directions other than that of the minimum in-situ stress  furthermore, the increased loading rate has potential to generate fractures in relatively ductile formations  with dynamic loading, fractures are initially generated by the diverging stress wave propagating from the energy release zone  it has been shown that the crack area and final extent depend on the ability of explosive products to flow into cracks after wave propagation  here we investigate the potential for crack generation from stress waves, and the opening of those cracks via the flow of explosive product gases into the cracks by developing a coupled finite element (fe) and godunov scheme for fluid-solid interactions   1  introduction  hydraulic fracturing is a common method for stimulating wells in petroleum and geothermal reservoirs (eaton, 1969; simonson et al , 1978)  hydraulic fracture orientation is largely controlled by principal stress magnitudes and orientation due to the slow propagation of the stimulated fractures  dynamic fracture stimulation methods based on the detonation/deflagration of energetic materials may provide an alternative stimulation technology for geothermal and petroleum-bearing formations (reeves and weida, 1995)  with an increasing rate of injection, which is achievable with explosives or propellants, it is possible to create fractures at arbitrary orientations and potentially stimulate the near wellbore region more uniformly (reeves and weida, 1995)  such an approach relies on the ability of stress waves from an explosive charge to overcome the in-situ stresses and create fractures in various directions, in contrast to a single preferentially aligned fracture commonly formed during hydraulic fracturing  however, it is also well known that shock waves emanating from a detonation can compact the rock and reduce the permeability (reeves and weida, 1995) | 
2017-1049 	 thermo-hydro-mechanical responses of fractured diatomite formation to steam injection |abstract: we developed a numerical model to simulate steam-water injection into fractured diatomite formations  to mitigate the high nonlinearity in both the eos of the water substance and the behavior of a fracture-matrix system, our formulations are simplified from actual system behavior but preserves the most fundamental behaviors of the steam-water fracture-matrix system  as a preliminary example of application, we used the model to study the effects of rock permeability on the development of the heated zone around the injection point  the results show how the steam chamber dimensions and injection temperature depend on rock permeability   1  introduction  cyclic steam stimulation is an important enhanced oil recovery (eor) method  a significant portion of california’s oil production, especially that in the san joaquin valley, relies on this technique  this technique has proven to be very effective to produce heavy oil contained in the shallow yet thick diatomite formations in the san joaquin valley (kumar and beatty, 1995; murer et al , 1997; fong et al , 2001)  otherwise, the oil is too viscous to be produced economically from diatomite formations that have relatively low permeability  cyclic steaming entails injecting high temperature, high pressure water-steam mixture for a period of time (days to weeks), followed by a soaking period of zero to several days, and production from the same well with or without artificial lifting   the modeling and analysis of cyclic steaming has conventionally considered it to be a multi-phase (gas and liquid), single- or multi-component (oil, water, etc ) flow process in a porous medium (blanco-martin et al, 2016)  however, there exists strong evidence suggesting that hydraulic fracturing is triggered or induced in the injection phase (kumar and beatty, 1995; kovscek et al, 1997)  the injection is often performed at pressure greater than the fracturing pressure (i e  bottomhole pressure greater than the minimum principal in situ stress at the depth) (speight, 2009)  in california’s south belridge, lost hills, and cymric fields, surface tiltmeter mapping has revealed that high rate steam injection generates fractures along the least principal stress plane whereas low rate steam injection seems to trigger two sets of fractures oblique to that plane (weijers et al , 1999)  our interpretation of this phenomenon, which is different from that in weijers et al  (1999), is that low injection rate activates natural fractures whereas high injection rate causes fluid pressure that is sufficiently high to open new fractures against the minimum principal stress direction | 
2017-1050 	 constitutive model for shale |abstract: presented is a new spherocylindrical microplane constitutive model that can capture the inelastic fracturing behavior of orthotropic materials, and particularly the shale  the basic idea is to couple a cylindrical microplane system to the classical spherical microplane system  each system is subjected to the same strain tensor while their stress tensors are superposed  the spherical phase is similar to the previous microplane models for concrete and isotropic rock  the cylindrical phase, which is what creates the transverse isotropy, involves only microplanes that are normal to plane of isotropy, or the bedding layers, and enhance the stiffness and strength in that plane  this new model can reproduce all the five independent elastic constants of transversely isotropic shales, which are all positive if the elastic in-to-out-of plane moduli ratio is < 3 75 (this applies to all shales)  vice versa, from these constants, one can easily calculate all the microplane elastic moduli  oriented micro-crack openings, frictional micro-slips and bedding plane behavior can be modelled more intuitively than with the spectral approach  data fitting shows that the microplane resistance depends on the angle with the bedding layers non-monotonically, reaching a minimum at 30° to 60°  finally, comparisons with extensive test data for shale validate the model   1  introduction  despite the astonishing recent success of hydraulic fracturing technology, aka fracking [1], the mechanics of shale fracturing is still poorly understood and major gaps of knowledge remain [2]  this may explain why only 5% to 15% of the gas contained in the shale strata is currently getting extracted  increasing this percentage requires tackling a number of problems  one of them is the problem of material constitutive model for fracturing damage and frictional slip in shale   mainly because of the pronounced anisotropy of shale, no realistic constitutive model exists at present  it is needed to design and control the fracking for gas or oil, as well as deep underground sequestration of c02, fracking water and other toxic fluids, and for radioactive waste disposal  no less it is needed for safety assessments of tunnels and underground caverns, tall building or bridge foundations, and all kinds of geotechnical excavations in shale |

2017-gggg 	 data-driven brittleness index prediction from elemental spectroscopy and petrophysical properties using support-vector regression |abstract  |brittleness index is one of the critical geomechanical properties to understand the rock’s drillability in drilling operations and screen effective hydraulic fracturing candidates in unconventional reservoirs  brittleness index can generally be obtained from stress or strain based relationships  it can also be estimated from conventional well logs or rock mineralogical composition  brittleness index measurements from stress/strain based relationships require laboratory tests, which are time-consuming and core samples are available only at discrete depths  while well logs can estimate a continuous profile of brittleness index along the borehole, it is derived from empirical correlation specific to a rock type  more recent advancements in logging tools have enabled the determination of elemental spectroscopy downhole  this information combined with petrophysical properties such as density and porosity can capture brittleness characteristics of rocks  this paper presents the use of support-vector regression (svr) to construct a data-driven brittleness index prediction from the elemental spectroscopy and petrophysical properties  |the relationship of brittleness index with elemental spectroscopy, density, and porosity is often complex and nonlinear  the svr described in this paper is used to correlate the elemental spectroscopy, density, and porosity to the brittleness index, thereafter building a data-driven brittleness index prediction model  the dataset of brittleness index, elemental spectroscopy, density, and porosity used in this study are based on various geological formations  laboratory tests such as unconfined compressive strength, confined compressive strength, and brazilian test were conducted  brittleness indices were calculated based on data generated from these tests  elemental spectroscopy data were obtained from x-ray fluorescence (xrf) analysis  the data are then separated into two categories: training and testing data  training data are used to train the svr and establish the brittleness index prediction model, while the testing data are used for validation  |in total, 28 cases were run with different combinations of petrophysical and mineralogical properties, number of training dataset, and svr kernel functions  the results reveal that the svr-based brittleness indices match very well with the laboratory-measured brittleness indices  cross-correlation plots of regression models between the predicted and the measured brittleness indices show high values of coefficient of determination  the small error and high values of coefficient of determination denote the svr models’ good performances  the prediction accuracy improves as more data are included to train the algorithm  from the comparison of svr-kernel-function-based models, we observe that the rbf-based model performs better than the polynomial-based model  the rbf-based model yields better accuracy than the polynomial-based model using the same number of training dataset  referring to the rbf-based model with 80% training dataset, it was observed that elemental spectroscopy has more influence than the other rock properties on the prediction  the promising results stemming from this study confirm that svr can be further applied to build a brittleness index prediction model based on mineralogy logs and petrophysical logs | 
2017-kkk 	 an integrated geomechanical approach for successful drilling through coal in peninsular malaysia and offshore vietnam |abstract  |past drilling of vertical and moderately deviated development wells in offshore peninsular malaysia and offshore vietnam has proven to be challenging  drilling experience in the development wells highlighted the issue of wellbore instability in the respective study areas, particularly though coal seams  numerous lost-time incidents related to wellbore instability-related problems were experienced, ranging from tight hole (remedied by reaming) to overpull, pack-off followed by stuck pipe, fill on-bottom to difficulties in running casing, and coal cavings to high gas associated with drilling breaks  these problems were observed particularly when drilling through the weak shales with interbedded unstable coals  |coal instability often does not respond to the same remediation used in shale, where we usually simply raise the mud weight to reduce the compressional hoop stress below the strength of the rock  borehole collapse or breakout may still occur when the coal cleats and natural fractures of the coal allow the drilling fluid filtrate to invade despite using an optimum mud weight  this results in pressurization of the near-wellbore region and loss of effective mud weight support for coal stability  all the wells in the respective fields were drilled with water-based mud (wbm) and so drilling performance benchmarking with other drilling fluids was not possible in the study area  faced with continual non-productive time (npt), a geomechanical study was initiated to mitigate the wellbore instability problems  the recommendations arising from the comprehensive geomechanical and drilling experience analyses have been implemented to improve performance during subsequent development drilling  |this paper highlights the importance of integrating geomechanics with proper drilling practices when developing strategies to mitigate unstable hole problems, especially related to coals  a full-scale geomechanical model was developed, validated and updated using logs and drilling data from wells in both the areas  the drilling experiences, rock mechanical properties, in-situ stresses and formation pressure in both the study areas are presented and discussed in detail  a detailed recommendation on the drilling strategy through coal and the associated uncertainties was implemented  utilization of geomechanical results from the two studies and the approach adopted in the development of drilling strategies helped to determine recommended optimal mud weight programs for the future wells  subsequent drilling campaigns have all been successful by incorporation of the entire risk and mitigation plan  this included a generalized road map with a protocol for drilling through coal, tripping and back reaming during drilling, pre-drilling and post-drilling  this effort, together with optimized drilling fluid design and the correct mud weight based on previous drilling experience as per recommended wellbore stability assessments, helped in two recently drilled wells in different areas with reduced non-productive time | 
2017-m 	 impact of different cleaning methods on petrophysical measurements |abstract  |the gas research institute (gri) did pioneering work on measuring shale petrophysical properties (luffel and guidry 1989, 1992; luffel et al  1992, 1993; guidry et al  1995)  however, despite growing interest in shales, due to its inherent complexity, there are no set standards with respect to core petrophysical measurements  core cleaning is one such aspect  |the objective of this study is to shed some light on the shale core-cleaning conundrum  the study shows the cleaning impact of different solvents on samples belonging to different maturity windows and having different in-situ fluids  it also compares the cleaning efficiency between plug and powdered samples  different apparatus like high-pressure extractor (hpe) apparatus and soxhlet are also compared  |different measurements like source rock analysis (s1 and s2 values); gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms) extraction analysis; brunauer, emmett and teller (bet) surface area and pore size distribution help to understand dynamics of core cleaning  the study was carried out on samples from wolfcamp and eagle ford formations  |cleaning has a major impact on various petrophysical properties like porosity (increases up to 50%), s1 (decreases up to 90%) and surface area (increases by 450 %)  the study showed that cleaning time is a function of maturity and sample state  samples in the oil maturity window are much more difficult to clean compared to the samples in the gas maturity window  similarly, plug samples are more difficult to clean compared to the crushed samples  the study shows that toluene, dichloromethane (dcm) and chloroform have similar cleaning efficiencies but n-heptane is less efficient | 
2017-n 	 unconsolidated thin bed clastic petrophysics - lessons learnt, greater dolphin area, trinidad |abstract  |the greater dolphin area consists of three main fields, dolphin, dolphin deep and starfish, off the east coast of trinidad  the reservoir intervals consist of a series of stacked pleistocene sands, silts and shales derived from the proto-orinoco, with thick marine claystones forming seals  the reservoir sands are generally unconsolidated with good porosity and permeability  hydrocarbon composition is primarily dry gas with minor condensate  |the laminated formations within the reservoir have been a long standing challenge due to poor quality core acquisition and handling, insufficient data acquisition and rugous wellbore conditions  previous attention has been focused on understanding the water saturation modelling in the belief that accounting for resistivity anisotropy would solve the low resistivity pay situation  it has been demonstrated that investigating water saturation alone does not yield results consistent with production behaviour  |unconsolidated sediments tend to have higher compressibility than potentially expected causing less depletion due to the compaction effect  in combination with a geomechanical study and core from well x, uniaxial pore volume compressibility was refined, improving volume estimation and thus production forecasting  |this study will show that careful core handling and preparation to preserve the clay properties in tandem with improved log acquisition, shed light on the need for accurate lithology description to enable water saturation to be modelled realistically  it is demonstrated that whether an effective or total water saturation model is used the same hydrocarbon volume is calculated and thus provides sense checks on the evaluation as a whole  production data however highlighted that a shaley sand water saturation model alone was not sufficient to neither account for the volumes or to identify the contributing intervals leading to the need to evoke a complex model developed through the integrated interpretation of advanced logging technologies (e g  resistivity anisotropy, nmr, dielectric and imaging techniques) | 
2017-ppp 	 geomechanical evaluation enabled stimulation optimization of apollonia tight chalk egypt |abstract  |the apollonia formation is a tight gas carbonate reservoir characterized as a low permeability soft chalk (young’s modulus ~ 1 mm psi) with medium porosity and low quality natural fractures  the ability to achieve economical production rates and efficiently develop the apollonia with those characteristics has become increasingly challenging  to further increase production from the field, a development plan was initiated employing drilling of horizontal wells with multistage fracturing stimulation  an integrated and detailed workflow of laboratory core testing was established to gain an in-depth understanding of this reservoir’s rock mechanics behavior and to help optimize the hydraulic fracturing and completion designs  particularly, elastic properties and principal in-situ stresses were acquired to provide the following: |static and dynamic mechanical properties information for correlating well-log data  |calibration to the mechanical earth models constructed from sonic-derived mechanical properties to help provide realistic deformation parameters for hydraulic fracturing design purposes  |strength information for developing a failure locus for the material  |the evaluation program of mechanical properties testing was conducted on selected core samples and integrated logs from two offset vertical wells  the laboratory testing program consisted of the following: |indirect tensile strength testing (brazilian method) performed at room temperature  |unconfined compression (ucs) testing  |single stage triaxial compression testing with concurrent ultrasonic velocity measurements  |all laboratory data, including procedures, tabulated results, stress-strain plots, computerized tomography scan images, and post-test sample images are provided for analysis and visualization of the failure mode  by understanding the reservoir geomechanics behavior and the mechanical parameters that have a critical impact on the hydraulic fracturing propagation, improved decision making in terms of fracturing design and optimization was made  software was used to model the propagation of hydraulic fractures based on the integrated reservoir mechanical properties analysis  different scenarios of perforation clusters were run to model propagation of multiple horizontal fractures and predict the changes in stress anisotropy in the neighborhood of the fractures  results revealed that an increased number of perforation clusters attributed to increased stress interference from the outer fractures, causing reduced inner fracture half-length and resulting in longitudinal fracture propagation rather than transverse fractures, thus reducing the stimulated reservoir volume  the results of this study improve the understanding of the apollonia reservoir mechanical properties and help provide valuable insight into optimization of multistage hydraulic fracturing design in horizontal wellbores, thus establishing the base for subsequent reservoir development | 
2017-rrr 	 quantitative interpretation of sonic compressional and shear logs for gas saturation in medium porosity sandstone |abstract  |gassmann equations (gassmann, 1951) are used to calculate seismic velocity changes that result from variations in reservoir fluid saturation  these equations became predominant in the analysis of a direct hydrocarbon indication from seismic data through their use in analyzing the compressional to shear velocity ratio, vp/vs  this vp/vs ratio is used in many industry analyses, such as the amplitude variation with offset (avo) analysis developed by castagna et al  (1993)  multiple authors have since published a variety of vp/vs seismic interpretation techniques that use empirical relationships with vp, vs, and porosity terms  unfortunately, however, there is a gap in the use of vp/vs relationships in petrophysical interpretation  |the vp/vs ratio analysis was expanded in 1995 when brie et al  proposed the application of a vp/vs vs  vp crossplot for gas trend indication and included a correction for shale effect  the crossplot of vp/vs vs  vp was published in 2015 by quirein et al  and was applied to organic shale reservoirs for kerogen volume and anisotropy trend indications  |this paper explores the use of a crossplot of vp/vs vs  vs for quantitative petrophysical interpretation  a relationship developed in the paper is used to describe water-wet and gas-saturated sandstone trends, and to independently calculate water saturation from a proposed crossplot in low and medium porosity isotropic sandstones  these proposed vp/vs vs  vs crossplot water saturation results are compared to traditional resistivity-based results  this proposed simplified method provides a suitable approach for determining gas saturation when resistivity logs yield inadequate results in, for example, medium porosity or low-resistivity pay formations | 
2017-v58n3a4 	 recovering elastic properties from rock fragments |abstract |mechanical characterization of an isotropic rock requires the measurements of at least two elastic constants  dynamic constants are obtained using ultrasonic techniques and static constants are obtained from the stress-strain response of the rock; both techniques can be used at elevated pressures and temperatures  these methods typically involve the use of cylindrical plugs; however, the existence of natural fractures or fissility of shale formations precludes the extraction of cores  the challenge is to improve reservoir characterization by measuring elastic properties using irregular, but ubiquitous smaller rock samples  we propose measuring two elastic parameters, i e , young’s modulus and bulk modulus through nanoindentation and mercury injection capillary pressure (micp) experiments, respectively  with these two constants and the assumption of isotropy, all other isotropic elastic constants can be derived  the idea is to infer young’s modulus (enano) using nanoindentation and estimate bulk modulus (kmicp) using micp data; neither measurement requires core plugs and can be carried out on irregularly shaped rock fragments  we assume the fragments are representative of the formation of interest; confirmation comes from establishing statistics  we measured woodford, haynesville, eagle ford, wolfcamp, bakken, utica and green river shale core samples  these values are compared to values obtained in ultrasonic-pulse transmission experiments  ultrasonic values of k measured at 5,000 psi confining pressure agree well with the values of kmicp at 5,000 psi  similarly, enano shows a 1:1 correlation with ultrasonically derived young’s modulus at 5,000 psi confining pressure  at a confining pressure of 5,000 psi, the influence of cracks is reduced  |introduction |the ubiquitous use of hydraulic fracturing to stimulate unconventional reservoirs drives the need for improved methodologies to compute the mechanical properties of rock  mineralogical variability (rickman et al , 2008; 2009; passey et al , 2010) in shale should be considered in the decision of the placement of laterals  ductility is a function of mineralogy, toc richness and in-situ stress profile  within a stimulation zone, where principle stresses are minimally varied, mineralogical variability directly affects elastic properties (al-tahini et al , 2006), brittleness and ductility (bai, 2016): high concentrations of clay make shale more ductile, while the predominance of quartz is associated with brittleness  jarvie et al , (2007) related brittleness directly to mineralogy |

2017-w11-01 	 historical s-wave applications and aspirations |summary |about every ten years and major e&p publications on shear-wave seismology, an historical perspective is compiled  these perspectives effectively summarize the potential technical utility to industry, namely, the aspirations for s-waves data use  typically, they cover borehole and surface seismic profiles to capture the r&d plus commercial impact  in addition, these perspectives cite case-study results to demonstrate the “s-wave application”  winterstein’s (1987) perspective summarizes s-wave objectives as: |amplitude effects to qualify reservoir “bright spots”  |vp/vs: to characterize lithology, porosity or fractures  |reservoir images in poor p-seismic areas  |subsurface higher resolution than with p-wave data  |anisotropy to investigate fracturing or lithology  |these points provide a convenient structure to update  this perspective starts ~1977 with the conoco group shoot targeting the commercial applications of s-wave vibrators  following, ~1987 a more vector-wavefield approach arose around nine-component (9c) recordings, such as in the arco multicomponent group shoot (tatham and mccormack, 1991)  with the industry downturn, the s-wave investigations shifted to consortia and offshore  successful applications of 4c on-bottom recordings ~1997 enabled imaging of marine converted-waves  the p-s image overcame the lack of p-wave seismic response at reservoirs with class 2 avo and under gas clouds  since then, production monitoring, heavy oil, geomechanics and shale reservoirs needs have looked to converted-waves to improve on p-wave images and estimates of subsurface properties (gaiser and strudley, 2005)  |the literature shares numerous trials, pilots and experiments attempting to apply s-wave technology  however, if ‘repeat business’ is a measure of the success of commercial application, there appears to be limited uptake in s-waves  one positive example comes from heavy oil-sands operators in canada, where p-s data use alongside p-data assists with mapping reservoir detail and production monitoring (weston bellman 2012, 2014)  discussions in historical numerous trials demonstrate, or suggest, barriers to successful application of s-waves (bale et al , 2009)  these barriers include variability in near-surface/overburden properties, complexity of s-wave propagation including anisotropy, and the ability to incorporate s-wave with p-wave data analysis  where the s-wave application is unsuccessful, these barriers often combine to limit signal-to-noise ratio (s/n), image resolution or detection sensitivity | 
2017-xxxx 	 impact of petrophysical properties on hydraulic fracture analysis |abstract  |defining petrophysical and mechanical properties of target and barrier zones are key components of the hydraulic fracture modeling process; subsequently, the selection of the detail necessary to accurately model fracture/reservoir performance is challenging  this work investigates whether using detailed petrophysical and mechanical properties provides fracture design parameters that better represent actual fracture behavior and subsequent well performance than a single-layered model  |the approach was to model an existing hydraulic fracture treatment and well performance from a well located in the northern delaware basin producing from the lower brushy canyon formation  models varied from a single layer model with simple-averaged, petrophysical properties to a fine resolution 1-ft model with detailed petrophysical values  detailed core descriptions were constructed to appropriately represent the thin-bedded and micro-laminated sandstones and siltstones  |in addition, point load tests measured values of fracture toughness for specific lithofacies from 600 to 1100 psi-in<u+00bd>  in comparison, the default value for a sandstone system is 1000 psi-in<u+00bd>  other mechanical properties, e g , poisson’s ratio and young’s modulus were derived from well logs, and were within typical values  |for the fracture modeling phase, the actual treatment volumes, rates and pressures were inputted into the model along with the measured petrophysical and mechanical properties  model net pressure was matched with the actual values to verify the output  the dimensionless fracture conductivity (fcd) from the various models ranged from 4 8 to 13 6  the range depends on the variation of lithofacies included in the fine resolution models and their associated mechanical/petrophysical properties  adding micro-laminated and bioturbated siltstones at the expense of clean sandstone in the finer resolution models resulted in higher permeability, fracture toughness and lower stress gradient  |for the production history matching phase, simulation pressures were significantly overestimated compared to actual measured bottomhole pressures for all single layer models regardless if actual or default mechanical properties were used  the overestimation reflects a threefold increase in pore volume due to the single layer values  for the finer resolution 1-ft model, the simulation pressure was significantly below measured pressure values using default mechanical properties  however, using actual mechanical properties in the 1-ft resolution model resulted in an increase in the fcd due to the decrease in fracture toughness and stress gradient input values  as a result, a very good match was obtained between simulation and actual pressures; indicating the 1-ft model with the measured mechanical properties is a good representation of the actual reservoir system | 
2017-y 	 logging-while-drilling dipole shear logging in fast formations using higher-order formation flexural mode |abstract  |a formidable challenge in obtaining a reliable logging-while-drilling (lwd) dipole shear log stems from the necessity to properly account for the inherent coupling between the shear-sensitive formation flexural mode and the strong collar flexural mode, which propagates through the stiff drill collar  recently, it has been demonstrated that a model-based inversion of the formation and collar flexural dispersions properly accounts for the presence of the drill collar and yields both the fast and slow formation shear slownesses  however, the model-based workflow is based on an equivalent isotropic and homogeneous (eih) formation model, and the estimated formation shear slowness might be compromised by model mismatches such as tool eccentricity, drilling-induced borehole damage, and strong formation anisotropy  |to mitigate some of these limitations, this paper describes a computationally efficient model-independent workflow to estimate the fast and slow shear slownesses in fast formations using lwd-sonic data  first, the proposed workflow exploits the existence of a higher-order formation flexural mode that is uncoupled from the dominant tool flexural mode  this uncoupling characteristic significantly reduces the complexity of processing algorithms to determine the formation shear slowness  second, the proposed workflow is not based on any forward model and hence, is applicable to both isotropic and anisotropic formations  this model-independent workflow complements the model-based workflow and can be particularly useful in challenging logging environments such as lwd operations  |introduction  |borehole acoustic logging is a major part of subsurface formation evaluation for oil and gas exploration and production  it provides key inputs to the geophysical calibration of seismic imaging, petrophysical analyses, and the estimation of rock stresses and mechanical properties for fracture stimulation and wellbore stability analyses  recent focus on shale-gas production has led to a renewed interest in characterizing formation anisotropy in terms of the fast and slow dipole shear slownesses in organic-shale formations  due to the high angle of many of these wells, there is a desire to obtain this information with logging-while-drilling (lwd) tools (sinha et  al, 2003) |

2645414-ms 	 introduction to poroelastic response monitoring - quantifying hydraulic fracture geometry and srv permeability from offset-well pressure data |abstract |horizontal-well developments in unconventional plays have increasingly been featuring multiple downhole gauges to monitor pressure and temperature variations during both the stimulation and the production phase  pressure variations in the monitor/offset wells during hydraulic stimulation have largely been documented and can range from just a couple psi to over a thousand psi  by modeling the geomechanical impact of a propagating fracture, we were able to demonstrate that some of these observed pressure responses do not represent a hydraulic communication between the fracture and the offset well, but instead a poroelastic response to the mechanical stress induced by the fracturing process  |when a stress load is applied to a fluid-filled porous material, the pressure inside the pores will increase in response to it  in theory, the incremental pore pressure is then progressively dissipated through porous media until equilibrium is achieved  but in a shale formation, dissipation is slow enough that the excess pressure is maintained throughout the stimulation phase (undrained deformation)  as a result, the poroelastic responses captured by downhole and surface pressure gauges are directly proportional to the volumetric stress perturbation induced by a propagating hydraulic fracture  |after building a geomechanical model of a propagating tensile fracture in a poro-linear-elastic material, we were able to match the poroelastic response captured in the toe of an offset well during the first stage of the stimulation of a horizontal well, and calculate the height, length, and orientation of the corresponding hydraulic fracture  following shut-in, the induced fracture proceeds to close thus relaxing the surrounding formation and causing the poroelastic response to fall off  by simulating the coupled leak-off and frac closure process, we were able to calculate the effective permeability of the formation following stimulation  |poroelastic response monitoring is showing tremendous potential in reducing the uncertainties of multi-stage fracture treatments in unconventional plays  among its many advantages, it is based on simple well-established physical models (linear-poro-elasticity), it is much less sensitive to rock heterogeneities than pressure transient analysis, each stage can be matched separately, and the noise to signal ratio is small  also unlike microseismic event monitoring, it directly measures the dilation of propagating hydraulic fractures | 
2662893-ms 	 understanding the 'frac-hits' impact on a midland basin tight-oil well production |abstract |in this paper, we present a mechanistic study for understanding the impact of ‘frac-hits’ on the tight oil ultimate recovery (eur)  ‘frac-hits’ are defined as the invasion of fracturing fluids into an existing producer (parent well) while a neighboring well (child well) is being fractured  data from wells that experienced ‘frac-hits’ suggest that substantial amount of fracturing fluids from offset wells may invade the existing producers, indicating high degree of connectivity between the existing producer and the newly stimulated well  even if the parent well is shutin during the fracturing of the child well, oil rates after re-starting the parent well production were observed to be lower than that prior to shut-in, and the oil production trend line deviates (usually lower) from the original type curve prediction  |we used a mechanistic model to assess the impact of ‘frac-hits’ on oil production  the results indicate that the impact of ‘frac-hits’ on oil production can be significantly different depending on producing pressure of the impacted wells  ‘frac-hits’ below the bubble point pressures could have long-lasting adverse effects on oil production  among the mechanisms studied, gas trapping is found to be the most likely mechanism that impacts oil production  gas trapping occurs when fracturing fluids suddenly invade the depleted matrix due to the relatively large gas compressibility  the snapped-off gas, isolated from the continuous fluid path in the matrix near the fractures, can hinder the oil productivity  |if gas trapping cannot be remediated after ‘frac-hits’, oil eur may be decreased along with increased water handling  given this, oil production may be optimized by coordinating the fracturing sequence and spacing to avoid ‘frac-hits’ below the bubble point and avoid re-fracturing in the region below the bubble point  |introduction |over the past decade, technological advances in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing have allowed the access to large volumes of shale oil that were previously uneconomic  the energy information administration (eia) estimated approximately 419 billion barrels of recoverable shale oil resources in 46 countries (eia 2016)  the united states (us) contributes more than 90 percent of the global shale oil production in 2016  current production in the us relies heavily on drilling and fracturing large numbers of wells, which is capital intensive | 
2666389-ms 	 can gas-permeability of fractured-shale be determined accurately by testing of core plugs, drill cuttings, and crushed samples? |summary |determination of the nanodarcy gas permeability and other parameters of naturally and hydraulically fractured shale formations by pressure-pulse transmission testing of core plugs, drill cuttings, and crushed samples is discussed  the methods available for interpretation of pressure tests are reviewed and modified with emphasis on difference between the intrinsic and apparent permeability  improved formulations and analysis methods which honor the relevant physics of fluid and transport, and interactions with shale are presented  better design and analysis of experiments for simultaneous determination of several unknown parameters that impact the transport calculations, including deformation, adsorption, diffusion, and deviation from darcy flow are described  the permeability and other parameters of shale samples are recommended to be determined by simultaneous analysis of multiple pressure tests conducted under different conditions to accommodate for temporally and spatially variable conditions  the inherent limitations of the methods relying on the analytical solutions of the diffusivity equation based on the darcy’s law are explained  |introduction |the permeability measured using a darcy-like equation is not the intrinsic permeability but the apparent permeability which depends on the prevailing conditions of fluid, transport, and shale  the intrinsic permeability of shale depends on the temperature and effective stress conditions and therefore the conditions of a particular intrinsic value should also be specified  the primary reason for the contradictory values of permeability measured by application of the analytical models is explained by dependence of measured permeability of shale on particular testing conditions over which only a certain average permeability value is obtained from most analytical solutions  |crushed samples have different size particles  the permeability of a particle depends on its size  large particles are likely to have both the matrix porosity and fracture porosity  consequently, it is not correct to assume all the particles of different sizes to have the same permeability  whereas, most attempts in calculating the permeability using the pressure tests on crushed samples assume the same permeability for all particles  this assumption can only be applicable for samples of uninform particle sizes | 
2666764-ms 	 experimental measurement of fracture permeability at reservoir conditions in utica and marcellus shale |abstract |permeability of fractures is a key uncertainty in the analysis of unconventional oil and gas reservoirs  this uncertainty is greatest at in situ reservoir conditions and when attempting to predict the permeability of fresh fractures created via tensile stress or critical stress shearing  in this study, we measure permeability of shale specimens shear fractured at stressed conditions and combine these measurements with concurrent x-ray tomographic characterization of the fracture systems  the fractures were created using a specialized triaxial system configured for either direct-shear fracturing  confining stresses up to 30 mpa (4400 psi) were used to simulate moderate reservoir depths  the body of the apparatus is an aluminum coreholder that permits acquisition of simultaneous x-ray radiography or tomography data together with permeability measurements and shear fracture displacement  in both clay-rich utica and carbonate-rich marcellus shale, we observe that increasing confining stress during fracturing results in significant decreases in fracture permeability ranging over 3 to 4 orders of magnitude  in a clay-rich direct-shear specimen, negligible permeability development was observed at confining stress of 22 mpa (3200 psi) despite significant deformation  the large variations in permeability as a function of stress at fracture initiation are in contrast to the lesser effect of changes in confining stress on already-formed fractures with a corresponding range of one to two orders of magnitude  these observations of permeability are corroborated by x-ray radiography and tomography that show a reduction in fracture aperture with increasing stress  |introduction |hydrocarbon production from unconventional shale resources depends on a number of factors including the extent and penetration of the hydraulic fractures (hf), distribution of proppant, the hydrocarbon content, matrix properties, pre-existing fractures, etc  a number of studies have concluded that existing, potentially reactivated fracture systems must contribute hydrocarbon to account for observed hf productivity (e g , gale et al  2007; johri and zoback 2013; mcclure and horne 2014)  however, little is known about “natural” shear fracture permeability and the changes in fracture permeability in response to changing stress or fracture reactivation  this results in significant uncertainty in the potential role of natural fractures in hydrocarbon production  for example, discrete fracture network models of unconventional reservoirs use an array of natural fractures to reproduce production data (karra et al  2015) | 
2667433-ms 	 protection refrac: analysis of pore pressure and stress change due to refracturing of legacy wells |summary  |in recent years, it has become evident that the depletion of legacy wells creates a pressure sink that attracts fractures from new infill wells nearby  this causes asymmetric growth of fractures from infill “child” wells more toward legacy “parent” wells  the asymmetric growth ends in fracture interference and subsequently results in an ineffective stimulation of the reservoir  to avoid the interference, operators have been exercising pressurization of the depleted region by means of shut-in parent wells while fracturing infill wells or by refracturing the parent well before fracturing of infill wells; a practice commonly known as “protection refrac”  the objective in this work is to study the effectiveness of protection refracs in re-pressurizing depleted reservoirs for the purpose of mitigating asymmetric fracture growth  |a transient poroelastic displacement discontinuity model is developed to study the problem of undesirable hydraulic fracture propagation toward depleted zones nearby an example parent well  the model is able to solve for pore pressure distribution and changes in principal stresses direction and magnitude around both parent and child wells  pore pressure calculation due to production and so depletion of parent wells, and the resultant change in stress magnitudes are critical to understand and predict the extent of fractures from new infill wells  the model is capable of handling dynamic changes over time and can predict the optimum refracturing timing and volume  |pore pressure and stress changes while production are calculated, and an estimated timing for protection refrac is suggested  different refrac scenarios are examined throughout the life of the well and optimum refracturing volume and well spacing for infill wells are recommended  it is shown that there is a critical time in the life of the well that protection refrac could help pressurizing the formation directly by increasing pore pressure through fluid injection and indirectly by mechanical dilation of existing fractures  beyond this critical time, any attempt in increasing pore pressure effectively may not be practically feasible due to the nature of the severe depletion  |the paper presents a novel approach in calculating stress changes and dynamic fracture propagation into depleted region over time  asymmetric fracture growth is uniquely shown in depleted formations along with mitigation strategies to overcome this undesirable scenario | 
2667781-ms 	 developing predictive models for shale reservoirs |summary  |for the past 10+ years, the oil and gas industry has been developing shale reservoirs using long horizontal well bores and multi-stage hydraulic fracturing  these reservoirs are complex, layered systems of mixed lithology and grain size, with various amounts of total organic carbon  the commonality is that these reservoirs are laminated, with low porosity and permeability  rock properties can also vary laterally along the length of a horizontal wellbore or between wellbores  industry has done a reasonable job of determining how to 'optimally develop' each reservoir in specific parts of a specific basin essentially by trial and error  using these multi-million dollar wells to learn what works and what does not work represents an approach to technology development that is costly and has little or no predictive capability away from the geographically limited area where the technology approach is developed  |even though the industry has done a reasonable job of 'optimizing' in a single formation in a single location in many cases, every horizontal well is a research project  the industry needs models to help predict how to drill, complete and produce shale wells to optimize development in new formations and new geographic areas   |we need predictive geologic models as input to decide where to drill wells, how long the horizontal wells should be drilled, and where to land the laterals  the geologic models should be used as input into both the hydraulic fracturing and the reservoir simulation models  |once the geologic predictive models have been used to generate a detailed 3d geologic data set, then the hydraulic fracturing modelers need to use the information to determine how the hydraulic fractures will propagate from the horizontal wellbore and how natural fractures might contribute to flow  the industry still has a long way to go before rigorous models are developed to simulate fracture propagation from multiple injection clusters in thick, layered reservoirs  |the ultimate goal is to develop reservoir models that can take the input from the geologic models, the hydraulic fracture propagation models, and additional data such as pvt properties, pressure data, well test data, and production data to match both the reservoir behavior and be capable of predicting production from the reservoir as functions of well bore landing zone, well bore length, and hydraulic fracture properties  such matches and predictions can only come if we can model the reservoir around the well bore in detail and then learn how to translate that into practical models that can be used to simulate the entire reservoir |

2697445-ms 	 integrating microseismic and geomechanics to interpret hydraulic fracture growth |summary |there has been considerable discussion regarding the possibility and likelihood that vertical nodal plane dip-slip events commonly observed in microseismic data are actually horizontal bedding-plane slip events  the vertical nodal plane is roughly parallel to the maximum stress, with no simple explanation for the shear stress necessary to cause it to slip  the horizontal plane is more easily explained by the shear stress concentration at the tip of a vertically propagating hydraulic fracture  supporting this interpretation is the fact that the range of azimuthal directions from vertical nodal planes is often more complex than commonly occurs with other nodal plane orientations  the implication of this evidence is that these events occur at the termination of vertical hydraulic fracture growth or at layer boundaries between rocks with different mechanical properties  to investigate this hypothesis, we examined multiple data sets through moment tensor inversion using the horizontal-slip interpretation  the horizontal-slip interpreted events were then analyzed using a geomechanical model of the area  the magnitude and degree of layer varying mechanical properties along with the local geologic dip support the correlation of horizontal nodal plane orientation with bedding plane slip theory  also observed in the data sets were strike-slip type events which correlated with known fracture orientations from geomechanical logs  |introduction |early attempts at characterizing source orientations of microseismic events assumed a double-couple mechanism due to limited observations, such as being constrained to a single vertical monitoring array  these results typically revealed strike-slip type mechanisms interpreted as slip on pre-existing fractures (rutledge and phillips 2003) or vertical dip-slip mechanisms that suggested the possibility of bedding plane slip (rutledge et  al  2014)  with the prevalence of multiple arrays, improved characterization of these sources is now possible  of the two data sets we examine, with nearly full focal sphere coverage, one reveals dominant strike-slip failure on a set of pre-existing natural fractures, and the other is dominated by events that we interpret as bedding plane slip  |theory |microseismic events have traditionally been associated with pore pressure diffusion and the associated failure resulting from the reduction in normal stress on fracture planes in a triaxial stress environment  in tight unconventional reservoirs with very low leak-off, direct communication of the hydraulic fracture with the natural fractures likely leads to slip along those fractures |

28020-ms 	 on the use of ocean tide model driver, tmd, as a filter to recover reservoir signal from well test pressure history |abstract   in many cases, the intensity of tide signal present in a pressure transient test is so strong as to render its interpretation unfeasible  this noise (from tide) to signal (from reservoir) ratio is a function of the transfer of tidal stresses to porous pressure as well as of some parameters from a downhole pressure test, specially, the flow rate before shut-in, formation transmissibility, shut-in elapsed time and indirectly, the wellbore skin factor    the purpose of this work is to disseminate a predictive method of tidal effect simulation based on tmd, tide model driver, with the necessary procedures and adjustments, which allows the extraction of the tidal signal components from the pressure signal recorded in wells under test through downhole pressure gauges, thus allowing analysis of test data under intense tide signal interference    furthermore, this work establishes a relationship between bourdet derivative smoothing parameter l and the nyquist sampling theorem  this relationship acts as a criterion on the choice of maximum l, limited by nyquist theorem and is designed to preserve derivative tide signal shape and amplitude for the bourdet well test analysis method, not allowing its misinterpretation as reservoir behavior  in addition, this work present simple relationships or even a full tide simulator to predict tidal effects on pressure buidup or falloff and logarithmic derivative, considering the actual or estimated time of test, contributing thus to well test design as well    the installation of pdgs, permanent downhole gauges (pressure and temperature piezo-electric sensors), in wells completed with icvs, intelligent completion valves and designed to perform extended well tests, or ewts, has made it possible to recover characteristic tide pressure signals from relatively long periods of pressure record  in some cases, it has become possible to detach the tide signal in order to characterize it, through the discrete fourier transform, dft, determining the main tide frequency components present therein  the comparison of those frequency constituents with the ones present in oceanic and earth tide signals led to the use of a tide simulator, tmd matlab toolbox, as a tidal effect filter with excellent results, without the need of time lag adjustments    the tidal effect present in pressure data from pdgs installed at oilfield wells always comes together with reservoir signal  a simple method to recover an almost pure tidal signal was developed, consisting of a polynomial fit to represent the reservoir signal  the recovered tide signal was then submitted to discrete fourier analysis, dft, and the resulting frequency components were compared with oceanic and coastal tidal data available through tide stations, and later on, compared also with simulated tidal predictions, leading to the use of a tide predictor as a tidal filter  with this result from dft, a tide signal generator, the tmd software, was selected with excellent results  a non-linear regression is run over the recovered tide data, to adjust the amplitude level of tide signal transmited to the reservoir pore pressure by rock stress  the procedure for using the tmd and necessary adjustments to conform and extract the tide signal is illustrated by a field case with strong tidal effect, to the point of totally spoiling the characteristic transmissibility levels of the pressure derivative on pressure shut-ins  on the other hand, after the proper treatment through the proposed filter, the reservoir "tide-free" signal is recovered, turning possible the analysis of the data with increased sensibility  once the filter is adjusted to pressure data from one well, it is ready for use on other wells operating at the same field and reservoir |

502143-ms 	 applicability of co2-eor in shale-oil reservoirs using diagnostic plots |abstract  |unconventional resources have played a significant role in changing oil industry plans recently  shale formations in north america such as bakken, niobrara, and eagle ford have huge oil in place, 100-900 billion barrels of recoverable oil in bakken only  however, the predicted primary recovery is still below 10%  therefore, seeking for techniques to enhance oil recovery in these complex plays is inevitable  in this paper, two engineering-reversed approaches have been integrated to investigate the feasibility of co2 huff-n-puff process in shale oil reservoirs  firstly, a numerical simulation study was conducted to upscale the reported experimental-studies outcomes to the field conditions  as a result, different forward diagnostic plots have been generated from different combinations of co2 physical mechanisms with different shale-reservoirs conditions  secondly, different backward diagnostic plots have been produced from the history match with co2 performances in fields’ pilots which were performed in bakken formation of north dakota and montana  finally, fitting the backward with the forward diagnostic plots was used to report and diagnose some findings regarding the injected-co2 performance in field scale  |this study found that the porosity and permeability of natural fractures in shale reservoirs are significantly changed with production time, which in turn, led to a clear gap between co2 performances in lab-conditions versus to what happened in field pilots  as a result, although experimental studies reported that co2 molecular-diffusion mechanism has a significant impact on co2 performance to extract oils from shale cores, pilot tests performances indicated a poor role for this mechanism in field conditions  therefore, the bare upscaling process for the oil recovery improvement and the co2-molecualr diffusion rate, which are obtained from co2 injection in lab-cores, to the field scale via numerical simulations needs to be reconsidered  in addition, this study found that kinetics of oil recovery process in productive areas and co2-diffusivity level are the keys to perform a successful co2-eor project  furthermore, general guidelines have been produced from this work to perform successful co2 projects in these complex plays  finally, this paper provides a thorough idea about how co2 performance is different in field scale of shale oil reservoirs as in lab-scale conditions | 
eurock-2017-003 	 geomechanical model tests and infrared detection of rock responses for tunnels excavated in sedimentary rocks |abstract  rock mass behavior is controlled mainly by weak planes in sedimentary rocks  geomechanical model tests were conducted for simulating tunnel excavations in horizontal, the 45° and vertical inclined rock strata  infrared thermography was employed for detecting rock responses during the excavations  infrared temperature (irt) curve obtained by averaging the matrices of the infrared sequence can be viewed as temporal observation of the overall energy release from the rock under excavation  the irt curve characterizes the horizontal and vertical strata as linear behavior and the 45° inclined strata as piecewise linear behavior over the full-face excavation and the three strata as plastic-like behavior over the staged excavation, respectively  the constitutive heterogeneity can be represented by the weibull modus obtained by curve-fitting to the weibull model using the probability distribution of the irt temporal observations  the vertical strata has the smallest weibull modulus values corresponding to the higher heterogeneity compared with the else two strata models  the structural response of the rock under excavation was characterized by the irt distribution of the infrared image  irt distribution of the horizontal strata evolved from scattering distribution to localized high-temperature zone around the face  in contrast, irt distribution for the 45° and vertical strata distributed as belt-like irt parallel to the weak surface; indicating the frictional sliding damage mechanism  most intense friction was observed in the excavation in the 45° inclined rock strata   1  introduction  sedimentary rocks cover the majority of earth’s surface and are frequently encountered in underground mining  in the sedimentary rocks, two main sources of discontinuities are beddings and joints  the beddings can be assumed continuous over areas greater than that of any designed excavation and joints, however, are typically constrained between beddings [1]  both beddings and joints are surfaces of relatively low shear and negligible tensile strength  under the condition of stratified rock masses stretching across the roadway section, the engineering geological behaviour during tunnel development and operation is mainly controlled by the characteristics of the stratification planes [2]  thus, existence of the discontinuities may exert a significant impact on the stability of the surrounding rock masses |

eurock-2017-012 	 directional destress with tension blasting in coal mines |abstract  in china, engineering geological disasters are frequently encountered in the underground mining sites where room and pillar method is used  this paper presents a novel method for developing the gateway tunnel without any excavation using directional tension blasting (dtb) in the mine panels  the mining-induced stress transfer will be blocked by cutting the roof stratum with a slit produced by dtb  the method has the following advantages: 1) forming the gateway tunnel without any excavation work; 2) de-stress, and 3) reducing the number of the pillars significantly  the dtb has been applied in many giant coal mining corporations in china and proved to be very helpful in 1) increase in productivity and reduction in costs dramatically, and 2) elimination of engineering geological disasters induced by the coal pillar and mining stress   1  introduction  room and pillar method is the major mining way in china  the shallow coal resources are gradually reducing along with the continuously mining, which leads to the rising of mining depth  but engineering geological disasters, especially large deformation problem of surrounding rock, which is much more serious than that in shallow mines, are frequently encountered in deep underground mining sites  according to incomplete statistics, around 80 %~90 % accidents occur at the deep gate road [1, 2], and 80 %~90 % among them happen in roadway along gob   in order to reduce tunnel excavation, non-coal pillar mining with reused roadway method was developed with the improvement of surrounding rock control theory and support technology  it can reuse the last sublevel of mining roadway for the next sublevel along the edge of gob  and this technology can eliminate the island mining face, alleviate the continuous tension of workface, reduce the amount of roadway excavation, realize reciprocating mining, improve the coal recovery rate [3], and it was widely used in coal mine enterprises at home and abroad  at present, the main research is based on the caving method, which focuses on the wall supporting form and resistance, the determination of filling materials and the optimization design of supporting parameters and so on [4-7] | 
eurock-2017-015 	 characterization of rock fracturing for vertical boreability |abstract  boreability can be defined as the ability of a bore to penetrate a rock mass  understanding the factors influencing boreability is critical for enhanced project planning and reduce geotechnical risk in an offshore shaft boring environment  large diameter drills are used for offshore shaft boring, which can be up to 7 m in diameter, and therefore more akin to tunnel boring machines due to the scale of the excavation and extent of ground interaction  with increases in bore diameter, there is a need to properly define and evaluate the effect of the degree of rock mass fracturing on machine performance for improved estimates of boreability  discrete fracture network (dfn) simulation has been used as an innovative approach for stochastic realisation of rock mass fracturing by determination of the p32 volumetric fracture intensity in the context of boreability  p32 shows positive trend to specific penetration (sp), with maximum sp being achieved at moderate to high fracturing levels (20 – 25m<u+2212>1)  however, in this case, p32 shows a similar positive trend to p10, but with peak sp appearing at higher intensity levels  increased rqd values result in reduced sp, with peak sp reached at moderate fracturing levels, similar to p10   1  introduction  boreability is defined as the ability of a machine to penetrate a rock mass [1], and is commonly associated with tunnel boring machines (tbm)  the development of offshore shafts, large diameter drills (ldd) are utilized, which feature similar tools or technology to that of oil well drilling with reverse circulation system for muck removal  the size and scale of ground interaction can be up to seven meters, making these type of ldd’s more akin to tunnel boring machines due to their scale  little research has been undertaken on the performance or boreability of ldd’s when compared to evaluation of tbm behavior  given that the underlying excavation process and ground interaction tools differ between ldd and tbm machines, tbm performance can only therefore be used as a proxy rather than direct comparison |

eurock-2017-031 	 numerical simulation of granite plates containing a cylindrical opening in compression |abstract  in this paper, a numerical investigation of uniaxial compressive tests on prismatic specimens with single cylindrical pre-existing cavities in brittle rock is performed  to investigate the rock fracture around cavities and to assess the potential of the numerical model to simulate this behaviour, published laboratorial physical models on granite are simulated numerically with a bonded- particles model (bpm) by using a distinct elements code  the numerical models are presented and the calibration of the bpm micro-parameters is described  then, the calibrated numerical models are used to investigate the potential of the bpms to simulate the fracture initiation and propagation of the physical specimens  it is concluded that the laboratory and the numerical observations are in good agreement   1  introduction  the bonded-particle model bpm [1] has extensively been used over the past decade to simulate the mechanical behaviour and fracture of rock under a variety of loading configurations  in the bpm, the intact rock is represented by a dense packing of rigid spheres (in 3d) or disks (in 2d) bonded together at their contacts  the model is implemented in the particle flow code pfc [2]  the bpm has been extended by potyondy (2010) [3] to form the grain based model (gbm) in order to simulate a rock grain structure of deformable, breakable or not, polygonal grains, cemented along their adjoining sides  the gbm has been successfully used to describe the crack initiation, crack damage and peak strength of dionyssos marble specimens under uniaxial compression [4]  however, more computational effort and extended calibration procedures are normally required to match the macroscopic rock behavior with the gbm  with the recent addition of the flat-joint contact logic in the bpm [5] particle interlocking and friction resistance at the contact are imposed, restricting the relative movement of particles, and thus attaining the advantages of simulating the rock structure   in this study, the bpm is used to model the fracture initiation and damage around cylindrical openings in compression (e g  [6-8])  published laboratorial physical models on granite [6] are simulated numerically with the two-dimension particle flow code pfc2d by using the flat-joint contact model   during a uniaxial compression test on the aforementioned physical models, three (3) phenomena should be appeared  first, the primary fractures (denoted in fig  1 with red colour) initially start from the upper or lower hole’s boundary, extending upwards or downwards respectively  these fractures initiate due to the tensile stress concentration of the upper and lower regions of the hole’s boundary  then, remote fractures (denoted in fig  1 with blue colour) away from the hole are formed on regions with high stress concentration, extending upwards and downwards  the angle of their formation and appearance is depended of the examined material’s characteristics  finally, slabbing initiation (denoted in fig  1 with green colour) on the inner surface at the left and right hole’s boundary is observed, due to the high compressive stress concentration on these regions  the more the material is brittle, the more apparent are the v-shaped notches at the left and right of the hole | 
eurock-2017-035 	 calculation the spacing of discontinuities from 3d point clouds |abstract  the influence of discontinuities on the mechanical behavior of rock masses, demands a detailed knowledge about the geometrical properties of the existing discontinuity network  traditional measurement techniques provide a rough knowledge about a discontinuity network but are also prone to bias  to increase the reliability of discontinuity models, remote sensing techniques like close-range terrestrial digital photogrammetry (crdtp) are increasingly applied for rock mass characterization  this research contributes to the trend of automatic rock mass characterization and focuses on the analysis of a digital surface model  this paper proposes a method to identify discontinuity sets in a point cloud and calculate the spacing of the sets  the discontinuity sets are semi-automatically identified with the open-source software dse (discontinuity set extractor)  the program analyzes the density distribution of the point normal vectors in combination with a co-planarity test  the subsequent calculations apply dbscan to cluster and assign the points in the point cloud to singe discontinuity sets  after identifying the different discontinuity sets, the sub-members of each discontinuity set are again searched with dbscan in matlab® (the mathworks inc ) and exported as a structure map to calculate the normal spacing between the single members of each set with shapemetrix3d analyst  the point cloud is generated with crtdp, using the digital mapping tool shapemetrix3d (3gsm gmbh), which is also used to validate the results of the calculations   1  introduction  there hardly exists a rock mass without three or more different discontinuity sets  hence, it is of crucial importance in rock engineering to have a profound knowledge about the discontinuity network within a rock mass, since present discontinuities, like bedding planes, joints or cracks, represent the weak zones, which separate singular polyhedrons of competent rock blocks and control failure mechanisms  furthermore, discontinuities influence the mechanical properties and the behavior of rock masses   geotechnical engineers traditionally acquire this data by geological and geotechnical surveys, which combine visual and manual technologies to characterize rock masses  the most common tool is a geological clino-compass to directly measure the dip and dip direction of discontinuities  this method can be extended by scan lines and mapping windows which reduce the inherent bias of a single measurement  but traditional geotechnical data acquisition is nonetheless limited in accessibility, geological or geotechnical knowledge, time and scale  the results are often subjective rather than objective and therefore not reproducible [1, 2] | 
eurock-2017-036 	 application of artificial neural networks in prediction of uniaxial compressive strength of rocks using well logs and drilling data |abstract  it is critical to obtain the rock strength along the wellbore to control drilling problems such as pipe sticking, tight hole, collapse and sand production  the purpose of this research is to predict the uniaxial compressive strength based on data of sonic travel time, formation porosity, density and penetration rate  for prediction of ucs, artificial neural networks were developed between ucs and input data resulting a practical correlation  in this research, a long well segment possessing complete and continuous data coverage has been analysed, and collected data of the wellbore are used to correlate data of the four mentioned input parameters of artificial neural networks with uniaxial compressive strength data as network targets  selection of input parameters is based on a vast literature review in this area  due to the fact that standard experimental test methods based on established standards require costly equipment and that the methods for sample preparation is difficult and time-consuming, indirect methods are more favourable  using these methods, the ucs values are predicted in a simpler, faster and more economical way  in this study, it is concluded that artificial neural networks are a good predictor of rock strength, and can reduce drilling costs significantly  it is observed in this paper that ucs predicted values by neural networks are very close with lab and field data, which is concluded by analysis of network performance results including mean squared error and correlation coefficient  it is also concluded in this study that input parameters which are chosen in this study, have deep effects in ucs prediction studies, and should be considered in other scientific studies  conclusions show that using artificial neural networks to predict ucs of formation rocks in petroleum fields around the world, would ease ucs estimation, optimize drilling plans and decrease costs   1  introduction  a geomechanical model requires a great deal of input information including measurements of magnitude of vertical and minimum stresses, pore pressure, rock mechanics properties and drilling experiences, all oriented to determine the magnitude of maximum horizontal stress  to conduct a geomechanical reservoir characterization, it is essential to have the knowledge of the in-situ stress magnitudes and rock mechanical properties [17] | 
eurock-2017-038 	 study on fracture mechanism of hydraulic fracturing in sandstone by acoustic emission parameters |abstract  a real-time monitoring system was established for 10-channel acoustic emission (ae) in hydraulic fracturing in the laboratory, with a hydraulic fracturing test conducted on two different sizes of natural outcrop cores under unconfined pressure and confining pressure respectively  then, a discussion was carried out on the microscopic response in rock to the formation and growth of hydraulic fracture under confining pressure and unconfined pressure  the study of ae parameters shows that the change of ra (rise angle) in hydraulic fracturing process is always opposite to that of af (average frequency)  also, ae parameters have higher dispersion under unconfined pressure  with breakdown pressure as a dividing point, as pumping pressure changes under unconfined pressure, the dominant internal fracture mechanism of rock will turn from tensile failure to shear failure  but under confining pressure, the transformation of the dominance is reversed, namely from shear failure to tensile failure  this phenomenon indicates that despite the same hydraulic fractures in macro scale under both confining pressure and unconfined pressure, there may be a large difference in microstructure between the hydraulic fractures formed under both pressure conditions respectively   1  introduction  hydraulic fracturing technology has become the primary means of reservoir stimulation since its first application in north america in 1949 [1]  at present, as the conventional oil and gas resources are increasingly exhausted, and the yield of unconventional oil and gas resources rises gradually, hydraulic fracturing has grown into a more critical factor to artificial production’s increase [2]  from the perspective of theoretical research, with the constant development of fracture mechanics and its application to rock engineering, scholars have come to realize that the nonlinear areas have an important influence on the mechanical behavior of a hydraulic fracture before and after its formation, while the occurrence of micro cracks is an important sign of nonlinear rock failure [3] | 
eurock-2017-046 	 geotechnical risk management concept for intelligent deep mines |abstract  deep mining, driven by the increasing need of the sustainable use of mineral resources, yields a chance to exploit untapped resources  nevertheless, large depths remain challenging and complex environment, posing geotechnical risks such as stress driven damage  the violent damage mechanisms in deep mines are spalling and strainburst in their most severe forms  real-time monitoring can not only assist in preventing a failure, but can also assist in post failure mitigations  it can help identify the possible systemic failure of adjacent areas and can therefore help in evacuating people and machinery from these areas  the long-term goal is to develop a real-time risk management concept for intelligent deep mines  the objective of this paper is to summarize the outcomes of i2mine and dynamine, formulate a risk concept suitable for real-time analysis and to produce a tangible measure of the risk levels  in this paper the fault tree - event tree methodology is proposed and an example is worked out using strainburst as an example risk case  the proposed methodology seems to work well and using a scenario with both property damage and ore loss, the risk expressed as financial consequences multiplied with probability drops from € 88,000 to € 11,000 corresponding to a – 80 % reduction in risk  the financial consequences together with the associated risk level can be expressed visually using a modified fn graph with financial loss on x-axis and probability on the y-axis  the developed geotechnical risk management concept suits the need of semi-automated or fully automated risk management  it would fit well in the analysis stage of the raw data and would produce a stress state change, which could be used as input in the risk management chain for intelligent deep mines   1  introduction  the mineral resources are limited and mines are slowly expanding to tap into deeper deposits  with the increase of depth the transport costs and rock support costs increase  massive extraction induces stresses and triggers seismic events  failures in high stress conditions can have violent nature that aggravates mining conditions, threatens the mine stability and increases working hazards  the violent damage mechanisms in deep mines are rock spalling and strainburst in their most severe forms [1, 2]  strainbursts are considered the most common rockburst type in deep underground excavations [3]  typical indicators for high probability of strainburst are: increased depth of mining, contrasting rock types (e g  hard and brittle rocks vs  weak and yielding), drill hole behaviour, geological factors (e g  faults, fractures), the increase of rock noise, large excavations, sudden change in cross-section area, and the increase in microseismicity [4]  the severity of the failure depends on the ratio of far-field maximum stress (<u+03c3>1) and the short-term unconfined compressive strength of the rock (<u+03c3>c) [1]  less violent and energetic spalling can start to occur when <u+03c3>1/<u+03c3>c > 0 2 [1]  in mining conditions, it might be hard to recognize the difference between progressive spalling failure and violent strainburst as both cause a clear notch in a tunnel perimeter and can induce seismic event that can be recorded only if a mine is equipped with a microseismic network  risk management tools and guidelines are essential to maintain safe and economically feasible extraction in the harsh underground environment, but they still need improvements  one opportunity identified here is the development of the real-time geotechnical risk management systems  the philosophy underlying this concept can be expressed by the data-information-knowledge-wisdom (dikw) hierarchy introduced by ackoff [5]  the author considers data as raw measurements, from which information is derived  processed and analysed data is used for identification of data relationships that contribute to understanding  understanding of data patterns and processed information provides knowledge  on the top of the dikw hierarchy there is wisdom that represents the decision-making based on the knowledge gained  the innovative technologies and concepts for the intelligent deep mine of the future (i2mine) project running under the 7th framework program of the european union produced useful tools that reflect the abovementioned hierarchy  one of them that aim at use of the real-time data is the dynamic intelligent ground monitoring internet network (digmine) capable of stress and seismic near-to-real time measurements and another is the geotechnical risk assessment (gra) guideline developed to tackle the geotechnical risks in underground mines [6, 7, 8]  in this paper the review of these is given and an expansion of the gra with the outcome from the dynamic control of underground mining operations (dynamine) project is proposed  the paper discusses the use of financial parameters as means of measuring tolerable and intolerable risk  with the use of fault - tree, event tree and f – n diagrams [9, 10], a conversion of geotechnical risk into monetary values and comparing it with pre-set financial targets is proposed  this knowledge can then be used to support a decision-making process for strainburst risk management in underground mines | 
eurock-2017-050 	 an assessment of the post-peak strain behavior of laboratory intact rock specimens based on different dilation models |abstract  the complete stress-strain response of a number of intact rocks —including igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary ones— has been studied based on more than 300 compressive uniaxial and triaxial strength tests  obtained results have been typically interpreted to register peak and residual strength as well as other post-peak parameters  particular attention was given to the study of dilatancy  dilation angle of these intact rocks was fitted to two pioneering but still recent dilatancy models (alejano & alonso 2005; zhao & cai 2010), having the feature of being plastic-shear-strain and confinement-stress dependent  the aim of this paper is to identify various dilation trends according to the type of rock tested and to check the ability of the models to accommodate actual results  this can be the base to further extend these models to the rock mass scale  to do that, the dilation angle database produced in our laboratory and some results from other tests taken from literature have been compiled in order to explain the main behavioral trends of this parameter according to the addressed models  these approaches are intended to insight rock behavior models emphasizing the post-failure stage as well as to contribute to more realistic but still practical dilatancy models   1  introduction  for several years, the stability assessment of rock engineering projects was mainly based on avoiding failure, hence the elastic and peak mechanical behavior of rocks have been extensively studied since they may represent, a priori, the most determining features to control stability   nevertheless, the post-peak behavior of rocks and rock masses plays a relevant role in important fields of rock engineering where failure take place  for instance mining caving methods, petroleum engineering or the estimate of plastic zones around underground excavation largely depend on post failure behavior  it is therefore interesting to have available improved post-failure behavior models to be able to study these phenomena both analytically and numerically, as highlighted by various authors [1, 2] | 
eurock-2017-052 	 hydraulic fracture propagation under varying in-situ stress conditions of reservoirs |abstract  in-situ stress state in deep reservoirs is highly variable due to many factors and it markedly influence the propagation behavior of hydraulic fractures  the direction and extent of hydraulic fracture propagation are predominantly controlled by the in-situ stress state of reservoirs  we conducted distinct element method-based numerical simulations to explore the behavior of hydraulic fracture propagation and containment under varying in-situ stress conditions and fluid injection rates  the results revealed that even a small contrast of minor principal stress between pay-zone and adjacent bounding zones can cause a significant hydraulic fracture containment  simulations performed under different injection rates showed that the hydraulic fracture containment is also influenced by the injection rate and higher injection rates tend to increase the hydraulic fracture penetration into the adjacent bounding zones  overall, the results of the present study generally suggest that the fracture propagation during hydraulic fracturing is not an unconstrained event as one would imagine and natural barriers such as varying in-situ stresses, which are common in deep reservoirs, often limit fracture propagation to a certain finite extent  in addition, operational conditions such as fluid injection rate can be selected appropriately to control the hydraulic fracture propagation into unproductive bounding strata   1  introduction  hydraulic fracturing is used to enhance oil and gas recovery from unconventional reservoirs since few decades ago  the same technique is also used in applications such as geothermal energy extraction, co2 geo-sequestration and management of high stresses encountered with deep mining [1]  the direction and extent of hydraulic fracture propagation play important roles in the economics of oil and gas production projects  therefore, a thorough understanding of the geometrical nature of hydraulic fracture propagation under reservoir conditions is imperative for successful hydraulic stimulation designs   in-situ stress field in deep reservoirs is highly variable in nature  this cannot be explained by the effects of gravity and topography alone, for which the role of tectonic stresses is undeniable [2]  the state of the in-situ stress is one of the primary factors to be considered in design and implementation of hydraulic fracturing treatments [3, 4, 5]  two fracture propagation models have been widely used for hydraulic stimulation designs of oil and gas reservoirs - (1) kgd model [6, 7] and (2) pkn model [8, 9]  each model was developed based on different simplified assumptions and with certain limitations meaning that the user should carefully apply them with a sound understanding of these stipulated conditions  pkn model assumes an elliptical fracture cross section in the vertical plane and the formation stiffness is concentrated in the vertical planes perpendicular to the direction of fracture propagation while kgd model assumes a rectangular cross section in the vertical plane and the stiffness of the formation is concentrated in the horizontal plane [10]  the numerical simulation program of this study is compatible with the assumptions of the kgd model and thus further discussions are only limited to the kgd model  as meyer [11] states, for a hydraulic fracture with unit height, the fracture length (lt) and aperture width at the wellbore (wt) can be expressed as shown in equations 1 and 2, respectively, assuming zero leak-off into the formation (see figure 1) | 
eurock-2017-054 	 changes of physical properties of silesian granite due to heat loading |abstract |temperature affects both the physical and structural properties of rocks and there may even cause chemical changes of minerals  rocks are more or less inhomogeneous material, so that during testing the same rock samples taken from one location the measured values of physical properties can vary on large scattering between test specimens  to eliminate the influence of inhomogeneity of rock, we analyzed the effect of heat loading (up to 700° c) on the same specimens  for this reason we have used in our research particularly non-destructive testing methods – determination of bulk density, measuring of longitudinal ultrasonic wave propagation velocity, thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity  besides the physical characteristics determined in the same specimen before and after tempering gas permeability and thermal expansion untempered and tempered test specimens was determined  hg porosity and total porosity of untempered and tempered specimens were found, too  as model material was chosen so-called silesian granite from novy lom quarry (zulova pluton, czech republic), which has been previously tested, and over macroscopically homogeneous character the variances in the measured parameters were found  hg and total porosity and gas permeability increase with increasing temperature  the bulk density, the ultrasonic wave propagation velocity and thermal conductivity decrease with increasing temperature  the most sensitive parameters are ultrasonic wave velocity, thermal conductivity and permeability  |1  introduction |a lot of experts [1–8] studied the effect of thermal loading on the rocks  temperature affects the porosity, microcracking, ultrasonic wave velocities, thermal conductivity, strength and permeability of rocks and there cause rock expansion and even chemical changes  |rock is usually more or less inhomogeneous material  to eliminate the influence of inhomogeneity of rocks, we analyzed the effect of heat stress on the same specimens  we have used in our research particularly non-destructive methods - determination of bulk density, measuring the longitudinal ultrasonic waves velocity, thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity | 
eurock-2017-069 	 investigating the relationship between far-field stress and local values of the stress tensor |abstract  in situ stress is an important parameter in rock mechanics, thus robust estimation of far-field stress to be used as boundary loadings for further rock engineering analysis based on the local in situ stress data seems indispensable  here, as part of a preliminary investigation into this problem, we use the combined finite-discrete element method to examine how the mean of local stress tensors is related to the far-field stress  we have conducted a series of stress simulations on a model of a fractured rock mass subjected to various boundary loadings, and calculated the euclidean mean of the stress data and compared them with the boundary loadings  the results shows that the euclidean mean and boundary loadings are approximately equal, which gives us an indication that the euclidean mean of the stress data can be a reasonable estimation of the far-field stress   1  introduction  unlike artificial materials like concrete and steel, natural materials such as rock masses are initially stressed in their natural state, mainly due to the weight of overlying strata and tectonic effects [1]  thus, in situ stress is an important parameter in many aspects of rock mechanics, including rock engineering design, hydraulic fracturing analysis, rock mass permeability and earthquake potential evaluation [1–5]  in these stress-related applications, robust estimation of far-field stress based on the local in situ stress data seems indispensable  however, local values of the in situ stress field within a fractured rock mass may display considerable variability, and so determining the value of the far-field stress to be used as input or boundary loadings for further rock engineering analysis is difficult [1–3, 5]   here, as part of a preliminary investigation into this problem, we use the combined finite-discrete element method (femdem) to examine how the mean of local stress tensors is related to the far-field stress  we first explain the calculation of mean stress [6] and illustrate the rock mass model establishment for the femdem simulation  then, for the rock mass subjected to various boundary loadings, we calculate the means of stress data extracted from the model and compare these with the far-field stress  as a result we are able to give suggestions for the selection of appropriate far-field stress or boundary loadings for further rock engineering applications based on local in situ stress measurement data |

eurock-2017-081 	 a review of uncontrolled pillar failures |abstract  coal burst is a sudden and violent rock/coal failure that occurs in underground coal mines  it is considered to be a highly catastrophic phenomenon which can cause significant damage to mine workings and equipment as well as result in multiple fatalities  throughout the history of underground pillar design, the relation between the post-peak behavior of pillars and stiffness of the surrounding strata has been extensively studied  these two concepts play an important role in determining the failure mode of the coal pillars and the amount of potential energy that can be converted to kinetic energy, which is the cause of coal burst  in this paper, the post-peak behavior of pillars and surrounding strata stiffness are reviewed and the criterion developed to investigate the instability of the pillar failures is explained  it is concluded that, as the pillar width to mining height (w/h) ratio increases, its post-peak modulus increases; and a pillar exhibits different failure modes for various w/h ratios   1  introduction  experiences in both hard rock and coal mines reveal that pillar failures are still one of the major hazards in underground mining and forecasting the mode of the pillar failure can be vital  therefore, it is essential to fully understand the mechanics behind these failures in order to predict and control them  as suggested by tincelin and sinou [1], pillar failures can be classified into two categories:  i  slow, progressive deterioration of the pillars that causes relatively delayed surface subsidence and even damage if the pillars fail,  ii  sudden, violent collapse of pillar causing immediate surface damage and mostly associated with fatal accidents   the first type of pillar failures is also named as controlled pillar failures which occur gradually and typically over long periods of time (i e  pillar spalling)  these pillar failures are also termed as creep and squeeze [2]  uncontrolled pillar failures, on the other hand, take place in a sudden and violent manner and fall into the second group of pillar failures as described above  since the uncontrolled pillar failures occur rapidly and may not be preceded by any deterioration of the pillars, they cause significant health and safety risks (e g  coal burst, entrapment, windblast etc ) [2] |

eurock-2017-101 	 assessment of rockburst hazard based on the data of mine seismology |abstract |processing and interpretation of huge array of mine seismicity data obtained in mines of norilsk nickel mining and metallurgical company has revealed the “pulsating” mode of seismic energy release on the background of an increase in the strata pressure and, based on the information on monthly migration of reduced centers of seismic energy release within the mine fields, enabled development of a rockburst hazard criterion for individual rock mass areas  the prognostic criterion of the limiting state of a rock mass area is developed based on the ratio of kinematic characteristics of seismic events, which are the velocity of a reduced center of seismic energy release and the apparent velocity of “migration” of individual seismic events closely timed within the ranges of stress concentration zones inside the mine fields  verification of this criterion using an ample seismic data base accumulated for a number of years in a mine of norilsk nickel has displayed high sensitivity of the criterion towards the change in the stress state of rock mass areas under monitoring  |1  introduction |currently the largest mines in russia (in the regions of norilsk, tashtagol, apatity, etc ) run multi-channel control of seismic activity  the acquired data on concentrations of sources of seismic events and on dynamics of their energy are highly essential when selecting mining flow charts or choosing precautions to destress rock mass areas where stress concentration is increased [1, 2] |this is specifically important for such a giant of russia’s mining industry as norilsk mining and metallurgical company situated in the polar region  the company’s mines develop deposits of norilsk and talnakh; the layout of one of such mines - oktyabrsky mine - is shown in fig  1 [3]  |2  seismic monitoring in oktyabrsky mine |since 1993 seismic monitoring in oktyabrsky mine is accomplished by the center of automatic geodynamic safety control based on the norilsk seismic station  oktyabrsky mine field accommodates 9 underground seismicity monitoring points | 
eurock-2017-103 	 hydromechanical behavior of a synthetic homogenous carbonate rock during direct shear |abstract  we have conducted a series of hydro-mechanical shear experiments using the csiro direct shear rig  there blocks were fabricated using loose calcite and quartz grains cemented by a calcium-rich fluid that permeated and filled the interconnected pore spaces to bind the grains together, i e  this technology is known as cips (calcite in-situ precipitation system)  those intact homogenous cips blocks (240 <u+00d7> 120 <u+00d7> 150 mm) were sheared to final displacements of 20, 70 or 120 mm under a constant effective vertical stress of 10 mpa   fluid-flow response across the fault zone was monitored during both shear deformation and hold periods, while keeping a constant injection pressure throughout the measurement  on reaching the final displacement (20, 70 or 120 mm), we cored a cylindrical plug of 38 mm diameter that contains fault zone and parts of intact wall rock at either end  in parallel to the experimental study, a 2d mechanical model of the shear experiments was developed using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph), suitable for deformation processes involving very large strains  numerical results were compared with the experimental data for a better understanding of local deformation process, stress distribution and potential tension cracks in samples during shear   shear results show all the tested blocks indicated strain-softening behaviour and the flow rate decreased as displacement increased  plastic deformation is compactant and resulted in the development of localised zone of deformation that decrease the fluid transmissibility of the blocks  furthermore, x-ray ct images show that the created deformation features in the sheared blocks resembled those observed in natural fault zones   1  introduction  the growth of natural faults is controlled by several factors including: tectonics stress, strain rate, pore pressure and host rocks  the impact of faults and their potential reactivation on oil and gas reservoirs have been investigated [1, 2]  compactive and dilatant deformation in porous rocks is a crucial problem in fault development, geotechnical engineering and reservoir/aquifer management  active tectonics and extraction of fluids from buried porous host rocks modify the pore pressure in a reservoir/aquifer, causing variations of the effective stress possibly leading to faulting and inelastic deformation that can in turn adversely affect oil production as in the case of the deep water reservoir in the campos basin [3]  in contrast with sandstone lithologies, limestones and marbles undergo brittle to plastic transition at room temperature for confining pressures accessible in laboratory [4, 5], because calcite requires relatively low shear stresses to initiate mechanical twinning and dislocation activity  the mechanical behaviour of carbonate rocks of a wide range of porosities has been documented by many previous studies [6-8] | 
eurock-2017-104 	 numerical simulation of hydraulic fracturing process in an enhanced geothermal reservoir using a continuum homogenized approach |abstract  the current study presents a numerical modeling approach for three-dimensional simulation of hydro-shearing in jointed rocks for the generation of a man-made, multi-fracture heat exchanger in hot dry rock (hdr) geothermal reservoir  various literatures have suggested the presence of in-situ fractured rock mass even in massive granite formations  thereby, 3d numerical modelling is essential, since the prediction of fracture growth in 3d is key to investigation of different fracture designs and furthermore various operational parameters in order to optimize the heat exchanger design and the resulting energy production  the numerical approach incorporates the dynardo’s approach of homogenized continuum method to simulate the hydro-shearing process in jointed rocks unlike vast majority of commercial and scientific approaches which use the discrete modelling technique  the main motivation of the continuum approach is the numerical efficiency of the 3d coupled hydraulic- mechanical simulations of hydraulic fracturing process in comparison to other alternatives  the input parameters of the numerical model from the best available well log and reservoir data are calibrated from diagnostics measurements such as micro-seismic events, bottom hole pressure, etc to assign the correct level of forecast quality to the important mechanisms of hydraulic fracturing  the numerical procedure is applied to a prospective granite reservoir in thuringen, germany within the purview of a german joint research project - optiriss  the integrated approach involves ansys as a pre-processor and solver, dynardo’s fracturing simulator on top of ansys, tamino - a post-processing tool and optislang - an environment for optimization and uncertainty quantification   energy consumption in the world has seen an ever increasing upward trend since the early part of the 20th century  still a major chunk of the total energy supply comes from non-renewable energy resources with approximately 66 % supplied only by crude oil, natural gas and coal reserves  the large share of these resources are not just restricted to developing economies such as china, brazil, etc  but also economic powerhouses such as usa and the european union [1]  geothermal energy provides tremendous benefits in terms of reducing dependence on fossil fuels, reducing greenhouse emissions and generating new economic and employment opportunities  geothermal power systems aim to extract the inexhaustible heat available beneath the earth's surface  natural geothermal springs are rare to find and hard to locate and in order to reduce dependence on naturally occurring hydrothermal reservoirs, hot dry rock/enhanced geothermal systems (egs) provide a suitable alternative  egs reservoirs are set-up by drilling wells beneath the earth's surface and creating a man-made permeable fracture network between the wells  in the process, hydraulic fracturing is a well-stimulation technique used for creating artificial heat exchanger by creating a network of permeable fractures between injection and production wells | 
eurock-2017-125 	 numerical simulation of size effect of laminated rock |abstract  roof and rib falls are still a leading cause of injuries in underground coal mines  when numerical simulation method is adopted to study this phenomenon, the influence of regular laminations on strength and size effect should be carefully considered because rock mass of roof is usually laminated  in order to get an insight into the influence of different lamination factors on size effect, cubic rock specimens with different sizes, stress directions, lamination orientations and lamination spacing were tested under true tri-axial conditions with 3dec  the results show that regular lamination can cause size effect even without considering size effect of the intact rock and rock joints  the influence of lamination orientation on size effect is distinct and is orientation-dependent while the influence of lamination thickness is minimal  changing dip or stress direction will affect the influence of orientation and size effect as well   1  introduction  improvements in roof control technology have led to significant decrease in accidents related to roof and rib falls  this brought the number of injury from roof and rib falls from 377 in 2012 down to 265 in 2013 [1]  but roof fall is still a leading cause of injuries in underground coal mines  and numerical simulation method has been widely used to investigate the mechanism and prevention of such problems [2-4]  proper rock mechanics property, however, is crucial to obtain practical results in numerical simulation  size effect is an important factor when laboratory-determined strength value is used to determine rock mass strength value for simulation   due to the importance of size effect, studies have been conducted to investigate the relationship between rock strength and their size  bieniawski [5] conducted extensive underground tests on cubical coal specimens ranging from 0 75 inches to 6 6 ft in size  singh and huck [6] performed tri-axial compression tests on specimens with diameters ranging from 2 to 36 inches and approximate 50 percent strength reduction was observed  medhurst and brown [7] performed tri-axial compression tests on coal specimens with diameters of 61, 101, 146 and 300 mm to investigate size effect on mechanical behaviour of coal  besides, numerical simulation was widely used to investigate size effect  adey and pusch [8] simulated size effect with boundary element method by considering larger discontinuities with increasing specimen volume  the discrete element program ca2 was used [9] to simulate size effect and the result shows that initial crack length must be increased faster than specimen size to capture size effect  scholtes et al  [10] studied size effect of coal by simulating true tri-axial compression tests with a discrete element model, which shows the capability to reproduce the dependency of strength on specimen size  zhang et al  [11] investigated size effect with bonded particle model, where the initial fractures were considered as randomly orientated and located disks | 
eurock-2017-131 	 integration of elastic stiffness anisotropy into ubiquitous joint model |abstract  this paper applies a modified ubiquitous joint plane model (modified ubi) to describe the mechanical behavior of layered rock masses  the constitutive model is an implicit-continuum based one where the joints are smeared across the rock mass  this modified model concerns not only the strength anisotropy but also it integrates the elastic stiffness anisotropy  thus, the elastic stress increments and the plastic corrections from the original ubiquitous joint model have been altered  now, it is possible to simulate the elastic and plastic behavior of transversely isotropic rocks  modified ubi is applied to simulate the behavior of the transverse isotropic rock samples in uniaxial compressive loading and triaxial loading tests  the results out of the modified model were compared to the analytical solution from jaeger and the caniso model from flac 8 0   1  introduction  determining the rock mass properties and expecting its behavior are matter of the modelling of the discontinuities in the rock continua  because of the complex mechanism of the rock mass which may not be directly predicted using the conventional ways of modeling (such as: closed form solutions or physical modelling); numerical modelling is one of the most trending means to model behavior of rock mass [1]  the condition of the rock mass (such as: excessively fractured or reasonably fractured or intact massive) and the scale of the engineering application (i e : layering is significantly smaller or bigger than the scale of the application) affect strongly the optimum approach selection of the applied numerical model, either continuum-based approach or discontinuum-based one [2]  modelling of layered rock mass is still a point of interest between different computational tools which either consider the joint implicitly (i e : flac - ubiquitous joint model) or use the explicit representation of the discontinuities (i e : udec - discreet element model) [3]  however, both the computational power and time consumed in calculation limit the usage of such discrete approaches  the accuracy of different implicit joint models has been investigated between both the ubiquitous joint model and cosserat model [4]  this paper adopts the continuum-based approach to implicitly model an isotropic rock mass (i e : smeared joints) | 
eurock-2017-137 	 three-dimensional elastic analysis of rock excavations by using the g2 constant displacement discontinuity method |abstract  a fast computational code is presented that is dedicated for the elastic analysis of three-dimensional excavations and cracks in rocks  the problem is solved on the boundaries that are discretized with a new triangular leaf constant displacement discontinuity element with one collocation point  the creation of the new triangular element was inspired from mindlin’s special version of grade-2 or strain-gradient elasticity theory (second gradient of displacement, g2)  this element is characterized by a much better measure of the average stress at the center of gravity of the triangular element compared to that of the classical elasticity element close to regions with stress or strain gradients (e g  notches, cracks etc)  in a verification stage, the accuracy of the computational algorithm for the pressurized penny-shaped and mixed-mode elliptical crack problems that have analytical solutions is demonstrated  more specifically, it is shown that the average error of the crack tip stress intensity factor predicted by the gradient modified method for nine discretizations of varying density is around 3 5 % with a maximum error of 5 %, while the constant displacement discontinuity element displays errors varying around 14 %  moreover, the new method preserves the simplicity and hence the high speed of the constant displacement discontinuity with only one collocation point per element, but it is far more efficient compared to it, especially close to the crack tips and corners of excavations where the displacement and stress gradients are highest   1  introduction  it is almost certain that any planned underground excavation in the scale of 101 m or more will transect a fault or persistent joint  the problem in the design phase is to examine the effect of the faults on the behavior of the rock mass during excavation and then to optimize the design of the underground openings and pillars  in geophysics there remains the reasonable trend to explain earthquake mechanisms by means of dislocation or fracture mechanics models  also, in petroleum engineering as well as in rock mechanics, the hydraulic fracturing technique where a pressurized mode-i crack propagates from a shallow or deep borehole, is widely used for permeability enhancement and measurement of in situ stresses, respectively  there many more problems involving threedimensional excavations and fractures that should be attacked with computational methods capable to tackle in a formal and accurate manner crack tip or corner singularities | 
eurock-2017-139 	 rock mechanics is meeting the challenge of geo-energies |abstract  the exploitation of geo-energies often leads to difficulties that rock mechanics helps to overcome  these essentially consist of instability problems caused by changes in the state of stress, associated pore pressures, and temperature  besides the classical near field problem of wellbore stability, the changes can impact a larger scale, triggering earthquakes and inducing seismicity  in this paper the current approaches envisaged to tackle these problems are briefly reviewed and discussed  some extensions that have been made possible thanks to the combination of new numerical techniques will be outlined   1  introduction  the term geo-energy could be defined as the set of energy sources that the earth produces  as in physical science where all is energy or matter, this would include fossil fuels such as coal, oil, gas or organic matter (wood) which is nowadays classified as unconventional geo-resources   in fact, the neologism “geo-energy” is mostly devoted to the energy that has been created from the temperature of the earth and which is used to heat or to produce electricity  this is the case for geothermal energy [1]; the exploitation of geothermal energy was considered a long time ago [2], but it has only taken off in the last twenty years  the main reason is the urgent need to limit emissions of greenhouse gases and the lure of a renewable resource [3]   despite the fact that many other issues could be related to geo-energies, such as energy storage by compressed air for instance, this paper will be limited to rock mechanics problems associated with enhanced geothermal systems   2  enhanced geothermal system (egs)  2 1  principle and brief history  the principle of a geothermal installation can be schematically represented by two boreholes  from the first borehole the injected cold water circulates into the rock mass and is heated up in contact with the hot rock  this hot water is then extracted in the second borehole and treated to remove energy  later, this cooled water is re-injected in the first borehole  the effectiveness and the efficiency of the system depends on the existence or the formation of a sufficient exchange surface in the hot dry rock formation, between the two boreholes |

eurock-2017-142 	 keynote: fatigue hydraulic fracturing |abstract  in this article, the concept of fatigue hydraulic fracturing (fhf) is described, and its geothermal application is discussed  the basic idea behind fatigue fracturing is to vary the effective stress magnitudes at the fracture tip to optimize fracture initiation and growth  the optimization process can include lowering seismic radiated energy and/or generating fracture networks with various geometry and permeability  historically, we start referring to results from mechanical laboratory core testing, discrete element simulation of fluid-induced seismicity, and application of cyclic water-fracs at the enhanced geothermal system site gn<u+03b2>-schonebeck, germany  then, an in situ experiment at aspo hard rock laboratory is summarized to bridge the gap between laboratory core testing and wellbore-size hydraulic fracture treatments in hard rock  three different fluid injection schemes (continuous, progressive and pulse injection) are tested underground in naturally fractured, crystalline rock mass in terms of associated induced seismicity and permeability performance  under controlled conditions, hydraulic fractures are extended to about 20-40 m2 in size from a 28 m long, horizontal borehole drilled from a tunnel at 410 m depth  the facture process is mapped by an extensive array of acoustic emission and micro-seismic monitoring instruments  results from three water-injection tests in avro granodiorite indicate that the fracture breakdown pressure in tendency becomes lower and the number of fluid-induced seismic events becomes less when continuous, conventional fluid injection is replaced by progressive fluid-injection with several phases of depressurization simulating the fatigue treatment  one reason for this may be that in the dynamic, fatigue treatment a larger fracture process zone is generated compared to the size of the fluid pressurized zone developing during the injection phases into crystalline rock  we see mine-scale tests with hybrid sensor arrays of importance to identify and understand the actual hydraulic fracture mechanisms in hard rock  in addition, the mesoscale data obtained underground allow downscaling to laboratory core results, and upscaling to borehole reservoir stimulation results   1  introduction  hydraulic fracture growth through naturally fractured rock is an area of interest and current research for petroleum, mining and geothermal applications  in particular in the development of enhanced geothermal systems (egs), hydraulic fracturing is used to form fracture networks connecting injection and production well for heat exchange purposes  however, hydraulic fracturing imposes environmental risks, one of which is induced seismicity associated with the permeability enhancement process [1-3]  of particular interest are, therefore, methods that limit the number and magnitude of seismic events while the required fracture permeability is obtained  in this context, the fatigue hydraulic fracturing (fhf) concept and the multi-stage hydraulic stimulation concept have been proposed  the key point in fatigue hydraulic fracturing is the frequent lowering of the injection pressure to allow stress relaxation at the fracture tip [4]  reducing the maximum injection pressure by alternative injection schemes will affect the damage zone surrounding the fracture and also the radiation pattern of seismic events associated with fracture growth [5]  for multi-stage stimulation, instead of massive stimulation, injection rate and pressure are controlled, and the reservoir is formed stage by stage [6, 7] |

eurock-2017-149 	 modelling dynamic fracture propagation in rock |abstract  fracture propagation in brittle rock is very fast and highly dynamic  typically this process consists of fracture initiation, propagation and termination  growth of micro-fractures is conceptually and numerically well established, however, current practices to model fracture propagation in rock employs slow evolving static regimes that do not represent the true nature of fracture propagation in the laboratory or the field  this paper presents a newly developed numerical approach using micro-brittle dynamics theory to model the propagation of fractures through rock in real time  this work presented here is based on a newly developed dynamic rock fracture model (drfm2d) and validated against laboratory experiments   1  introduction  current advances in computing technology have enabled solutions of many complex geotechnical problems  however when a presence of large fractures dominate strata behaviour, these solutions may not be correct  available numerical software can be generally divided into three groups: elastic, inelastic time-dependent implicit and inelastic time-dependent explicit  these are briefly discussed in table 1   whilst available inelastic time-dependent explicit methods are currently used to simulate ground failure, they are in most cases not employed correctly  most researchers will use the quasi-static formulation and slow evolving material damage to resolve highly dynamic fracture phenomena, consequently they are not capable of capturing true real time dynamic brittle effects occurring within the rock mass   new development of a 2-dimensional dynamic rock fracture model (drfm2d) in flac2d [1] challenges the use of numerical methods, demonstrating superior computational efficiencies towards accurately modelling the dynamic brittle fracture propagation through rock in real time  our currently developed drfm2d model is focused on the practical application of fracture dynamics in engineering  an overview of the natural physical processes and the governing constitutive laws is outlined here   2  micro-brittle dynamics (mbd)  2 1  micro-scale dynamic response  the dynamic action of the smallest finite mass in a continuum model represents the discrete dynamic response of a single element  in general, mechanical stress-strain response of any brittle or ductile rock past the elastic limit can follow one of four behaviours; strain hardening, elastic-plastic, strain softening or perfectly brittle  these rock failure types are illustrated in fig  1a  in micro-brittle dynamics (mbd), where brittle materials are unable to absorb plastic deformation energy prior to fracture, the dynamic micro-scale interactions exhibit an ideal brittle failure response  this occurs at the elastic strength limit taking the brittle failure path curve in time as illustrated in fig  1b | 
eurock-2017-150 	 an analytical study of failure of transversely isotropic rock discs subjected to various diametrical loading configurations |abstract  the indirect (brazilian) tensile strength test is commonly used in rock engineering and rock mechanics  most of the research on how to interpret brazilian test is only valid for isotropic rock  the load may be applied to disc shaped samples through flat platens or curved jaws and the different load configurations give rise to subtle but important differences to stress distributions throughout samples during testing and at the onset of failure  to reliably obtain the tensile strength accurate stress distributions, especially at the location of the initial crack, must be determined  however, most real rocks exhibit a certain type of anisotropy known as transverse isotropy due to the presence of preferred directions of grains, beddings, microcracks or pores  this study focuses on the failure modes when transverse isotropy is present  previous studies for transverse isotropy indicate that the exact location of the initial crack is at the disc centre  these studies, however, ignore the effect of the load contact configuration on the stress distribution  this paper overcomes this limitation and applies amadei’s analytical solution to assess the effects of the load contact area on the stress distribution  the stress distribution is coupled with a transverse isotropy failure criterion in a mechanically consistent way to find the exact location of initial crack  it is shown that the location of the initial crack depends on the transverse isotropy orientation and load configuration   1  introduction  the brazilian test is a diametrical compression test that is used as an indirect tensile strength measurement  at first, the test was proposed by carneiro [1] and akazawa [2] to obtain tensile strength of concrete  in 1978, the international society for rock mechanics (isrm) officially presented brazilian test as a standard method to indirectly determine the tensile strength of rock like materials (isrm 2007)   nowadays the brazilian test is widely used to determine tensile strength of rock like materials because of its simple specimen preparation, experimental performance and data reduction [3-4]  in the test, a thin disc is diametrically compressed  the corresponding stress field throughout the specimen is highly non-uniform |

i-17-157 	 dynamic responses of offshore wind turbines on bucket foundations in sand considering soil structure interaction |abstract  a computationally efficient model including the dynamic wind turbine bucket-soil interaction is proposed  in this model, euler-bernoulli beam theory is used to depict the tower of the turbine, bucket foundation is modeled as a rigid shell due to its small length to radius ratio; while the seabed is modeled as an elastic soil half-space  analytical frequency dependent dynamic impedance functions will be used to model the effect of dynamic soil-structure interaction  the natural frequencies and dynamic responses of the whole system at various loading conditions will be studied  the impedance matrix model is validated by comparing with a coupled finite-infinite element model   introduction  scientifically develop and utilize offshore wind power energy has a special significance on improving the country's energy structure, alleviating such problems as environmental pollution  ensure the safety of the offshore wind turbines in the life cycle operation is the fundamental guarantee of offshore wind power development  in order to better use of the offshore wind, the megawatts of turbines increase continuously these days  with the tower becoming higher and slender, the whole structures become softer and weaker, coupled with its operation process will be affected by wind, wave, flow, earthquake and its operation loads at various low frequencies, if poorly designed, resonant fatigue failure can easily develop  in order to anchor the wind turbines to the seabed, cylindrical bucket foundations (like a reversed bucket, and can be installed easily and quickly by pumping water out of the bucket to create pressure difference) have attracted a lot of interest  bucket foundation is a real sense of environmental friendly foundation, as there is no noise when installation, small impact on the environment, and can be recycled many times repeatedly  besides, high cost has become a serious problem for offshore wind power industry  bucket foundation has the potential to save the industry for its low construction costs  however, compared to the numerous studies on the dynamic characters of piles (achmus, et al , 2009; bisoi, and haldar, 2014; gazetas and dobry, 1984; lombardi, et al , 2013; pak and jennings, 1987; novak, 1974; rajapakse and shah, 1987; zania, 2014), there are quite few studies on the dynamics responses of bucket foundations: liingaard et al  (2007) studied the impedance of bucket foundations in a viscoelastic medium using the coupled bem-fem method  he et al (2016, 2017) obtained both the vertical, and the coupled horizontal and rocking impedance functions for a rigid cylindrical shell embedded in seabed, using a rigorous analytical method  besides, field trials of bucket foundations both in clay and sand are studied by houlsby et al (2005, 2006) and the complex rotational dynamic impedance is obtained | 
i-17-193 	 investigation on bearing capacity of concrete suction caisson in clay |abstract  nowadays, there is still no existing specification for bearing capacity of caisson in engineering design  in order to study the bearing capacity of caisson, model tests were respectively conducted using two kinds of kaolin samples with different preconsolidated pressures  moreover, finite element method (fem) and bearing capacity formulas were adopted in analysis of bearing capacity  the results obtained by those formulas and fem were compared with those of the model tests  the fem obtained the closer results with the tests than those of formulas  besides, the bearing capacity factors were also concluded in this paper   introduction  suction caisson is a large, hollow, cylindrical steel or concrete structure which resembles upturned buckets  it is also known as suction anchor, suction pile, or bucket foundation  the principle of the suction caisson technique is to generate downward net force by applying suction inside a sealed cylindrical caisson, which makes the caisson sinking into the seabed soil  after the suction is removed, the construction of the caisson foundation is finished even without treating the soft soil in the deep sea, which has economic and environmental advantage over the traditional driven piles method  in recent years, suction caisson has been successfully employed in many projects, including mooring anchors (andersen and jostad, 1999; randolph et al , 2011), breakwaters or sea walls (chu et al , 2012), offshore platforms (zhang and ding, 2011), and foundation for wind turbines in deep waters (byrne, b  w  and cassidy, m  j , 2002; houlsby, g  t  and byrne, b  w  houlsby et al , 2005)   when sinking the caisson, the pressure difference between the caisson cavity and the external seawater could contribute to the driven force  the main design challenge for this case is to penetrate the caisson deep enough into the seabed so that it can provide the required bearing capacity and keep the displacement within acceptable value under the design loading  some centrifuge tests were carried on with steel suction caissons (fuglsang and steensen-bach, 1991; clukey and morrison, 1993, 1995; watson and randolph, 1997; allersma et al , 2000), and the previous studies also focused more on the steel ones  concrete caissons have many advantages over the steel ones, such as (1) higher erosion resistance, (2) lower construction cost, and (3) easier construction of a seamless whole structure  however, in concrete caissons, the ratios of skirt thickness to external diameter are usually very high (chu et al , 2012) | 
i-17-207 	 discrete element simulation of ship breaking through ice ridges |abstract  the paper describes a simulation tool for estimating the ridge breaking ability of ships and offshore structures, based on the discrete element method (dem)  fundamentals of the method are given, including contact detection and forces calculation  artificial ridges are created into the simulation domain by means of floating-up technique  hull geometry is introduced into the model, handling non-convex bodies as composites of convex bodies  hydrostatic properties are calculated according to actual draft, pitch and roll angles  calibration and validation phases are carried out, comparing numerical simulation with model tests using underwater video snapshots from model tests and quantitative comparison of measured time series   introduction  sea ice ridges are one of the most difficult obstacles encountered in ice-covered seas  when two ice sheets come into contact, they break and small pieces of ice accumulate along a line, creating large floating structures embedded in the ice sheet  with a keel depth sometimes exceeding 30m, ice ridges represent considerable obstacles to ship navigation, but also to floating structures and vessels under dynamic positioning operations  in the context of increasing activities in polar regions, the present work focuses on the estimation of the ridge breaking ability of ships and offshore structures  the paper discusses the working principle of newly-developed simulation software based on the discrete element method (dem)   numerical modeling of ice ridge creation, ice ridge breaking and ice ridge/structure interaction are relatively new research topics  naval architects and ship designers at early design stage are often interested in assessing the capability of a vessel to navigate through ice ridges  for this purpose ehle (2011) developed a method that enables calculating ship's velocity and resistance during ridge breaking, taking into account hull bow shape and ship's power  numerical implementation has been performed by hisette (2014)  the aforementioned method is based on available analytical formulae and results of model tests in ice tank but does not allow visualization of ship behavior in the ridge and simulate different possible interaction scenarios | 
i-17-224 	 effective stress analysis of a dynamically installed anchor penetrating into rate-dependent soil |abstract  this paper presents a dynamic large deformation finite element approach based on frequent mesh regeneration within the effective stress framework and investigates the penetration behavior of a dynamically installed anchor in normally consolidated kaolin clay  the strain rate dependency of clayey soil is represented by an elasto-viscoplastic soil model  the numerical model is validated against existing centrifuge testing data  the anchor deceleration profiles and the development of excess pore pressures around the anchor are discussed  a parameteric study is then conducted to explore the effect of impact velocity on the final embedment depth   introduction  recently introduced dynamically installed anchors (dias) have been regarded as a cost-effective anchoring solution for floating structures in deep waters  they are usually rocket shaped equipped with three or four fins at the trailing edge  the dias are installed by releasing from a design height above the mudline  the anchor is then penetrated into the seabed via the kinetic energy gained during the free-fall in the water column and the anchor's submerged self-weight  the quick installation process can be regarded as nearly undrained conditions, especially in clayey sediments, and significant excess pore water pressures are accumulated around the anchor  an anchor installation is generally followed by a set-up period, prior to applying operational loadings, allowing dissipation of the installation induced excess pore water pressures up to some degree   to date, the dynamic penetration behavior of dias have been explored mainly through field trials and centrifuge tests, while a limited number of numerical studies have been conducted  the anchor penetration from the mudline to the final embedment depth was replicated using a computational fluid dynamics method (raie and tassoulas, 2009) and large deformation finite element (ldfe) approaches (nazem et al , 2012; kim and hossain, 2015; kim et al , 2015a, 2015b; liu et al , 2016)  however, almost all previous numerical analyses on dia installation were within the framework of total stress, in which the development of excess pore pressures during penetration and the subsequent dissipation could not be considered directly  this limitation may lead to an inaccurate prediction of pullout capacities at an operational stage, which is dictated largely by the degree of dissipation or consolidation, unless an artificially increased undrained shear strength of the adjacent soil is considered (kim and hossain, 2016, 2017)  therefore, an effective stress analysis is required to gain comprehensive interpretation of the soil response during dynamic installation and to compute accurate capacity under operational loading | 
i-17-231 	 effect of near-surface crustal layers on the vertical penetration response of subsea pipelines |abstract  in this paper, the undrained vertical bearing capacity of subsea pipelines installed on a surficial high shear strength crust overlying a soft clay is studied  a large deformation finite element methodology which incorporates frequent remeshing and mapping of all state variables from an old geometry to a new geometry was adopted for the current work  various relative shear strength ratios of crust to underlying soil and pipe diameters were considered for the parametric study  it was observed from the results that, the presence of crustal layer significantly influences the vertical penetration response of pipelines   introduction  as the offshore industry is exploring hydrocarbon reserves in remote geographic locations, a thin layer of crust exhibiting an abnormal shear strength overlying a normally-consolidated clay deposit is often encountered  the high shear strength in the crust region can be attributed to the biochemical activities of micro-organisms living in the vicinity of the seabed (kuo and bolton, 2013)  deepwater subsea pipelines carrying hydrocarbons at very high temperature and pressure are often installed on this crustal sediments directly without any trenching or additional protection  the vertical penetration of these pipelines during the installation process is generally an undrained phenomenon involving formation of soil heave around the pipe that influences the vertical bearing capacity  it is very essential to accurately assess the penetration response of pipelines installed on a surficial crust for the design of on-bottom submarine pipelines   in the recent past, researchers have conducted several studies on the vertical bearing capacity of subsea pipelines either using classical plasticity solutions (randolph and white, 2008b, martin and white, 2012) or small strain analysis by applying finite element technique (aubeny et al , 2005; merifield et al , 2008, 2009)  experimental studies based on centrifuge modelling (dingle et al , 2008) were also carried out to understand the pipe-soil behavior albeit they are limited to specific cases  numerical finite element analyses adopting large deformation approach (wang et al , 2010; chatterjee, 2012) was also undertaken to examine the much more realistic scenario of vertical penetration response of seabed pipelines on clay seabed  during installation of a pipeline on the seabed, the pipe embeds into the seafloor because of its self-weight and dynamic oscillations of laying vessels (randolph and white, 2008a)  the soil heave developed due to penetration process has a remarkable influence on lateral pipe-soil behavior (white and cheuk, 2008; white and dingle, 2011)  very few studies available in the literature consider the effect of high strength crustal layer present near the seabed on the penetration response of subsea pipelines  park et al  (2010) determined the bearing capacity factors for shallow foundation on a stiff non-homogeneous crustal layer overlying a very soft clay  morrow and bransby (2011) conducted a series of small strain analyses using finite difference method to study the effect of different shear strength profiles and crust shear strength on vertical penetration of seabed pipelines  martin and white (2012) considered the pipe as a rigid plane strain element and studied the ultimate bearing capacity using limit analysis  recently feng et al  (2015) examined the influence of near surface crust on the ultimate load carrying capacity of mudmats considering loads from all six directions | 
i-17-244 	 effect of pipe-soil interface roughness on undrained uplift capacity of buried offshore pipelines |abstract  estimation of undrained uplift capacity of buried offshore pipelines involves several soil, structure and interface parameters  for buried pipelines, undrained uplift capacity is significantly influenced by pipesoil interface roughness coefficient  design guidelines for obtaining uplift capacity exist in literature for perfectly smooth and fully rough interfaces  this paper aims at estimating undrained uplift capacity over entire range of interface roughness coefficient  for this purpose, a number of finite element analyses have been carried out by varying interface roughness coefficient and other parameters  the obtained results are validated with plasticity theory based solutions  present study shows that the simplistic approach of linear interpolation of capacity with roughness coefficient leads to slightly conservative design   introduction  global energy demand has increased manyfold over the past few decades and as a result offshore hydrocarbon extraction facilities are being built both at nearshore and deep water regions  offshore pipeline systems are one of the vital components of oil and gas extraction facilities as they are used for transporting oil within fields and also to shore  these pipelines, laid on the seabed at ambient temperature, are either placed on the seabed (on-bottom pipelines used in deep water locations) or are buried into the seabed using trenching  burying the pipes enhances its thermal insulation and thus helps in achieving higher flow velocities within the pipelines  burial also protects these pipelines from hydrodynamic wave loading and fishing activities  since, these pipes carry oil and gas at high temperatures compared to the temperature at which they were laid, they tend to elongate  however, elongation in the longitudinal direction is resisted by frictional resistances developed in the environing soil mass and thus the pipes get subjected to compressive forces  for buried pipelines, this axial compressive force is at times large enough to induce buckling in the upward direction which is resisted predominantly due to shear strength of soil, self-weight of soil cover and mobilized interface tension  as the pipe undergoes uplift, shear stresses start building within the adjoining soil mass resulting in increase in soil resistance till it reaches a peak  the post-peak soil response often shows a decrease in resistance  the maximum uplift resistance offered by the soil during pipe uplift is termed as uplift capacity (which excludes the pipe weight as per common definition)  upheaval buckling can often occur under undrained conditions in soil depending on rate of loading, soil permeability and drainage conditions  thus, estimation of undrained uplift capacity and optimal burial depth becomes essential as pipeline design is an important economic factor in offshore industries | 
i-17-295 	 generalized semi-analytical solution for laterally loaded pile in multi-layered soils with transfer matrix method |abstract  determining the response of the laterally loaded piles analytically is one of the challenging problems due to the complexity of soil-pile interaction models and the difficulty to solve governing difference equations  in this paper, a general solution for laterally loaded piles is proposed for multilayered soil systems with any forms of p-y curves  the generalized solution of laterally loaded pile was formulated based on the transfer matrix approach  the elastic and plastic transfer matrix coefficients for pile segment at any depth were analytically obtained through laplace transformation  validations of the proposed method are performed through comparison between our predictions with the results from existing methods  good agreements are reached which implies that the proposed method can be employed as an alternative method to effectively evaluate the response of laterally loaded piles  moreover, a parametric study on pile bending stiffness is performed to investigate its influence on the ultimate capacity of laterally loaded piles in the same soil profile  we found that these three piles with different bending stiffness would have the same limit state distribution of soil resistance along the pile with the same rotation center below soil surface, which will yield identical ultimate lateral bearing capacity and corresponding maximum bending moment (mmax) for the piles  under the concept of the maximum bending moment (mmax), it would be more rigorous to define a rigid pile when plastic moment mp along the pile exceeds mmax and to define a flexible pile when mp is less than mmax, especially for piles in multilayered soil deposits   introduction  piles are extensively used as foundations not only to transfer vertical loads from upper structures to surrounding soils, but also to bear horizontal forces and moments simultaneously  in offshore engineering (e g , offshore wind turbine and oil production platforms), the piles are mainly designed to resist the lateral loads mainly from the wind to the upper structure, water pressure and seismic activity to the foundation (basu et al , 2008)  the subgrade reaction concept of laterally loaded piles was introduced since the piles behave as winkler model against lateral loads  to determine the pile responses rigorously is one of the challenging problems due to the complexity of soil-pile interaction and difficulty of solving the governing fourth order differential equation on the basis of subgrade reaction approach | 
i-17-307 	 suction buckets behaviour under tensile loads: a numerical study with fem |abstract  suction bucket jackets (sbj) are found as a suitable alternative to driven piles for the support of foundations for offshore wind energy converters  in the case of jackets or multipods, a predominant vertical load is to be expected  the effect of such a tensile loading is the generation of suction in the soil inside the bucket which leads to an increment of tensile capacity  this paper aims to study the bearing behaviour of a suction foundation by taking into account how the soil permeability and the loading rate influence the foundation behaviour  moreover, after submitting the structure to a storm load, the bearing capacity is studied again, in order to see the effect of such a load on the bucket's bearing behaviour  this study is carried out by means of finite element numerical simulations based on the formulation of biot's equations combined with a constitutive model that reproduces the key aspects of cyclic soil behaviour in the frame of generalized plasticity   introduction  the urgent need for a clean and sustainable energy, followed by the progressive depletion of the finite hydrocarbon reserves, has lead several worldwide countries to aim to achieve energetic goals by exploiting wind energy, where offshore turbines play a major role  for geotechnical engineers, the design of foundations for offshore wind energy turbines faces a series of important challenges, such as dimensions and their high ratio of lateral and vertical loads  for this reason, due to the growing interest in exploiting deep waters and the site characteristics, different strategies are taken into consideration   even though traditionally offshore wind turbines are founded on gravity concrete foundations or monopiles, research projects on suction caissons (byrne, 2000; feld, 2001; houlsby, ibsen, & byrne, 2005) have largely found this technology as a valid alternative  suction caissons are originally used in the oil and gas industry for offshore structures and however the concept is well known, in the case of wind energy turbines, load conditions change drastically  the loads typically found in these structures are cyclic and a combination of a relatively low vertical load combined with horizontal forces inducing an overturning moment  in the design of such structures, it is definitively of most importance to consider the cycling effects, not just with pseudo-static approaches where the cyclic degradation it is just an estimation of the accumulated displacements without reflecting the actual physical state  on the other hand, hydromechanical coupling in the saturated sea bed is often not taken into account for practical design and the effects of the development of excess pore pressure around or inside the caisson on a cycle by cycle basis are often neglected  moreover, the distribution of total stresses within the soil may be changing continuously because of the reduction of soil stiffness when the pore pressure increases (taiebat, 1999)  it is therefore not possible to determine the failure stress state from the initial conditions at the beginning of the cyclic load and the need to consider a fully coupled nature of the problem in hand by using a general framework is suggested | 
i-17-321 	 capacity degradation method for driven steel piles under cyclic axial loading |abstract  the piles used for jacket type foundation for an offshore wind turbine are subjected to highly cyclic tension and compressive loading  the pile capacity under cyclic axial loading decreases with number of loading cycles due to the reduction of pile shaft resistance  a numerical simulation scheme is presented, which allows the calculation of pile capacity degradation (cdm) due to cyclic loading for driven steel piles  the volume compaction of soil near pile surface during the cyclic loading is determined from cyclic simple shear test results and is then applied to the pile-soil system   from the limited number of tests available, interaction diagrams have been developed, which give the number of load cycles leading to failure dependent on the mean load and the amplitude of the cyclic load portion, both related to the static pile capacity  however, such diagrams cannot account for different soil conditions or pile geometry and pile stiffness  the calculation results for piles with three different embedded lengths in sandy soil under cyclic loading in tension are presented and compared with the existing interaction diagrams  finally, recommendations regarding necessary further investigations and improvements of the method are given   introduction  jacket type foundation of offshore wind turbines are supported by steel pipe piles located at the edges of the foot print area (fig 1)  these piles are often subjected to intensive cyclic axial loads due to wind and waves  a loading time series applied on the pile (pile 4 in fig  1) of a reference wind turbine is presented in fig  2  under cyclic axial load, the pile capacity decreases with increasing number of load cycles  this occurs mainly due to a decrease of ultimate skin friction, whereas the tip resistance is believed to remain almost unchanged   although numerous studies have been carried out regarding pile capacity under cyclic loading, no approved calculation approach yet exists to determine the decrease of capacity dependent on cyclic load magnitude and number of load cycles  at the institute of the first three authors, a new simulation scheme was developed, which allows the calculation of pile capacity degradation (cdm) due to cyclic loading for driven steel piles [abdel-rahman & achmus (2011a & 2011b), abdel-rahman et al (2014a & 2014b), achmus et al  (2015)]  herein, the system behavior under the first loading and unloading step is simulated by a finite element calculation  from the resulting shear strain amplitude in each soil element, the volume compaction to be expected under the considered number of load cycles is predicted by an approach derived from cyclic simple shear tests conducted with sandy soil by silver & seed (1971)  this volume compaction is applied to the elements in the finite element model and results in a reduction of the normal stresses acting on the pile  in a subsequent loading stage, the (reduced) post-cyclic capacity of the pile is determined |

nrms-2017-013 	 introducing a 2d experimental set-up for modeling hydraulic fracturing in synthetic rock-like materials |abstract |crack initiation and propagation is a three-dimensional process  most of the analytical solutions (such as pkn and kgd models) and numerical models treat crack propagation as a two-dimensional (2d) process  yet, there is no experimental study, which can provide a one to one comparison in 2d to validate these kinds of models  the 2d experimental set-up equipped with a high-speed camera provides continuous video record and measurement of fracture path  a speckle pattern is applied in order to accurately measure surface deformation with digital image correlation (dic)  a transparent material is used in order to have a direct viewing of fracture growth  the results provide information about the breakdown pressure, fracture growth direction, width and fracture speed  |introduction |hydraulic fracturing has been used in different applications since 1950 there are still many open questions and uncertainties related to hydraulic fracturing  observing the fracture geometry in field treatments is almost impossible, except in special tests with extensive seismic monitoring (abe et al , 1983; vinegar et al , 1992), even in those cases it is believed (de pater et al , 1994) the data interpretation needs to be more developed  to better understand the behavior of rock during a hydraulic fracturing treatment, numerous studies have been undertaken and several physical models developed to investigate rock behavior during the injection  laboratory tests should, therefore, serve as benchmarks for numerical simulations  |in this study, an innovative two-dimensional set-up is introduced for conducting hydraulic fracturing on low-strength rock-like materials  |1  background |there are three different approaches for simulating crack propagation  (1) analytical, (2) numerical and (3) physical models are introduced and related literature are summarized | 
nrms-2017-018 	 numerical modelling and seismicity at the kiirunavaara mine, sweden |abstract |the ability to use cutting edge tools, such as numerical modelling, to predict seismically active volumes is a clear goal of today’s geomechanical engineers  a knowledge of problem volumes in advance of drifting and production would lead to a safer working environment, where risk mitigating design can be implemented  while specific successful cases exist, a standard approach for numerical stress analysis of seismicity is not currently available in the literature  |this paper presents the use of numerical modelling to analyse seismically active volumes of luossavaara- kiirunavaara ab’s (lkab) kiirunavaara mine, a 4 5 km long, iron orebody extracted using sublevel caving  crack initiation and slip along pre-existing discontinuities were evaluated using itasca’s flac3d software and compared to mine seismicity  results were used to evaluate expected changes in seismically active volumes with planned production  hanging-wall seismicity was correlated with the location of plastic failure in the models, as well as differential stress near the production front  less clear relationships existed between footwall seismicity and model results, however, many orientations of discontinues have the possibility to slip, and therefore may contribute to seismicity  patterns in orientations of discontinuities that can slip were consistent in the footwall drifts relative to the active production level, regardless of the depth of production evaluated  in general, the models did not indicate any expected changes in seismically active volumes with planned production  |1  introduction |it is undisputable that an understanding of the phenomena of seismicity in rock masses will improve mine safety  although prediction of specific seismic events does not seem achievable (e g  mckinnon, 2006), identification of areas that have a higher risk of seismic activity seems within reach  numerical stress analysis models are the leading-edge tools to understand rock mass behaviour, and much effort has been put towards the modelling of seismicity (e g  diederichs, 2000; andrieux et al , 2008; beck et al , 2009; sjoberg et al , 2011; ghazvinian et al , 2014)  however, to date, a standardised and accepted strategy to numerically model seismicity that successfully reproduces this behaviour for all cases does not exist |
