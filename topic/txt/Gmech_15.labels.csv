The general increase in the use of LWD measurements worldwide has meant that LWD acoustics measurements are being made in a greater variety of hole sizes, borehole conditions and formation types than ever before. These include a variety of anisotropic formations such as those encountered in unconventional operations. Where anisotropy is present then its correct characterization can be critically important for a variety of applications including seismic processing, geomechanics and wellbore stability, completions design and production management. |The non-uniquely directional nature of the quadrupole mode means that it is not yet possible to reliably extract the fast and slow shear anisotropy information from quadrupole data. Dipole tools are commonly used as solutions when this information is needed. Dipole measurements are currently only routinely available on wireline devices due to the large coupling of the dipole mode with the collar mode. Unipole devices are also used in certain situations. However in many cases quadrupole and/or monopole may be the only shear measurement methods used on a particular well. This brings up the question – what does the quadrupole actually measure in anisotropic formations and how is the data sensitive to such an environment? |This paper explores the effect of anisotropy on the quadrupole mode, its azimuthal sensitivity, what it measures and its limitations in anisotropic formations. The effects of anisotropy on the quadrupole dispersions are discussed along with ways to determine the presence of anisotropy based upon the results of the quadrupole inversion processing. Numerical modeling in anisotropic formations coupled with data examples are presented, including dispersion plots, that demonstrate these effects and explain the techniques used.|",,28

The main goal of this study is to effectively account for the high heterogeneity of the rock fabric and associated high variability in permeability encounter on the reservoir, despite of showing porosity values uniformly distributed. |This carbonate reservoir is clearly subdivided in two different sections: a Lower Section, comprise of mostly rudstone and floatstone, preserving micro-porosities in some bioclasts and carbonate mud, defining a unimodal pore distribution and size, with a small pore throat radius. The Upper Section presents primarily coarse-grained limestones(rudstone) preserving primary and secondary porosities, causing a variable distribution of pores and a heterogeneous pore throat radius associated with the particle micro-fracturing contribution (Criollo and Marin, 2015). |For this study, a reference well with a comprehensive dataset was selected, that included Core data (Sedimentological facies, Porosity and Permeability), Micro-resistivity Images and NMR data. The images were used to quantify with high resolution the rock fabric changes seen on the formation. Similarly, the whole NMR T2 distribution was used to account for changes in the pore system. This information was then combined with standard petrophysical logs and core facies using the Multi Resolution Graph-Based clustering method, to produce detailed electrofacies models, focusing on honouring the rock fabric and pore distribution in the reservoir. |These detailed electrofacies models constructed were then calibrated with core data, allowing to predict permeabilities on sections of the well not covered by the original core, as well as on neighbouring wells, where no core data was available.|",,8

In the current economic downturn, operators direct more focus to cost optimization through process enhancement and innovative approach. Specifically in South East Kuwait field, where new well profiles are being employed to reach a deeper pay zone directionally. These new well profiles require the 16 inch hole section to be drilled deeper with inclination through interbedded abrasive sandstones and sticky shale; which were previously drilled in 12 <U+00BC> inch hole size. Drilling becomes increasingly challenging using larger diameter bits where torque fluctuations, down-hole conditions and durability limit performance. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the engineering analysis for directional large diameter hole application and the selection of an optimized hybrid drill bit design, roller cone combined with Polycrystalline Diamond Compact (PDC), to maximize drilling performance where standard PDC or roller cone bits alone fail to provide an optimal solution. 
The 16 inch directional section was typically drilled using a mud motor assembly with a roller cone bit or a PDC. Drilling parameters were reduced in the upper layers especially with PDC bits as they involve sticky shale which can induce bit balling. While in the lower layers the abrasive formations tend to wear down roller cone bits. 
Selecting an appropriate hybrid design with an optimized drilling system for the application resulted in a breakthrough performance; tripling the Rate Of Penetration (ROP) of conventional technology. The time saving achieved was worth $250,000 for this section. 
PDC bits generally provide faster rate of penetration than roller cone bits while generating higher torque fluctuations as they drill by shearing bottom hole formation. Due to their high torque demands, PDC bits require an additional mud motor to drive them efficiently in larger hole sizes. Roller cones crush and gouge the bottom hole formation and due to their mechanical rollers result in reduced reactive torque and a smoother hole profile. Hybrid drill bit technology proven the capability of achieving the benefits of both designs in specific selected applications.|","Breakthroug Performance, Drilling Efficiency Maximization, Reducing drilling Days, Hybrid Technnology Deployment, Engineering Design Optimization",13

Steam injection by Cyclic Steam Stimulation (CSS) and Steamflood (SF) are the selected enhanced oil recovery methods in a Kuwait shallow formation. Initial single wells and recent 5-spot pilots for CSS has production affected by sanding issues from the unconsolidated formation. A robust reservoir geomechanical model and cap rock integrity characterization on a field scale is a prerequisite for successful design and implementation of the two target steam-based EOR techniques for commercial exploitation. 
Conventional geomechanical modeling approaches normally depend on history matching of the in-situ rock failure. However, lack of quality data measurements for minimum and maximum horizontal stress was major challenge for soft sediment rock. 
Unconsolidated formation have their own inherent issues. Rock being weak and soft, it has low strength, as exhibited by the unconfined compressive strength (UCS). It also has comparatively lower values for the elastic moduli. Most of the time, the Leak Off Tests (LOT) carried out in such formation lead to inconclusive and questionable interpretation, as the pressure regime used is extremely low and this leads to uncertainty in stress measurement. Any thermal EOR project in such shallow-depth and unconsolidated formation heavily relies on a competent cap rock in place, whose integrity under the combined effect of thermo-mechanical-stress can be put to severe test. 
To overcome the challenges of: a) weak soft sediments having low rock strength and elastic moduli, b) uncertainty in the stress measurement, c) inconclusive interpretation of leak off tests (LOT), a novel method was suggested. An Integrated Stress Analysis (ISA) approach was used for geomechanical modeling to evaluate magnitude of horizontal stresses from advanced sonic measurements and 3D dipole radial profiles. Data can be further used for estimating rock mechanical properties, stress orientation and Transverse Isotropy of Vertical symmetry axis (TIV) parameters. 
A comprehensive anisotropic geomechanical model was built from the ISA and advanced 3D sonic output, which was validated using results from independently acquired minifracs run in offset wells. 
This model could accurately predict potential drilling hazards and wellbore breakout. More than 10% acoustic anisotropy in horizontal stress was also found in sand intervals, which requires more careful approach while deciding the injection parameters. Multi-well analysis and geomechanical modeling also indicated variation in horizontal stresses ratio and direction across the field. 
This paper provides a new approach for stress estimation of shallow heavy oil formation demonstrating how rock can behave as anisotropic material from sonic measurements, resulting in better constrain of tectonic and effective stresses. As special tool required to conduct minifrac in each wells and it is costly, using this novel approach to estimate stress magnitude is preferred.|","Integrated Stress Analysis, 3D Dipole radial profile, geomechanical modeling, Shallow heavy oil formation, Minifrac",26

Selection of adequate thermal operating parameters to ensure fluid containment and cap rock integrity under high-temperature, high-pressure steam injection is vitally important. Cap rock integrity is controlled by the mechanical properties of the rocks and the in-situ and applied stresses resulting from field operations. This paper describes recent minifrac tests carried out in the Lower Fars formation in South Ratqa Field in northern Kuwait to determine the in-situ stresses. 
The main objective of the field tests was to obtain the minimum horizontal stress using a variety of Before Closure Analysis (BCA) techniques. A secondary objective was to perform After Closure Analysis (ACA) to obtain reservoir parameters such as permeability and initial pressure. All of this data is used as input into subsequent geomechanical studies. For BCA, it is important to identify various fluid flow regimes in the fall-off portions of the tests. The end of particular flow regimes indicates fracture closure. Fracture closure and the resultant minimum horizontal stress are therefore based on sound engineering principles. 
The cases presented in this paper provide further evidences that a combination of various techniques is the best approach to identify the minimum horizontal stress. No single methodology provides a reliable answer in all cases. Field examples are given to illustrate the practical application of these techniques.|","Mini-frac, minimum horizontal stress, Heavy Oil, Unconsolidated Reservoirs",19

Diatomites are high-porosity, low-permeability reservoirs with elastoplastic properties and high geo-mechanical responsiveness. They have a great potential for oil recovery despite these drawbacks. Withdrawal of fluids from the reservoir rock leads to subsidence causing compaction and shear stresses. This disturbed stress distribution results in well failures that causes loss of millions of dollars. Successful maintenance of pressure support through optimum injection/production is key to preventing subsidence to mitigate the risk of well failure and achieve better sweep efficiency for recovery. 
There have been different approaches to tackle subsidence and well failures in diatomites, including the use of ‘backpressure method’, coupled with a neural network to optimize injection-production to ‘balance’ the rock in terms of stress-distribution and thus decrease well failure due to shearing. However, using such methods may mask other problems the well is experiencing including several mechanical issues that influence production. Another existing approach, satellite-imaging (InSAR) cannot be used to take real-time actions that is crucial in diatomites. 
Surface tiltmeter data is collected to undertsand the relationship between injection/production and resulting surface deformation, which also provides information about well-to-well connectivity. A neural network-based approach is followed to determine the nonlinear relationship between surface subsidence/dilation and injection-production. This is then used to build an objective function that works to minimize the differences between well-to-well subsidence/dilation measured by the tiltmeters, by adjusting injection-production for the wells. 
In this paper, a method that harnesses real-time surface tiltmeter data to adjust injection-production distribution in diatomites to decrease well failures is used beyond the existing applications of surface tiltmeter, for instance, in the areas of detection of early steam breach to surface in steam operations and fracture orientation. This method also provides real-time data for robust reservoir management of such reservoirs where satellite imaging is not effective.|","surface deformation, neural networks, geomechanics, subsidence, tiltmeters",23
6,7,184146-MS,Heavy Oil - Produced Water Polishing with Compact Flotation Technology,"Asdahl, S., Schlumberger| Maelum, M., Schlumberger| Rabe, K., Schlumberger","|Abstract 
For light and medium crude oil produced waters, the compact flotation unit (CFU) technology has been widely used as the final cleaning step in the process during the last 10 years, especially in Europe. In general, more traditional methods such as induced gas flotation (IGF) and dissolved gas flotation (DGF) are more commonly applied on heavy crude oil-produced waters. The CFU technology has been preferred over the more traditional technologies due to substantially reduced weight and footprint combined with superior cleaning efficiency. 
This paper describes efforts related to examining the effectiveness and applicability of using CFU technology in heavy crude oil produced water (PW) polishing and comparing the results with polishing produced water from light and medium crude oil. Experimental work was conducted in a water test setup in which synthetic produced water with different crude oils (13.7–39.7° API gravity) was tested for flotation efficiency using a proprietary compact flotation unit. A literature study was performed to support the experimental results. Furthermore, field data were collected from field trials using the proprietary compact flotation unit technology with produced water containing crude oils in the 17–43° API gravity range. 
Experimental results showed that for a given crude oil type, the oil removal efficiency is dependent on oil droplet size, and these results are supported by the literature. Comparing different API gravity crude oils with the same droplet size showed, in general, a slightly reduced flotation efficiency with increasing gravity, which could be explained by the correlation between increasing gravity and increasing coverage time. 
However, field data for 17–43° API gravity crude oil show the ability for the proprietary compact flotation unit technology to meet normal effluent requirements (<U+2264> 25 ppm) over the full API gravity range. Field data further emphasizes the importance of preparing optimum process conditions for the flotation unit. 
Despite of the low retention time compared to traditional IGF and DGF technology, the compact flotation technology has proven to be robust for heavy-oil treatment. This result is partially explained by the fact that induction and coverage times are shorter in turbulent flow regimes than in traditional laminar flotation environments. Furthermore, the proprietary compact flotation unit technology combines both induced and dissolved flotation with vessel internals that effectively minimizes the rise path. 
It should be emphasized that these findings relate to the examined CFU models only because the various models have different technologies that will lead to different performances.|","environment, produced water treatment, field data comparison, compact flotation, heavy crude oil",9

The field study is in northern part of Kuwait targeting heavy oil formation, known to be shallow unconventional oil reservoir. It is heterogeneous shallow sandstone reservoir (500ft TVD) with low maturity oil, has low natural pressure, and poorly consolidated. Mud losses known to be the main risk of horizontal drilling in shallow heavy oil environment and the heterogeneous including continuity of the sand are also challenging for geo-steering team in order to place the well in the optimum position. Seismic is not available, however due to high offset well density a good correlation map has been produced. We are using formation tops from offset wells to delineate the continuity of the sand and trend of the structure dipping, we called it as shooting point method, which is assuming the trend of the structure from one offset well to another nearby offset well. The resistivity contrast will be expected to give us around 9 ft depth of detection (DOD) for our Azitrak resistivity tool based on Picasso plot. We made some scenarios for exiting the reservoir and it showed us some early warning 80ft to 180 ft prior to exit the reservoir. We use Autotrak, Azitrak dan Litotrak formation evaluation and density imaging tool to geo-steer and optimally place the wellbore inside 1B sandstone. The expectation of drilling the lateral was below 1000ft MD due to wellbore stability issue. From the correlation of available offset well it is clearly seen, there are two sand bodies in heavy oil target sand. The thickness is around 30-40 ft TVD and the structure was expected to be flat or a little bit dipping down. The well was landed in the middle of 1B, based on correlation of actual landing point log data to the nearest offset wells. Distance to bed boundary (D2B) showed local conductive layer from bottom since drilling the lateral section, which was not the response of base of 1B sand. So it was recommended to go down in stratigraphy in order to place the trajectory at the bottom part of 1B sand. In order to minimize wellbore stability issue along the lateral section, Bakerhughes recommended to maintain consistent faster ROP (80-100ft/hr) and effective hole cleaning. In the middle of lateral section of well B (1750ft MD) the well trajectory was inverted for the optimum production purposes to total depth (2250ft MD). Total lateral length achieved is 1116ft MD which covers 100% of the lateral length. Shooting point method in defining the rough structure trend from one well to another well was effectively applicative in the field, where current structure after drilling the lateral section is almost flat or slightly dipping down same as predicted before.|","heavy oil, geosteering, breakout, unconsolidated sand, wellbore stability",30

The completion equipment readiness and success of the installation can be challenging in the event of extending the horizontal section to accommodate geological heterogeneity and maximizing well productivity. This paper discusses operational excellence recorded in Well A, in the Thang Long Field, offshore Vietnam, from well design perspectives ensuring maximum reservoir contact to outcome of well completion. |The well was targeted in the Oligocene reservoir, a thin oil rim with large gas cap overlay, and required drilling and completion for 1126 m horizontal length of 8 1/2-in. open hole. The completion design included multiple swellable packers for isolation of unwanted zones, 6 5/8-in. basepipe sand screens for the production zones, and a fluid loss control device to help prevent undesirable losses. Several torque and drag simulations were performed to help predict potential threats that could be encountered during completion string deployment or during space out of the inner wash pipe string. |One apparent challenge of this completion design was to deploy the lower completion string to total depth (TD) per stringent reservoir requirements, resulting in an approximate 1126 m length of the string in the horizontal section. Another task was to facilitate manipulating 1130 m of wash pipe inside the completion string to locate the seal assemblies accurately at the corresponding seal bore extension positions for effective acidizing treatment. Although these were long sections of completion string and wash pipe, the quality of acidizing stimulation to effectively remove mud cake should not be compromised to ensure positive production rates. |During operations, the completion string was run to target depth without any issue, and the wash pipe was spaced out and manipulated correctly. These operations subsequently led to a successful acidizing treatment and the proper closure of the flapper type fluid loss device. The completion design and operation were concluded successfully, significantly contributing to field production performance to date. |The novelty of the completion design and installation is the ability to deploy an 1126-m lower completion in long, highly deviated and horizontal openhole section coupled with acid stimulation in reasonable time and as per plan.|",,21

SIDRI Area is a relatively new settlement with a reasonable hydrocarbon potential according to petrophysical analysis. The target formation of SIDRI wells is a sedimentary rock with granitic facies that consist of a series of tight conglomerates over an oil/water column of more than 900m. The pore system of this rigid and stiff formation consists of a micro natural fractures network with secondary cemented porosity. The production is mainly governed these tiny natural fractures that have a permeability as low as 0.1-0.5 md. Despite this tightness these series are separated by nonporous sections that occasionally exhibit as barrier and may introduce layering or subdivision of pay, however in sometimes permit a vertical communication between productive sections. Performed Cuttings analysis such as XRD, thin-sections showed a variety of minerals composition representing different lithology which in turn complicates the characterization of such reservoir. |On top of the unique mineralogy, the executions of fracturing treatment of SIDRI wells include multiple other challenges. The higher reservoir temperature and the formation depth cause a great constraint in terms of pumping rate and pressure. Besides, the non-availability of pumping equipment of high Horsepower restricts the pump rates and also limits the utilization of slick water frac. Even the nature and the quality of crude oil is quite challenged since it is a heavy black oil type and its composition contains high number of asphaltenic compounds accordingly the opportunity of creating sludge with treatment fluids is highly likely. The oil water viscosity ratio at reservoir condition represents a weighted obstacle for oil recovery that should be overcome. |The basic concept of applying hydraulic fracturing for these kinds of reservoirs is very simple, however the execution to get much more production improvement is quite difficult. Particularly the main idea here is to conduct a cost effective fracturing treatment with economical wisdom principle that can lead to achieve a greater oil recovery with best profitable model.|",,52

One of the main reasons for this difficulty is the heterogeneity of natural nanogranular media, which is scale dependent. In this study, we propose a new conceptual model for the elastic deformation of a shale formation. The conceptual model accounts for the effective stiffness of small-scale constitutive entities at a large scale. We use the proposed model to determine macroscale Young’s moduli by analyzing nanoindentations. Independent macroscale measurements corroborate our model. |Introduction |The petrophysical characterization of a shale formation, which can be considered to be a natural nanogranular composite, remains a challenging problem because of its heterogeneous structure. The heterogeneity exists at different scales, which makes it even more difficult for us to understand the pore space and the solid phases forming the matrix (Gupta et al., 2013; Sakhaee-Pour and Bryant, 2015). |The elastic properties of shale play critical roles in formation stimulation, well-log interpretation, drilling design, and production estimation. Determining these properties by conventional methods is time consuming and may even become impractical for shales. A large shale sample usually breaks into pieces during recovery due to the lack of mechanical stability. Hence, the notion of finding large-scale (core-scale, block-scale, or log-scale) properties from relevant properties of forming entities, such as organic and clay minerals, has gained attention among researchers (Bobko and Ulm, 2008; Kumar et al., 2012; Bennett et al., 2015). The key assumption is that knowing the elastic properties of the forming entities can enable us to predict the elastic properties of shale at a larger scale.|","Document Type

In terms of mechanical properties, i.e., Poisson’s ratios and Young’s moduli, the simplified equations can be defined using three mechanical properties. We used two theoretical models to create data for fractured shales with two sets of vertical fractures (VTI background + fractures). Different fracture densities were considered, which resulted in variable SWS values. These data were used to investigate the mechanical behavior of media with orthorhombic symmetry. Two possibilities were considered; Case 1 is a horizontal well drilled perpendicular to natural fractures or along the minimum horizontal stress, and Case 2 is a horizontal well drilled parallel to natural fractures or perpendicular to minimum horizontal stress. The values of Poisson’s ratios and Young’s moduli decrease with increasing fracture density, although a few moduli values will remain almost unchanged. For all fracture densities, the magnitude of stress anisotropy (<U+03B4>H - <U+03B4>h) can be accurately computed using the simplified orthorhombic model; for higher fracture densities, models converge to the exact values. For Case 1, <U+03B4>h can be accurately computed using the simpler vertically transverse isotropic (VTI) model, whereas the <U+03B4>H calculation using VTI or isotropic models will result in significant errors. |Introduction |In unconventional reservoirs, it is important to know the stress variations in different intervals for various applications, such as hydraulic fracturing, wellbore stability etc. In order to understand the variations of maximum and minimum horizontal stresses, engineers use poroelastic Hooke’s law that can give an estimate of the horizontal stresses from moduli. Moduli are usually computed from sonic log measurements. However, sonic measurements provide the dynamic moduli, which must be corrected to obtain the static moduli (e.g., Tutuncu, 2010).|",,60

Common 3D fracture-modeling software is based on isotropic rock models, and models that account for anisotropy are computationally expensive, especially when numerous simulations must be performed by varying the input parameters for parametric study. |A new workflow was created that integrates anisotropic acoustic log interpretation, 3D fracture modeling, and neural networks to improve fracture prediction accuracy and efficiency for anisotropic shales. The workflow generates a neural network with a limited number of 3D fracture-modeling cases; the fracture modeling uses rock mechanical properties interpreted from sonic logs with properly selected anisotropic acoustic models. The neural network trained from a pilot/offset well can be applied to predict fracture geometries or to optimize fracturing design for other wells from the same geological basin in a timely and cost-effective manner. |The workflow is demonstrated by generating neural-network models for two shale reservoirs. The fracture geometry predicted from the anisotropic models is compared with the one predicted from the conventional isotropic simulator. The results show that ignoring shale anisotropy leads to overestimated fracture widths and underestimated fracture containments, lengths, and net-pressures. The neural-network models are run in large parametric studies to demonstrate how the effective propped length and fracture productivity varies with perforation position, injected volume, and pumping rate in the two shale formations. The results provide valuable insights of selecting perforation location and optimizing pumping strategy. |Introduction |The combination of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling has made production from shale and tight formations commercially realistic.

Since its development, the MPS method has almost always been applied with a simple explicit Euler scheme, and the effect of higher-order time-integration schemes on the accuracy of this method has not yet been examined in detail. In this paper, the effect of higher-order time-integration schemes is investigated by considering a set of appropriate ocean engineering-related benchmark tests. It will be shown that the accuracy of the MPS method is not noticeably sensitive to the applied time-integration scheme. Hence, for further enhancement of the MPS method, especially for the simulation of the violent fluid flows often encountered in ocean engineering, the main focus should be given to the accuracy, consistency and convergence properties of differential operator models and an applied projection scheme. |Introduction |The moving particle semi-implicit (MPS) method was originally developed by Koshizuka and Oka (1996) as a Lagrangian meshless method for the simulation of viscous incompressible fluid flows. In general, particle methods, including the MPS method, have a distinct advantage in reproducing the complicated violent flows with free surface often encountered in offshore and ocean engineering, due to their Lagrangian tracking scheme without the advection term. However, particle methods, including the MPS method, have an inevitable shortcoming regarding unphysical pressure fluctuations that usually leads to computational inaccuracy. |A set of enhanced schemes for suppressing pressure fluctuations was developed until now (Khayyer and Gotoh, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011; Tsuruta et al., 2013; Wendland, 1995), so this method can be reliably applied to ocean engineering applications. By applying the enhanced schemes to particle-based simulations, various challenging engineering problems such as breaking waves (Khayyer and Gotoh, 2008) or wave impact (Khayyer and Gotoh, 2009) have been widely studied. However, up to now and to our best knowledge, the effect of a time-integration scheme on the accuracy of the MPS method has not been studied rigorously and comprehensively. On the other hand, a number of studies have applied different time-integration schemes in the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) framework (Molteni and Colagrossi, 2009; Blanc and Pastor, 2012). This is because SPH has a simple explicit algorithm, whereas the MPS method is founded on a semi-implicit solution process; thus, application of different time-integration schemes would not be straightforward in comparison to explicit SPH. Jeong et al. (2013) applied the Runge– Kutta scheme to the MPS method and obtained slightly improved results. However, their study did not mainly target the effect of time-integration schemes, and other higher-order time-integration schemes that may be superior to the Runge–Kutta scheme in terms of applicability or calculation time were not examined.|","time-integration schemes,  MPS method, Particle methods,  projection methods,  accuracy",0

Computational costs can be very high for such a complex system, which makes direct fine-scale simulations prohibitively time-consuming for large field-scale applications. This motivates the use of coarse grids for thermal-reactive compositional-flow simulation. However, significant errors are introduced by use of coarse-scale models without carefully computing the appropriate coarse parameters. In this paper, we develop an innovative dual-grid method to effectively capture the fine-scale reaction rates in coarse-scale ICP-simulation models. In our dual-grid method, coupled thermal-reactive compositional-flow equations are solved only on the coarse scale, with the kinetic parameters (frequency factors) calculated on the basis of fine-scale computations, such as temperature downscaling and fine-scale reaction-rate calculation. A dual-grid treatment for the heater-well model is also developed with coarse-scale heater-well indices calculated on the basis of fine-scale well results. The dual-grid heater-well treatment is able to provide accurate heater temperatures. The newly developed dual-grid method is applied to realistic cross-sectional ICP-pattern models with a vertical production well and multiple horizontal heater wells operated subject to fixed and time-varying heater powers. It is shown that the dual-grid model delivers results that are in close agreement with the fine-scale reference results for all quantities of interest. Despite the fact that the dual-grid method is implemented at the simulation-deck level, by use of the flexible scripting and monitor functionalities of our proprietary simulation package, significant computational improvements are achieved for all cases considered.|","in-situ conversion process, heater well model, thermal reactive compositional flow, upscaling, multiscale method",43

Many shale producers can ill afford a significant spending hike on such services when, according to IHS Markit, produced water management can represent half of a shale well’s operating expenses. |The severity of this issue will depend on how aggressively shale producers seek to rebound from the downturn by drilling new wells. It also will depend on how quickly they activate the estimated 4,000 oil-rich, drilled-but-uncompleted wells (DUCs) that have amassed over the past 2 years as both a cost-cutting and a production management maneuver. |“If you get a lot of new completions in a short amount of time, that means you are going to get a whole bunch of water too, and this is something that the industry needs to be thinking about and planning for,” said Piers Wells, co-founder and chief executive officer of Digital H2O, a company that uses analytics-based models to forecast oilfield water resources. |Because it is the most active and prolific shale play, the Permian Basin of Texas is already under pressure. As shown by Digital H2O’s model, the recent uptick in drilling there and in the adjacent Delaware Basin is yielding produced water volumes that are approaching what many of the disposal wells can take away. |“While they may not be at full pressure utilization today, many are getting close and, in a higher-price environment, you will see many more areas shifting into high utilization,” Wells said. “The thing that people need to be aware of is that this could all happen really, really fast.” |With far less drilling activity happening, North Dakota’s Bakken and Texas’ Eagle Ford shales are not facing quite the same situation as the Permian currently is. However, higher prices would start to change that, and there are also more than 2,000 DUCs in those two plays that if brought on line in quick succession have the potential to drive water-handling costs higher. |Produced water management is complex and expensive for shale producers partly because they have fewer options than their conventional counterparts on what to do with it. One major disadvantage is their inability to reinject into unconventional reservoirs, underscoring that disposal wells will always play an outsized role in shale developments.|","Document Type

It is necessary to investigate how to choose an unstructured mesh to accurately simulate production performance. In this paper, a new unstructured gridding and discretization work flow is proposed to handle nonorthogonal and low-angle intersections of extensively clustered fractures with nonuniform apertures. The work flow is then validated with two models in terms of production behavior and central-processing-unit (CPU) performance: a synthetic model with one horizontal well and orthogonal intersected hydraulic fractures built by tartan grid, and a field-scale local-grid-refinement (LGR) model with three horizontal wells and irregular hydraulic fractures in a slightly dipping reservoir created by a commercial software plug-in. |Good-quality matches are obtained between unstructured and structured grids in both pressure and production behavior. Sensitivity analysis of the meshing parameters suggests that refinement in the vicinity of fractures has improved both early and late production of a well, whereas background density has a dominant effect on the late production. Background-grid type and orientation have less influence as long as they have the same grid density. Fewer cells can be achieved by increasing reservoir-background size and size-progression ratio, replacing unstructured-background grids with structured grids, and reducing the complexity of the fracture networks without loss of the accuracy, resulting in improved CPU performance. |This study applies unstructured grids to simulate multiple horizontal wells with complicated fracture networks, and provides detailed comparisons between unstructured and structured grids. Most importantly, it resolves the question regarding how to choose an appropriate mesh to yield both accurate results and high-quality CPU performance.|","Eagle Ford Formation, History Matching, Unstructured Grid, Hydraulically Fractured Horizontal Wells, Unconventional Reservoirs",4

In INSIM, the reservoir is characterized as a coarse model consisting of a number of interwell control units, where each unit has two specific parameters: transmissibility and control pore volume (PV). By solving the mass-material-balance and front-tracking equations for the control units, the interwell fluid rates and saturations are obtained so that phase-producing rates can be predicted. The ability of INSIM to predict water cut and phase rates is the most important innovation included in INSIM. INSIM is applied to perform history matching and to infer the interwell connectivity and geological characteristics. INSIM has a number of advantages. First, the model parameters estimated from history matching provide a relative characterization of interwell-formation properties. The model can handle changes in the flow directions caused by changing well rates, including shutting in wells or converting producers to injectors, whereas with the common correlation-based interwell-connectivity method, the well interactions are assumed to be fixed. Second, the previous methods, which have similar computational complexity to INSIM, can only provide the total liquid-production rate, whereas with our procedure, we can calculate the oil- and water-flow rates and hence history match water-cut data. Third, because we can calculate the oil- and water-flow rates, our method can be used for waterflooding optimization but with far-less computational effort than with the traditional method by use of a reservoir simulator. |*Discussion available.

The growth of soft sand zone is the root of sand production problem. Wells drilling and operation leadleads to a change in the stress state of rock. Near wellbore strains can cause the collapse of the wellbore walls under certain conditions, it leads to remove of sand from the well. In this paper we describe the geomechanical modeling algorithm for wellbore stability analysis and completion selection for soft sedimentary rocks. Algorithm consists of few stages: 1D geomechanical modeling; its application to minimizing risk of drilling fishbones; calculation of depression for cost-effective rate and minimizing sanding. 1D wellbore stability model gives a first approximation of the stresses. The next step is the finite element modeling for calculation near wellbore stress state. This paper proposes an integrated approach to sand control. The algorithm includes wellbore stability analysis for drilling horizontal and fishbone wells, 3D geomechanical modelling for near wellbore zone. The proposed algorithm allows determining the critical depression in order to reduce the volume of sand carried out of the well.

Особо остро эта проблема проявляется при разработке неустойчивых, слабосцементированных пород, которые характеризуются низким пределом прочности. Бурение и эксплуатация скважин приводят к изменению напряженного состояния горных пород. Возникающие напряжения при определенных условиях могут вызвать обрушение стенок скважины. Представлен применяемый в компании ПАО «Газпром нефть» алгоритм геомеханического моделирования для решения задач бурения сложных скважин и выбора типа заканчивания при разработке слабосцементированных коллекторов.

Our approach identifies a low-dimensional structure in the solution space. We introduce an auxiliary variable (the velocity field) in our model reduction that achieves a high compression of the model. This compression is achieved because the velocity field is conservative for any low-order reduced model in our framework, whereas a typical global model reduction that is based on proper-orthogonal-decomposition (POD) Galerkin projection cannot guarantee local mass conservation. The lack of mass conservation can be observed in numerical simulations that use finite-volume-based approaches. The discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) approximates fine-grid nonlinear functions in Newton iterations. This approach delivers an online computational cost that is independent of the fine-grid dimension. POD snapshots are inexpensively computed with local model-reduction techniques that are based on the generalized multiscale finite-element method (GMsFEM) that provides (1) a hierarchical approximation of the snapshot vectors, (2) adaptive computations with coarse grids, and (3) inexpensive global POD operations in small dimensional spaces on a coarse grid. By balancing the errors of the global and local reduced-order models, our new methodology provides an error bound in simulations. Our numerical results, by use of a two-phase immiscible flow, show a substantial speedup, and we compare our results with the standard POD-DEIM in a finite-volume setup.|","model reduction, mixed finite element, Galerkin projection, POD-DEIM, reservoir simulation",60

During the exploration of these deeper water depths, large hydrocarbon deposits have been found below salt formations. These reservoirs are called “presalts,” which are below the salt formations. Presalt reservoirs have been found in offshore Brazil, the Gulf of Mexico (GOM), West Africa, and the North Sea. Completions in salt formations can be difficult because of the creep behavior that the salt formations exhibit. Creep behavior results from the instability of the salt formation, which causes a slow flow and permanent deformations. Creep deformation occurs over time and begins once the salt formation has been penetrated. Completion of the wellbore does not stop formation creep. The constant creep of the salt formation causes excess stress on the wellbore casing, which may eventually cause the casing to collapse. In this study, a 3D geomechanical model is developed, by use of data such as wellbore pressure and temperature; formation stress and temperature; rock, cement, and casing properties, to predict the effects of salt-creep behavior on stress loading in the wellbore casing, which helps to assess the life expectancy of wells in presalt reservoirs. The simulation results of this model can provide quantitative results of casing stress and deformation as a function of time under various temperature, in-situ-stress, and operation conditions, which can be used as useful information for subsequent wellbore-casing design and wellbore-integrity analysis. In addition, possible methods that can mitigate the severity of salt mobility and reduce the risks of casing collapse are discussed.|","Wellbore Stablity, Completion, Pre-Salt, Casing, Salt Creep",1

The combination of two breakthrough patented technologies, namely the Hydraulically Regulated PCP (HRPCP) for High GOR Wells associated with the Permanent Magnet Motor (PMM) technology used as an electrical submersible PCP had been successfully deployed in Middle East. 
Combining the highest motor efficiency of the Permanent Magnet Motors with the most efficient ALS PCP, is virtually the most efficient existing ALS on the market to-date opening doors for larger scale deployment to improve recovery factor while lowering abandonment pressure and reducing premature failures. 
The pilot has been installed in a highly deviated well deploying a submersible PMM coupled with a multiphase PCP featuring Hydraulic Regulators to handle high free gas at the pump intake. The absence of rods allows operating a PCP through high DLS while eliminating the rod drags against the tubing. Being a technology derived from PCP, the HRPCP enables to handle sand, solids and viscous oil as any other PCP, bringing in a single ALS the benefits of the ESP and PCP.

On offshore installations space has always been at a premium. With current market conditions requiring cost savings across the board, reducing the footprint of the ESP surface electrical equipment skid would result in reduced costs when fabricating offshore platforms. This paper presents a redesigned Medium Voltage VSD that is significantly smaller and incorporates new technologies that present an added bonus in additional cost savings and characteristics that can increase the run life of the ESP. 
A typical offshore installation has one 2,000KVA Step Down transformer that supplies four or five skids, each with their own Low Voltage VSD and Step Up Transformer. With a Medium Voltage Drive, supply line voltage up to 6.6KV does not need to be stepped down, furthermore is no requirement for a Multi Tap Step Up Transformer as the VSD can provide the required medium voltage required for the ESP motor. The removal of these transformers has reduced the space and weight of the surface electrical equipment that influences the size and load bearing capabilities, and fabrication costs, of new installations. 
In addition to the space and weight savings, by incorporating new generation VSD technologies, efficiency and reliability can be increased which ultimately prolongs pump run life and reduces operating costs. Cascaded Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) rectification significantly reduces the input harmonic distortion reflected back onto the supply, which can incur penalties from energy providers. The multi-level inverter technology on the output provides a near sinusoidal waveform, which removes the need for the expensive, and heavy, space consuming Sine Wave Filter (SWF) typically required on ESP installations. The cleaner power being delivered to the motor reduces the motor operating temperature and stresses on the electrical system's insulation resulting in a longer run life. 
Maintaining a cool operating environment for the drive pushed conventional compressed gas air conditioning methods to their limits. A solution was to employ a Thermo Electric Cooling System. Operating on the principle of the Peltier Effect, a stable operating temperature can be maintained and as there are no moving parts, the TEC system is inherently reliable and economical in comparison to traditional A/C units. Furthermore, the TEC modules are very compact and can be operated in any orientation, in line with the requirement for a reduced footprint. 
This new generation VSD technology has resulted in significant cost savings for Operators in terms of Capital and Operating Expenditure. Additionally, the power quality delivered to the motors can result in an extended run life, the ultimate goal for offshore applications.|","Medium Voltage VSD, Thermo Electric Cooler, Reduced footprint, Multi Level Inverter",21

In SAGD wells, the gap between the oil sand and the sand control liner closes or collapses over time due to such factors as the oil sand thermal expansion, the melting of bitumen and the ensuing loss of the apparent bonding between the grains. The result is the buildup of effective stresses and the gradual compaction of the oil sands around the liner. Current practices for the sand control design do not account for the effect of time-dependent effective stress variation around the liner on the sand control performance. In this paper, we outline the results of an experimental study on the effect of near-liner effective stress on the performance of slotted liners. 
This study builds on existing experimental procedures and investigates fines migration, sand production and clogging tendency of slotted liner coupons in large-scale unconsolidated sand-packs. Sand-packs with controlled properties (grain size distribution, grain shape, and mineralogy) are packed on a multi-slot sand control coupon in a triaxial cell assembly. Varying levels of stress are applied to the sand-packs in directions parallel and perpendicular to the multi-slot coupon. For each stress level, brine is injected into the sand-pack from the top surface of the sample towards the coupon. Test measurements include pressure drops across the sand-pack and the coupon as well as the produced sand/fines mass for each stress level. Post-mortem analysis is performed to measure fines/clay concentration along the sand-pack as a direct measure of fines migration. 
Experimental results show that under the subsequent increase in effective stresses, sand-packs experience considerable deformations in directions parallel and perpendicular to the multi-slot coupon; which result in a drastic drop in the porosity and retained permeability. Test results show that the maximum reduction in permeability occurs in the vicinity of the multi-slot coupons due to the fines accumulation and the higher compaction in that region. In comparison to experiments with no confining stress, the application of confining stress results in lower retained permeability in the sand-packs as well as reduced sand production. 
This paper presents, for the first time, the effect of near wellbore effective stress on clogging tendency and sand retention characteristics of slotted liner completions. The tests allow the assessment of the adequacy of the use of existing design criteria over the life cycle of the well under variable stress conditions around the liner.|","Sand production, Effective stress, Slotted liner, Retained permeability, SAGD wells",60

This paper presents the characterization of oil sands from the McMurray Formation. The main objective of this paper is to investigate the possibility of replicating the oil sands by the mixtures of commercial sands and fines for large-scale testing. There is a growing interest in large-scale evaluation testing for sand control devices that require considerable amounts of representative oil sands materials. However, natural representative oil sands samples are usually not available or are limited in quantity. Therefore, replicating the oil sands is essential for such tests. 
Twenty-three oil sands samples were collected from two wells in the McMurray Formation and cleaned using the Soxhlet extraction technique. The cleaned samples were examined using the image analysis technique and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) imaging to study their Particle Size Distribution (PSD), shape factors, mineralogy, and texture. Similar analysis was performed on eleven series of commercial sands to compare their shape, mineralogy, and texture with those of oil sands. Particle Size Distribution of 10 commercial fines was also analyzed with a particle sizer to cover the required fine/clay part of the duplicated samples. Direct shear and 1D consolidation were performed to compare the mechanical properties of the oil sands samples and the duplicated mixtures of commercial sands and fines. 
The shape factors of the oil sand and the selected commercial sand samples are in close agreement. In addition to the common average/cumulative shape factor measurements, this paper also presents the variation of shape factors within each sample for different grain sizes. The results show the same sand shape characteristics among all oil sand samples as well as the tested commercial sands. Further, XRD results indicate a similar mineralogy for the commercial sands and the oil sands samples. The SEM images show random changes in the surface texture of both oil sands and commercial sands with no observable trends. We were able to use commercial sands and fines mixture with similar grain shape properties to duplicate the PSD of the oil sand samples. Direct shear and 1D consolidation testing of the oil sands and samples made of commercial sands and fines show similar consolidation and frictional properties for both the duplicated mixture and cleaned oil sands for the same compaction level (porosities). 
This paper provides a procedure for duplicating the oil sands with commercial sands and fines. It also provides detailed information on the mineralogy, texture, and the variation of the shape characteristics for oil sands from the McMurray Formation.|","Particle Size Distribution (PSD), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Shape factors, Image analysis",17
27,28,182524-MS,Lightweight Cement Systems Help Prevent Permafrost Melt,"Benge, Maggie, Halliburton| Reyes, Julio, Halliburton| Xiao, Erin, Halliburton","|Abstract 
As an increasing number of thermal wells are drilled in arctic and subarctic regions, such as the north slope of Alaska and northern Canada, there is an urgent need for lightweight cement systems with thermally insulating properties. Significant temperature changes resulting from activities such as shut-in, steam injection, and production can lead to increased temperatures in the wellbore. As the wellbore temperature rises, there is an increased risk of melting permafrost, which can allow the formation to move and result in costly damage to the well. Lightweight and thermally insulating cement would contribute to the life of a well by maintaining low thermal conductivity while providing structural support for the casing strings. This study compares the thermal and mechanical properties of water-extended, foam, and microsphere cements with densities of 1.32, 1.50, and 1.68 specific gravity (SG) (11, 12.5, and 14 lbm/gal). 
To simulate several different conditions in a well, thermal conductivity of the foam system was measured for dried, as-poured, and saturated conditions. While the amount of air or fluid in the foam samples influenced the measured thermal conductivity, both microsphere and foamed systems appeared to be comparable. 
Initial findings from mechanical properties testing demonstrated foamed slurries have higher tensile and compressive strengths. Under confining pressure, the foam cement system had a larger failure envelope and would be able to withstand greater downhole pressure increases compared to the microsphere design at the same density. 
When designing wells in areas with permafrost, including a cement system with low thermal conductivity would help minimize the risk of melting the permafrost and maximizing the longevity of the well. This paper reviews several possible lightweight solutions and presents the thermal and mechanical properties of various foam and microsphere cement designs.|","Thermal, Zonal Isolation, Heat Transfer, Geomechanics, Cement",46

The integrity of thermal in situ wells is a function of the distinct yet inter-related processes that control the integrity of the reservoir caprock and of the wells themselves. Our objective was to bridge the scale gap between reservoir caprock integrity analysis and thermal well cement sheath design, and in so doing, improve the risk analysis of cement sheath integrity. 
At the well pad scale, a coupled finite element geomechanical model was used to predict the evolution of thermal and mechanical stresses in the caprock due to thermal in situ operations. The geomechanical models were populated with data from public domain reports from northeastern Alberta thermal in situ projects. These model results were then used to constrain a risk-based analysis of the multiple potential failure mechanisms at the wellbore scale that can compromise cement sheath integrity of thermal wells. Common thermal well and cement blend properties were used to then analyze the probability and magnitude of cement sheath damage during thermal injection operations. 
Although integrity may be predicted within the caprock for a given operational practice, the integrity of the cement sheath was shown to be less certain. Several factors contributed to this uncertainty. Firstly, the selection of caprock material and plasticity models for caprock stress analysis has significant implications for the risk of cement sheath damage. Secondly, the statistical distribution of caprock mechanical properties is typically quite broad through the overburden and caprock intervals, meaning that average zone mechanical properties may not be sufficient to model and design cement sheath integrity. Thirdly, it is necessary to adequately constrain our knowledge of the initial state of stress within the cement sheath after placement, and before steam injection. Our results show that these three factors can be adequately constrained to reduce well integrity uncertainty through the integration of geomechanical caprock integrity analyses and cement sheath integrity analyses. 
In this study we combine relatively time-consuming coupled finite element method analyses with rapid semi-analytical system response curve methods for cement sheath integrity. In so doing, we quantify the impact of the uncertainties present in caprock modeling and in the constitutive modeling of thermal cement blends on a risk-based evaluation of cement design requirements.|","thermal stress, finite element analysis, cement sheath integrity, geomechanics, risk analysis",61

This paper is aimed to summarize the evolution of wellbore steering and the impact of logging-while-drilling on well and reservoir performance. |The quest for productivity drilling began in the late 1980s with the first generation of logging-while-drilling (LWD) technology that provided directional and formation-evaluation measurements and basic data insurance in vertical and deviated wells. The primary applications were stratigraphic and structural correlation and rudimentary formation evaluation. A shift in LWD technology in the 1990s increased the focus on exploitation of smaller, tighter, and harder-to-reach reservoirs. This second phase saw the introduction of azimuthal measurements, borehole images, instrumented steerable motors, and forward-modeling programs for well placement through geosteering. Well architectures became more challenging as well construction evolved from geometrical designs to wells steered by geological information. In the 21st century, geosteering entered its third phase; structural steering with deep-reading LWD resistivity measurements and high-resolution imaging. This allowed operators to re-position in real-time horizontal and high-angle wellbore trajectories in anticipation of structural changes ahead of the bit. |Two recent developments since 2010 have taken geosteering to the next phase of productivity steering. The first one is reservoir mapping while drilling. It uses continuous bed boundary logs from deep azimuthal electromagnetic measurements. The second one is fluid mapping while drilling. It incorporates discrete/station measurements of reservoir rock and fluid properties from formation testing while drilling along with advanced mud gas logs. These developments have made it possible to estimate the productivity index (PI) of openhole section, in near real time, during reservoir drilling process. |The productivity index while drilling estimate can therefore be used for drilling decisions as well as completion decisions and to evaluate the effect of trajectory undulations on well productivity while drilling. Real Time Productivity Steering (RTPS) is hence no longer a myth but a reality now.|",,21

Well Performance is measured by evaluating the Inflow Performance & Outflow Performance Relationships (IPR & OPR). For that the need to use the correct IPR for subjected reservoir is very essential. |Since many decades, Vogel IPR equation has been used comprehensively for evaluating the productivity of vertical wells in saturated gas drive reservoirs. Vogel’s model successfully evaluates IPR for single porosity solution gas drive in homogenous reservoirs.  However, the applicability of Vogel’s IPR for naturally fractured dual porosity-dual permeability reservoirs is questionable; hence this challenge is addressed by the industry only numerically. Due to composite fluid flow behavior between fracture and matrix system in a dual porosity-dual permeability reservoir, there is a pressing need for a new, practical and simple IPR model that takes into account the consideration of fracture parameters. |This study investigates the effects of reservoir complex fluid flow behavior on IPR curves for vertical wells drilled in naturally fractured oil saturated reservoirs resulting in the development of an IPR curve for such conditions. A base case simulation model is developed with typical reservoir, fluid and rock properties using black oil model. Using a set of points relating oil production rates to flowing bottom-hole pressures, the dimensionless IPR curves are generated. Fluid and reservoir properties were varied between two porous and permeable media such as Inter-porosity flow co-efficient, storativity ratio, oil gravity, reservoir thickness and bubble point pressure. Inter-porosity flow coefficient and fracture storativity ratio were found to have a significant impact on dimensionless IPR curves. Finally, an attempt is made to converge the results into one simple model using non-linear regression technique in order to get a new empirical IPR correlation for vertical well producing from naturally fractured oil reservoirs. |A small and acceptable average absolute error of less than 2% was found with the new proposed empirical IPR model, while comparing the existing published correlations on the same data gives more than 15% error. The developed IPR correlation is accurate enough and can serve as a handy tool for the production engineers to forecast the productivity of wells drilled in a naturally fractured dual porosity-dual permeability saturated oil reservoirs.|",,15

Sonic logs can be used to estimate rock elastic parameters that are useful in obtaining the in-situ stresses of the rock. In cases where the sonic log is missing, the log values are estimated using empirical correlations. Since conducting sonic logging involves time and cost, the industry relies on empirical models. However, none of the available models are universally accepted by log analysts because each model estimates the sonic log values significantly different from the others. The error in sonic log values affects the elastic parameters, which can result in either underestimation or overestimation of the in-situ stresses. 
The objective of this paper is to develop simple and accurate model to determine sonic travel time based on gamma ray, bulk density and neutron porosity because these three logs are generally available for every well. Artificial Neural Networks are used for the development of the model. An attempt has also been done to converge the results into one simple empirical correlation using the weights of ANN model in order to make the model equation universal and usable for field applications. 
Several empirical correlations from literature were selected and subjected to same real field well log data as the AI model to predict sonic travel time and the results showed that ANN model was able to predict sonic logs with 96% accuracy with a correlation coefficient of 0.96 while other correlations did the same but with lesser accuracy. In addition, the developed empirical correlation from the weights of ANN model gives exactly the same results as predicted by the ANN model. 
The developed model along with the empirical correlation can serve as handy tool to help geo-mechanical engineers detremine the reservoir geo-mechanical parameters and design any operation in cases where sonic logs are not available.|","Sonic Log Travel Time, Field Validation, Empirical Correlation, Artificial Neural Network",5

Brittleness index is one of the critical geomechanical properties of reservoir rocks. In fact, it is not possible to have accurate solutions to evaluate hydraulic fracturing effectiveness without having accurate brittleness value. Different methods were proposed to measure this parameter, which some of them need reservoir geomechanical parameters by tri-axil experiments, and some others such as mineral analysis are very expensive. Elastic based brittleness is commonly applied because it can provide continuous profile but S wave is generally not performed in all wells. Therefore, attempts have usually been carried out to use artificial intelligences for identification of the relationship between the well log data and core mineralogy based brittleness. This study proposed a new approach based on two common neural network approaches by conventional logging data. The mineral based brittleness database from one well in Jiaoshiba shale gas filed, China were established through QEMSCAN and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Construction of back propagation artificial neural network (BPANN) and least squares support vector regression (LS-SVR) for predicting formation brittleness is described. Moreover, an overall ranking of sensitivity degree is then provided to show the impacts of different well logs as inputs on models. Obtained results of both LS-SVR and BPANN model are competent for predicating brittleness. But, LS-SVR approach is more accurate than the BPANN method at same conditions. These artificial intelligence methods are first adopted in formation brittleness prediction and the integration of core mineralogy based brittleness and well logs is more practical and applicable than elasticity-based brittleness method using acoustic full waveform logging.|","formation brittleness, Support vector regression, hydraulic fracturing, well logs, artificial neural network",16

The complex fault system formed due to periods of tectonic movements always raised the risk of shale gas E&P activity. Faults with large displacement can be easily recognized on seismic profile, but mini faults are hard to find even though they have non-ignorable impact on well palnning. This paper ultilzed the borehole image data to distinguish the mini fault and analysised how the mini fault can influence the sedimentary and in situ stress disturibution. 
Stratigraphic dip patterns from images, integrated with core data and conventional logs, can ascertain the fault position in the wellbore and help define the fault property, such as fault azimuth, dip amplitude, fault displacement, and the fault-related geological deformation. The dip patterns showed abrupt change around the fault breakpoint at which depth the image structure was disordered, the cores broke into pieces, and the marker values on the conventional logs were missing compared with adjacent wells. Sedimentary features observed on the images also revealed different structures between hanging wall and foot wall of the fault in the wellbore. All of above proved the existence of the normal fault. 
Cross section images were used to evaluate this fault and its associated depositional architecture. In the target shale interval, the wells on the cross section show strong comparability of thickness and stratigraphic dip patterns which are mainly green patterns. However, the dip patterns in the same interval demonstrated green-red-green patterns in the well where the fault was discovered. Morover, a set of sandy turbidities overlied on the target shale can be found in all of the wells on the section. It has thinner trend towards the south, but unexpectedly became thicker in the well with the fault. A great amount of syngenetic deformational structures were also recognized on the image of the hanging wall of the fault, while the foot wall is dominated by parallel bedding and low angle cross bedding. Those phenomenon indicated that the fault is a typical normal growth fault. Furthermore, the in situ stress direction reflected by the wellbore failure demonstrated that the in situ stress changed its direction around the fault plane. It is concluded that the fault controlled the sedimentary distribution in the depositional period and influenced the in situ stress direction during tectonic movements. 
The analysis of the stratigraphic dip patterns from the images complemented the accuracy of seismic data in the geological structure interpretation. The understanding of the growth fault have realistic meaning in both studying the sedimentary facies distribution and predicting in situ stress direction.|","Normal growth Fault, In situ stress, Sedimentary Facies, Shale gas",17

The Lujiaping shale gas formation in Sichuan Basin, SW China, is 1400m deep and has high dip angles. Moreover, it is also subjected to the strike-slip fault geostress and contains highly developed bedding planes and natural fractures. The complex geologic condition makes the fracturing treatment effect hard to predict. This paper aims to establish a simulation model to predict the created hydraulic fracture geometry so as to provide appropriate stimulation strategy. Based on the discrete element method, a novel three-dimensional fracture propagation model is established. The transverse isotropy constitutive relations are primarily introduced to characterize the layered shale in the high dip angle formation. Then, the model is used to investigate how the hydraulic fracture geometry changes with different parameters, such as in-situ stress distribution, natural fracture density, fluid viscosity, and pump rate. The model is validated through experimental data, which shows the simulation result is in accordance with the experimental observation. Taking the complex geologic conditions as the initial condition and assuming the formation dip angle as 50°, the high differential stress which is the difference between overburden stress and minimum horizontal stress enhances the fracture propagation in the vertical direction. At 5 MPa of differential stress, the increase of fracturing fluid viscosity can reduce the influence of bedding plane on fracture geometry. The increase of pump rate is helpful to decrease the restriction of bedding plane on fracture propagation so as to improve the stimulation effect. In addition, the high density of natural fracture will further enlarge the impact on the fracture geometry. This work is a theoretical study of predicting the hydraulic fracture geometry under complex geologic conditions, which provides the technical guidance for the optimization of the fracturing treatment in Lujiaping shale gas formation.|","Fracture geometry, Shale, Bedding, Hydraulic fracturing, Dip angle",5

Currently, with proceeding in exploration and development of deep oil&gas, and hot dry rock resources rapidly, it is a high priority to solve the problem of drilling super hard rocks, such as basal conglomerates, tuffs and carbonates in drilling projects. As the drilling efficiency affects the economic feasibility of the drilling project, various methods to reduce the drilling cost have been proposed. Among these alternatives, dynamic load rock breaking method has been further developed in this study to achieve efficient drilling, which can change the way that polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) operates on rocks. 
It is a common problem in drilling in hard strata, such as rate of penetration, stick-slip vibration, chip hold down effect, and high temperature. To solve these problems, torsional and axial percussion hammer has been developed, which can generate both axial and torsional impacts at the same time. The vibration module of this tool, driven by pressurized drilling fluid, can impact on a hammer with a particular slope briefly and the energy instantaneously released in this process can then trigger percussion. The direction of the impact, depending on the resultant force of axial and torsional impact, closer to the dip angle of PDC, indicated that this tool conforms to the rock breaking mechanism of PDC bit. Therefore, this tool is expected to be more effective than traditional axial percussion hammer. In addition to perform structural design and optimize this tool, numerical simulation and laboratory test with designed parameters were conducted in this study. The tool described in this study can reduce stick-slip effect by providing pulse torque and WOB to the bit. 
Statistical analysis in this study suggests that the effectiveness of percussion is directly correlated with stick-slip ratio, breakability of rock and frequency of percussion hammer. Based on these findings, rock breaking model with rock's compressive strength, stick-slip ratio and brittleness was established. 
This tool was purely made of metal which can endure high temperature and resist corrosion. Field application of this tool in the Ordos and Tarim Basins demonstrates that it has remarkable service life and is effective in speeding up drilling with an average 150% increase of ROP. This torsional and axial percussion hammer is expected to lead to a revolutionary advance in the development of rock-breaking techniques for deep well drilling in hard strata.|","Torsional, Dynamic Load, Axial, Rock Breaking Model, Percussion Hammer",17

The design of stimulation jobs requires an integrated knowledge of the reservoir (lithology, mechanical properties, fracture properties, PVT, etc), needing calibration and scenario simulation capacities. Current tools permitting such a workflow exist, yet rarely fully integrated within a single package. In this paper we aim to show the advantages of using two new tools, presently developed as prototypes, namely an unstructured fracture model and a multiphysics coding platform designed to integrate all concepts currently under research pertaining to unconventional reservoirs. |Characterization of unconventional reservoirs implies the conciliations of several scales, demanding the integration of a potentially large fracture information database. Within this ""rich"" database, today's models have difficulties integrating all this information. Thus, improving upon current Discrete Fracture Networks (DFN) would require many fractures to be accounted for (up to 500,000). Coupling of such DFN's to reservoir modeling packages often use up-scaling methods, resulting in models which in turn are simulated using extensions of classical dual continuum models. Current reservoir models do not integrate all physical pertinent phenomena though as being important for gas or multiphase production such as dynamic permeability varying with pressure, nonequilibrium effects, multicomponent adsorption models, diffusion effects or proper transfer functions between matrix and fractures. |Using a realistic example inspired from field data, we show how the construction of a fracture model using a consistent Discrete and Deformable Fracture Networks (DDFN), tractable for multiphase flow reservoir simulations, can help describing a complex fracturing case. The use of a coding platform tailored to pertinent unconventional physics is discussed, through examples of developed multiphysics Geoscience applications. |The example shows how the integration of the representation of a multistage operations through a DDFN model, using the joint characterization of a field natural fracture system and a propagating fracture network corresponding to the hydraulic fracturing process, calibrated on the BHP and microseismic cloud, is input as a specific unstructured dual discretization into a reservoir model. |This explicit description of the fracture geometry is coupled to a non-discretized matrix refinement function accounting for matrix heterogeneities, well-adapted to the dynamic pressure behavior observed in such reservoirs. A generalized multiple interacting continua formulation (named ""transient transfer influence function"") is used within the matrix medium, allowing the simulation of a longer transition period, typical of many unconventional reservoirs, thus improving matrix contribution during hydraulic fracturing. Because the full process may include several hundred thousand fractures and approximately the same number of cells for the matrix medium, we show how run time performance is improved through a preconditioning technique which reduces the condition number of the matrix associated to the linear system, and speed up the iterative parallel linear solver convergence. |The discussion of results obtained by using the integrated DDFN is extended to the potential use of an adapted computational platform which could be used for the inclusion of specific physics pertinent to unconventional reservoirs. |This DDFN approach is able to computationally handle 100,000's of fractured coupled to a fluid flow simulator.

This paper is to show a case study from Junggar Basin in North West China, which integrates a variety of logging data acquired by latest wireline measurements to analyze and evaluate lithology, pore types, fluid types and geomechanics properties of volcanic reservoir.

Recently, a lot more advanced data sets are available from the new wireline tools and measurements in Xinjiang Oilfield, such as SonicScanner, LithoScanner, Images logs, and latest 3D Saturn Radial probe forvolcanicformation sampling. The new data provide a better view for avolcanic reservoir. An integrated evaluation workflow that combines multiple latest wirelinetechnologies has been set, which can provide a good solution to the evaluation of volcanic reservoir in this area. Calibrating high precision and high-resolution lithology data to core data can accurately describe the complex lithology of volcanic reservoir. Meanwhile, apart from fractures identification, we are not only be able to categorize rock type with help of structure analysis provided by image data, but also can analyze the volcanic eruptible period by comparing images of adjacent wells. In addition, by acquiring, processing and interpreting advanced sonic scanner data; we can evaluate formation anisotropy, fracture effectiveness, identify gas zones and calculate geomechanics parameters, which will be used later during stimulation. In the end, utilizing the 3D Radial probes, the formation tester can confirm the fluid type by the downhole analyzer and actual fluid samples, this greatly reduce the uncertainly for evaluation and later stimulation.

Successful production from unconventional reservoirs is made possible by horizontal drilling and reservoir stimulation through multistage hydraulic fracturing along the laterals. Although hydraulic fracturing techniques have been widely used for unconventional gas stimulation, a considerable percentage of perforations do not contribute to production. The objective of this study is to integrate the geomechanical, petrophysical and completion parameters to precisely design hydraulic fracture for better hydrocarbon production. 
Reservoir characterization and optimizing completion parameters are essential for effective well design to improve staging and perforation placement. Challenges in the design of hydraulic fractures include the proper placement of fracturing ports, perforations, and location of isolation packers. The challenges are due to the large variability in fracture gradients, mechanical and reservoir properties, and petrophysical characteristics along the lateral. 
Industry experience shows that injection pressures required to fracture the formation (fracture gradient, FG) often vary significantly along a well and that there can be intervals where the formation cannot be fractured successfully by fluid injection due to high in-situ stress. 
Geomechanical and petrophysical evaluations providing rock anisotropy and anisotropic stress properties along the wellbore play a fundamental role in completion and hydraulic fracture design. The paper shows how geomechanical and petrophysical properties from open-hole logs and sonic anisotropy evaluations are integrated to compute reservoir quality (RQ) and completion quality (CQ). Intervals with similar properties are grouped to better understand and optimize hydraulic fracture design and operations. This optimization procedure has been applied in a borehole within a potential shale gas reservoir targeting the hot shale facies formation in Saudi Arabia.

The aim of this paper is to provide analytical solutions of stress fields in mechanical layers which consist of stiff and soft or compliant layers. The paper examines possible geological conditions of mode I (extension) fracture development on the basis of the analytical calculations with various layer thicknesses, Young's moduli, Poisson's ratios, external stress fields and pore-fluid pressure. Linear elastic model with two different mechanical layers is assumed for the calculations. Fluid-driven fractures, hydrofractures, are discussed in detail elsewhere and are not considered here. Layer-parallel stresses in the model caused by external stresses and pore-fluid pressure are mathematically calculated for both stiff and soft layers. Relative Young's modulus and relative thickness between the two types of layers are applied to simplify the associated equations. Poisson's ratio v is assumed to be same between the two. This is because the possible variation of Poisson's ratio between rocks is much smaller than those of the other parameters. The calculated ratio of minimum to maximum principal stresses within each layer is used to estimate fracture type which can develop under various geological conditions. The results indicate extension fracture preferably develop in stiff layer. Stress conditions in the model are primarily controlled by relationship among external horizontal stress <U+03C3>XX, vertical stress <U+03C3>ZZ and pore-fluid pressure Pf: no tensile fracture forms when <U+03C3>XX > Pf + v(<U+03C3>ZZ - Pf)/(1 - v); tensile fractures can form only in stiff layers in soft-layer-dominant system when Pf + v(<U+03C3>ZZ - Pf)/(1 - v) > <U+03C3>XX > Pf; tensile fractures form in stiff layers in both stiff-layer-dominant and soft-layer-dominant systems when Pf > <U+03C3>XX > 4Pf/3 - <U+03C3>ZZ/3; tensile fracture can form in both stiff and soft layers in soft-layer-dominant formation with small relative Young's modulus when 4Pf/3 - <U+03C3>ZZ/3 > <U+03C3>XX. Only shear fractures can form in soft layers, except the rare geological condition of 4Pf/3 - <U+03C3>ZZ/3 > <U+03C3>XX with very small relative Young's modulus. The results of analytical calculations provide potential criterion to estimate when and where layer-scale extension fracture network develops in relation with geological history. One implication of the results is that extension fracture formation is not necessarily related to regional tensile stress field but ratio among horizontal stress, vertical stress and pore-fluid pressure. This implies that extension fracture network can form in mechanical layers not only during crustal uplift/exhumation but also during basin-burial in which horizontal stress, vertical stress and pore-fluid pressure are increasing.|","mechanical layers, analytical calculation, extension fractures",1

The micro-scale hydraulic fracturing is a technique which is used to shorten the preheating period by means of controlling water injection to horizontal wells to create homogenously distributed microcracks in the zone between the two wells. Numerous simulation studies have been previously conducted to understand the growth of the steam chamber, however, the model to simulate mini-frac before preheating is left undone.

First, laboratory triaxial tests were designed to determinate the mechanical behavior of the oil sand and the mudstone caprock.

Finally, a micro-fracturing model coupled fluid-solid is implemented by with the finite element program ABAQUS, to describe the early SAGD start-up demonstrated on the SAGD well pair in Xinjiang oilfield. 
The first-hand target of ABAQUS simulation in this study is to evaluate the performance of micro-fracturing process, particularly, to determine the degree of connectivity of injection and production wells. Thereby to predetermine the bottom hole pressure (BHP) and volume of injection in order to provide a specific guidance for work program carried out in oilfield. As the matter of convenience, this study, according to the simulation results, have discussed how to define the extent of the connected parameters to determine the connectivity of the well pairs. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses have been done to realize the different parameters on proficiency of micro-scale hydraulic fracturing in the field. 
Our works are significantly important for the future development and promote the mini-frac tests to enhance the in-situ thermal recovery in Xinjiang oil field. In addition, the model and method can be implemented for any type of heavy oil field which requires early SAGD start-up to increase the oil recovery.|","oilsands, ABAQUS, SAGD, connectivity parameter, microcracks",21

Several concerns arise at the field development planning stage which may be only answered by geomechanical studies, such as wellbore stability analyses, sanding risk assessments, and studies of compaction and subsidence during the life of the field. These issues can be very important in large projects in deep-water environments. A comprehensive geomechanical study was conducted for an offshore deep-water gas field in Southeast Asia as part of the field development planning. 
The study covered a wide range of geomechanical studies from drilling to production stages for the entire life of the field. The geomechanical model was built based on the available logs and data from the exploration and appraisal wells drilled in the field. The model was then used for several geomechanical applications; a) wellbore and fault stability analysis to investigate the effect of the well trajectories on mud weight recommendations and casing design, b) sand production prediction analysis to study the risk of sanding for different completion scenarios, and c) compaction and subsidence analysis to study the impact of depletion on the platform and subsurface designs. 
A wellbore stability analysis was conducted to investigate the effect of wellbore trajectory on the safe mud weight window. The analysis suggested that the collapse pressure for any well in the field is dependent on the deviation of wells rather than their azimuths. The impact of the stability of the natural fractures and faults on the upper bound of the safe mud weight window was investigated in detail. The analysis showed that the mud weight required to reactivate the natural fracture and fault intersecting the wells is above the upper bound of the safe mud weight window defined by the wellbore stability analysis. 
The sand production prediction analysis showed that sanding is expected from the early stages of production for both open-hole and cased and perforated completions. The analysis suggested that selective and oriented perforations may only delay or reduce the risk of sanding and cannot eliminate it entirely. The compaction analysis showed that the maximum compaction is less than 1% for all reservoirs. This is significantly lower than the general criteria of 3% – 5% which may cause problems for casing and completion systems. Moreover, the maximum total calculated subsidence at the seabed is expected to be below the engineering design limits. 
All the methodologies and approaches used to conduct the above mentioned geomechanical analyses, and interpretation of the results are thoroughly explained in this paper. This study highlights the importance of the geomechanical studies for decision making in deep-water field development planning.|","Deep-water, Gas Filed, Geomechanics, Field Development, Southeast Asia",5

This paper presents a novel approach by integrating well log data evaluation to seismic rock physic calibration of field development plans. The result of the study was incorporated in the development drilling to optimizing well placement. To date, the well result demonstrates that the method was proven to determine the gas bearing sand distribution. As a consequence, drilling at a sweet spot location can be optimized. 
Reservoir fluid identification is a major role in the formation evaluation task. In the field with multiple stack sands and limited water salinity data, will cause more challenging to define fluid type. The result is very substantial to determine hydrocarbon in place, the volume of which will be used to take the decision to develop the gas field. The inherent uncertainty which comprises of sand and hydrocarbon distribution is a real challenge when identifying the sweet spot location in a development drilling campaign. 
Well log data provides essential information that will use for interpretation of lithofacies and fluid type. The elastic acoustic velocity of the formation taken by sonic tool is a common data that are considered in the petropysical evaluation. In essence, the advantage of ratio of sonic compressional to shear wave velocity is applied to identify gas bearing formations. This is based on the fact that compression wave is more sensitive to type of fluids than the shear wave when it travels into the poro-elastic formations. The same method is also relevant when applied to the seismic data. The seismic Vp/Vs ratio must be first calibrated with well data to provide a proper meaning. Thereafter, the seismic Vp/Vs ratio is exerted to determine gas bearing sand distribution. This information is expected to deliver a great contribution in the well placement optimization. 
The method is proven to reduce the uncertainty of lateral distribution at shallow reservoirs. The application of this method for deeper reservoir is still being investigated and further detail works will be done to confirm the findings.|","Formation Evaluation, Seismic Inversion, Sonic Log, Petrophysics, Exploration and Appraisal",13

Traditionally, hydraulic fracturing is considered as an effective stimulating method for unconventional reservoirs with extremely low permeabilities. For poorly consolidated sandstone formations in Gulf of Mexico, East China, West Africa, etc., hydraulic fracturing is used for control or solution of sand production and formation damage more than just creating conductivity. However, it is difficult to analyze the rock mechanisms after stimulation due to the consequences of weakening of proppant overtime and changing of fracture tortuosity, etc. Stress distribution in the formation has been altered with the propagation of fractures, which make the situation more complex. For simulation of solid rock, applied by Discrete Element Method (DEM), a dynamic numerical model approached by PFC 2D Modeling is used to evaluate geomechanical properties and predict the potential formation damage. DEM is also coupled with Pipeline Network Approximation (PNA) for solid-fluid interaction. In this paper, fracture initiation and propagation, anisotropic stress boundary effect, contact forces between particles, and change of stress are investigated in microscopic system. Results demonstrate that the shear cracking mode should not be neglected in the formation of low strength and high permeability. The simulation results from PFC modeling are in agreement with the conventional numerical simulation methods. This study provides an alternative method of understanding the fracture micro-mechanism for poorly-consolidated formations, which could be applied into design and optimization of hydraulic treatment.|","Pre-fractured, Geomechanical Evaluation, Discrete Element Method (DEM)",33

Over the past decade, significant improvements have been made in the stimulation treatment strategy to deal with the unique characteristics and complexities in naturally fractured shale reservoirs. Several well placement patterns have been developed to promote the fracture complexity and reduce the undesirable impacts of in-situ stress alteration in prevention of unfavorable fracture orientation. However, most traditional approaches used to evaluate the fracturing techniques usually relied on the production predicted using fracture model with the fracture geometry pre-determined or pre-established as a fixed pattern. Without a proper model representing the accurate reservoir characteristics, the validity of the evaluation could be significantly undermined. 
Operation parameters and the important considerations on fracture propagation - which include the interactions between natural fractures and approaching hydraulic fractures, the impacts of rock properties on fracture growth, the stress shadow due to in-situ stress alteration, and the fluid and proppant transport - are among the critical aspects known to enhance accurate representation of the fracture network geometry and its associated properties. Although an accurate production forecasting tool might be created by integrating the actual fracture geometry in the fluid flow model, having the precise characterization of the reservoir and all parameters are nearly impossible in practice. With availability of reliable data, we used the workflow engineered to develop the fracture network model with the enhanced capability to represent the behavior of the formation. With the grid specifically generated for the modeled DFN, more reliable production forecasting was attainable with reasonable computational and data requirements. Introduced approach and model developed were validated against the field data from a well pad in the Eagle Ford shale formation. 
Various hydraulic fracturing patterns were evaluated based on the production analysis. The study case based on the information used indicates that greater initial production rate and total oil recovery could be anticipated when each well in a pad has been fractured in alternating pattern, compared to the others. However, its relatively high decline rate might prevent the alternating technique to be the best option in long-term production. Conventional consecutive pattern appears to be less preferable in terms of production rate and volume recovered. The advantages of the zipper technique include late-time production rate and its relatively larger drainage area. 
The recommendations based on the analysis and evaluation performed using the approach presented in this study can be beneficial to the operators in terms of optimizing fracturing design and production. The approach itself can also be efficiently used to evaluate a design for any shale reservoir since a simulated fracture network is inclusive of formation characteristics in the area. This could help to prevent an unexpected adverse circumstance pertaining to the unsuitable design, avoiding both CAPEX and operation expenses.|","Shale, Naturally Fractured Reservoir, Multistage Hydraulic Fracturing, Unconventional Reservoir, Coupled Geomechanics Fracture Model",3

The Umm Gudair 12.25-in. vertical drilling performance section involves several technical challenges for engineering an application-specific PDC bit. The interval consists of two formations that require contradictory bit design principles. The abrasive Zubair formation incorporates sandstones interbedded with hard shale streaks, followed by dual Ratawi intervals of hard shales that are succeeded by compacted limestone. The initial sand interval abrades the cutting structure, resulting in slower rates of penetration in the deeper carbonates. The premature dulling of cutters then causes lower carbonate drilling efficiency. Typically, the section is drilled at 35 feet per hour (fph) and requires 2 bits to complete. 
After reviewing offsets with faster than average rates of penetration that successfully completed the interval in the same application, a design compromise was achieved. The new optimized bit design is based on a seven-bladed bit with sixteen-mm cutters. Subsequent design iterations optimized the cutter selection and the cutting structure to maximize durability in the sands while remaining aggressive enough to drill the lower carbonates. An iterative design-and-simulate process then followed, simulating bit stability against formation strength data and optimising drilling fluid flow dynamics. The design was adjusted repeatedly based on the simulation results until a balance in aggressiveness, stability and flow was reached. 
After the design process concluded, optimal drilling parameters for each formation were drawn up from offset wells, and the new design was field tested. Drilling stability improved in the sand interval while cutting structure integrity was sustained into the deeper carbonates, resulting in improved rates of penetration in both intervals. After several runs, the results demonstrated that significant gains in rates of penetration were made; reaching over 90 feet per hour (fph) in some cases, almost doubling current rates of penetration. The post-run dull condition of the bits tended to be virtually new (1-1-WT), and in one instance the bit re-ran on a second well, drilling the interval at 53fph. 
This paper demonstrates a successful engineering design process for such a challenging section in the Umm Gudair Field. It then highlights the technologies featured in this bit and their value in drilling this application. Finally, field test results are analysed and the improvements in drilling performance and time and monetary savings to the operator are quantified.|","PDC, Performance, Impact, Abrasive, Bit",35

For decades, the oil and gas exploration industry evaluated assets and screened them for future development based on certain characteristic requirements/pay cutoffs such as shale percentage, water saturation, and porosity. Reservoirs that did not meet these specific requirements were considered uneconomical and not considered for further development. Currently, as the demand for energy is continuously rising, those reservoirs that were considered uneconomical in the past because of a lack of original hydrocarbon flow capacity and were overlooked are attracting significant attention for development globally, and now a considerable percentage of the world hydrocarbon production is coming from these emerging unconventional reservoirs, such as shale gas, tight gas, and coalbed methane. The challenge in developing these unconventional assets is that they cannot produce at economic rates without an effective stimulation treatment. To achieve the required reservoir stimulation effectiveness, a coherent understanding of the subsurface characteristics of the reservoir is necessary, such as depositional environment, structural and lithological characteristics, rock mechanics, and geomechanical properties. This thorough evaluation of the reservoir is needed not only to determine the best stimulation approach but also to aid in deciding the most suitable well architecture—trajectory, azimuth, and completion concept—to maximize the benefit of the planned stimulation concept. Whereas the stimulation treatment design was usually only considered later in the life of the reservoir, for these formations, it is considered during a much earlier stage in the planning phase, moving from a drill-to- produce to a drill-to-stimulate and late-produce concept. Hydraulic fracturing is the most effective and widely used stimulation concept in modern times and was vital for making the shale gas plays in North America economic assets. Lately, it has attracted much attention, and a significant amount of scientific/engineering efforts are being exerted to develop a better understanding of how rocks will behave under hydraulic fracturing conditions. Understanding rock major behavioral characteristics, such as failure mechanisms, fracture growth patterns, and fracture height containment, is crucial for identifying the fracturing strategy, rate requirement, treatment volumes, and, more importantly, the number of stages required to maximize the stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) and hence a single well's deliverability.|","volcanic, Fracturing, limited entry, multistage fracturing, Tight gas",9

Apparent matrix permeability of organic-rich shale is complicated because of its unique pore structure, gas storage and transport mechanisms. In inorganic pores, free gas is the only phase considered. While in organic pores, adsorbed phase coexists with free gas. Surface diffusion is the transport mechanism of the adsorbed phase. However, transport mechanism of free gas varies during production and is distinguished by the Knudsen number. Slip flow, transition flow, Knudsen diffusion and surface diffusion are found in organic pores, whereas only slip flow and transition flow occur in inorganic pores. The effects of pore size, pressure and temperature on the transport mechanism are discussed. Pressure reduction causes a change in transport mechanisms during production. Stress dependency of inorganic pores is one of the factors that affect pore size, transport mechanism and permeability. The apparent permeability is derived by calculating the geometric average of permeability of different units with varying pore sizes and permeabilities. Sensitivity analysis shows that stress-dependency plays an important role in inorganic pores, which results in the positive correlation between permeability and pressure. Conversely, in inorganic pores, permeability increases as pressure decreases. As a result, permeability decreases and then increases with decreasing pressure.|","Geometric Average, Permeability, Transport Mechanism, Organic Shale, Analytical Solution",39

The main objective of this paper is to present the assessment and methodology that would improve the tight oil recovery by hydraulic fracturing (HF) wells. The methodology is enabled by a fully integrated workflow orchestrating petro-physical log interpretation, static modelling, and dynamic modelling coupled with rock mechanics for an optimal fracturing design and mitigating the underlying risks. 
In the past, well placement in tight reservoirs and HF design were performed mostly based on available analogous data of offset wells using rock mechanics parameters such as stress magnitude and regional stress orientation to predict the fractures that would propagate through the reservoir in a certain location and well orientation, the stress/strain regime is one of the key parameters that plays an important role. It is also the key performance indicator for developing the tight oil reservoir with underlying complexities. 
The process is initiated by the conventional static modelling which involves structural framework construction, distributing the petro-physical characteristics subject to the well logs and other available subsurface data. The second step is to perform a history match of a derived dynamic model by honouring the observed data. This process helps in calibrating the model to be able to represent reservoir dynamic behavior. The results of the history matched model; i.e., reservoir pressure through time is the key input for the Mechanical Earth Model (MEM) in the next step. The MEM process starts with the construction of a 1D MEM using well log advanced scanner and rock mechanics properties from laboratory to represent the strength and elastic properties of the rock where existing wells have been penetrated into the reservoir layers. Hence, a coupled dynamic reservoir simulation with 3D geomechanical model will yield a realistic relationship between the current reservoir depletion state in terms of pressure and the current stress strain regime. This relationship is paramount for optimal location indentification of the fracturing wells and corresponding design together with an estimation of the subsequent recovery. Also, the rock mechanic simulation study would yield a comprehensive result with respect to the reservoir mechanical integrity while conducting the hydraulic fracturing operation to increase the well productivity. 
This integrated workflow is considered as the key step for tight oil reservoir development, and it can be expanded to unconventional resources for a better reservoir characterisation and reservoir development. The study was performed within close collaboration within the teams with comprehensive know-how sharing and exchange.|","Tight Oil Reservoir, Integrated Study, Mechanical Earth Model, Reservoir Simulation, Geomechanics",23

Cairn India Ltd & ONGC completed a joint venture appraisal of the Barmer Hill (BH) field in the Rajasthan block of India in 2015. The objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of horizontal multi-frac completions. The Barmer hill field is a moderate permeability (0.5 – 4 mD) oil bearing porcellanite with alternating sequences of tight shale. To produce this reservoir economically, hydraulic fracturing was the obvious choice of stimulation and was performed on a number of vertical wells (see Shaoul et al. 2007). To better evaluate the development strategy, completions using either transverse or longitudinal fracture treatments were successfully designed, executed, and evaluated. In the appraisal phase, four vertical and four horizontal wells were drilled to appraise the Barmer Hill reservoir in the Mangala field. Two of the horizontal wells were drilled along the maximum horizontal stress direction and completed with multiple hydraulic fracturing stages, which generated longitudinal fractures along the lateral wellbore. The fracture orientation with respect to the wellbore was confirmed with micro-seismic monitoring. This fracture treatment strategy provided the opportunity to decrease the number of frac stages and exhibited lower treating pressures as predicted by standard elastic rock mechanics theory. 
While the initial productivity of the transverse fractured wells was expected to be almost 2.5 times more than the longitudinally fractured well, it only produced about 40% more. In addition, the EUR of the longitudinally fractured well is almost the same as the transversely fractured well. Based on the generated fracture geometry, theoretically these longitudinally fractured horizontal wells may also provide better effective sweep efficiency when converted to a water injector from a field development concept.|","moderate permeability, transverse and longitudinal fracture treatments, multistage hydraulic fracturing, development strategy, micro-seismic",5

Wellbore ballooning (or wellbore breathing) is a pertinent drilling issue in exploration wells where the formation lithology, geo-mechanics, pore pressure and fracture pressure regime is not fully understood. This phenomenon is generally observed in formations with micro-fractures. While the pumps are on the ECD is just sufficient to open up the natural micro-fractures allowing the mud to enter the formation. As the pumps are switched off the dynamic pressure effect is lost and the static mud weight is insufficient to keep the fracture open, resulting in the mud lost in the formation to flow-back as the fracture closes. A flow back of mud is observed on the surface with pumps off, which can be misinterpreted as wellbore influx or kick. 
Misinterpreting a wellbore ballooning phenomenon as a well kick can lead to the application of standard well control procedure which can aggravate the problem and may have severe implications even to the extent of well failing to meet its objective and being prematurely abandoned. 
This paper presents case studies of two wells, viz. NJ North East-1 and Raag Deep Main-1, drilled by the operator in the same block. Severe ballooning was observed in the first well wherein delayed identification of the phenomenon resulted in high NPT and consequential cost impact. The lessons learnt from this experience were implemented in the second well with similar ballooning issues, along with close real-time well monitoring while drilling resulting in smooth drilling operation and successful achievement of objectives as per plan This paper also summarizes suitable in-field drilling practices to be adopted and implemented to mitigate wellbore ballooning, which can be a low-cost alternative to expensive technologies used to counter this phenomenon.|","Best Drilling Practices, Wellbore Breathing, Exploratory Drilling, Wellbore Ballooning",46

The Single Well Chemical Tracer (SWCT) method has proven to be a reliable technique to measure near wellbore residual oil saturation (Sor) and to validate the chemical formulation developed in the laboratory prior to full field Chemical EOR (CEOR). The objective of this work is to establish an inclusive SWCT test program of a new generation Surfactant-Polymer (SP) that can withstand seawater via a holistic approach, making the project first in the world for offshore application. 
A robust study was carried out to develop an optimum SWCT pilot to validate the chemical effectiveness in terms of Sor reduction between post waterflood and SP flood in one of the Malaysian offshore fields. This paper demonstrates a seamless integration from multi-disciplinary teams to propose a SWCT concept, commencing from a vigorous R&D program to a comprehensive subsurface and surface evaluations, as part of derisking steps of key risks and uncertainties. The SP formulation has demonstrated encouraging outcome in the laboratory. Hence, the results and lessons learnt are required to be validated in the field. 
Some critical parameters were properly quantified during the fluid-fluid and fluid- rock evaluations in the laboratory such as surfactant-polymer compatibility, phase behavior, interfacial tension, Sor reduction and adsorption to ensure the chemical formulation readiness. The test was designed to utilize one existing producer with minimal workover for cost optimization. A detailed well screening review was performed on the existing wells, with the integrity check surpassed the selection criteria. This consideration is essential to ensure that the selected wells are fit for pilot program, without compromising on pilot objectives. Other selection criteria also included reservoir quality, pay zone thickness, gas interference, and high water cut wells, wells configuration and status. Subsequently, detailed numerical modeling works were performed, including the coreflood modeling for scaling up chemical parameters and radial modeling to reinforce the SWCT test design. Sensitivity analysis were conducted to find the optimum preflush, slug size, and injection rate and flowback period. Similarly, the surface team looked at various concept select options within the constraint imposed by the offshore environment and aging facilities. Due to these challenges, a floating facility, which is an accommodation work barge was selected as the most feasible option to outfit the chemical mixing, injection and back production equipment.

Mud weight optimization is a key driver in attaining optimum wellbore stability while drilling horizontal wells. This paper demonstrates the role of geomechanical knowledge prior to and while drilling to address wellbore stability related issues to help reduce drilling risk and non-productive time (NPT). 
To maximize gas production from a tight carbonate reservoir, horizontal drilling and multistage hydraulic fracturing methods have been adopted. For several wells, maintaining wellbore stability has been a challenge without prior geomechanical knowledge of the field resulting in undesired drilling events such as tight hole excessive reaming, stuck pipe, and difficulties while making trips. Even in wells with pre-drill geomechanical analysis for mud weight recommendations, uncertainty in the pore pressure due to depletion along the horizontal section of the wellbore, drilling with one recommended single mud weight (MW) posed great challenge to manage wellbore stability. 
In this paper, statistical analysis of data is used to investigate root causes of wellbore stability related issues for a number of horizontal wells drilled in the direction of the minimum horizontal stress. The analysis suggests that wells drilled with little understanding of geomechanical properties along the wellbore path encountered significant NPT's compared to those wells where understanding of rock mechanical behavior and in-situ stresses was utilized to make recommendations prior to drilling. In some cases it helped reduce NPT to less than 2% even in exploration wells. 
Among the successful wells, results from a case study describing the real-time (RT) geomechanics workflow was used to optimize MW enabling drilling the well to the planned target depth. The uncertainty related to pore pressure and intervals of high porosity which creates a significant risk of differential sticking were addressed by incorporating RT data and updating wellbore stability models and providing recommendation to the field operation. The paper demonstrates the role of geomechanics and its impact to drilling operations aimed to reduce operation cost and increase drilling efficiency by eliminating geomechanics-related wellbore stability problems.|","Wellbore stability, Geomechanics, Drilling, Real-time, NPT",52

A shale gas field at the southern edge of the Sichuan basin, China, started its oilfield development plan (ODP) in early 2014. The first wells drilled in this field and its adjacent blocks experienced significant challenges, such as severe mud losses, stuck tools, losses in the hole, high treating pressure, and unexpected screenout. Because it is vital to have accurate understanding of geomechanics and its roles at various scales, three-dimensional (3D) full-field and pad geomechanics models were developed for achieving both efficiency and effectiveness during the ODP. 
The work is based on high-resolution structural, geological, reservoir property, and multiscale natural fracture models. An extensive characterization of mechanical properties was conducted by the evaluation of cores, well logs, and seismic data. A systematic approach was implemented to build a 3D pore pressure model of the field. Finally, an advanced finite element simulator was used to compute 3D stress distribution, which fully owns all features and local changes of structural, geological, mechanical, and reservoir properties, and multiscale natural fracture models. The large model (80<U+00D7>80-m cell) covers the full field, and the pad model (20<U+00D7>20-m cell) covers a 15- to 20-km2 area. All have 0.5-m vertical resolution of the targeted sweet section to capture vertical heterogeneities measured from logs. Large-scale parallel computing technology was used to perform such massive geomechanical modeling. The models were calibrated or constrained by all available data such as mud logs, cores, borehole images, drilling data, prefracturing injection tests, hydraulic fracturing responses, microseismic events, and flowback data. All models were updated continuously when new data became available. 
The computed stress models match the highly compressive background and current understanding of the dominant tectonic movements of the Sichuan basin. They are sufficient to reveal orientations, magnitudes, anisotropies, and heterogeneities of in-situ stresses. Large variations of in-situ stresses can be quantified among pads and wells and along laterals. Such variations correspond to or align with changes in texture and composition at various scales, such as faults and complex multiscale natural fractures. The full-field model was used to optimize pad and well locations and well trajectories and assess geological integrity, resources in place, and instability of natural fractures. The high-resolution pad models were used for near-wellbore stability analysis, real-time drilling management, engineering hydraulic fracturing design and monitoring, and integrated post-fracturing analysis. The implemented approach was proven to be effectively integrated into the progress of drilling and completion. This is the first time such 3D geomechanics models have been built for China's shale gas development. The knowledge and experience gathered can certainly benefit other similar projects.|","Sichuan Basin, Shale Gas Development, Full Field Modeling, Longmaxi Formation, Three Dimensional Geomechanics",63

From drilling perspective, the two horizontal stress path coefficients (<U+03B3>shmax and <U+03B3>shmin) are the key for accurate borehole collapse pressure and fracture pressure prediction in the depleted reservoirs. However, field measurements and theoretical descriptions have focused only on the change in the minimum horizontal stress. Constrained by opportunities for direct measurement and calibration, the changes in the total stresses in the horizontal plane are often assumed symmetric, i.e. <U+03B3>shmax = <U+03B3>shmin. This paper explores the stress path computed for the depleted reservoirs in Field X from full-field numerical simulations and its implications on future drilling activity. The major findings are:  
The numerical model suggests significant anisotropy in the two horizontal stress path coefficients. 
The model also predicts variations in the two horizontal stress path coefficients with time at different stages of depletion despite a linear-elastic reservoir constitutive model. 
The onset of production is defined by a relatively higher <U+03B3>shmin compared to <U+03B3>shmax. This is seen to reverse with a higher <U+03B3>shmax compared to <U+03B3>shmin at the later stages of reservoir development.|These insights on the evolution of horizontal stresses in Field X favorably affect future development options in Field X. The paper discusses the causes and implications of the temporal variations in the horizontal stress path coefficients in Field X, which are also applicable to other small fault bounded reservoirs.|","stress path, field development, geomechanics, fracture gradient, Depleted drilling",40

In recent years, exploration in northeast India has focused mainly in the area south of the Naga fault. This area is tectonically active with complex folding and faulting. Target formations are in excess of 3,000m through these complex structures. ONGC has drilled several wells in the Tripura region of northeast India. Although results were encouraging, the main challenges faced during drilling were various well control and instability events: kicks, tight hole, stuck pipe, lost in hole, etc. The causes of this instability were difficult to isolate. Experience from past wells also indicated the existence of overpressure in the Middle Bhuban Formation, which could not be accurately predicted by surface seismic data. Hence, drilling through these highly stressed and overpressured formations led to excessive NPT and cost. In addition, severe hole enlargement and rugosity through eventual reservoir sections resulted in poor logging conditions and uncertain reservoir evaluation. As a result, access and interpretation of the reservoirs, to prove and produce reserves, is a major challenge in this region. In this paper, two case studies are presented to show how a geomechanics-based approach has significantly improved drilling rates by reducing the drilling-related problems. New wells were drilled within 40% of the planned number of days. Better hole conditions not only improved drilling performance but also led to huge improvements in reservoir evaluation and the identification of unloading mechanisms, probably caused by uplift due to thrusting, in the Middle Bhuban Formation. Integrated study provided valuable information about overpressure and stresses acting in this field/structure for future drilling.|","Overpressure, evaluation, Stuck pipe, Drilling, optimization",39

Pore pressure prediction plays a very important role in well planning as exploration targets is shifting to deeper overpressured reservoirs. Pressure related problems in such zones are mainly associated with narrow operating window resulting in severe well control incidents, sometimes even leading to early abandonment. Uncertainties in prediction models arise from input data, assumptions used in the workflow and the complexity of the geological/structural conditions.

Knowledge of the in-situ stress state and how it varies with reservoir depletion is important for the design and execution of in-fill drilling. This paper highlights the key geomechanical aspects and their usage in planning of wells through severely depleted (up to 25 MPa) and overpressured zones within a very short depth interval (few 10s of m), in an onshore gas field in Brunei. With focus shifting from oil to deep-gas development, drilling complications include risks of wellbore instability, excessive mud loss and internal blowouts, as well as differential sticking in the depleted reservoirs. Moreover, fracturing of the depleted sands while drilling infill wells carries the risk of jeopardizing production at nearby producing wells because of locally altered flow paths. The risks were evaluated by application of empirical and analytical geomechanical models of stress changes with depletion, and by elasto-plastic finite element models of borehole instability (collapse) due to shear failure. 
Our results show that for an average depletion rate of 1 MPa/year, the drilling window (difference between maximum allowable mud weight controlled by fracture pressure and minimum mud weight controlled by formation pore pressure or borehole collapse pressure, whichever is greater) is likely to remain open for the coming 12 years. Minifrac or extended leak-off tests at different stages of field development should be taken to monitor stress changes within the reservoirs and provide updates for calibration of the geomechanical model. 
Next to showing the geomechanical model results and their application to drilling, we demonstrate the refinement of pore pressure/fracture pressure predictions (i.e. narrowing down the uncertainty in the drilling window) for mature fields where producing ""from the bottom up"" has not been feasible. We also indicate how risks associated with drilling through depleted/undepleted reservoir sequences in a single hole section can be managed to as low as reasonably practicable with the help of geomechanical input. These results ""open the door"" for accessing deeper potential pay zones by drilling through severely depleted formations.|","drilling window, depletion, finite-element models, borehole stability, geomechanics",16

At the beginning of 2015 in response to the well construction difficulties faced by drilling companies such as lost circulation, slow Rate of Penetration (ROP) and increasing flat times observed while drilling in an extra heavy oil asset in the Gulf of Mexico, the operator implemented a real-time drilling monitoring center called Centro Inteligente de Pozos (CIP by its Spanish acronym). 
The whole purpose of the team and technologies deployed at the CIP is to Anticipate and prevent drilling events; effectively and systematically reduce drilling Nonproductive times (NPT); implement best practices aimed to optimize drilling performance and operate closer to the wells’ technical limits; and accelerate initial oil production by finishing wells before expected. 
The CIP solution is comprised of a very well balanced combination of technologies, resources and processes as follow:  
Data acquisition, transmission and visualization: Vendor neutral technologies and services are deployed in both ends the rig and the office to enable data collection, integration, aggregation and transmission. 
Risk analysis: For each well and prior to start drilling, the CIP team prepares a detailed drilling risk analysis, which includes risk description, prevention and mitigation practices. 
Drilling optimization: CIP’s engineers use specialized drilling monitoring software to analyze available data, managed identified risks, optimize performance, and make operating recommendations to exceed performance while drilling within the wells’ technical limits. |At the CIP, the well-coordinated efforts between the operator and the service company in conjunction with the application of efficient processes and innovative technologies, have been cornerstone to reach drilling optimization while minimizing the negative impact of drilling events; making the CIP initiate a success for the operator and service companies. 
As a result of implementing the CIP, wells in the Extra Heavy Oil Asset have been drilled in record times. For example, a well that was originally planned to be drilled in 116.7 days was drilled in 89.9 days. This represents total savings of 26.8 rig days (~23% time saved), with a corresponding oil production estimated at 6,000.00 bpd. 
Our industry constantly strives to drill faster and safer wells while drilling in more challenging environments. In the author’s opinion one way to achieve this is by adapting classic surveillance procedures with modern workflows based on real-time data and considering relevant analysis such as risk estimation, real-time geomechanics and flat times optimization.

Today, oil and gas industries have been continuously drilling into deeper reservoirs and into high temperature formations. Drilling high temperature wells poses new challenges with current available drilling tools because the operating temperatures can closely reach and at times, surpass downhole tools' temperature specifications. The temperature will affect electronics, elastomer or rubber components in tools, sensors, or even could reduce the mechanical strength of the steel collar and cause twist-off. The development of downhole tool technology continues to strengthen and increase the tool temperature rating to withstand those challenges. Utilizing high temperature rated downhole tools can be significantly expensive compared to standard temperature rating tools (150oC). Other technological developments for high temperature wells rely on mud properties and mud surface cooling system. Despite that, one of the key factors to successful drilling operations in high temperature wells still lies on the capability to simulate downhole conditions taking account various technologies and parameters involved, understand the potential challenge and risks, and predict down-hole circulating temperatures that tools will be exposed to.|","Modeling, High Temperature, HPHT, Well Design, Dynamic Temperature",60

This paper describes the optimization of a hybrid bit which is a polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) bit with rolling cone cutters to improve dynamics and durability. When drilling the hard & interbedded formations with conglomerates in the Tarim Basin in Northwest China, PDC bits break down with broken & chipped cutters in the cone, nose & shoulder sections of the profile. In addition severe torsional vibrations lead to twist-off's and stick-slip which damages the bit and drilling system. Even worse, because of the torsional vibration, less Weight on Bit (WOB) is being applied, which results in lower Rate of Penetration (ROP), less footage and more trips. Roller-cone bits generally drill faster than PDC bits, but bearing life is short in the hard and abrasive conglomerates. 
Due to success in similar application elsewhere in the world, a hybrid bit was proposed and tried to drill the challenging formations in the Tarim Basin. In the first run the entire conglomerate interval was drilled at higher ROP, with lower torsional oscillations and saving 16 rig days. Although this was a success there was an opportunity for further improvement by strengthening the PDC cutting structure to avoid premature cutter damage mainly in the central, cone section of the profile. 
An upgraded hybrid bit with split, overlapping blades and more durable Dual Chamfer cutters was deployed in the same interval. Respective performance of PDC, Roller Cone, Hybrid bit and Optimized Hybrid bit used in the same formation are compared in terms of footage, ROP, Mechanical Specific Efficiency (MSE) and dull condition. By using Optimized Hybrid bit, the customer saved multiple bit runs & drilled eight times farther with the ROP 92% faster than conventional PDC bit run in the same well.|","Hybrid, Optimization, MSE",53

The swelling of smectite clays in the interburden rock layers of coal seam gas wells results in spalling of fine particles that may negatively impact gas production through damage to the well's pump and/or the permeability of the coal layers. One of the causes of the clay swelling is the change in water chemistry at the wellbore location due to drilling fluids and the influx of produced water. The conventional technology to mitigate the swelling of smectite clays in oil and gas reservoirs is to stabilize the clay using a brine such as 4 % KCl, and although this technology is relatively low cost and initially effective the mitigation of clay swelling is temporary because K+ ions are easily washed from the clay when the well is brought into production. An alternative approach recently reported is to use nanoparticles and nanofluids to control clay swelling. 
In this laboratory study we evaluated the effectiveness of five commercially available nanoparticles – SiO2, Al2O3, ZnO, Fe2O3, and ZrO2 – to prevent swelling of a natural bentonite clay that was rich in sodium montmorillonite. The effectiveness of the nanoparticles to prevent clay swelling was measured with a visual swelling index method based on ASTM D5890-11 and compared to the swelling of the clay in 4 % KCl brine. In the initial nanoparticle screening tests performed in distilled water all the nanoparticles except for the ZnO exhibited some potential to mitigate the swelling of bentonite. The next stage of screening experiments was performed in model formation water solutions containing 2500 mg /L and 9000 mg/L of Na ions at pHs of 5 and 9. In the model formation water tests, the SiO2 was the most effective nanoparticle to mitigate clay swelling across the range of conditions examined. 
These experimental results suggest nanoparticles may be a potential solution to mitigate clay swelling and spalling in coal seam gas reservoirs as well as other types of reservoirs. Further research is required to elucidate the mechanism of swelling inhibition with SiO2 nanoparticles and to develop practical methods to deploy nanoparticles into a CSG well.|","smectite, clay swelling, fines, nanoparticles, coal bed methane",17

Waterflooding is often planned for unconsolidated sand reservoirs for pressure support or production enhancement. Injections may be carried out under ""matrix"" or ""fracture"" conditions. Despite the typically high permeability and high porosity nature of unconsolidated sand reservoirs, global experiences suggest that water injection in such formations is not trouble free. Under matrix injection significant injectivity decline due to formation plugging could be encountered within the first few years or even months of the injector start up, particularly in the absence of fine filtering of water. Injection under fracture conditions may be considered to avoid formation plugging and injectivity decline. However field evidences suggest that ""fracture"" water injection in unconsolidated soft reservoirs could lead to high pressures, potential loss of containment and failure of sand control. The consequence of severe injectivity loss for either injection strategy is early injector abandonment or replacement of expensive wells and production deferment or loss of waterflood reserves. 
Considering the above limitations for different injection strategies, it is paramount that geological settings, formation type, rock mechanical properties and consolidation levels are considered in selecting water injection strategy, well completion and topsides filtration design in field development planning. Even with these considerations it is often not possible to confidently predict the performance of water injectors in unconsolidated sand, particularly under fractured conditions. There is no widely accepted theoretical understanding of the fracturing process in soft formations and therefore the predictive capabilities for modelling injectivity are quite limited. 
This paper presents the geomechanical factors considered for selecting the waterflooding strategy for a particular deepwater, unconsolidated soft sand reservoir in offshore Sabah, Malaysia. The actual decision making process was based on an integrated approach between various subsurface and engineering disciplines. However, due to the unconsolidated formation settings, as well as the faulted nature of the caprock and reservoir, geomechanics played a critical role in devising the waterflood deployment strategy and setting operational limits to ensure containment. The work involved comprehensive geomechanical modelling of the waterflooding process in the reservoir using both analytical and 3D numerical modelling. Global experiences of waterflooding in unconsolidated formations were also invaluable and were integrated in selection of completions and development strategy.|","Waterflooding, Containment, Caprock, Fracture",30

Historically, one to two polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) bits were utilized in this section and were pulled out for low penetration rates.

Horizontal wells with multi-stage fracturing have been proved to be an efficient technology to exploit thin-interbed reservoirs. However, problems were encountered during multi-stage fracturing of horizontal wells in the Silurian reservoir in Ta-zhong Oilfield, western China. This paper mainly discussed the causes of these problems and the optimized completion and fracturing designs to avoid these problems. 
Ta-zhong Silurian reservoir is a thin-interbed, low-permeability reservoir with buried depth from 4000 to 4500m. The sand distribution is heterogeneous both vertically and horizontally. A horizontal well in this reservoir was fractured twice using two different multistage fracturing technologies, firstly hydraulic jetting fracturing and then packer-segregated fracturing. Abnormal pumping pressure and difficulties to add proppants were encountered in both of the two operations. The causes to these failures will be analyzed comprehensively, based on which an optimized multi-stage fracturing design of this well will be proposed through numerical modeling and analysis. 
According to the analysis, defective completion and fracturing design is the main cause of the failures experienced in the two operations. The ill-considered jetting parameters caused the difficulties of fracture propagation and proppant placement during the hydraulic jetting fracturing treatment, whereas inappropriate perforating intervals led to simultaneous initiation of multiple fractures in each stage during the packer-segregated fracturing treatment. These fractures interfered with each other and led to great near-wellbore pressure losses and fracture reorientation, and then resulted in abnormally high pumping pressure and challenges of proppant placement. Several changes to avoid these problems are proposed and incorporated in a new multi-stage fracturing design. The jetting parameters, fracture spacing, fracture geometries as well as perforation parameters are all optimized by numerical modeling in the new design of well A and other horizontal wells in Ta-zhong Silurian reservoir, which is expected to avoid the above-mentioned problems and obtain better results. 
Nowadays, horizontal wells with multi-stage fracturing are a common-used technology in tight thin-interbed formations. However, the design of segregated completion and multi-stage fracturing is still a challenge for such formations. This paper introduced the lessons learned from a failure case and proposed an optimized completion and fracturing design, therefore provided a good reference for completion design of the wells in Ta-zhong Silurian reservoir as well as similar reservoirs in the world.|","multi-stage fracturing, segregated completion, hydraulic jetting, thin-interbed, horizontal well",19

Access to new reservoirs requires drilling at increasingly greater depths through more challenging environments with limited resources. Hard Rock bit cutting structure layout has been developed to extend bit life, drilling through hard, abrasive, and thick conglomerate and sandstone intervals while achieving significant rate of penetration (ROP) improvement. A case study is presented to demonstrate the liability and consistency of this new technology. 
In Oman, one of the most challenging formations is Amin. It's composed of hard conglomerates, abrasive sandstone, and layers of medium hard shale. The formation thickness is typically 1500 m. 
Roller cone bits have been used to drill it for years with low performance and high operational risks. Eight to eleven bits were usually required to drill the section at poor ROP. 
Polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) bits were also tested previously with limited improvement at poor footage and ROP. 
An unconventional bit cutting structure layout referred to as multilevel force balancing was used to develop fit-for-purpose designs combined to a new generation of cutters. 
A comprehensive engineering analysis of bit performance in the area was carried out, including formation strength, bit design details, drive system, and an understanding of drilling parameters. Additionally, the introduction of new materials led to bit design adjustments based on hard rock drilling concepts. The combination of cutter technology and multilevel cutting structure layout was used to create a fixed cutter bit, setting records for drilling hard and abrasive lithology in Oman, delivering more intervals drilled with higher ROPs than the roller cone bits used previously. The bit consumption was reduced to an average of three bits, achieving 75% improvement in terms of footage drilled, and 100% ROP improvement. 
This new generation of fixed cutter bits has now become the standard for drilling in high interbedded formation as well as hard and abrasive rock formations in Oman.

The Bonga FPSO was designed to process 280 MBLPD gross liquid, constrained by the three-phase low pressure (LP) separator capacity. The projected production forecast indicated that additional future volumes of produced fluids from the Bonga field could exceed the design capacity of the installation. FMC's Inline PhaseSplitter was identified as a solution for debottlenecking the three-phase LP separator liquid handling capacity. The PhaseSplitter is a compact pipe-based cyclonic separator that splits the feed flow into a gas stream with limited liquid carry-over and a liquid stream with limited gas carry-under. The performance objective for the PhaseSplitter is 70 % or more gas removal while keeping liquid carry-over in the gas outlet below 1 % volume fraction. 
In this paper, we report results of a technical qualification program (TQP) for the PhaseSplitter as a debottlenecking tool for the three-phase LP separator. We used a down-scaled 3 inch pipe of the PhaseSplitter as compared to a 24 inch full-scale field unit. A model fluid whose physical properties resemble the Bonga fluids was used, thereby giving credence to the test results. A test matrix covering a range of representative feed conditions was probed: gas volume fraction (GVF) 75 - 90%, water cuts 20 - 80% and inlet momentums 4500 - 11000 Pa. We measured the percentage of gas removed from the feed and the amount of liquid carry-over into the removed gas as function of the flow split to the gas outlet. 
The results show that for almost all test conditions, acceptance criteria that were set for the PhaseSplitter were met, i.e. 75 - 80% gas removal and liquid carry-over with the gas less than 1%. Gas-liquid separation performance gradually decreases with decreasing momentum and GVF in the feed. We observed no dependence of separation performance on the feed water cut. We plotted the results as function of the normalized flow split showing universal trends. These trends provide a means to control the separation performance by monitoring the pressure drop over both outlets. We conclude that the PhaseSplitter delivers a robust performance under steady-state conditions over a wide range of operating conditions.|","FPSO, Gas-Liquid Separation, Debottlenecking, Inline PhaseSplitter",3

The key challenge in unconventional gas plays covering vast geographical areas is locating the regions in the reservoir with the highest combination of reservoir and completions quality. This allows operators to evaluate not only the richness of their resource but also the ability of the reservoir to produce hydrocarbons in commercial quantities. 
This paper discusses hydraulic fracturing designs targeting tight gas in horizontal wells drilled in the Apollonia tight chalk formation in the Abu-Gharadig basin, Western Desert, Egypt through the integration of laboratory, geological, petrophysical, geomechanical, fracture simulation, and diagnostic fracture injection test (DFIT) analysis. 
Laboratory testing, which included scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), was conducted to determine mineralogy and potential damage mechanisms. Fracturing fluid chemistry was tested and optimized using core plugs from representative reservoir rock (fracture conductivity, fracturing fluid compatibility, surfactant type, fracture regain permeability, and scale tendency). 
Geomechanical rock properties derived from advanced petrophysical analysis of newly acquired high-definition triple-combo full-wave sonic logs and core samples were combined with geological parameters and potential treating schedules to develop sophisticated fracture simulation models. These models were then refined with in-situ reservoir data obtained from DFIT analyses to derive the final fracturing treatment design. 
The stimulation model was built using a three-dimensional (3D) geological model with multidisciplinary inputs, including formation properties, in-situ stresses, natural fractures, and completion parameters (i.e., well orientation, stage and perforation cluster spacing, fluid volume, viscosity, and proppant volume, size, and ramping schedule). 
The integration of all available data resulted in an optimized fracture design that helped reduce both cost and formation damage, thus improving flowback, long-term productivity, and profitability from this tight formation.|","Unconventional Reservoir, Horizontal Multistage Hydraulic Fracturing, Tight Chalk",4

Rock stress changes strongly impact well drilling schedules, well placement, fracture design and fluid production in unconventional reservoirs. The objectives of this work are to understand and quantify the effects of stress changes caused by production and fracture stimulation in tight reservoir (shale oil/gas) plays. The implications of stress changes on well drilling (timing), interference between wells due to stresses (well placement) and fracture design (number, placement and timing) are investigated in this work. 
Numerical simulation models that integrate several physical effects have been used to achieve these objectives. This integration includes the modelling of fluid flow for reservoir pressure and temperature calculations, full field geomechanical stress, fracture initiation and propagation, rock failure, along with detailed wellbore models. 
The work shows that the creation of a single fracture on a well strongly affects the formation of a nearby fracture on the same well. The entire process of multistage hydraulic fracturing can be simulated by integrating the above-mentioned physics in a single model. The results can be used for fracture placement and surface pump duty estimates. The fracture creation model can also be used to estimate the extent of stimulated rock volumes in the reservoir. Stress interference effects between wells can also be investigated using full field modelling. 
Furthermore, the closure of natural fractures within stimulated volumes in the reservoir, which reduces permeability affecting future production, can be estimated using full field geomechanics modelling. 
The far field effects of stress in unconventional plays show that, although the wells are in pressure isolation, there are strong stress interference effects between wells. The models can be used to generate guidelines on well drilling schedules, well placement, and fracture design and location in such systems. 
Several papers exist in the literature on different physical effects studied in isolation within the context of geomechanics in unconventional reservoirs. Importantly, this work integrates the different physical effects in a single model.

70,71,183561-MS,Impact of Heterogeneous Hydro-Geomechanical Properties of Caprock on CO2 Leakage by Tensile Fracture Reactivation During CCS,"Kim, G. W., Hanyang University| Kim, T. H., Hanyang University| Lee, K. S., Hanyang University","|Abstract 
Mechanical failure of cap rock is one of the main reasons of CO2 leakage from the storage formations. Through comprehensive assessment on the petrophysical and geomechanical heterogeneities of cap rock, it is possible to estimate the pressure distribution more accurately and to predict the risk of unexpected caprock failure. To describe the fracture reactivation and fracture permeability, modified Barton-Bandis model and dual permeability system are applied. Porosity-permeability relationship is calculated with power law. In order to generate hydro-geomechanically heterogeneous fields, the negative correlation between porosity and Young's modulus/Poisson's ratio is applied. In comparison to homogeneous model, effects of heterogeneity are examined in terms of vertical deformation and the amount of leaked CO2. To compare the effects of heterogeneity, heterogeneous models for both geomechanical and petrophysical properties in coupled simulation are designed. 
Simulation results show that CO2 leakage occurs after 4-6 years from injection. After 10 year injection with petrophysically heterogeneous and geomechanically homogeneous caprock, CO2 leakage is larger than that of homogeneous model. In contrast, heterogeneity of geomechanical properties is shown to mitigate additional escape of CO2. Vertical displacement of every heterogeneous model is larger than homogeneous model. According to results from model with petrophysically heterogeneous and geomechanically homogeneous caprock, the higher Dykstra-Parsons coefficients (VDP) the larger vertical displacement is obtained. The vertical displacement with petrophysically homogeneous and geomechanically heterogeneous model is also larger regardless of VDP.|","geomechanics, CCS, heterogeneity",33

The geomechanical factors put significant constraints on CO2 storage in terms of injection pressures that may be limited by fracture propagation, injection rates that can be achieved without compromising the seal and excessive fracture propagation, and the CO2 placement affected by fracturing. 
Goodarzi et al (2012) investigated the feasibility of securely storing CO2 in Nisku geological formation located in Wabamun Lake area (Alberta, Canada) using a coupled flow, thermal and geomechanical model. Due to lack of field and lab measurements, the results of the study were reported as pessimistic. This paper utilized recently recorded well log, well test and lab measurements specific to the study area to build porosity, absolute and relative permeability, thermal, mechanical property and stress profiles required for refining the results of the aforementioned study. 
The results show that injection in the Nisku aquifer (below or at fracture pressure with 1–2 Mt/year) causes only small surface heave in the range of 2–3 mm. Injection above the fracture pressure at 2 Mt/year results in higher well injectivity but also increases the possibility of caprock fracturing. The degree of vertical propagation strongly depends on the caprock stress state and mechanical properties. The importance of the proper site characterization is highlighted by comparison of our current results with our earlier work on the same site reported in Goodarzi et al. (2012), in which estimates were used for many parameters. The predicted fracture dimensions based on updated fluid and rock mechanical properties in the current work are significantly larger than the dimensions reported in the 2012 study. The primary reason for this is the lower initial fracture pressure and higher stiffness of the reservoir rock formation used in this study.This causes smaller fracture width and lower leak-off which will be compensated by larger extent of fracture both horizontally and vertically.. 
Thermal effects of cold CO2 injection reduce significantly the fracture pressure and enhance the horizontal fracture propagation. The vertical extension of fracture in the thermal model was shown to be smaller than in the isothermal model due to the confining stress contrast created by thermoelastic stresses. This in turn resulted in larger horizontal propagation of fracture in the thermal model. The reduction of fracturing pressure due to thermal effects will reduce the well injectivity if the well is to be operated below fracture pressure, and increase fracture propagation if fracturing is allowed. This aspect needs to be taken into account by operators as well as by regulatory agencies. If it is required to operate below fracturing, the time-variation of fracture pressure under injection condition can be determined using geomechanicaly coupled model and its historical minimum value should be taken as the maximum operating pressure.|","dynamic fracturing, thermal effect, CO2 injection, geomechanical modeling",14

Coal seam gas is an unconventional resource for natural gas that is becoming popular due to its environmental benefit and abundance. This paper reviews recent developments on the pore-scale characterisation of coal from coal seam gas reserviors. The development of micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) imaging has enabled for the 3D characterization of the fracture system in coals. This provides detailed insights into understanding flow in these unconventional reservoirs. A novel image calibration method in which the skeleton of the fracture system is obtained from micro-CT imaging while the fracture apertures are measured from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is described. We also show the application of micro-CT imaging for studying diffusion processes in ultralow permeability matrices and discuss the incorporation of the data into calculations of gas production from unconventional reservoirs. The extraction of statistical information from micro-CT images to reconstruct coal cleat system are also demonstrated. This technique allows for preserving the key attributes of the cleat system while the generated fracture network is not limited in terms of size nor resolution. The developments of microfluidic methods for understanding the complex displacement mechanisms in coal seams are also described. These low-cost experimental methods can provide unique information about the displacement mechanisms occurring during gas production from coal seam reservoirs. Variation of coal contact angle with pressure is analysed and results demonstrate important wettability processes that occur in coal seams. We describe numerical methods for prediction of petrophysical properties from micro-CT images of coal and discuss the associated limitations when dealing with coal samples. The paper concludes by addressing the challenges faced when characterising coal at the micro-scale and approaches for population of coal data into reservoir simulators for relaible prediction of reservoir behaviour during gas production as well as CO2 sequestration in coalbeds.|","Coal seam gas, pore scale modelling, characterisation, micro-CT imaging",23

This paper examines the challenges, solutions and milestones of the hydraulic fracturing based cuttings reinjection (CRI) process implemented on two artificial islands offshore Abu Dhabi. 
During the development of an offshore field from two artificial islands, disposing of vast amounts of drilling waste and cuttings, generated from almost 100 wells, presented a major challenge. The conventional skip-and-ship for onshore treatment and disposal was technically, logistically, and economically unviable and posed possible future environmental liability. After careful assessment, total containment of drilling waste on the islands through multiple hydraulic fractures in suitable formations, for permanent in-situ waste confinement, was concluded by the operator as environmentally and economically the only sustainable process. 
Two CRI wells were planned on each island to accommodate an estimated 8 million barrels of drilling waste slurry expected to be generated at the islands. While CRI is a proven technology wherein cuttings are slurrified and injected into sub-surface formations, fracture injections have high risks too. Many failures are known in the industry, including well and formation plugging and waste breaches to sea-bed and near-by wells, with far-reaching consequences and liability to operators. 
Considering the complexity of the multiple-hydraulic fracturing process that requires careful planning, execution, monitoring, and analysis, a comprehensive geomechanical study was performed to identify and characterize all potential injection formations to achieve successful long-term injection. This was followed by front-end engineering design (FEED), fracture simulations, CRI well design, surface facilities design, slurry simulations, and followed by careful execution. 
Two CRI wells were drilled on each island. Specifically designed injectivity tests were performed on each well before commencing injection, followed by regular injectivity tests to continuously analyze fracture behavior. A carefully designed slurrification and injection process, incorporating detailed QA-QC at all process stages, was implemented that helped to avoid solids settling, fracture or perforation plugging, uncontrolled fracture propagation, or well integrity issues. About 500,000 barrels has been successfully injected to-date in two CRI wells with injection pressures as per FEED estimates. 
The paper details also the proactive sub-surface injection monitoring-assurance program built into the CRI injection procedure to continually modify the process as per sub-surface pressure responses, thus proactively mitigating injection risks. 
Periodical injectivity tests, model alignment studies, temperature logs, and fracture pressure analysis facilitated regular recalibration of the geomechanical model to define fracture-domain sizes, monitor fracture height growth, and estimate residual formation domain capacity as injection progressed. 
The multiple-hydraulic fracture-based CRI process implemented first time in Abu Dhabi incorporates many unique features which can be applied in similar projects elsewhere. This paper also describes the downhole gauges for accurate pressure-temperature monitoring at perforations, a detailed slurry design, the particle-size distribution for slurry quality analysis and quality control, the sub-surface monitoring-assurance program and regular tests and recalibration studies.|","Cuttings Re-Injection, Geomechnical Study, FEED Study, Fracture Injection, Cuttings Slurry",60

Maintaining CO2 in gas and oil wells is a challenge in CO2 sequestration. The downhole forces on the pumped cement between the casing and the drilled formation lead to failure of cement, and hence the well integrity can be affected. Furthermore, the prolong interaction between the stored CO2 and the casted cement can lead to corrosion of embedded well tubulars. This deterioration of the casted well is a major cause of cracking and channeling of the cement matrix resulted in early gas migration. Such problems can lead to early workover jobs or shutting-down some wells that resulted in losing its productivity. 
This work aims at developing a new material from clay that has a high resistance to CO2 in upstream for plugging CO2 storage wells. The synthesis conditions as well as the adsorption-desorption characteristics at simulated well condition will be presented. Then a model that simulates the adsorption isotherms and the thermodynamic properties for the interaction between the developed material and the CO2 will be investigated. 
The developed material demonstrated lower porosity and permeability, and higher compressive strength than the conventional cement plug. Thermogravimetric and thermal stability of the developed geopolymer sample showed a minimal variation in weight loss with incremental heating up to 420 °C. Adsorption-desorption of CO2 at various modeled temperature showed an endothermic and spontaneous process with maximum adsorption capacity of 800 mg/g obtained at 660 psi. Higher pressure lead to more storage capacity with physisorption hysteresis curves. The novelty of this work is the development of new geopolymer material that can substitute the conventional cement plug for upstream carbon capture and sequestration.|","CO2 sequestration,, adsorption and desorption,, modeling, Cement plug,, geopolymer",30

Innovative Velocity SpoolTM (Surface Jet Pump) technology combined with novel compact separation was tested at a remote onshore wellhead location in Saudi Arabia to see if it could increase multi-phase production from low pressure oil wells that were already producing and revive wells that were backed out/not flowing. 
The Velocity Spool (VS) is a passive device which utilises often wasted fluid energy (via a choke) from a high pressure (HP) well to reduce the back-pressure of a low pressure (LP) well and boost its' flow to the production manifold. For the VS to work efficiently on multi-phase oil wells, a compact in-line separator is installed upstream to bulk separate the gas and liquid fluids. 
For this trial, one of Caltec's patented VS multiphase skids was installed at an onshore wellhead location and connected to existing HP and LP wells. Production from both wells was diverted to the VS to test its effectiveness. The trial tests lasted 3 months. 
Results from the first set of tests showed that the VS boosted production from an LP oil well that was already flowing by an additional average of 400 bbls/d with a corresponding wellhead pressure reduction of 45 psi. Results from the second set of tests showed that the VS revived a dead well that had not been flowing since 2004 and made it flow at an average rate of 1100 bbl/d with a backpressure pressure reduction ranging from 54 to 27 psi. Prior to the trial, several attempts had been made to bring this dead well back into production using other methods but these had not been successful. The results showed conclusively that the VS was very effective in boosting production from LP oil wells using passive surface mounted equipment and avoiding any well intervention. The production gain was achieved by lowering the FHWP of the well and the amount of gain was dependent on the productivity index of the well. 
The advantages that the VS offers over conventional technologies such as Multi-phase pumps and ESPs are several: it is tolerant to variations in flow conditions, gas volume fractions (GVF) and associated slugging (without affecting performance), it is surface mounted (so well intervention is not required), low cost, easy to deploy, has no moving parts, consumes zero fuel gas/electrical power and uses already available surplus energy. 
This paper reports the trial results and discusses the use of Velocity Spools as an alternative to other boosting methods for oil production. The design and operational criteria of the VS are also highlighted.|","Field Development Mature fields, Well Intervention, Dead wells, Production boosting, Low Pressure wells",25

Bottomhole pressure management is essential to address challenging issues in hostile drilling environmentsbecause of wellbore pressure disparity during pump cycles while in circulating or noncirculating modes. This disparity can cause substantial instability on equivalent circulating density (ECD). While drilling in deepwater, HPHT, or any other hostile environment, these conditions may result in costly nonproductive time, may jeopardize operational safety, or may disrupt the well drillability. 
One of the most advanced methods to enhance ECD management during drilling and connection is use of a sub-based uninterrupted circulating system. This technology has been proven to improve drilling performance by maintaining continuous circulation during drilling and connection to retain wellbore pressure stability without significant changes to the rig operation system. This system enables operators to improve drilling performance in wells with a slim pressure window, challenging geomechanical instability, extreme temperature (geothermal), high and long tangent section where hole cleaning is very essential, as well as in extended reach. This system also can be easily integrated with managed pressure drilling technology that exists in the present market. 
This system uses a small-footprint, sub-based system with an automated flow switching mechanism to eliminate personnel exposure to the high-pressure system. By maintaining steady state circulation throughout the drilling process, the CFS remedies wellbore pressure disparity to retain continuous circulation and ECD management along the entire wellbore. This condition can effectively assist the operator to reduce nonproductive time, to enhance operational safety, and to enable drilling the well to target depth in a timely and safe manner. This paper will describe the equipment design of this uninterrupted circulating system as well as the best practice and constraints during operation. Generic factory testing will also be discussed to provide comprehensive understanding the reliability of the system.|","HPHT, Equivalent Circulating Density Management, Managed Pressure Drilling, Uninterrupted Circulating System, Extended Reach Drilling",35

The Groningen Gas Field in the Northern Netherlands is the largest gas field in Europe and has been producing since 1963. Small magnitude seismic events in this seismologically quiet region were first observed in the early 1990's and linked to gas production. The objective of the work described here is to advance the understanding of subsurface deformation induced by gas production by including hundreds of mapped faults and fault-offsets to (i) characterize subsurface behavior related to production-induced fault reactivation, (ii) evaluate alternate production strategies to help manage subsurface stresses to reduce fault slippage which can lead to seismicity, and (iii) integrate with a seismological model for prediction of seismic activity rate. 
The multi-scale modeling framework includes a global model to capture full-field phenomena and three sub-models for regions with observed seismic activity which honor conditions of the global model, but also include explicit modeling of multiple faults. This approach considers the following features: i) Irregular stratigraphy and fault surfaces, ii) Non-uniform reservoir rock properties based on porosity, iii) Non-uniform pressure depletion mapped from reservoir simulations, iv) Relaxed deviatoric salt stresses at start of production, v) Salt creep effects during production, vi) Biot coefficient effects for reservoir rocks, and vii) Coulomb friction behavior to capture slippage along faults. 
The geomechanical models are used to better understand subsurface behavior related to production induced compaction and fault reactivation. Several production scenarios are analyzed and compared on a relative basis based on the predicted dissipated energy. The slip and contact force data for all finite element (FE) nodes on the fault surfaces are used as input to the seismological models for prediction of seismic activity rate. Results show the fault offset is a key factor for production induced fault slip. A fault with offset can develop slip due to differential compaction on two sides even if the dip and azimuth are not favorable for fault slip. This leads to more slip on significantly more faults compared to that in previous models without offsets. Initial seismological model results based on slip data predicted by present models show good correlation with observed seismic activity rate. 
Models rely on input parameters such as fault friction coefficient, rock properties and initial stress conditions that have some degree of uncertainty. To address the impact of these uncertainties, sensitivity analyses with a range of input parameters were undertaken which yield a range of outcomes. The use of quasi-static geomechanical models for predicting seismicity attributes is an evolving field and additional improvements or alternative correlations may be identified in the future. However, current model results are used to compare various production scenarios on a relative basis or for correlations in seismological modeling, and the parameters are expected to be consistent between scenarios.|","fault, geomechanics, seismological model, finite element model, induced seismicity",36

The main objective of this paper is to present a case history of 26 successful Multi-Stage Fracturing jobs performed in 4 horizontal (up-dip) wells drilled in the western onshore field of India. A detailed analysis of Frac job design, Stress profile analysis, well placement, exploitation approaches and successful implementation of new completion technology is also addressed. 
Detailed stress profile studies were conducted to finalize the azimuth of the well. Placing the lateral section of the well with reference to the stress directions plays a major role in the success and effectiveness of fracturing in enhancing and sustaining productivity. Rock mechanical data was taken from nearby offset wells. The data was extrapolated over a lateral length of ~1000m and an up-dip angle up to 9 degrees. Considering the heterogeneity of formation, Mini-frac and DFIT test analysis were conducted in alternate stages to get the variance in leak-off and permeability throughout the horizontal section of the reservoir. 
An exhaustive study involving numerous tests on core and oil samples were conducted including elemental analysis, XRD, SEM, Capillary Suction Time (CST), Non-emulsification tests etc. Observations from the tests confirmed that Pour point of the crude was considerably high and crude was waxy in nature. Mineralogical analysis showed more than 40% of MLIS clays. The inputs from these test results were incorporated in formulating the frac fluid as well as job design. Geoscience studies results were utilized in finalizing the well trajectory and placement. Sensitivity analysis helped in deciding the optimum proppant volume for the stages.

This case study presents a systematic methodology applied for integrating tectonic history, image data, 3-D seismic data, geo-mechanical study to develop the Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) based 3D fracture model. Motivation for the present study was the limited understanding of permeability distribution in reservoirs. Dynamic behavior of the field from drilled wells indicated the possibility of presence of natural fractures in reservoirs. Fracture characterization study was embarked upon to build a reliable fracture model with the ultimate aim to improve on understanding of permeability distribution in reservoirs and to assist future dynamic flow simulation studies in the field. 
The structural history of the field was analyzed to tie fracture related observations to the known tectonic events affecting reservoirs. Data analysis was done by attempting a simple structural restoration with available data. This analysis indicated two main tectonic events responsible for evolution of the present structure and the likely stress direction. Based on the tectonic history analysis, assumptions of a simplified plate-bending model and the Stearns model of fracturing related to folding have been applied during modeling. Available micro resistivity formation images from wells were interpreted for fracture type, fracture orientation & computation of fracture attribute. 3D seismic data was used to pick mappable faults & to generate the geometric seismic attributes. Variance attribute was selected for edge detection and was used to extract the Seismic Discontinuity Planes (SDPs). Faults in the reservoir & SDPs were further used as inputs to develop DFN. Fault related fractures were modeled using boundary element method based geo-mechanical approach which aims at computing maps of both natural fracture orientation and density trends, from observed major faults and observed fracture data along wells. Predicted tectonic models with stress directions show good match with the carried out structural geological analysis. Geo-mechanical model was used to estimates the breakability of rocks in reservoirs by computing Poisson's Ratio and Young's Modulus logs in several wells. 3D volumes of Young's Modulus and Poisson's Ratio were generated using Pre-Stack inversion results. Fold related fractures parallel to fold axes were modeled using the rock breakability predicted from Young's Modulus and Poisson's Ratio models calibrated with fractures interpreted from the wells. These fractures were constrained to the crestal part of the structure. 
The 3D DFN based fracture model was up scaled into the 3D matrix model to generate the fracture porosity, fracture permeability tensors and the matrix to fracture communication factor. Multiple realizations of the fracture model were generated to capture the uncertainty associated with various aspects of this model. Fracture pore volume maps were generated for each reservoir and the specific recommendations were made about their use in dynamic history matching process.|","Fracture Characterization, Fracture Modelling, DFN Modelling",40
80,81,183204-MS,Estimating Maximum Horizontal Stress from Multi-Arm Caliper Data in Vertical Wells in Oman,"Dobroskok, Anastasia, Petroleum Development Oman| AL Zadjali, Ruqaya, Petroleum Development Oman","|Abstract 
Characterization of magnitudes and directions of principal stresses is vital for building a geomechanical model. The magnitude of the maximum horizontal stress is most challenging to estimate among three principal stresses. Meanwhile a well known Kirsch solution formulated in terms of displacements, allows for estimating the ratio of minimum to maximum horizontal stress in vertical wells when displacements of the borehole wall can be measured (e.g., by multi-arm caliper). This study evaluates the limits of applicability of such analysis. 
Multi-arm caliper readings may be indicative of both inelastic (i.e., rock failure) and elastic (e.g., contraction) deformation. In case of inelastic deformation (e.g., breakouts or key seats) Kirsch solution is not applicable. Meanwhile within the limits of elasticity, the solution can be more useful. Drilling history or a BHI log may assist in identifying zones where no failure or yielding have occurred. Then, potentially, the solution allows for reconstructing two of the following parameters: i) ratio of the minimum to maximum principal stresses acting in the plane orthogonal to the wellbore axis, ii) static Young's modulus, and iii) static Poisson ratio. The suggested approach includes the following two steps. In the first step multi-arm caliper data are used to calculate the ratio of minimum to maximum displacement Ku and translate it to the ratio of stresses  where v is the static Poisson ratio. In the second step the analytical solutions for non-Kirsch displacements can be used to estimate static shear modulus. 
Practical application of the methodology highlighted the need for additional calibration of the log derived data. Firstly, the displacements derived from the multi-arm caliper need to be corrected in regard to the orientation of the caliper arms relative to the principal stress directions. Because of the irregularities in caliper signatures this can be challenging especially if the principal directions are not known. Secondly, careful analysis of the resistivity logs indicates that caliper measuremenst may be affected by the formation of a filter cake. Finally, the estimate of the elastic moduli relies on accurate calculations of displacements. The case study discussed in this paper, illustrates that the desirable accuracy may not be attainable because the actual borehole diameter may be uncertain (e.g., due to back reaming or a filter cake) or the accuracy of caliper readings may be inadequate. Meanwhile the estimation of the maximum stress relies on the displacement ratio Ku rather than the absolute value of the displacement. Hence, the estimate for the ratio is expected to be more accurate. 
The suggested technique allows for easy estimation of the maximum horizontal stress. In some cases when borehole diameter is certain and caliper readings are accurate, the technique also provides the means for estimating static shear modulus. The estimate can be further used to decrease the uncertainty of the results obtained with more conventional and sophisticated approaches.|","geomechanics, multi-arm caliper, maximum horizontal stress, static elastic moduli",31

Gerotors are positive displacement pumps and candidates for artificial lift in the oil and gas industry. This study evaluates the performance of a unique gerotor pump design under single and multiphase conditions in a downhole configuration. The gerotor pump performance is modeled with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to develop a virtual prototype of the multiphase performance behavior prior to physical testing. 
A prototype 3D model of a 400 series gerotor pump suitable for application in a 5<U+00BD>-in. casing was developed. The pump volume displacement is consistent between the initial laboratory experimental tests and future field testing. A transient 3D CFD was used to simulate the gerotor pump performance under single-phase and multiphase flow conditions. The complex gerotor motion was modeled in CFD using a dynamic meshing technique. Pump rotor speeds applicable to the range of testing conditions were applied. The gas and liquid phase properties correspond to mineral oil and air at the prototype test conditions. 
The results of the gerotor pump performance are presented for single-phase and multiphase conditions over a range of gas volume fractions (GVFs) from zero to 0.75. The CFD results show that the flow rate decreases approximately linearly with discharge pressure, which is typical of positive displacement pumps. Pump performance and efficiency curves are developed relating the delivery pressure and flow rate. The CFD model methodology is presented with consideration to appropriate selection of the numerical methods, multiphase model, mesh design, dynamic mesh motion, and other aspects to improve the reliability of the numerical simulations. For the same delivery pressure, increasing the GVF decreases the gerotor pumping rates. Recommendations are proposed for improving the multiphase pumping capacity through pump geometry modifications. The modifications effectively tailor the gerotor to improving gas-liquid pumping in specific oil field operating conditions. 
This study highlights the potential for gerotors as an alternative artificial lift technology for multiphase pumping. This technology with the inherent mechanical simplicity and compactness provides cost-effective surface and downhole multiphase pressure boosting for production in the oil and gas industry.|","Multiphase, Pump, Performance, Gerotor, Modelling",44

Measurement of geomechanical properties using seismic and laboratory methods have been used in oil and gas industry for several years. Laboratory methods, in most cases, take only small samples from consolidated rocks, which may not be representative of the elastic regime existing in the reservoir owing to sample size. In general, geomechanical studies are performed on a well-by-well basis. Measurements calculated at the wellsite are then used as calibration points to convert the 3-D seismic data to geomechanical cube. However, elastic properties measured this way are restricted to the well location and cannot be interpolated across the reservoir. To overcome these challenges, this paper describes an approach for deriving and discretizing geomechanical and other elastic properties in the reservoir by integrating results of 3D geo-cellular and basin models. 
The workflow presented in this paper is utilized to calculate cell-by-cell elastic properties of the reservoir by integrating parameters from both basin model and 3D geo-cellular grid. The basin model reconstructs the geologic history (i.e. burial history) by back-stripping the reservoir to its original depositional thickness. Through this reconstruction, the mechanical compaction, pore pressures, effective stress, and porosity-vs-depth relationships are established for the reservoirs. In the final stage, dicretized calculations of geomechanical properties are assigned to each lithotype (facies) in the geomodel. The discretization of elastic properties into 3D grids resulted in better understanding of the prevailing rock elastic properties and stress regimes helping hydraulic fracturing operators in the effective design of their depletion strategies with minimal drilling risks and costs. This approach provides an innovative way of determining effective minimum horizontal stress for the entire reservoir through distribution of elastic properties in a 3D grid. The conventional approach of using small sample plugs is not sufficient to describe elastic properties for an entire reservoir and can be replaced by current approach.|","Burrial History, Geostatistics, Facies, Basin Modeling, Geomechanics",5

Pipe-soil interaction behavior in the axial direction is an important design parameter for offshore pipe design. Governed primarily by the axial interaction behavior, the thermal expansion of the pipe wall could cause the pipe to either freely expand, or buckle on the founded seabed. Therefore, it emphasized that by controlling the axial interaction behavior, the overall pipe on-bottom stability can be effectively managed. This paper presents laboratory experiments performed at Monash University to understand the pipe-soil interaction behavior in the axial direction. A special 2-D actuator test setup was developed to study axial walking of pipe on clay seabed under both drained and undrained loading conditions. The effect of pipe loading rate, pipe embedment, and shutdown cycles on axial friction force were explored. Based on the experimental results, the pre-peak, peak and residual components of the axial force-displacement curve were identified and explained using a simplified theoretical framework.|","Pipe-soil interaction, pipeline, clay seabed, axial walking, offshore",38

ADMA-OPCO has undertaken a prestigious campaign to drill a large number of wells from artificial island in ABC field, most of these wells are extended reach drilling (ERD) wells with step-out up to around 18,000 ft. Operational efficiency/costs for drilling ERD wells is highly dependent on the wellbore stability, especially while drilling through the problematic Nahr Umr shale at different deviations and azimuths. Nahr Umr shale has a known history of causing wellbore instability in UAE and the surrounding countries and therefore a geomechanical study was initiated to understand the geomechanical setting in ABC field as well as fluid-rock interaction between drilling fluid and Nahr Umr shale formation. The main objectives of this geomechanical study were to optimize well design and drilling fluids in order to drill through Nahr Umr shale interval efficiently, additionally estimation of sustainable pressure variation that major faults can take without being reactivated was also performed. 
An integrated geomechanical study including a 3D geomechanical modeling was carried out, in order to ensure drilling through Nahr Umr shale formation efficiently. This study covered formation petrophysical characterization, chemical tests on cuttings from Nahr Umr shale, chemo-poroelastic modeling, weak bedding analysis and also faults reactivation analysis. 
Based on the study mentioned above, both customized drilling fluids program and suitable mud weights were optimized to stabilize Nahr Umr shale, and mitigate different types of wellbore instability issues. In addition to mud fluid optimization, the sustainable pore pressure variation was also estimated for several major faults. 
A successful drilling campaign is in progress; so far many deviated wells have been completed without any noticeable troubles while drilling through Nahr Umr shale. This geomechanical model is helping to implement an effective drilling program for a smooth well placement. A learning curve has been building up continuously for handling more complex well trajectories successfully in the future. From this study, it was realized that, not only fluid-rock interaction and geomechanics related factors need to be taken into consideration for stabilizing a wellbore, but also special attention is needed for the existing micro-fractures within the formation, where increase in mud weight may make hole condition worse. A balanced approach has been adopted including drilling fluid optimization in order to avoid possible multiple failure mechanisms.|","faults, fluid-rock interaction, stable, shale, drilling",54
85,86,183239-MS,NMR Characterization of Fluid Imbibition in Thinly-Layered Source Rocks – Where Oil and Brine Invade in the Mixed-Wet Pore System,"Kesserwan, Hasan, Baker Hughes, Dhahran Global Technology Center| Jin, Guodong, Baker Hughes, Dhahran Global Technology Center| Goh, Serena, Baker Hughes, Dhahran Global Technology Center| Agrawal, Gaurav, Baker Hughes, Dhahran Global Technology Center","|Abstract 
The drilling/fracturing of lateral wells in thinly laminated source rocks often confronts critical wellbore instability and fluid loss problems. These problems are mainly caused by the leakage of the fluids into the rock matrix through a system of fine layers and immense network of natural fractures. It is conceived that the penetration of fluids perturbs the rock’s effective stress state or alters its strength. Nevertheless a thorough understanding of the instability phenomenon has not been introduced yet where numerous questions over the underlying mechanisms remain unresolved. For instance in a mixed-wet rock system it is unclear how an oil based mud (OBM) or water based mud (WBM) invades the different pore volumes; What are the effects of the clay content, types (swelling or not) and total organic content (TOC) including their spatial distribution in the shale matrix, and so on? 
In this work, we perform nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements on highly laminated source rocks which are sequentially saturated by spontaneous imbibition of diesel and 5% KCl brine. We probe the rate and capacity of oil/brine imbibition focusing on the wetting characteristics of the bedding planes, the effects of mineralogy, TOC, and the connected pore network in the kerogen and inorganic matrix on the fluid distribution inside these rocks. Hence, we provide guidelines for optimizing drilling-fluid design, horizontal drilling and fracturing operations. 
For each of the source rocks studied, samples were drilled parallel and perpendicular to the beddings. Then, each sample is cut into twin plugs which are submitted to two sequent imbibition experiments: 1- regular imbibition experiment where one of the twin plugs imbibed oil and the other imbibed brine for varied times, and 2- reverse imbibition experiment where the twin plugs are interchanged to imbibe the other fluid. The mineral elements, phases and the TOC of the rocks were measured using X-ray Fluorescence (XRF), X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and HAWK pyrolysis, respectively. 
The measured NMR T2 spectra showed that all samples were able to imbibe both oil and brine with a clear preference of oil indicating a mixed wettability state of these source rocks. This is attributed to the coexistence of organic and inorganic pores in these rocks. Moreover, the prevalence of surface relaxation on the NMR dynamics was prominent as all T2 relaxations took place at time scales (T2 <U+2264> 100 ms) much shorter than their bulk values. Upon imbibition, brine is observed to flow along the bedding planes which are rich in clay minerals and therefore forming pathways of minimum flow energy. Indeed, the interaction between brine and clay is identified to be the potential driver of the rock stability problems especially near the wellbore; however it is firmly dependent on the type of existing clays. Oil is absorbed faster than brine and in larger volumes. The discrepancies between oil and brine imbibition is magnified by the presence of fractures which enhanced the network connectivity of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic pores or even across them. Furthermore, the fractures allowed the fluids to surpass the vertical bedding planes and thus accelerating the fluid distribution processes inside the pore space.|","spontaneous imbibition, bedding planes, Nuclear Magnetic resonance, source rocks, wellbore instability",27

Recent news headline came to remind the dangers associated with gas transportation. Due to its asset size, pipelines are often the facilities the more difficult to protect in cases of an explosive gas leakage. 
The objectives of the Fibre Optic Leak Detection (FOLD) project were to assess the capability of fibre optic sensing to detect a small gaseous leakage on a buried pipe, to give guidelines regarding the best deployment positions of the fibre along the pipe, to compare the performance of several methodologies and to assess the impact of the fibre optic length on the detection performance. 
The strength of this project is to propose a representative test bench to help the industry to mature the detection methodologies: Gaseous leakages were performed from the external surface of a steel pipe with an internal diameter of 390 mm and a length of 30 m. These leakages were of methane, hydrogen or nitrogen and took place through different orifices (from 1 to 7 mm) and at varying released pressure (between 20 and 100 bar). This pipe and the optical cable were buried in a granular type soil compacted to a known level. Several types of interrogator (DTS - Distributed Temperature Sensor) from different suppliers were tested during the FOLD project. 
The paper will present the experimental bench and the main results. Based on these results, it will be possible to conclude on the overall performance of the DTS technologies to detect a small gaseous leakage on a buried pipe, to give guidelines to optimise several parameters for improved detection performances: fibre optic position or deployment architecture along the pipe (directly buried or into a polyethylene tube), detection range assessment, equipment choice... Five different instrument suppliers took part in the initiative and delivered comprehensive data. 
To make sure that detection will occur whatever the gaseous leakage flow rate on a buried pipe, it could be interesting to use both internal detection means (pressure or flowrate transducers placed at both ends) and external ones. Among the technologies available for external sensing, the optical fibre seems to be a promising candidate. This paper will present brand new data, collected in very controlled conditions, to assess the performance of such technology. 
We will present the proportion of instruments capable of detecting leaks and the possible configurations presently recommended to pipeline designs in project phase.|","Monitoring, Pipeline, leak detection, fiber optic, explosion",33

Many GASCO pipelines cross major highways in Abu Dhabi through concrete culverts (lengths varying from 50 to 125m). Some culverts are in severely deteriorated condition and required immediate replacement. Collapse of culvert(s) may lead to failure of the pipeline resulting in Loss of Containment, environmental degradation and potential risks to personnel/neighbourhoods. This paper presents a techno-economical solution as an alternate to the repair/replacement option for safeguarding the integrity of the pipelines. 
GASCO identified four severely deteriorated concrete culverts which are protecting 6nos vital oil/gas pipelines, for major repair/replacement. Performing the repair/replacement of these culverts pose challenges due to access restraints, traffic obstructions/diversions, massive civil works, risk of working in the live gas pipeline vicinity etc., with huge overall estimated cost and more than two years execution time. GASCO studied/explored different options including the repair/replacement of existing culverts and ended up with selecting the option of flooding the culverts with a self-compacting mixture of sand and water using specialized pumps which can satisfy/meet the technical, commercial aspects and extend the remnant life. 
Detailed study was carried out to verify the various technical aspects and evaluate the methodology, with data collection of existing pipe sizes, pipeline wall thicknesses from pipe condition inspection reports, vehicle loads, vibration measurements due to vehicle movements at pipe depths and desktop evaluation of data. The existing pipelines wall thicknesses were checked for Barlow stress (Hoop stress), Circumferential Stress, Longitudinal Stress, Radial Stress and Fatigue check for Girth & Longitudinal Welds considering the overburden loads of earth/sand fill, vehicle cyclic load and internal pressure/temperature and found adequate. Methods of construction and different materials for filling were explored. In some culverts, there was not adequate headroom for people/ equipment access. The method of pumping sand (using special pumps) and compaction of each sand layer by water flooding was found to be the most suitable option in terms of technology, local equipment availability/easy mobilization, locally available filling material, reduced risk of working in the vicinity of live gas pipes, etc. The solution was successfully implemented for the four culverts (each 60m long) across the busy Abu Dhabi – Al Ain highway at Mussafah, in Sep-2015, within 2 months duration and resulted in a huge cost saving of AED 38millions. 
The followed approach is a long term solution that can be executed by the in-house resources of maintenance team with some support from local contractors (for pumping facilities, etc.) and it also eliminates the future maintenance cost. This solution is first of its kind that was implemented among ADNOC group companies and can be shared with/ adopted by other companies having similar facilities to benefit from the cost optimization & other advantages.|","Culvert, Protection, Approach, Integrity, Pipeline",46

The innovation used in polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) bit design has historically focused on two main elements—cutting structure (CS) stability, whether statically or dynamically, and the grade and quality of the PDC cutting element, which mainly involves the diamond microstructure and interface design. Since the onset of PDC bit development, there existed a limitation on PDC cutter element construction, and that is they had to be cylindrical diamond tables. This geometric PDC constraint derived everything else relating to PDC bit design. This constraint has finally been overcome. With the advent of new manufacturing techniques, PDC geometry flexibility has now been unlocked. Three-dimensional (3D) cutters add two new degrees of freedom to PDC bit design—cutter geometry and cutter placement on the bit face. 
The first wave of 3D cutters included a conical diamond element (CDE), ridged diamond element (RDE), and rolling PDC cutter (RPC). This paper will present the fundamentals of such technology and their effect on field performance. The process by which these elements are applied to a PDC bit is by thorough review of bit-face anatomy versus the drilled application challenge. With such in-depth analysis, these new cutters are separately or concurrently utilized in a ""hybrid"" bit design, which eliminates traditional PDC bit failures, such as ringout, cored dulls, and impact in extreme applications, including fully drilling conglomerates. 
The hybrid bit solution is a disruptive concept that is application-specific and significantly increases drilling efficiency through the selection of the proper technology mix. Moreover, embedded in the development of 3D cutters are the latest diamond microstructures that were traditionally the focus of PDC manufacturers. This paper highlights field deployment results to prove the concept of the technology mix per application in addition to some of the perceived risks. 
Chronic deficiencies affecting PDC bit life have been resolved with new, innovative cutter geometries and their placement on the bit face depending on failure modes and load distribution. In addition, the proper selection of the applications suitable for each technology deployment is a key factor in the success of the trials and preserving the bits' cutting structure throughout the bit run. Consequently, the new method improved the bits' lifetime, drilled footage, and rate of penetration compared with the PDC bits using conventional cutters. The effectiveness of the newly introduced 3D cutter technologies and hybrid bits on lowering the cost per foot shows the success of such an approach in harsh economic climates and that the development of new technology is more important than ever in times of pricing pressure.|","Disruptive PDC technology, 3D PDC Cutters, Hybrid PDC bits",16

Kansao, Frontender Corporation| Yrigoyen, A., Frontender Corporation| Haris, Z. M., Frontender Corporation| Saputelli, L. A., Frontender Corporation","|Abstract 
Fast evaluation of reservoir performance is one of the main concerns for decision making. Additionally, lack of reservoir data is a big issue in performing numerical simulations and obtaining reasonable history matching results in a short period of time. Asset management tends to question and avoid cost and downtime related to data acquisition. Pressure and rate transient analyses (P&RTA), along extended periods of production, allows the characterization of reservoir and near wellbore features, however, P&RTA alone does not provide pressure and fluid distribution prediction beyond the wellbore, it requires the integration with reservoir simulation. 
This paper provides a practical application for integrating well performance models to derive sandface pressure and rate data, that would enable P&RTA and ultimately a full-field integrated reservoir model. P&RTA facilitates the identification of reservoir parameters leading to improve and expedite reservoir history matching, and to perform the evaluation of various production scenarios. Available real-time pressure and rate data is key to achieving these objectives. The applied workflow allows engineers to quickly identify uncertainties and opportunities to evaluate different field development strategies to maximize the ultimate oil recovery. 
The methodology was successfully applied in a reservoir study in South America. To achieve the goals, it was necessary to characterize the reservoir in terms of original oil in place, reservoir rock properties, compartmentalization and well performance history by well in each producing reservoir. Unstructured refined grid principles (Voronoi Grid) were applied to build a relatively small and simple model that considers all the required physics of the problem. The estimated reservoir properties from petrophysical analysis were validated against P&RTA thus honoring the near wellbore effects. The resulting model permitted the generation of key field development strategies considering additional well placement and completion technologies and best production operational practices, as well as the characterization of major uncertainties related with the reservoir-well system. 
As a result of this application, prediction forecasts in comparison with the base case scenario for all formations showed that optimal production and development strategy results in 16.47 % reduction of water produced, with a simultaneous 13.2 % increase in overall oil recovery and 10 % project profitability. A series of recommendations were also derived including: (i) a data acquisition plan to minimize the impact of uncertainties in the field development plan, (ii) guidelines for generating a more reliable and economically profitable field development plan and (iii) opportunities visualization to improve and enhance oil recovery by conducting by water, gas and polymer injection.|","History Matching, Pressure Transient Analysis, Numerical Simulation, Rate Transient Analysis, Reservoir Characterization",33

Unconventional reservoirs have revolutionized the global resource supply picture and represent significant opportunities for countries around the world. Whether rock matrix or fluid properties deviate from what we may consider conventional, success in this environment requires a close integration between both subsurface characterisation and efficient engineering practices. Among the disciplines involved, geophysics plays a role in describing the sub-surface and where to develop: rock type, fluids and fractures through seismic-derived attributes. The ability to convert amplitudes from seismic into a desired rock property attribute isolated from other properties depends on: 1) the rocks and fluids under investigation, 2) acquiring and processing high quality seismic indicative of the reflection process deep underground, and 3) the particular model used for wave propagation and reflections in the earth. Microseismic, as a technqiue which monitors changes in stress, provides a guide to how the reservoir responds dynamically to stimulation and production. Based on the same wave propagation in the earth, the two techniques are linked and complimentary. Due to the heterogeneity associated with unconventional reservoirs and their depositional environments, data acquisition choices are key to unlocking detailed and robust information about the rocks and fluids through processing and analysis. Factors important for the long-term technology vision required for unconventional reservoir development are acquisition market solutions and thinking in the industry: equipment being developed and its suitability for operations in different land environments with the intensity we desire. We recognize that efficient and cost effective dense sampling of sources and receivers is what we wish to aim for. Dense spatial sampling stabilizes the higher-order attributes we need, and a more complete description of the elastic earth provides complimentary information using P- and S-waves acquired with multi-component sensors. While BP and the industry are working on the efficiency side, we need to continue to think of novel ways to produce the right equipment in large quantities such that adequate 5D wavefield sampling becomes practical.|","Unconventional Reservoirs, Wide-Azimuth Seismic, Multi-Component Seismic, Microseismic, Completions Monitoring",63

Temporary fluid diversion using solid particulate systems has been used in several field applications in both conventional (acidizing) and unconventional (fracturing/refracturing) stimulation operations. Besides extensive successful field applications, less attention has been paid to the underlying physics and mathematical modeling of the diversion process. The aim of this study is to propose a comprehensive workflow for designing and optimizing different stages of diversion; i.e., slurry displacement from surface to downhole, sealing and fluid diversion, stimulation efficiency, and corresponding production enhancement. Coupled computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and discrete element method (DEM) numerical simulations are used to better understand the parameters controlling the fluid diversion process.

Exploration and production of horizontal unconventional tight reservoirs is a growing market in the Middle East. Drilling challenges require precise horizontal steering control relative to the severe formation tendency to achieve higher degrees of accuracy in borehole placement while improving the overall rate of penetration (ROP). This paper discusses the interaction between the polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) bit cutting structure and rotary steerable systems (RSSs) with respect to vibration alleviation. 
Steering using a RSS requires a special bit design to enhance the dogleg capability and ensure minimum vibration levels. A new PDC bit was designed using innovative multilevel force balancing technology—a new theory on PDC cutters layout in force-balanced groups. A group of three or four single-set cutters on a bit profile form a force-balanced cutter group; by carefully selecting the order of layout cutter groups, a new feature of the PDC bit is obtained, ensuring the efficient removal of any ring of rock in a balanced environment. 
The new PDC bit design and the implementation of the integrated engineering softwares used to analyze offset wells vibration data, drilling parameters, bit walk tendency, and rock mechanics had a significant effect on the run performance. The clear reduction in the vibration levels enabled more parameters to be applied; thus, helping overcome the formation tendency of the tight reservoir and finishing the run with a good ROP. The even distribution of the cutting forces as a result of the multilevel force balancing of the bit cutting structure reduced the imbalance forces induced as the bit entered transit formation. This increased the overall bit stability, reduced vibration levels, and increased drilling efficiency.|","RSS vibrations, RSS drilling, tight reservoirs, cutter layout technology, PDC bit vibrations",60

Advanced technology of increased hydrocarbons recovery – Plasma Pulse Treatment (PPT) is presented. The explanation of physical impact on the reservoir is given. Examples of laboratory studies and field-testing observed. 
The physical bases of the PPT are periodic pulses of equal strength, spaced with equal time intervals by discharge current passing through a metal conductor. Shock wave, formed by the explosion of conductor, is propagating radially with supersonic speed, gets out through the perforation holes and provides an elastic compressive and tensile impact on the media. Low frequency waves, propagating deep into reservoir, contribute to the development and formation of new cracks, as well as the transformation of sub-capillary pores into capillary, causing the liquid moves from stagnant zones and channels to the zone of active drainage. 
The paper presents the description of the physics of a process as well as some calculations and estimates of observed technical parameters. Some estimates and calculations, given in the paper, are based on the principles of nonlinear physics and fluid dynamics. 
Laboratory studies confirmed substantial changes after PPT application both in oil samples (resulting in viscosity reduction) and core samples (increase of permeability). 
Microseismic studies, carried out on the field, registered the propagation of waves, created by PPT, on a distance of over 1.3 kilometers away from a treated well.

Acoustic measurements are used throughout the lifetime of a well, from seismic to production. Logging While Drilling (LWD) sonic is traditionally used to log formation slowness in the open hole. In this case study we show that both, measuring formation slowness and evaluating the success of a cementing operation can be obtained with the latest generation of LWD sonic tools while drilling, thus saving rig time, simplifying operations, and adding safety to well integrity solutions. Both, formation slowness and well integrity are often an essential criterion for the decision whether to drill ahead or to take additional measures to assure well integrity. 
In this case study we have demonstrated that there is additional approach wherein formation slowness can also be recorded/captured in cased hole with LWD tools when the cement bonding is sufficient to allow good coupling. Continuous formation compressional and shear slowness was recorded and extracted for most of the interval below Top of Cement (TOC) and some short intervals above TOC. This advanced technique of logging formation slowness through casing with LWD can complement or even save an additional logging run in some cases and therefore result in significant savings to the operator. 
Where azimuthal cement evaluation is not a strict requirement, knowing the top-of-cement (TOC) from LWD can help to confirm well integrity without adding rig-time. Should the measured TOC be lower than required, then more advanced analysis can be run for additional investigation.|","well integrity, sonic, LWD, cement evaluation",53

Suppressed oil prices amid a call for increased returns from shareholders has created opportunities for operators and service companies to work closely in developing and deploying new technology in well construction efforts. Under extreme pressure, operators are seeking innovations to reduce drilling time and shorten the time to production. An operator in Oman has tripled output over the last ten years using enhanced oil recovery (EOR) methods, making it the largest independent oil producer in the Sultanate. 
The development of polycrystalline diamond compacts (PDC) is one of the fastest-evolving technologies for fixed cutter drill bits. The application of PDC bits continues to expand performance by increasing rates of penetration (ROP) to lower drilling costs. The most recent developments in synthetic diamond cutters have been in 25mm-diameter cutters. Although 25mm-PDCs were developed in the mid-1990s, they lacked the necessary durability for demanding drilling applications. Only recently has the technology become available to meet these needs in this size. 
Several recent tests in Oman have shown the new 25mm-cutter technology drastically improved performance with shoe-to-shoe runs at increased ROP. With the new cutters came the need for paired frame improvements with special considerations for aggressiveness and mechanical limitations for torque, both for the drilling rigs and use with positive displacement motors. During vertical drilling through carbonates and shales in the Diba field, the technology established a new field record ROP of 217 feet per hour—an 80% improvement over the field average ROP. In the Jalal field, 275 feet per hour was achieved—29% higher than the previous best record. The technology was also introduced on a steerable motor in a directional well, delivering improved penetration rates and excellent stability in slide mode. An additional lesson learned was the smooth torque generated by the large cutters. The smooth drilling torque enabled improved directional tool face control. 
This operator has implemented an aggressive drilling and development program to drill faster and reduce cost per foot in heavy oil sands and fractured carbonates. The authors will present case studies to demonstrate how the latest technology 25mm-cutters and new frame technology helped lowered drilling costs for this operator's drilling program in Oman.|","PDC, Bit, Cutter, Oman",39

The study of tectonics deals with the broad architecture of the outer part of the Earth, the age, relationship, evolution of regional structural, deformational, and crustal features. 
Subsurface geological maps are perhaps the most important tool used to explore for undiscovered hydrocarbons and to develop proven hydrocarbon reserves. However, the subject of subsurface mapping is probably the least discussed in Abu Dhabi, yet most important, aspect of petroleum exploration and development. 
This paper presents the tectonic map for Abu Dhabi based on gravity, magnetic and seismic interpretations, along with describing the various elements, their controlling faults and their effect on basin development and also rationalizes previously published structural and tectonic elements to clarify the kinematic relations and naming of individual tectonic elements. 
The method, which combines geologic, geophysical data in a comprehensive way, incorporates these data to simulate the interrelated effects of deposition and erosion of sediments and compaction, pressure, petroleum generation and multiphase fluid flow. 
The tectonic map of Abu Dhabi distinguishes three principal tectonic cycles: (1) Precambrian cycles are interpreted using the magnetic data, as there are no wells that penetrated the basement in Abu Dhabi and the seismic is mostly covering up to Jurassic layers. (2) The Paleozoic cycle began with continental rifting about 550 Ma, followed by inundation of much of Abu Dhabi by shallow seas. This cycle ended with the opening of the Neo-Tethys, which caused the deposition of the Mesozoic Cycle. (3) The Mesozoic cycle represents the legacy of ocean opening and the rise and fall of sea level created the stratigraphic and structural features that would later trap vast quantities of oil and gas. On the tectonic map, major features record this history. Abu Dhabi is affected by at least seven major tectonic events, which are shaping the present structures. However, these events can be complicated by the salt-movements (halokinesis) in offshore areas of Abu Dhabi, which resulted in change of structural relief and faults/fracture characterization particularly for deep reservoirs. 
Understanding of the kinematics and mechanics of the structures will highly impact the preservation of most of the hydrocarbons, and in turn reveals the new ventures to add reserves for Abu Dhabi.|","Regional Tectonics, Tectonic chart, Tectonic evolution, Structural Framework, Faults",43

The in-situ stress state in a rock mass is widely recognized as being of major importance in unconventional field. The inherent variation of stress distribution associated with geological environments is widely recognized as being a key factor in an unconventional field; hence, the need to understand from the basin-scale phase is critical. The three main ingredients needed to formulate a model for the mechanics of the porous sediments, are the concepts of bulk stress, pore pressure and compaction. Most available rock-stress-based numerical engines uses default laboratory properties for the set of lithology's in their library. However, understanding the mechanical properties of the lithologies and applying such to the model makes the result more representative of the local geology. 
This paper is an update on the previously published model (Mohamed et al., 2015), exploring the impact of rock stress and external geomechanical boundary (otherwise known as tectonic stress) on pore pressure development and rock failure. Middle Cretaceous formation (layer of interest ~ 150 m) was sub-divided into seven layers based on mechanical log signatures. Athy's law, formulated with effective stress combined with 3-D rock stress based on poro-elasticity, was used in the forward modeling simulator to improve the pore pressure prediction. Depositional events such as erosion and hiatus periods were also taken into account during simulation. The development of porosity, pore pressure, temperature, stress and related rock failure through time were simulated and calibrated to measured data. The main geomechanical properties, such as Young's Modulus, Poisson ratio, cohesion and friction angle depend on lithology and porosity. Appropriate relationship were established and ultimately used to calibrate the first–pass rock properties prediction from the numerical engine. Model porosity is dependent on burial depth, weight of the overburden sediment columns, and lithology properties. The mean stress was ultimately considered in deriving pore pressure results. 
Results reveal a dynamic representation of the three principal effective and total stresses within the studied formations. The maximum stress shows a NE-SW trend in the synclinal area and N-S trend on the anticlinal structures, the medium stress shows N-S trend on the synclinal structure with an E-W and NW-SE trend on Well A and Pseudo-well A wells respectively. The minimum stress reveals a NW-SE direction on the synclinal area and N-S trend on both flanks. The model also shows an improved pore pressure result ranging from 26.97 – 42.50 MPa (with 28.46 MPa average values within layers of interest) revealing ~ 1450 psi (10 MPa) difference when compared to the previous model where rock stress modeling was not performed.|","Rock Stress, Carbonate Reservoirs, Pore Pressure, Abu Dhabi, Tectonic Stress",44

A large, strategically important tight gas project in the Sultanate of Oman progressed over 5 years on an accelerated path from exploration to the development stage. Collaboration between operator and service provider helped advance the deployment of technology that made this acceleration possible. Poor initial success in both hydraulic fracturing treatment placement and hydrocarbon productivity along with limited resources with ever-expanding work scope were the main challenges faced in the first 2 years of exploration. To address these challenges, an integrated approach to the project was taken. Technology trials and the selective deployment of technology along with improved operations gave flexibility to this new efficiency model. Close collaboration with the service provider allowed smoother and faster progress. Collaboration included joint technology mapping exercises, team visits to North American locations of the operator and the service provider with the goal of knowledge sharing, faster technology transfer, and the secondment of a senior engineer from the service provider as a full-time production technologist to the operators' subsurface team. The effective execution of strategy and implementation of various technologies resulted in an increase in the success rate of fracture placement and zonal evaluation from the initially low 50% to 100%. The integration of several disciplines was critical to achieving this goal. Technologies deployed in the project comprised of rock and core mechanical tests, such as reservoir coring, openhole stress testing, sonic measurements, continuous unconfined compressive strength measurements, abrasive perforating, various fracturing treatment designs, and several geomechanical studies targeting different aspects of fracture initiation. An additional focus was on the assessment of fracture geometry using radioactive tracers, advanced sonic logging, geomechanical evaluation coupled with geological mapping, microseismic monitoring, and cutting-edge fracture design methodology in both vertical and horizontal wells. The collaborative efforts led to evaluation of similarities and differences between North American and international unconventional projects and suggested techniques and best practices that can be applied in the tight gas project in the Sultanate of Oman. This project has been deemed one of the first commercially successful gas deliveries in the Middle East from a tight gas reservoir. Technologies, methods, and strategies developed for this large tight gas project and tested in the field will contribute to improving the success rate on similar projects around the world.|","Tight Gas, fracturing, collaboration, case study",50

An operator in the Middle East is seeking to develop its natural gas resources to meet rising energy demand. This operator is drilling horizontal wells along the minimum horizontal stress direction in an attempt to generate multiple transverse fractures during stimulation to increase gas production in unconventional reservoirs. However, drilling operations in these wells is extremely difficult because of the in situ stress environment; these conditions result in a significantly increased number of stuck pipe incidents, wellbore collapse, incurring remarkably high nonproductive time. This paper describes the methodology used to define and calibrate the safe mud window for the curve and lateral section of the first horizontal well drilled in tight sandstone formation by conducting a wellbore stability study and real time drilling geomechanics and pore pressure monitoring. The wellbore stability study incorporates all logs and rock mechanical properties propagated on the direction survey and proposed formation tops of the planned horizontal well X-56. The well was drilled successfully with a mud weight of95 pcfto 98 pcf in the curve section and 100 pcfto 106 pcf in the horizontal section. Major technical contributions of this paper include: (1) Characterization of geopressures and stress field in different formations calibrated with real time data, (2) back analysis methodology to estimate fracture gradient from formation integrity test (FIT) & image logs, in addition to this (3) pore pressure zones designation along the stratigraphic column.|","horizontal, Pore pressure, geomechanics, tight sandstone, real time",10

Most of unconventional shales are mechanically anisotropic and usually treated as transversely isotropic (TIV) media. Full anisotropy characterization of gas shale samples traditionally requires laboratory tests on several plugs cut along different orientations to the bedding. In practice, very often, this is untenable – due to the scarcity of shale plugs, experimental challenges, cost consideration and other factors. As alternate, ultrasonic measurements are only performed along the longitudinal axis of the sample, where the apparent dynamic properties are determined using isotropic media equations, and then used to build a correlation model between static and dynamic properties. However, such approximations could result in significant difference in reservoir rock mechanical properties determined from downhole acoustic logging measurements when the simplified apparent dynamic/static correlation model is used. 
The paper performs ultrasonic measurements, velocity anisotropy analysis, and triaxial compression testing on a series of shale samples cut in two orientations – parallel and perpendicular to the bedding. The static Young's moduli measured along the bedding are not always higher than those measured perpendicular to the bedding. For the samples tested, horizontal plugs generally have higher Young's moduli than vertical plugs in the range of low modulus, while lower than vertical plugs in the high modulus range. Generally, horizontal plugs have relatively higher static Poisson's ratios than vertical plugs. Both the dynamic and apparent dynamic Young's moduli are higher than the static moduli. There exist strong correlations between the dynamic/apparent dynamic and static moduli. However, the apparent dynamic moduli seem to have a relative better correlation with static values than the dynamic ones. In addition, the apparent dynamic moduli are higher than dynamic ones when they are measured perpendicular to the bedding, while they are almost the same when measured parallel to the bedding. 
The discrepancy observed between the dynamic (measured from velocity anisotropy analysis) and apparent dynamic (using the isotropic model) confirms the importance of distinguishing and carefully selecting between these values when building static-dynamic relations for log-core calibration. The method of performing velocity anisotropy analysis on one horizontal plug only enables one to obtain the complete dynamic properties for the transversely isotropic media, which could considerably simplify the anisotropic measurements, save core material, and make much more geomechanical data available for shale well development.|","Unconventional shales, Mechanical anisotropy, Velocity measurement, Static and dynamic properties",42

North American unconventional well completion design has evolved dramatically since 2013 in an effort to keep pace with the productivity gains realized in horizontal drilling. Several trends have emerged during the current industry downturn. Among these trends are a focus on core acreage with higher yield potential, the use of longer laterals, a movement towards higher proppant loading (pounds per linear foot), an increased reliance on plug and perf techniques, and decreased stage length and perforation cluster spacing (increased perf density). As a result associated improvements in well initial production (IP) rates and estimated ultimate recoveries (EUR's) have been highlighted in oil & gas operator's quarterly shareholder's reports during 2015 and early 2016. 
Unconventional multi-stage completion designs have also quickly evolved along a path paralleling these trends. Horizontal well IP rates and EUR's have also been enhanced through the adoption of integrated completion designs. Recently introduced geo-engineered completions rely on cross-functional expertise and software to integrate petrophysical, geomechanical, drilling, and production data into a completion design. In cases where geo-engineered designs were used, wells showed improvements in EUR's over those associated with increased lateral lengths, proppant loading and stage counts. In one recent case using a geo-engineered design it was demonstrated that fewer stages and clusters achieved higher production than offset wells while injecting less proppant and fluid; thus achieving lower completion cost. 
The use of engineered workflows in tight or unconventional reservoirs is not new. Multiple case histories have been published in recent literature illustrating the use of stress variability/contrast or mechanical specific energy (MSE) to generate brittleness or other fraccability indices to group stages with similar rock characteristics. In contrast to engineered designs, newer geo-engineered designs integrate multiple inputs (attributes) to determine basin and formation-specific weighted algorithms that correlate to stage and cluster production contribution improvement. The geo-engineered approach has proven repeatable and can be accomplished even when key wireline or LWD data is not available. 
This paper will document how geo-engineered completion designs evolved from engineered workflows. Multiple inputs (e.g. production, wireline/LWD/mud logs, core analyses, and big data from national and state data bases) can be combined to determine stage length and perforation cluster positioning. Case studies will demonstrate that geo-engineered horizontal completion designs deliver superior well production results when compared to geometric, high-intensity plug & perf designs.|","fracturing, completion, horizontal, unconventional, Geo-engineered",40

The USA began exploiting unconventional gas resources 40 years ago, eventually leading to a domestic shale gas production increase from 4% to 56%, 2005 to 2015. Many countries and major oil and gas companies strive to match this success. 
Using public information to research USA key success factors helped establish a holistic framework to assess and expedite shale gas development in other countries. This framework is intended for international market experts now guiding their countries and companies toward similar success. The framework has been applied to China and Poland to provide highlights, lowlights and specific recommendations for conditions in those countries. 
The analysis splits six factors into two categories: 1) subsurface factors related to exploration, development, drilling and fracturing of the prolific shale-system; and 2) technical and non-technical surface factors including the involvement of the State (which has consistently directed and stimulated unconventional gas development), the roles of oil companies and service companies, the availability of required materials and water and the related logistical capability, and the gas market and infrastructure.

Fracture is of primary importance to gas producibility from many tight sandstone reservoirs in the Kuqa depression, Tarim Basin, NW China, but the orientation, size and plane porosity of fractures in the subsurface is difficult to measure directly. Terrestrial light detection and ranging (LIDAR) surveys can offer factual information of outcrop-based research efforts to characterize fracture development laws and control factors. In this paper, we obtain the three-dimensional (3-D) point cloud data by the LIDAR survey from a typical outcrop. Matching with high-resolution digital photos and artificial measured information, the 3-D positions of natural fractures are extracted strictly in the data volume section. Furthermore, the fracture patterns and controlling factors are revealed accurately with the fracture and reservoir model founded by computer simulation technology based on the systematic sampling and laboratory analysis. It is founded that three groups of shear fractures are mainly developed with large inclination, short trace length and small spacing of normal distribution. The fracture aperture is related to the orientation with bimodal distribution of 0.2~0.4mm and 0.8~1mm. The fracture patterns provide the literal distribution of grid-like fracture zone and reticular fracture zone with a single and a double set of advantage orientation respectively. The fractures in the former zone have greater trace length, spacing and smaller surface density and run through the adjacent shale mostly while the latter is just the opposite. The plane porosity of fractures in 11 single sandbodies of different microfacies has been calculated quantitatively with a range of 0.026~0.081% and an average of 0.05%. It is in the sandbodies of underwater distributary channel is better than mouth bar and distal bar. It turned out that the size of fracture is controlled by lithology, bed thickness, maximum paleostress and rock composition with a good exponential relationship. The fractures are more developed relatively with the coarser particle size of the rock, the thinner thickness, the greater paleostress, the lower content of feldspar and the higher content of cement.|","Controlling factors, Fracture patterns, Tarim basin, Outcrop, LIDAR",57

With an objective to shorten directional intervals, operators place greater demand on higher Build Up Rates (BURs). The section just before the pay zone involves the most intensive directional work, pushing rotary steerable systems to their capability limits. This paper focuses on a particular interval of hard and soft interbedded carbonates that provides a significant challenge for conventional Polycrystalline Diamond Compact (PDC) bits to provide consistent build up rate and good borehole quality on rotary steerable systems. Throughout this paper we demonstrate the engineering process of designing a bit to increase buildup rate capabilities of rotary steerable systems and improving drilling efficiency through interbedded carbonate formations. 
The engineering process involved reviewing the critical issues of this application to assure a sound solution. This included: |Current build up rates versus Rotary Steerable Systems (RSS) steering capability. 
Vibrations generated by conventional PDC bits being deployed in the field. 
Specific cutting structure, depth of cut limiters and gauge requirements for different RSS drive types. 
Formation strength analysis. 
Parameters used in drilling the section. 
Roller cone insert and PDC interaction of the hybrid bit with the formation and how formation deformation generated by one interacts with the other. 
Roller cone insert design aimed specifically at carbonate formation drilling |Various hybrid drill bit and Bottom Hole Assembly (BHA) combinations were evaluated with state-of-the-art drilling response simulator to review the buildup rate capabilities combines with the bit and BHA interaction. The best combination was then successfully trialed on several wells, proving significant improvement compared to current performance with conventional PDC bits. 
The optimized hybrid bit and BHA combination eliminated drilling vibrations in intervals where extreme vibrations were witnessed with conventional PDC bits, significantly increasing drilling efficiency. Improved torsional stability reduced the load on the directional tools improving the ability to achieve the required doglegs. In softer shale where RSS with conventional PDC's had to control parameters while using maximum steer force to achieve target dog legs of 7°/100ft, the hybrid drill bit achieved 10°/100ft while utilizing only 70% of the steer force. The hybrid drill bit has been proven to be successful with both push-the-bit and point-the-bit RSS systems. 
Hybrid drill bits have proven to be a solution to problems and limitations of both conventional PDC and roller cone bits in directional drilling. Based on recent refinements in the drilling mechanics of hybrid drill bits to further improve their interaction with directional drilling systems, engineering selected this emerging technology to overcome the challenges in this particular application.|","Increasing drilling efficiency, Hybrid Technology Deployment, Steering and Directional Tool Face Control, Breakthrough Performance, Directional Drilling",39

Producing hydrocarbons at appraisal and development targets from deep, overpressured, high pressure/high temperature (HPHT) Jurassic carbonates in Northern Kuwait has been a challenge as a result of the complex reservoir heterogeneity. Because of the tight carbonate formation properties, matrix acidizing does not always deliver hydrocarbons at economical rates; in this scenario, hydraulic fracturing is required. Hydraulic fracturing, however, presents placement and activation challenges as a result of the wellbore construction limitations and a complex tectonic setting/high stress environment. 
The zone of interest in this dolomitic reservoir was identified as an acid fracture candidate because of the immobility of fluids identified during multiple pressure sampling tool attempts, despite a reasonable valuation of the log-computed porosity and permeability in the range of approximately 10% and 1.1 md, respectively. In addition, solid hydrocarbons (bitumen) were reported in the cuttings samples, which indicates the possibility of in-situ conductivity damage. The well trajectory was designed as a high angle deviated well to maximize the reservoir exposure, with a maximum inclination of 49 to 50° through the zone of interest. The reservoir was drilled at a slight overbalance with 13.0 ppg of oil-based mud, using mud weight management techniques to minimize the formation damage. The highly deviated wellbore and the highly anisotropic stress regime complicated the effective design and placement of the acid fracturing treatment. As an added challenge, the operation had to be completed within a very short period because of the high cost of the deep drilling rig on site to facilitate the operation. 
The hydro-fracture field case was built on the analyses of the open hole logs, 1D geomechanical earth model, and a customized data-fracture suite to meet the data acquisition needs, followed by the design and calibration of an acid hydro-fracture treatment using a pseudo3D grid-based fracture modeling and calibration software. A solids-free dynamic diversion schedule was built and field-laboratory level fluid design tests were conducted to reach the most optimal design possible. 
A robust and operationally pragmatic fracture program was developed and implemented successfully in a very short notice period. The mobility of the formation fluids was established, leading to a critical understanding of this sour unconventional carbonate flow unit. 
Data fracture analyses and a customized acid fracturing technique described in this paper are the first of its kind in the deepest parts of the Northern Kuwait sour gas basin. A collection of completions data has proven critical in terms of reservoir deliverability aspects and in the calibration of the mechanical formation properties, leading to a better understanding of the hydro-fracture geometry and how to effectively connect to the higher mobility segments of the reservoir. This paper also outlines the future optimization plans based on the lessons learned from the fracture tests conducted in the well.|","Hydraulic Fracturing, Unconventional, Sour Gas, Tight Gas and Oil, HPHT Carbonates",57

This paper focuses on a tight carbonate reservoir in a giant field in Abu Dhabi by identifying shortcomings in conventional modeling strategies for geomechanics and demonstrating the benefits of continuous core data to build more reliable 1-D Mechanical Earth Models (MEM). 
A 1-D MEM was built from the sonic wireline log, which shows significant difference with a profile of ultrasonic P-wave velocity (Vp) measured on cores. However, results of rock mechanical tests (RMT) on plug samples (including ultrasonic Vp measurements at different stress conditions, and stress-strain curves from triaxial tests) are consistent with the core-based Vp profile. 
We investigate the impact of stresses, resolution and fluid saturation on sonic velocities to reveal the possible shortcomings of sonic wireline logs as an input for geomechanical models and the greater relevance of using core based ultrasonic velocities measured on dry cores for the upscaling of static elastic moduli. 
Finally we propose an empirical relation to correct sonic wireline logs for geomechanical modeling in offset wells. 
The following conclusions can be drawn from this study:  
The core based Vp profile, which is highly consistent with the RMT results, ultimately leads to opposed trends in the in-situ horizontal stresses predictions compared to those of a 1-D MEM based on the non-calibrated wireline sonic log. 
Only unrealistic reservoir stress conditions could reconcile ultrasonic Vp measured on plugs at different stress states with wireline sonic velocities; 
Using a low resolution Vp profile at reservoir stress conditions (combining Vp from plug samples and core based continuous Vp profile), we show that differences in stress only partially explain the discrepancy between velocities measured on plugs and wireline sonic velocities. 
Although a conventional Gassman fluid correction could explain the remaining differences between core measurements and the wireline sonic, its practical application would require the detailed knowledge of the rock mineralogy and of the saturation along the well. 
Conversely, a profile of the bulk modulus of the rock mineral fraction can be derived from the sonic log and the ultrasonic P-wave velocities measured on dry cores corrected for stresses effects. 
Evidences in the drilling data suggest that the discrepancies between the core based sonic velocities and the wireline sonic could be due to natural fractures in the borehole vicinity. 
An empirical relationship involving wireline logs only was established to correct the sonic wireline log to enhance the reliability of geomechanical models for offset wells.  |These findings have important implications for the practical applications of 1-D MEM, such as the design of hydraulic fractures. Quality control of the sonic logs with extensive data acquired on dry cores reduces the uncertainty when upscaling static elastic properties. Continuous velocity profiles acquired on dry cores are therefore highly valuable to calibrate empirical corrections of sonic logs for geomechanical modeling in offset wells.|","CORE TESTING, GEOMECHANICAL MODELING, SONIC WIRELINE, ULTRASONIC VELOCITY",39

During the previous 14 years, North American unconventional reserve delineation activities have resulted in hundreds of billions of dollars in capital spending. Development of the accompanying defined reserves has generally been a recent occurrence; in most established plays, the typical wellbore has been associated with field development rather than delineation. 
Approximately 102,000 horizontal wells have been drilled and completed in North America since 1990, at an industry cost of approximately USD 750 billion. However, there is a clear trend toward continuous improvement in both process and production response. Much of the learning curve has been based on trial-and-error (T&E) activities, rather than the deliberate acceptance and integration of upfront measurements with the application of physical realities and rigorous peer-reviewed algorithms, concepts, and practices. 
During the early history of hydrocarbon extraction, operators experimented with various vertical well drilling and completion (D&C) processes to maximize production and optimize net present value (NPV). Given the steep learning curve that the North American industry has experienced and the significant D&C capital cost of a single unconventional well, it is no longer prudent for national oil companies (NOCs) outside North America to repeat the pattern of historical experimentation to achieve equivalent (or better) efficiencies and results. 
This paper offers a number of suggestions and concepts that can be applied to dramatically shorten the learning curve and minimize capital expenditures associated with efficient extraction of ultralow-permeability hydrocarbon reserves. North American parameters that have clearly impacted performance (parallel lateral spacing, fracture spacing along a lateral, total exposed conductive fracture surface area, decreasing proppant diameter, lateral length, etc.) are examined. The quantitative value of applying rigorous reservoir modeling, intensive study of historical practices, and upfront measurements, such as far-field fracture mapping, near-wellbore (NWB) production flow-splitting, and long-term diagnostic shut-in testing, is then estimated by examining the cost of error in delineating and developing a given acreage position.|","fracture mapping, delineation, learning curve, unconventional, reservoir modeling",2

Evaluating the elastic parameters of reservoir section are very essential for oil and gas industry in alleviating the risks associated with the drilling and production phases of the reservoir. These parameters are used in the optimization of the well placement, well bore instability, completion design, and draw-down limits to avoid sanding, hydraulic fracturing, reservoir subsidence and in many more applications. To carry out any aforementioned operations, a continuous profiles of rock elastic parameters are needed. Misleading estimation of elastic parameters may wrongly lead to heavy investment decisions and inappropriate field development plans. 
Retrieving reservoir rock samples throughout the depth of the reservoir section and performing laboratory tests on them are extremely expensive as well as time consuming. Therefore, these parameters are estimated from empirical correlations. Most of the previous models/correlations were developed using linear or non-linear regression techniques. Artificial intelligence tool once optimized for training can successfully model elastic parameters since these tools are capable of capturing highly complex and non-linear relationship between the input parameters and the target parameter. 
The objective of this study is to develop a robust and an accurate model for static Young's modulus based on the wireline logs as an input using three artificial intelligence tools (artificial neural network, adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system and support vector machine). The data on which these AI models are built comprises of more than 680 real field data points from different fields covering a wide range of values. Based on the minimum error and the highest coefficient of determination between actual and simulated data artificial neural network is selected as the proposed AI model to predict static Young's modulus. 
A comparison between the static Young's moduli predicted by the proposed model with the published models /correlations reveals that neural network model gives significantly less average absolute percentage error. Finally, a rigorous empirical correlation is developed using the weights of ANN model in order to make the AI black box model as a white box and universal that can be usable for field applications.|","Artificial Intelliegnce, Empirical Correlation, Elastic Parameter, Static Young's Modulus",60

This paper will cover the design and installation of BP’s first 15Kpsi Open Hole (OH) completion in the Sultanate of Oman in March 2016 and also the initial execution results of the stimulation treatments in July/August of the same year. This change to the current well design and execution strategy has become necessary due to variable cased hole horizontal well results and greater understanding of the challenges of delivering efficient and sustained gas production from the higher fracture gradient areas of the Barik reservoir. 
The Khazzan (Barik) development in the Sultanate of Oman operated by BP is a tight gas project, requiring hydraulic fracturing of tight gas resources. Tight gas production from the deep hot reservoirs in the Sultanate of Oman has historically concentrated on cased hole completions stimulated with large hydraulic fractures. The original Basis of Design for Khazzan for Full Field Development consisted of horizontal wells with multiple hydraulic fracturing stages performed within a Cased & Perforated 4-1/2<U+2033> liner design. Challenges encountered with the CH approach have included the following:  
Tight pressure deployment/pumping window within the existing completion design, complicated by a wide variation in areal and vertical stress regime. 
Variability in the injection response, proppant placement and particularly the quality of the fracture/wellbore connection that would and has been achieved. 
Lack of predictability regarding post-frac production rate, due to a variation in fracture placement achieved due to above two reasons. |In 2014 a decision was made to introduce some flexibility in evaluating suitable fracturing designs incorporating a number of Lower Completion (LC) styles, one of which was a horizontal open-hole completion. Optimizing stimulation performance by evaluating ball dropped activated systems and over-displacement was seen to have significant potential. A multi-disciplinary approach involving drilling, completion, stimulation, intervention and subsurface was performed to ensure Project value was maximized and the objectives delivered. 
This paper will cover how the pressure rating of the OH completion was designed to 15 kpsi, in excess of the existing CH pressure rating. This includes screening and evaluation of the available open-hole LC system design and operational characteristics suitable to deliver propped gel fractures in 6<U+2033> OH for 1,000 m horizontal wells. Screening criteria included; system/equipment technology status, associated drilling requirements and design for ""5-7/8<U+2033> hole"" cost and duration versus the existing 8-3/8<U+2033> hole configuration and an ability to meet the well stimulation Statement of Requirements (e.g. fracture placement, zonal isolation). 
The final system design will be detailed including wellbore orientation and trajectory, hole and casing sizes, zonal access and isolation method(s) and hydraulic fracture parameters, including fracture spacing, geometry and treatment design. 
Operational results will be presented for well construction and stimulation phases. Well construction results will include drilling performance comparison, wellbore preparation for the completion installation, drill-in/completion fluid requirements and packer spacing/zone selection criteria. Stimulation execution results will include evaluation of execution versus design, comparison of stimulation results for ball drop stage results versus plug and perf results. Assessment of Radioactive (RA) tracer results and evidence for OH packer integrity will also be presented. 
Conclusions will include an initial comparison of the execution of the drilling, completion and stimulation phases and lessons learned on the success of the design versus the original objectives.|","OHMS, Stimulation, Tight Gas, HP",14

A range of different methods, which includes outcrop logging, sampling, petrographic descriptions, fluid inclusion and isotopic analyses has been used to describe the main stratigraphic and diagenetic features of the outcropping sedimentary series. Optical microscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Backscattered Electron image (BSE) with Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were used to assess the timing of different diagenetic events (paragenesis), which included dolomitization, physical/chemical compaction, iron oxide formation and late calcite cementation. 
Isotope analysis showed two different generations of dolomites, i.e. a low temperature dolostone and a high temperature dolomite cement, which could result from evaporation in a sabkha environment and from burial diagenesis, respectively. Fluid inclusion microthermometry in cements filling vugs proved useful to confirm the mesogenetic (burial origin) of the drusy dolomite cements.|","Dolomitization, fluid inclusion, carbon & oxygen isotopes, paragenesis",52

Mud weight optimization is a critical driver to successfully drill horizontal wells. Historically, using inadequate mud weight while drilling horizontal wells has proven to be cost effective when it is intended to place multistage fractures in tight formations. The typical problems encountered in such wells are tight spots, requiring hard reaming which sometimes lead to stuck pipe and bottom-hole assembly (BHA) loss during borehole events. It is of paramount importance in drilling that correct mud weight be used from the start and during each section. Subsequently, based on well behavior/response, mud weight is optimized to an optimum range during the course of drilling. 
In subsurface areas where rock behavior varies progressively with depth, along with constantly changing regional and local stress regimes, mud weight optimization is one of the tools that lead to successful drilling of wells to depth (TD). Geomechanical characterization of the target formations provides optimum mud weight window to drill along planned trajectory with minimum wellbore stability related issues. 
This paper describes the construction of a 1D Geomechanical model and wellbore stability (WBS) analysis performed to determine the mud weight window used to drill multiple sections in a horizontal well for a new offshore field. The paper will further discuss how an integrated drilling and geomechanics approach was utilized for mud weight and drilling/tripping practices optimization, which resulted in successful drilling 
This study is a perfect learning example how to use the various surface and downhole data in real-time and integrate it with a pre-drill geomechanical model to forecast and avoid wellbore stability/drilling problems by optimizing mud weight window. The value of geomechanical study is not only limited to drilling the well to TD, in fact, updated information can be further utilized for finalizing completion strategy. This paper also describes how updated stress profile in 1-D geomechanical model was used to characterize the reservoir for multi-stage fracturing. 
A comprehensive geomechanics study incorporating offset wells analysis, core data, mini-frac data and formation pressure points resulted in the following starting mud weight recommendations for each section of the horizontal well in tight formation:|","Real-Time, Mud Weight Optimization, Offshore Drilling, Horizontal Well, Geomechanics",13

Carbonate rocks are among the dominant oil reservoir formations. Due to their heterogeneity, their petrophysical properties are difficult to be evaluated. Magnetic Resonance, applied as low-field Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), are powerful tools for reservoir characterization. Their basic advantage is the quantitative demarcation of various fluids. In this work we have used MRI methods in order to evaluate the petrophysical properties of carbonate rocks. For this purpose commercial limestone, saturated with deionized water, crude oil and model oil or mixture of water with model oil were used to acquire calculated spin-spin relaxation time (T2) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) MRI scans. This leads to the pixel-by-pixel characterization of the rock samples and the quantitative evaluation of the saturation profiles in 3-D space. The proposed MRI techniques offer a new insight in the spatially resolved information of petophysical properties towards better understanding of the fluid-rock matrix interactions.|","carbonates, simultations, wettability, MRI, NMR",39

As drilling of horizontal wells is increasing in Abu Dhabi, so is the need for a stress map. In this paper, such a map, composed of the in-situ stress field of Abu Dhabi, is determined by the analysis of borehole breakouts and drilling-induced tensile fractures along with the results of 1-D Mechanical Earth Models. Stress orientations are variable across the Abu Dhabi fields as a whole; however, within 3 of 5 individual stress provinces defined in Abu Dhabi, mean stress orientations are statistically significant. The stress provinces and stress trajectory mapping reveal that they are systematic continental-scale rotations of stress orientations within Abu Dhabi. The stress orientations are not parallel to the direction of absolute plate motion of the Arabian plate, nonetheless; the regional pattern of stress orientation is consistent with plate boundary forces controlled by the complex nature of the subduction in the northeastern boundary of the Eurasian-Arabian plates. 
To date, 130 1-D MEM's were generated, 98 of them expose the in-situ stress orientations, which have been compiled as the cornerstone of Abu Dhabi Stress Map. Of these, over 57 are considered reliable tectonic stress indicators, recording horizontal stress orientations to within ±15°. Remarkably, a good correlation was observed among stress orientations deduced from in-situ stress measurements and geologic observations made in the upper 1–2 km and in well bore breakouts extending to 2–3 km depth. The stress fields are believed to be largely the result of compressional forces associated with the subduction of the Arabian Plate beneath the Eurasian Plate and possibly from the divergent movement of the Red Sea along with the sinistral movement of the Aqaba-Levant fault boundaries. Knowledge of the contemporary crustal in-situ stress is of great importance for several applications, such as, borehole stability, hydraulic stimulation and understanding of the structural evolution of the terrain.|","Structural evolution, Borehole stability, Stress Map, Mechanical Earth Models, In situ stress",11

In the quest to achieve higher production, horizontal wells are being drilled in PDO concession area located in the Sultanate of Oman. The goal is to link a number of tight sand gas accumulations to central production facilities. Troublesome formations, including a variety of layered silty-shales (Al Bashair, Miqrat), and a depleted gas bearing sandstone formation (Amin), pose a huge challenge for wells drilled at high inclinations in high stressed environment. Earlier exploration and appraisal wells encountered stuck pipe, wide breakouts and hole cleaning incidents while drilling through those formations. The high risk of wellbore instability in accessing the reservoirs with horizontal well drilling threatened the commercial viability of the project. 
This paper describes how a geomechanical study was used to mitigate wellbore instability in the decision making process during drilling operations of the horizontal wells in one of the Clusters. The geomechanical study output helped to select specific mud weights and to plan casing points in order to drill the critical landing and horizontal sections through breakout prone Ghudun formation and the 450m-500m thick silty-shales (Al Bashair, Miqrat) overlying the depleted sandstone reservoir. 
A Mechanical Earth Model was constructed to represent the state of stress and mechanical properties of the overburden and reservoirs. The model incorporated data from a number of sources including laboratory-measured mechanical properties, closure pressure and breakdown pressure from hydraulic fracturing jobs, leak-off data and drilling records from the earlier vertical and high angle wells. Examination of the stress profiles showed considerable horizontal stress anisotropy and breakouts in Miqrat formation. Rock mechanics test data suggested anisotropic elastic and rock strength properties as confirmed by sonic anisotropy. This suggested that anisotropic Young’s modulus and rock strength properties vary between 10% and 15%. These anisotropic properties were used in the wellbore stability analysis. 
The geomechanical study helped in making a number of critical decisions in the well design including the decision not to drill the Miqrat and Amin formations in one section as was done previously in high angle wells. This will allow the drilling of the highly stressed Miqrat formation with mud weight in the range of 12.8 kPa/m to 13.1 kPa/m to mitigate breakouts, stuck pipe, and to drill depleted Amin reservoir with mudweight of 10.8 kPa/m. Lower mud weight in Amin reservoir would minimize reservoir damage and improve ECD management with proper hole cleaning. Risk of mud losses and differential sticking in depleted Amin formation were reduced with proper mud formulation and rheology. BHA design was optimized while landing inside Amin reservoir to mitigate stuck pipe due to mud overbalance in the silty-sandstone layers in deeper Lower Miqrat formation. 
The Amin reservoir section could be drilled safely as per the planned well path. In horizontal sections, the CBL’s are generally very poor in spite of precautions and good cementing practices were followed. Coupled with good cementing practices and planning, 100% cement bond log was achieved. This resulted in higher than expected production from the well with very encouraging results overall.|","depletion, cementing, completion, breakouts",35

The modeling was performed on a unique experimental facility Triaxial Independent Load Test System (TILTS) created at the Institute for Problems in Mechanics of the RAS. The importance of taking into account of the strength and filtration rock properties anisotropy is demonstrated on the example of Filanovsky field reservoir rock. The tests of rock specimens showed that rocks having the isotropic elastic properties and outward appearance can have significant anisotropy of strength and filtration properties. In this regard, fracture conditions of horizontal well vary for different circuit points, the fracture of a horizontal borehole begins in the areas near the intersection of well contour with the vertical plane. The rock permeability in the horizontal plane was significantly higher than in the vertical direction. Modeling of decompression process in horizontal downhole using TILTS revealed that the occurrence of non-uniform stress conditions in the vicinity of the well when creating a depression in its bottom may result to a substantial change in permeability in this zone – both to a decrease or an increase. The very significant permeability increase mainly observed in the test specimens corresponding to their location in the points of intersection of the contour of a horizontal well and a vertical plane. The studies lead to the important conclusions regarding the selection of the prioritized strength and filtration properties of reservoir rocks to be determined experimentally under creating and filling in the geomechanical model of the deposit. Currently used traditional set of data is based on the assumption of an isotropic elastic and strength properties of rocks (Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, the Mohr-Coulomb or Drucker-Prager strength constants, etc.). The facilities which based on the Karman principle mainly used to determine these characteristics, but they do not allow to create real stress conditions arising in the formations in the vicinity of the well. At the same time, deformation, strength and filtration properties of rocks depend intrinsically on the level and type of stresses created in the formation. Conclusions and forward recommendations to ensure the stability of rocks in the bottomhole zone of reservoir, find the maximum of allowable depression and well production can be quite remote from reality if the strength rock properties anisotropy, as well as the dependence of the filtration properties on stresses, will not be taken into account. And the central objectives to reduce risk and enhance efficiency in well production will not be achieved.|Представлен геомеханический подход к решению проблем устойчивости стволов горизонтальных скважин и увеличения продуктивности скважин, основанный на физическом моделировании деформационных и фильтрационных процессов в окрестности скважины. Моделирование проводилось на уникальной экспериментальной установке Испытательной системе трехосного независимого нагружения (ИСТНН), созданной в Институте проблем механики РАН. На примере изучения пород-коллекторов месторождения им. В. Филановского показана важность учета анизотропии прочностных и фильтрационных свойств горных пород. Испытания образцов пород показали, что изотропные по упругим свойствам и внешнему виду породы могут обладать значительной анизотропией прочностных и фильтрационных свойств. В связи с этим условия разрушения на контуре горизонтальной скважины не одинаковы для различных точек, разрушение ствола начинается с областей пересечения контура скважины и вертикальной плоскости. Проницаемость пород в горизонтальной плоскости оказалась значительно выше, чем в вертикальном направлении. Моделирование на установке ИСТНН процесса понижения давления на забое горизонтальной скважины показало, что возникновение в окрестности скважины неравномерного напряженного состояния при создании депрессии на ее забое может приводить к существенному изменению, как уменьшению, так и увеличению, проницаемости пласта в этой зоне. Причем увеличение проницаемости, и весьма существенное, главным образом наблюдалось при испытании образцов, расположенных в точках пересечения контура горизонтальной скважины с вертикальной плоскостью. Выполненные исследования позволяют сделать важный вывод относительно выбора приоритетных деформационно-прочностных и фильтрационных характеристик горных пород продуктивного разреза, подлежащих экспериментальному определению для создания и наполнения геомеханической модели месторождения. Используемый в настоящее время традиционный набор таких данных базируется на предположении об изотропности упругих и прочностных свойств пород (модуль Юнга, коэффициент Пуассона, прочностные константы Кулона – Мора или Друкера – Прагера и др.). Свойства в основном определяют на установках, основанных на принципе Кармана, которые не позволяют создавать в цилиндрических образцах пород истинные напряженные состояния, возникающие в пластах в окрестности скважин. В то же время деформационные, прочностные и фильтрационные свойства горных пород существенно зависят от уровня и вида создаваемых в них напряжений. Без учета анизотропии деформационно-прочностных свойств горных пород, а также зависимости их фильтрационных свойств от действующих напряжений выводы и прогнозные рекомендации по обеспечению устойчивости пород в призабойной зоне пласта, максимальным допустимым депрессиям и дебитам скважин могут существенно отличаться от фактических и не обеспечат снижения рисков и повышения эффективности при эксплуатации скважин.|","specimens,  permeability, geomechanics,  core tests,  well,  anisotropy,  rock,  strength,  stability",46

Accurate characterization of fracture complexity plays an important role in optimizing fracturing design, especially for shale reservoirs with high-density NFs. |In this study, we simulated simultaneous multiple-fracture propagation within a single fracturing stage by use of a complex HF-development model. The model was developed to simulate complex fracture propagation by coupling rock mechanics and fluid mechanics. A simplified 3D displacement-discontinuity method (DDM) was implemented to more accurately calculate fracture displacements and fracture-induced dynamic-stress changes than our previously developed pseudo-3D model. The effects of perforation-cluster spacing, differential stress (SHmax–Shmin), and the geometry of various NF patterns on injection pressure and fracture complexity were investigated. |The single-stage simulation results show that (1) higher differential stress suppresses fracture length and increases injection pressure; (2) there is an optimal choice for the number of fractures per stage to maximize effective fracture-surface contact area, beyond which increasing the number of fractures actually decreases effective fracture area; and (3) fracture complexity is a function of NF patterns (various regular-pattern geometries were investigated). NFs with small relative angle to HFs are more likely to control the fracture-propagation path. Also, NF patterns with more long fractures tend to increase the likelihood to dominate the preferential fracture trend of fracture trajectory. Our numerical model can provide a physics-based complex fracture network that can be imported into reservoir-simulation models for production analysis. The overall sensitivity results presented should serve as guidelines for fracture-complexity analysis.|","Hydrualic fracturing, complex fracture networks, naturally fractured reservoirs",40

The post-fracture productivity of such low-permeability reservoirs is largely determined by the matrix/fracture contact area with appropriate fracture conductivity. Although it is often anticipated that the fractures are infinitely conductive, the general belief is that production increases with the proppant amount injected. |This paper presents an approach to assess the proppant amount injected by determining the optimum post-fracture conductivity. First, through use of 3D finite-difference reservoir simulations in a naturally fractured reservoir, which has both the hydraulic fracture and natural fractures modeled explicitly as discrete gridblocks, we find cumulative production as a function of fracture conductivity. For a fixed propped length and production time, we observe a critical conductivity beyond which the production is insensitive to the conductivity. The critical conductivity is then obtained as a function of the propped length and production time. The numerical results show that the critical conductivity increases with propped length and decreases with production time. The effect of stimulated natural-fracture properties (spacing and permeability) on the critical conductivity is then investigated. For reservoirs with matrix permeability in the range of 20 to 1,000 nd, natural fractures increase the short-term critical conductivity, but decrease the medium- to long-term conductivity. The paper also evaluates the influence of water production, cluster spacing, and flowing bottomhole pressure (BHP) on the critical conductivity. |This study demonstrates that fracture designs that are based on pseudosteady-state solutions are not appropriate for naturally fractured shale reservoirs and can lead to significantly lower initial production. Considering conductivity degradation over time, fracture designs that target achieving 1-year critical conductivity are recommended. A simple, yet robust workflow that is based on knowledge of 1-year critical conductivity is also presented for systematically selecting the type and amount of proppant for stimulation treatment. Such a workflow can mitigate trial-and-error-based and data-driven approaches in the industry.

Fractured slope to deepwater carbonates in Papua New Guinea present significant challenges from the perspective of calculating hydrocarbons in place and assessing reservoir productivity. Given the heterogeneous nature of the carbonates, significant difficulties arise when attempting to determine productive intervals using only petrophysical evaluations and borehole image logs. This paper discusses how productive intervals are identified by integrating mobility from formation pressure testers. 
To determine the role exerted by diagenetic processes (mainly cementation and compaction) on the fluid storage and migration pathways within the slope to deepwater carbonates, permeability structures had to be appraised. Over the past several decades, wireline formation testers have proved to be an efficient method of assessing mobility and inferred productivity, in addition to gathering representative fluid samples for accurate pressure, volume, and temperature (PVT) analysis. Recent advancements have further improved the efficiency of wireline testers in such environments by combining the benefits of straddle packer systems with enhanced probes. 
In this paper, in-depth analysis is presented on the integration of a comprehensive pressure and productivity data set acquired using the latest-generation wireline tools with advanced formation evaluation and image logs.

Managing sand production is becoming an increasingly important issue for petroleum production wells, particularly in challenging environments such as deep water, or gas fields with high flow rate production where sand tolerance is very low and changing the completion strategy could be costly. Sand production prediction is an integral part of overall field development planning. Consequently, it is important that the risk of sanding is accurately evaluated and appropriate measures are taken for well completion. The critical part in a sanding study is to define a proper rock deformation threshold based on laboratory tests or field observations. Due to the lack of sufficient field sanding data or for the sake of modelling simplicity, the rock deformation threshold is frequently defined either inappropriately or too simplistically because of the failure to recognize the intrinsic heterogeneities of reservoir rocks. 
In this paper, two cases are presented with the deformation threshold ""critical plastic strain limit"" defined by a numerical simulation approach. One case represents a weak to medium-strength sandstone reservoir and the other a stronger, clean sandstone reservoir. In both cases, a comprehensive core testing dataset and a field-validated geomechanical model are available. In the weak-medium strength case, there were also several years of production history with sanding observations available from a few wells. 
The numerical method uses an elasto-plastic material model where the rock behaviour is numerically defined from systematic triaxial compressive core tests and a rock failure criterion based on the plastic strain limits modelled from Advanced Thick-Walled Cylinder (ATWC) core tests with calibration against field sanding observations. From the modelling of a range of high-quality ATWC tests and field sand production experiences, strong correlations are found between the critical strain limit and the rock compressive strength for both cases indicating different critical strain limit thresholds for different rock strengths and rock types. 
Although high-porosity and weaker rocks may still have a higher risk of sand production than low-porosity and stronger rocks, the risk of sanding may not be as high as predicted if a single threshold is used for the entire rock strength and porosity range. The use of a single threshold for the whole field could over- or under- estimate the risk of sand production, especially for reservoirs with a moderate risk of sand production. 
Sanding evaluations of the two cases revealed that the predicted sanding risk is potentially misleading if a simple sanding threshold is defined without adequately capturing the heterogeneity in reservoir rocks. This approach may prohibit the selection of an appropriate completion strategy for the entire field. This paper is concluded by presenting a rock testing program procedure for sanding evaluation studies to better capture the heterogeneity in reservoir rocks and, hence, to predict the sanding risk more reliably.|","Critial Strain Limit, Rock deformation Threshold, Numerical Simulation, Sand Production",46

This paper highlights the phenomenal achievement of a Malaysian operator's first fast track drilling operation in a deepwater well offshore Borneo. The collaborative well planning (CWP) method fundamental to the drilling success is discussed. 
The discussed drilling environment is an overpressured deepwater area that has not only forced the earlier A1 and A2 to early total depth (TD) and caused abandonment of geological targets, but also contributes to numerous operational problems. Despite the challenges, operations on A3 ST-1 required significantly less operational time cost than budgeted. The difference between the previous two wells and A3 ST-1 was that, during the planning period, multidisciplinary concerns were addressed more carefully in real-time by employing CWP to unite geoscientists, drilling engineers, and other stakeholders using 3D integrated platform technology. 
This CWP helped the operator meet objectives for A3 ST-1, a fast track well that required only two months of drilling time, rather than the typical 12 to 18 months. It resulted in one primary well location and six geological sidetrack scenarios being accomplished in only one day. Upon the end of the operation, Well A3 was drilled with one successful cased hole sidetrack to geological target objectives without significant operational problems. A significant portion of the success can be attributed to the proper accommodation of concerns and best practices of rig usage, engineering insights, tool usage, and geological conditions during the planning process through the common software platform that can seamlessly allow collaboration of both geoscience and engineering data. The process automation only requires key drilling parameters to construct well trajectories, which was also significant in terms of shortening the planning time. 
This paper describes the first application of the CWP concept in offshore Borneo, which has become a trendsetter in terms of efficient and safe deepwater drilling planning and operations.|","fast track drilling, well planning, collaborative well planning, process automation, deepwater",1

Reservoir pressure depletion and decline of production are two common features of many mature petroleum fields. Drilling and stimulation of long, highly-deviated wellbores is one of the many technologies commonly used to enhance the production in mature fields. Reservoir depletion results in reduction of in situ horizontal stresses and more specifically in the formation fracture gradient (FG). The presence of non-depleted and generally weak interbeds within the pressure depleted reservoirs with a low FG leads to a narrow drilling margin for new infill wells or laterals. Therefore, a robust knowledge of rock mechanical properties, formation pressures, the magnitude of in situ stresses and their evolution with production and depletion are essential for successful drilling of new wells in particular and the redevelopment of mature fields as a whole. 
A case study from a mature oil field in the Sarawak Basin, offshore Malaysia, is presented where the field geomechanical elements were constrained from field data acquired in more than 10 offset wells drilled in early 1980s, and a new re-development well drilled in 2014 with supplementary core, well logs and pressure data. The results of rock mechanical core tests along with acoustic logs in the new well were used to update and verify an early geomechanical model built in the area. Extensive production from more than 20 multi-layer sandstone reservoirs resulted in significant pressure depletion whilst some of the deeper and stronger reservoirs still contain significant oil reserves. The geomechanical model was used to identify the narrow-margin drilling and stability risks of infill deviated oil producers targeting by-passed oil in the deeper reservoirs, and horizontal water injectors planned to enhance oil recovery in the field. 
The results showed that both intermediate and production sections of planned wells would have narrow mud weight windows. Depending on the well trajectory, the production sections could have only 0.8 ppg drilling margin due to a higher depletion of deeper reservoirs. The analyses also highlighted thin, weak interbeds in the intermediate hole section that require a minimum mud weight of 10.0-10.5 ppg to limit shear failure to a manageable level considering hole cleaning challenges in high-angled wells whilst the FG of depleted sections could be as low as 11.3 ppg requiring stringent control on downhole pressure while drilling to keep the hole pressure within the safe margin. Optimum mud weights, safe drilling margins and casing setting points were determined for nine different well trajectories focusing on the azimuthal and inclination dependency of fracture and borehole collapse pressures. 
The subsequent drilling campaign of planned infill oil producers and water injectors in the field has been successful due to good drilling practices, using the recommended mud programs consistent with wellbore stability assessments, and careful bottomhole pressure control.|","Depleted Reservoirs, Geomechanics, Mature Field Redevelopment, High-Angled Infill Drilling, Narrow Drilling Margin",33

CO2 geo-storage in deep saline aquifers or oil and gas reservoirs is a key technology to mitigate anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Technically, CO2 is captured from large emitters, e.g. coal-fired power plants, and injected deep underground into geological formations. In case of hydrocarbon reservoirs, this can be combined with CO2-enhanced petroleum recovery, which is rather efficient. One potential host rock for CO2 is thus porous limestone; however, the geomechanical response (especially at the microscale) of the limestone when it is exposed to the acidic CO2-fluids (CO2 saturated brine or wet supercritical CO2) is only poorly understood. 
We thus measured the geomechanical properties of Savonnieres limestone cores before and after injection of supercritical CO2 at the microscale. The CO2 was injected at representative flow conditions: a fully brine saturated storage reservoir at approximately 1000m depth (323K temperature, 10 MPa pore pressure, 5 MPa effective stress) was simulated, and 10 pore volumes of supercritical CO2 were injected at a capillary number of 10-6, which mimics storage conditions. The dynamic elastic properties and the formation factor were measured and compared with the geomechanical response. 
We found that the dynamic Young’s modulus decreased, while permeability and porosity increased after scCO2 injection; however, the micro-scale indentation moduli showed a dual behaviour: while the indentation modulus slightly increased in less consolidated rock areas, it decreased in the more and highly consolidated areas. We conclude that the scCO2 injected into limestone weakens the well consolidated areas, but strengthens the weaker areas.|","CO2 storage, supercritical CO2, geomechanical, acid injection",13

Understanding the elastic properties of rocks is very important for unconventional reservoirs exploration. Unlike marine shale, the lacustrine shale is more complicated with complex mineral composition and frequent sand and shale interbeds. Typical analysis for lacustrine shale gas reservoir rock include: triaxial test, X-ray diffraction (XRD), total organic carbon (TOC) measurements. The mineral composition is different for argillaceous shale and silty laminae shale. The static elastic properties are controlled by clay content, organic matter and porosity. In this work we evaluate elastic properties of above mentioned rocks using experimeal core analysis and well log data. Based on triaxial test, Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of rocks are obtained by means of the relationship between strain and stress. Argillaceous shale is low to medium strength rock, and silty laminae shale belongs to medium to high strength rock. We find that Young's modulus and Poison's ratio has a negative relationship with clay content, organic matter and porosity which is present by bulk density and neutron porosity logs. The dynamic elastic properties are obtained from cross diploe acoustic well logging data. The dynamic elastic properties have the same controlling factors as static properties. Argillaceous shale and silty laminae shale have significantly different response characteristics in well logging. The porosity is the main factor which leads to the differences between dynamic and static elastic properties. Moreover, it is also found that the ratio of static and dynamic elastic properties is a function of porosity. Hence, density porosity and neutron porosity from the logs are chosen to establish dynamic elastic properties correction model. The correction model is effective in predicting static properties in lacustrine shale gas reservoirs. We conclude that the static properties obtained from the correction model match with core derived static properties.|","diploe acoustic logs, elastic properties, characterization, shale gas rock",60

Measurements of deformations by using tiltmeters located at large or moderate distances from a hydraulic fracture (HF) have often been used to monitor fracture geometry. The fracture is generally represented as a singular point displacement discontinuity (DD) source, or as a constant DD over a rectangular plane, or as a distributed DD across a fracture plane, and the analytical solution for the induced deformation by a DD in a homogeneous elastic half-space is commonly used directly as a forward model for representing a simple fracture or as a building block for constructing a more complex fracture in mapping the fracture geometry. The mechanical properties of the coal seam in which an HF is placed are typically very different from those of the surrounding rocks. In addition, the poroleastic response associated with fracturing fluid leakoff from the fracture surface into the coal layer may also influence the HF growth and the induced deformation. In order to obtain a correct interpretation of the created fracture geometry and better understanding of the treating pressure behaviour in hydraulic fracturing stimulation of coal to enhance gas production, the mechanical property contrasts and the poroelastic effect induced by fluid leakoff need to be recognised and taken into account. 
In this paper, a mechanical model based on the concept of eigenstrain and the equivalent inclusion method is presented and applied to the problem of calculating the far-field deformation and stresses induced by a horizontal fracture located in a formation layer with mechanical properties different from those of the surrounding homogeneous elastic half-space. The fracture is modelled as a constant opening DD across the fracture plane, and the corresponding mathematically equivalent eigenstrain is defined based on the fracture opening and formation layer geometry. A simple one-dimensional hydromechanical model has been presented to approximate the fluid leakoff through the surface of a stationary fracture. The analytical solutions allow for estimating the importance of the poroelastic effect associated with an HF in a coal seam. The variation of the pore fluid content due to fracturing fluid leakoff is characterized by the poroelastic eigenstrain. A relationship connecting the induced far-field deformation and stresses with the fracture and formation layer geometry, the fluid leakoff volume, and the mechanical properties has been established. The proposed method offers a simple and computationally efficient forward model to take into account the effect of mechanical property contrasts and poroelasticity on the deformation induced by the fracture when using tiltmeter monitoring to map the geometry of an HF in a coal seam.|","Poroelasticity, Material Heterogeneity, Coal Seam, Hydraulic Fracture, Tiltmeter",53

Drilling and stimulation of exploration and development wells in the Cooper Basin, Central Australia, has been challenging over the decades due to the high-pressure, high-temperature environment, the high stress anisotropy, and the presence of thick coals. Most of the wells drilled to date have been vertical. To improve production, a study was conducted for a low-permeability tight-sand oil field to assess a horizontal well with multi-stage stimulation. The long horizontal well was expected to pass through a region with varying depletions and lithologies, causing lateral variations in stress and rock properties that could only be captured by a 3D geomechanical model. 
A 3D geomechanical model was constructed to provide an integrated and accurate understanding of the field and to facilitate the planning and design of drilling, completion and stimulation of the horizontal well with reduced cost and risks, and to maximize the productivity. Based on detailed 1D geomechanical modelling, a well-centric understanding of the three principal stresses, fluid pressure and rock mechanical properties of the formations was developed for offset wells in the field. The pore pressure distribution and depletion in 3D space was calibrated using well test and long-term pressure survey data. Rock mechanical properties and stresses were populated in 3D space using seismic interval velocities and relationships developed in the 1D modelling, honouring the 3D static geological and structural models. 
The model of pressure, stress and rock property variations in 3D space enabled optimization of the casing program and mud weights. Operational best practices to drill the long horizontal well, especially the high-angle build section in overburden coals, were compiled based on a drilling knowledge base developed using data from analogous fields. The use of varying stress and rock mechanical properties along the planned well trajectory in hydraulic fracturing optimization was a differentiating approach to conventional hydraulic fracturing optimization using 1D geomechanics. The treatment was optimized to confine the fracture above the water-bearing formation along the well path. The optimized stimulation design provided the best solution of stages, proppant and fluid selection, and injection schedules to maximize production with minimum cost. 
Based on the detailed assessment, it was concluded that the horizontal well is drillable with optimized mud properties and good drilling practices to overcome the instability in coals. In addition, the reservoir section can be drilled safely with lower mud weights whilst still maintaining good wellbore shape. A multistage transverse fracturing program was optimized to improve the production, mitigating the challenges from the extremely low stress contrast between reservoir and the underlying water-bearing zone.|","Stimulation Optimization, Cooper Basin, Horizontal Well, Well Planning, 3D Geomechanics",33
132,133,182247-MS,Geomechanical Sweet Spot Identification in Unconventional Resources Development,"Rahman, Khalil, Baker Hughes| Gui, Feng, Baker Hughes","|Abstract 
Sweet spot identification in unconventional fields generally involves the identification of clusters and intensities of parameters that indicate the resource volume and production-related parameters, i.e., reservoir quality parameters such as total organic content (TOC), porosity, permeability, pay zone thickness, etc. The process usually incorporates interpretation of seismic data, well logs and other data to develop a 3D model that is used to suggest locations for productive wells. While understanding these parameters is essential in unconventional resource development, the potential to achieve productive hydraulic fractures, or the potential to exploit natural fractures, or the potential to achieve both simultaneously determines the feasibility of developing an unconventional resource. There are geomechanical conditions that are favourable to achieve the maximum productivity from stimulation operations. Identifying the geomechanical sweet spots within the field-wide reservoir quality sweet spots is, therefore, essential for optimum placement of wells and hydraulic fractures in unconventional reservoirs. This identification requirement is gaining more and more attention in the industry, which is helping the technique and workflow development. This paper discusses the workflow to identify the existence and properties of geomechanical sweet spots including rock mechanical properties and natural fracture distribution and how they help to decide the vertical location and direction of horizontal wells for optimal reservoir development. The workflow requires a multidisciplinary data set comprising drilling, geology, geophysics, production, geochemistry and geomechanical information. Based on detailed geological understanding, either a 1D or a 3D geomechanical model is built as the foundation for further analysis. Images, seismic data and structural information are the key to develop the understanding of natural fracture distribution. A discrete fracture network (DFN) model, or other definitive models, is required to identify stress-sensitive fracture distributions under different stress conditions. Due to the fact that local in-situ stress and natural fracture properties can be altered by production operations, initial unsweet spots may turn into sweet spots at some stage of production or injection operations. Based on the results of comprehensive geomechanical sweet spot analysis, an optimal development decision can be made based on integrated geomechanics, production and net present value analyses within the identified sweet spots. This paper includes results and illustrations from several case studies completed for a number of fields in the Asia Pacific to demonstrate the concept.|","Optimum development, Unconventional, Sweet spot, Stimulation, Geomechanics",21

When drilling wells for hydrocarbon extraction, completing a specific interval of the well in the fastest time possible is a key requirement. One of the main contributing factors for improved performance is the drill bit. 
It is well known in the drilling industry that the stress state of the formation around the bit and drilled well is significantly lowered once penetrated by the bit. Conventional single diameter polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) drill bits are not capable of taking advantage of this reduced effective rock strength. 
Dual-diameter bits address the identified challenges through the use of elegant physical principles and offer an efficient, reliable means of drilling. The concentric, dual-diameter design lowers the effective rock strength encountered by the critical shoulder-to-gauge area of the bit's cutting structure. 
The smaller pilot section of the bit design drills a pilot hole, which reduces the confinement and thus strength of the rock drilled by the larger reamer section. The reamer section of the bit is able to utilize the bedded pilot bit for stabilization to offset the greater forces associated with larger diameter drilling. The offset blade configuration of the bits also offers 360-degree contact the borehole and helps deliver a gun barrel hole quality. 
This paper introduces the development of a unique, two-stage, dual-diameter profile, and polycrystalline diamond compact drill bit for an application in Indonesia. Typically, multiple drill bits are required to finish the section, which consists of abrasive sandstone with some layers of coal. The objective was to improve the drilling performance while also minimizing non-productive time (NPT) for a bit trip. 
The paper provides and in-depth evaluation of the bit performance over several field trials. The first bit was run in a motor assembly and improved 14% rate of penetration (ROP) with exceptional dull condition. The drilling parameters indicated that the bit generated higher ROP with lower weight on bit (WOB) compared to other bit types. This performance convinced the operator to run the dual-diameter PDC bit in a more challenging field where its remarkable performance achieved field records. In comparison to the closest offset well, dual-diameter drill bits replaced three-bit runs with 56% longer intervals drilled and improved overall ROP by 41%. In addition, rig time was reduced by 5.3 days. The operator was extremely pleased with the bit performance and decided to use a dual-diameter PDC bit as the primary option to drill this section in every field.|","Penetration Rate, Drill Bit Design, Bit Selection, Performance",17

Drilling in the Cooper Basin faces challenges from the hostile stress environment, high-pressure and high-temperature conditions, and variations in rock properties with depth. The current understanding is that the Cooper Basin is under a highly deviatoric, strike-slip stress regime with significant stress contrasts between different lithologies. These conditions create challenges for drilling and well stimulation. 
A series of wells have been reviewed to understand the vertical and lateral stress changes in the Patchawarra Trough in the Northern Cooper Basin. The temperature anomaly at this location appears to be lower than in the Nappamerri Trough in the south. A different level of overpressure is also observed, and the formation pressure appears to vary depending on structural location. Shallow wells on the ridge appear to be near hydrostatic in the Permian sands, but overpressure is as high as 10.5-11 ppg on structures in the deeper part of the Patchawarra Trough. Rocks appear to be generally strong, with siltstones in the Permian section being only slightly weaker than sandstones. The stress anisotropy in the sandstone is large; the SHmax/Shmin ratio is greater than 2. The stress anisotropy is considered to be the reason for preferential wellbore failure in sands instead of shaly siltstones. The stresses in interlayered thick coals tend to be near isotropic. It is also thought that the stress regime is not necessarily uniform with depth; the maximum horizontal stress decreases drastically at shallower depths, and the stress regime becomes normal faulting. 
The detailed geomechanical analysis shows that the drilling challenges faced in the deeper section are mainly caused by the thick coal sequences. Sandstones and siltstones are relatively strong, should not cause much wellbore instability, and are only expected to develop narrow breakouts. For hydraulic fracturing, the small stress contrast (similar minimum horizontal stress magnitudes) between sandstone and siltstone in the Permian formation would result in difficulty in confining the fracture in zone. Consequently, excessive height growth may cause the fracture to grow into highly fractured coals and may lead to early screen-outs. 
Detailed geomechanical modeling for a series of wells in the Patchawarra Trough has enabled a thorough understanding of variations in rock properties, pressure and stress in the area. Optimised drilling strategies for mud weight and mud properties were adopted for the drilling of vertical and horizontal wells. Accurate stress modelling also helped the optimisation of hydraulic fracture design to achieve successful fracture treatments for improved production.|","Cooper Basin, Stimulation, High Stress Contrast, Drilling",53

Challenging environments, such as deep-water, require greater effort when designing wells and completion systems. In such cases, hydrocarbon production associated risks must be evaluated from very early stages of field development. Particularly, the risk of sanding should be investigated to select and define the optimum well completion, and if required, the appropriate sand control options. This paper presents a novel approach to predict the onset of sanding by describing a case study from a deep-water gas field in Southeast Asia. 
Sanding analysis generally consists of either a numerical or analytical model calibrated against laboratory tests and production histories. Here, both numerical and analytical models are implemented to achieve a robust and reliable prediction in the absence of any production data. For this purpose, the numerical model is prepared and run using a comprehensive material model considering poroelastic-plastic rock behaviour with strain hardening. The rock is modelled from a combination of single-stage triaxial and advanced thick-walled cylinder rock mechanical tests on representative samples from the target reservoirs. A poroelastic analytical model calibrated against the numerical modelling results is then used to conduct sand production predictions with sensitivity analyses for a number of well trajectory scenarios for both cased and perforated, and open-hole completions. 
Although the numerical and analytical models follow different assumptions, the sanding prediction results from both models are consistent. Once a reliable validation is obtained, the analytical method can be used with confidence for sand production prediction for future wells through its simplicity and fast realization of various scenarios. The results show that a high risk of sanding exists for both cased and perforated, and open-hole completion systems for the planned deviated wells. Hence, downhole sand exclusion options are deemed to be required for the development wells. 
Incorporating analytical poroelastic and numerical poroelastic-plastic sanding evaluations enhanced the reliability of sanding prediction for development wells. This approach is particularly beneficial in the absence of production data at appraisal or early development stages.|","Sand Production Prediction, Geomechanics, Analytical Analysis, Numerical Analysis, Deep-Water",3

A workflow has been developed for a shale play in North America for the strategic deployment of refracturing in an unconventional reservoir. Although it is clearly understood in the industry that refracturing in tight unconventional reservoirs can have a dramatic impact on the productivity and longevity of economic production, until now there has been no workflow that could be counted on to deliver consistent results. The impact of production and stress re-orientation plays a significant role in adding a fourth dimension of time to the existing three-dimensional problem of hydraulic fracture modeling in these reservoirs. 
We examined the re-orientation of reservoir stress and the change in stress magnitude with production in a case from the Eagle Ford. The stress redistribution occurring due to poroelastic effects was simulated using a finite element geomechanical simulator and then tied back to predict the new hydraulic fracture growth. Fracture geometry as it relates to draining the unstimulated domain was found to play a significant role in fracturing success. The impact of adding new perforations in the wellbore and application of a suitable diversion technique were also considered in the study. Our numerical investigation of the potential increase in productivity with selection of the optimum refracturing treatment timing and technique led to development of a methodology that solves the complex four-dimensional problem. 
By adopting the guidelines from the case study application of the end-to-end workflow, operators can avoid the futility of too early or too late fracturing and thereby maximize their return on investment.|","VISAGE, depletion stress change, Unconvetional fracture model, Refracturing, Mangrove",15

All would agree that bad data should not be let into the organization’s systems and its decision-making processes, yet there are no industry standard methods on how best to assure this for well log data. Electric well logs are the principal data sets for all geotechnical personnel in this industry: logs generally constitute the main continuous and relatively high-resolution records describing a wellbore, and they are available over the main depth intervals of most wells drilled for hydrocarbon exploration and production. 
The specialized contractor companies that acquire the logs have quality management systems in place to ensure compliance and consistency with their own specifications. The data deliverables are therefore subject to some quality control before delivery to the operating companies, although it is of a general nature and focused on the acquired data, rather than on their future exploitation. 
On delivery, the responsibility for any post-acquisition quality control of the well logs frequently falls on inadequately trained and supervised geotechnical persons, who may skim over it on account of its being ""too hard"" or ""too urgent"". People responsible for log quality control frequently report that they find it ""difficult"" or ""overwhelming"" and that they ""don’t know where to start"". Subject matter experts themselves know that logs must always be checked and perhaps conditioned before they can be used. Yet few of them have simultaneously the knowledge, the experience, the reference information, the tools and the time to verify the fitness-for-purpose of the data methodically and confidently. This systematic requirement is costly for organizations, and its uncertainty exposes them to unnecessary risks. The situation is exacerbated by concurrent increases in the variety, volume and complexity of the log data and in their rates of change. 
There must be a better way to assure log data quality and readiness for exploitation. The objective of this paper is to propose a framework to formalize and simplify log quality control in operating companies and other data-user organizations.|","Log Quality Control, LQC, Data Quality, Quality Management, Log Data",1

Waterflood induced fractures are the new features affecting the reservoir heterogeneity in low-permeability reservoirs. Due to the high injection pressure, waterflood induced fractures will generate and propagate when the formation pressure exceeds fracturing pressure during the waterflood process of low-permeability reservoirs. Waterflood induced fractures will interact with natural fractures and create high permeable flow channels. 
Conventional reservoir simulation models often fail in simulating the waterflooding of low-permeability reservoirs without considering the effect of reservoir pressure on the fractures. Current fracture models based on Perkins-Kern-Nordgren (PKN) model only focus on the simulation of the propagation of a single fracture without considering the interaction between waterflood induced fractures and pre-existing natural fractures. Therefore, based on the analysis of field data and the mechanism of waterflood induced fractures, a comprehensive wateflood induced fracture simulation model for naturally fractured low-permeability reservoirs is established. 
Compared with the existing models, this waterflood induced fracture model can simulate the process of occurrence, propagation and closing of waterflood induced fractures due to the effect of high injection pressure and complex in-situ stress. The model considers the interaction between induced fractures and natural fractures, including slippage and crossing. The fracture model is coded in a module of a reservoir simulator. The simulation results shows that waterflood induced fractures worsen the reservoir heterogeneity, greatly increase the water cut of production well and lower the oil production rate. 
The model can simulate the impact of waterflood induced fractures on waterflooding and optimize well patterns in low-permeability reservoirs to improve sweep efficiency and oil recovery.|","Low-permeability reservoirs, Waterflood induced fracture, Enhanced oil recovery, Fracture modeling, Reservoir Simulation",37

Fresh and distilled water was filtered through samples, and the samples were exposed to variable effective stresses. The experiments showed significant change of sample permeability caused by coupled mechanical and chemical (mechanochemical) effects. The results of studies were processed for determination of regularities in permeability variation in the process of water injection and the effective stress impact. As the result, the authors received the dependences of change of the fracture width on the fracture wall contact area, that can be used for prediction of change of the fractured reservoir permeability.|",,1

The area is characterized by high risks of borehole instability in Upper Permian overburden shales that overlie Kungurian anhydrite and salt deposits and Artinsky fractured carbonate reservoir rocks. Deviated well trajectory in 245 mm (9 5/8"") section contribute to higher risks of borehole instability in overburden shales. 1D and 3D near-wellbore geomechanics modeling taking into account shear slip along bedding planes of weakness was carried out for deviated wells to optimize mud weight and reduce risks of wellbore instability. The plane-of-weakness failure criterion is adopted to identify the onset of rock sliding along a weak plane (bedding or fracture) in the anisotropic wellbore stability model. The influence of bedding orientation and wellbore trajectory on the borehole stability is considered in the model. Shale formation rock strength anisotropic parameters, i.e., cohesion, friction angle and tensile strength for bedding planes of weakness, were deduced from the intact rock matrix parameters as a normal practice of geomechanical modeling, as no core test data were available from the shales. |According to post-drill geomechanical analysis, borehole damage computed using the wellbore stability model with bedding planes of weakness is in agreement with drilling events (cavings, overpulls) occurred under insufficient mud weight in 245 mm section of deviated well A. In contrast, poor correspondence between modeled borehole breakouts and drilling events was obtained by using the conventional wellbore stability model. Deviated well trajectory and angle of attack at 45°± 5° in 245 mm section represent settings that are favorable for shear slip along bedding planes contributing to borehole instability. According to the modeling results, stable mud weight window in 245 mm section of well A narrows in the model with planes of weakness if compared to the model with intact rock only. Well trajectory optimization was recommended to keep angle of attack below 30° in shales and increase deviation in the underlying anhydrite and salt deposits. The anisotropic wellbore stability analysis applied for the first time in deviated wells of the Field X has shown that modeling of bedding plane of weakness in shales was essential to quantify the effect of shale strength variation with angle of attack on wellbore stability, and has to be considered in geomechanical modeling for drilling the wellbore safely and cost effectively.|",,21

Specialists, who analyze core material, are often encounter a lack of manufacturing capabilities of conditioned samples required for the measurement of physico-chemical and estimation parameters. |The purpose of this work is to optimize the operations with core material from source rocks on the territory of the company Gazprom Neft PJSC, which are aimed at maximum recovery of geological information while ensuring the best preservation of core material. |To address this objective it is required to perform an integrated approach for analysis of the core material at all stages - from the selection of suitable coring technologies, operations with a core ""in the well"" and transportation of the core to the laboratory to selection of the optimal sequence (algorithm) of the sample preparation and laboratory tests, depending on the set of commercial applications. |It is assumed that the section of the BF can be divided into a series of intervals formed by rocks, differing from each other by physico-chemical and filtration parameters. One group of intervals may be involved in the development by creating a pressure differential in the well-reservoir system, the second - by creating artificial fracture network by applying the fracturing technologies, the third will be the result of thermal effects on the rock. A list of studies was compiled on the basis of the basic assumptions of non-uniform vertical structure of the section of BF, that allows addressing a series of commercial tasks: how intervals with different properties are spread in the sections of the BF, the presence of movable hydrocarbons, filtration-capacity parameters range of intervals.

K., Schlumberger| Vereschagin, S., Schlumberger| Malyshev, V., Schlumberger| Stashevsky, V., Schlumberger","|This paper addresses the failure of field development pattern design where horizontal wells with multistage fractures (HWMSF) are being drilled and are completed in low- to- mid-permeability oil-bearing conventional reservoirs [k<100 mD] where the field is under waterflooding. |A novel and optimum pattern for HWMSF has been developed to promote economic success and avoid the issues with current HWMSF production wells that exhibit either early water breakthrough or higher-than-planned decline in fluid rates. |The analysis and thorough numerical reservoir modeling exercise of the currently used well patterns used in waterflooding reveal that the completion design, azimuthal orientation, and operating condition of the HWMSF production well and injector wells are suboptimal. The result of such field development is either an early-time relatively high production rate followed by a steep production decline and water breakthrough or low initial production and even lower late-time production. In either case, the HWMSF are not economically viable, and operators search for alternative methods to revitalize production from HWMSF. Such an alternative are the proposed changes in initial completion and operational practices. |With the introduction of the new HWMSF completions as production wells, the injection-production well pattern design in conventional reservoirs that was applicable for vertical, subvertical, slanted, and S-shaped hydraulically fractured wells must be adjusted to ensure waterflooding remains effective in the changed completion environment. |The novel pattern devised consists of placement of a row of HWMSF production wells and, between the production wells, a row of injection HWMSF. This is different from all known patterns in that both injector and producer HWMSF are drilled in the direction of minimum horizontal stress and hydraulically fractured. The wells are completed in such way that the hydraulic fractures on both wells are spaced out in a controlled manner, and the ports as well as the injection and production are controlled. This way, the pattern allows for high early production rate and high late-time production rate and reduces the risk of early water breakthrough while preventing uncontrolled fractures in injector wells. The completion design—including the hydraulic fractures and the wellbore hardware, the position, azimuthal orientation, and spacing of the injector and producer wells—is critical to the optimization of hydrocarbon production and the recovery of reserves and is explained in the paper. |The paper describes the novel method of developing conventional oil-bearing formation by drilling HWMSF as injector and producer wells. The wells are drilled in line with minimum horizontal stress and are completed in such way that fractures are fully controlled during fracture placement and later during the wells' operations. This results in maximizing the early production oil rate, minimizing production decline, and minimizing risk of water breakthrough, therefore maximizing the economic results and the recovery factor.|",,17

The Arctic regions offer significant resource bases for energy supplies for the future. The Arctic developments has been challenged during the last years due to relatively high risk and cost levels related to the remote locations, harsh environment and environmental risks. The price of energy has fallen significantly and Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) prices has followed the oil market, therefor the development of LNG facilities in the Arctic has to offer substancial cost benefits over what was planned some few years back. 
Gas fields in the Arctic can be developed with LNG plants onshore, Floating LNG (FLNG) or by Gravity Based Structure (GBS) LNG solutions. Onshore developments has been the only alternative developed to date but logistical, foundation and lower productivity for construction, hook up and commissioning in arctic conditions has enabled another development concept to be evaluated. FLNG in shallow water and ice infested areas has not yet been considered a feasible development solution. 
The GBS LNG concept offers solutions to many of the challenges in developing a large scale LNG plant in the arctic. The self contained GBS LNG based on compact design with integrated topside, Product storage and offloading in one unit can improve the execution of:  
Construction and integration in a yard instead of in an remote localization with harsh environment large parts of the year 
Reduced logistical challenges and no ice breaking tansport vessels required 
Locating the GBS LNG in permafrost free site 
Concrete GBS can be constructed locally to ensure substantial local content 
Securing the project schedule by working in a controlled environment with established infrastructure and work force 
Significant reduction in bulk quantities due to compact design 
Integrated ice barrier and potentially ice management systems in the GBS |The GBS LNG concept has been developed to be a flexible solution where;  
Train size and number of trains can be accommodated - up to 10 MTPA LNG capacity per GBS 
Large flexibility in LNG and condensate storage capacity 
Water depth ranging from 13-30m 
Design one build many - easy hook up for multiple LNG GBSs 
Cooling medium (Air or Water cooled) 
Driver selection - GT or Electrical drive 
Self contained with Living Quarter, Flare and utilities in produced on board 
Flare can be installed on GB S |This paper is based on several conceptual and pre-FEED studies for the arctic and sub arctic environment where the GBS LNG solution has been evaluated favourable over the onshore development alternative, especially in location with ice infested waters and were permafrost on land is present.|",,5

169,170,182116-MS,Competent Utilization of Multistage Acid Fracturing Technology to Increment Well Productivity during Stimulation of Low Permeability Gas Carbonate Reservoirs – Case Study,"Guizada, Pablo, Ali Habbtar","|Tight gas reservoirs and specifically low permeability gas-bearing carbonate formations require stimulation to produce commercial gas rates. Certain carbonate reservoirs in Saudi Arabia are highly heterogeneous and the degree of heterogeneity changes over the field and within well drainage areas. Horizontal multi-stage acid fracturing technology has become the preferred completion method in such reservoirs to stimulate these carbonate formations to maximize reservoir contact and enhance well productivity. Due to the degree of heterogeneity of these formations, a number of factors should be considered and a set of best practices should be implemented to overcome the reservoir challenges and achieve the expected results. |Maximizing stimulated reservoir volume is one of the key aspects of the success of this technology. To maximize the stimulated reservoir volume, effective placement of the hydraulic fractures for every stage must be achieved, which is one of the most challenging factors. Effective placement of hydraulic fractures depends mainly on the following factors: placement of the horizontal wellbore along the minimum-stress direction and proper annular isolation to induce independent fractures across each stage. This goal becomes even more challenging to achieve with acid fracturing treatments. Failure to isolate the stages can lead to hydraulic communication between the fracture stages, allowing the pumped frac stage to propagate to the previously open frac stage, preventing the creation of separate fractures, affecting the well's productivity and ultimate recovery. A second factor that governs multi-stage completion effectiveness is the use of swellable packers to ensure proper isolation between the various stages, which was observed in the field. |This paper describes the application of Multi-Stage Fracturing (MSF) completion technology. Field cases describing the deployment of the MSF completions and the obtained results after stimulation is presented, as well as the main conclusions and recommendations for successful implementation of this technology are highlighted.|",,24

Moreover, many shale rocks are strongly anisotropic. The objective of this study is to develop a fast semi-analytical model for MFHWs with coupling geomechanics and fluid flow. The effects of stress-sensitive hydraulic fractures and shale anisotropy are considered. |This study first uses an exponential correlation between principal stresses and pore pressure changes in anisotropic shale. Then the correlation is applied to match experimental data of fracture conductivities vs. effective stress. The fracture compressibility in the exponential equation is stress-dependent rather than constant. Next, this study discretizes each hydraulic fracture into several slab source segments. For each segment in each time step, pressure distribution is calculated with source/sink functions. Then both stress field and hydraulic fracture conductivities are updated according to the pressure distribution with the aforementioned correlations before starting next time step. |Calculations of production rates with this model generate series of type curves for rate transient analysis of MFHWs with stress-sensitive hydraulic fractures. First of all, the production rate of a MFHW with stress-sensitive hydraulic fractures decreases faster than that with constant fracture conductivities at early-stage production. Secondly, the hydraulic fracture compressibility decreases with the increasing effective stress. Such change of the fracture conductivity is determined by the initial value and declining rates of fracture compressibility. Thirdly, shale anisotropy caused by kerogen leads to a larger increase of effective horizontal stresses when the reservoir pressure drops during production. Moreover, in terms of stress-sensitivity, fracture designs with improved conductivity are more resistant to the loss of fracture conductivity than large-volume designs for longer fracture length but lower conductivity.|",,27

To fully answer this question, the following tasks will be completed. First, determine shale properties: strength, elastic and permeability. Second, determine what effective stress(es), or range, exceeds the shale's tensile strength. Lastly, determine a theoretical model for fracture propagation in shale. A large-scale laboratory experiment has been designed to subject shale to pore over-pressurization and induce tensile fractures bringing the sample to failure. It is anticipated that the pressure differential, elevated pore pressure in a low permeability rock sample, and concomitant bleeding off of confining pressure will induce tensile fractures affected by poroelastic properties of the rock. The results from this experiment will be used to calibrate a forward finite element numerical model, which can then simulate the tensile fracturing process and answer the above question. With rare exception, tensile strength is determined using the indirect method, a method that is industry standard, but by definition cannot describe uniform internal failure as it is intended to fail a sample diametrically. This project will use laboratory experiments to simulate the physical processes of initiating a tensile fracture with excess pore pressure. A numerical model will be constructed that simulate the laboratory experiments to illustrate the coupling of pore pressure, matrix stress and fracture initiation. The laboratory experiment is designed to provide data to with which to calibrate the model and validate the model's output. This model can then be used on the one hand to better design completions programs for hydraulic fracturing and, on the other hand, how to design safer storage caverns in shales. This research will make use of the coupling between a shale's matrix properties and the fluid properties contained within the pore space in order to evaluate the shale's usefulness for various applications: 1) completions engineers in the petroleum industry who endeavor to hydraulically fracture shales, and 2) those who do not seek to fracture shales, such as engineers designing shale caverns to store natural gas or carbon dioxide.|",,61

Thermal recovery processes in heavy oil reservoirs have become an efficient technique for the exploitation of the viscous oil that is trapped in the porous space. The heat reduces the oil viscosity and thus allows it to flow from the formation to the well. In recent years, there have been technological advances that have permitted such operations to become safe and profitable. Having a right understanding of what happens to the reservoir and the surrounding formations during thermal recovery has become a topic of interest to reduce the environmental impact of these operations and to generate models that predict production and recovery factor accurately and reliably. 
Understanding the geomechanical behavior of this type of formations under different scenarios of stress and temperature is essential to model this kind of operations due to possible scenarios during thermal recovery. Confining condiciton is related to the depth of the reservoir and tectonic activity in the area. Heavy oil reservoirs are mainly located at detph less than 3000 feet according to Shafiei et. al (2013) [1]. This usually makes the reservoir formations to be unconsolidated or poorly consolidated, this kind of formations show elastoplastic behavior where stress-strain relationship plays an essential role in the production/injection process. 
Samples from an outcrop of an oilsand formation located in Eastern Cordillera of Colombia were collected to performe triaxial tests at high temperature conditions. Picacho formation presents a high content of fines as other important heavy oil formations in Colombia, where thermal recovery has been considered. Fines content is crucial in the understanding of the material behavior due to particular silt and clay behavior such as thermal consolidation and mineralogic change caused by the temperature increment. 
During heating, different parameters were measured in order to understand what occurs to the porous medium while it is subjected to changes of temperature. The measurements include pore volume, total volume and permeability at different stages during the heating process. The experiments were perfomed at different conditions of effective confining stress (mainting pore pressure constant). The results show a significant dependence of the petophysical properties such us permeability and porosity to the confining stress at which the porous medium is subjected.|","Oil sands, Petrophysics, Thermal Recovery, Confining",21

This laboratory work is the base for further improvements in heavy oil operations. The system consists of a pipe packed with nanoparticle-doped, superparamagnetic spheres as the bed material. The experimental results are compared to the data obtained with a volume average numerical method. |In the RF heating system, the spheres are excited when subjected to oscillating electric fields ensuing thermal energy dissipation; this mechanism is called the Neel relaxation, a type of electrical induction heating. We have tested this system’s performance using water and heavy crude oil flowing in non-electrically conductive ceramic pipes packed with different sizes and spheres materials. Pressure, temperature and electric consumption data corresponding to varying flow rates have been collected and the numerically solved heat transfer equations are used to extend the system characterization; this will allow for industrial apparatus design considerations. |Steady state data indicate that fluid heating is achieved at smaller residence times than in conventional heaters; temperature can be controlled with a great accuracy by varying the parameters of the RF generator. When heat leakage could be contained (through insulating the pipe outer wall and relatively low temperature gradients), heating efficiencies were significantly higher than 80 %. The volume average numerical method shows that the liquid flowing through the packed bed gets uniformly heated. Thermal and flow characterization are achieved for Reynolds and Nusselt numbers in the range of 10-2-102 respectively. |This set up is able to heat in an efficient and temperature accurate manner for a wide range of flow conditions, and can be potentially used as a highly efficient heat exchanger for production operations (e.g., steam generation) in areas where the construction of surface facilities (fuel storage tanks, boilers) is not possible, either for environmental reasons or for lack of land space.

189,190,181163-MS,Voidage Replacement Ratio as a Decision Variable in Closed Loop Reservoir Management Process Improving Field Production Efficiency,"Nogueira, Elysio Mendes, Petrogal Brasil","|Abstract 
Closed Loop Reservoir Management (CLRM) aims to automate the classic reservoir management process by means of using artificial intelligence, control theory and optimization workflows. One of the tasks performed during a CLRM is the optimization process which deals with defining the best allocation of resources so as to maximize, for instance, Net Present Value. This resource allocation may be wells location, injection (or production) rate for each well, etc. 
In this context, the goal of this paper is to introduce an innovative approach of CLRM for optimization of waterflooding process by using Voidage Replacement Ratio (VRR) as a decision variable to generate optimum NPV of a given field. It is argued that this decision should be taken prior to any definition on well injection rates or either zone injection rate for Intelligent Wells. 
A simplified oil-water reservoir model is used to simulate real field behavior under a number different scenarios of VRR values defined by an optimization algorithm designed to reach maximum value of a simplified NPV function. From that initial model, three case studies are performed to answer three questions:  
How can different reservoir and economic scenarios impact decision of the optimum value of VRR to be pursued by reservoir managers?; 
How to adapt the proposed method to different development project drivers? 
Is it possible to improve field's performance by defining an optimum sequence of variation for VRR through time? |This paper demonstrates that, although being the most common practice for waterflooding projects, a strategy of keeping VRR ~ 1 do not always lead to optimal profitability in terms of NPV. They are also discussed the many aspects to be considered when deciding on the pressure management strategy for developing a reservoir safely and economically while limited by technical and operational constraints. 
The studies performed demonstrate how an active VRR management during production lifetime might generate improved efficiency of company's assets aligned to its development strategy. Also, a reliable rule of thumbs guideline is presented to give operators a qualitative insight on how different geological and economic scenarios might impact on the definition of optimum strategy for VRR management.|","Voidage Replacement Management, Closed Loop Reservoir Management, Optimization Workflow",38

For this reason rehabilitation work are done constantly to clean wells with the objective of reactivating, or increasing their production. |Given that the application of conventional rehabilitation work done with service rig using wash pipe and shoe mill has not shown successful results because of lack of circulation in the well; arises the need for a new cleaning technique by using the cyclone bailer tool combined with coiled tubing unit. |The global procedure of this combination involve making runs with coiled tubing and the cleaning's BHA composed of: a shoe mill, collecting chamber, a flapper valve, a bottom filter, a high torque bottom motor, and a cyclone bailer which allows, by a suction effect, catching the residuals inside the collecting chamber. Once the collecting chamber is filled with elastomers and oil residuals, the tool is taken to surface for cleaning and this process is repeated until reaching the target depth and remove all obstruction. |As a consequence of applying this technique on the four wells studied, an average overall effectiveness of 85% was achieved in clearing blockages ranging from 363-817 ft in liners from 3-1/2 to 6-5/8 in, in an average of 8 runs in 7 days operational time per job, thereby achieving full production restoration at 769 BPD, which meant an average increase of 22% above the estimated production of 630 BPD. |The result of the application of the cyclone bailer tool to remove the cumulated rubber residuals in the liner showed more effective than cleaning with jets, or conventional motors with wicks used previously, this is due to compaction and the sizes of the elastomers residuals, which in several occasions reached up to 1.5 feets in length, too big to pass by annular space between inner diameter of liner and outer diameter of coiled tubing (CT) and the debris were too heavy to be lifted using fluids energized with nitrogen. |It is important to highlight that during the first run of well intervention with this technology, no further progress was observed due to flapper valve obstruction in the BHA due to the presence of large pieces of trapped elastomer, which prevented entry of other elastomers in the collecting chamber, making it difficult to reach full capacity and thereby causing lost time in the recovery of elastomers and well cleaning, so it was decided to try changing the BHA eliminating the flapper valve to allow free passage of elastomeric rubber clippings and so achieve greater debris collection by run, thus obtaining better results in the operation, due to their compaction and maintaining a low fluid pumping rate while pulling the CT to surface to prevent their return to the well.|","wells cleaning, heavy oil",61

C., RC Tolman LLC","|A novel hydraulically-powered, Self-Reciprocating Valve Pump (SRVP) was piloted in a Western Colorado gas well for deliquification operations. The objective was to pump fluids from a deep gas well and later retrieve and redeploy the SRVP without a workover rig. This paper will describe the SRVP technology, areas of applicability, and pilot program, including the completion design, deployment/retrieval workovers, performance, teardowns, learnings, and future plans. |Gas production wells tend to load up with produced or condensed liquids that create an impediment to flow and reduce or stop gas production. Pumps are typically used when the reservoir pressure is too low for less intrusive artificial lift methods or when significant amounts of fluid must be removed. Pumps can suffer from reliability issues and considerable installation/deployment costs because a workover rig is typically required for intervention. Unfavorable producing conditions and tortuous wellbore trajectories further tend to decrease run lives. These issues can make economical hydrocarbon production impossible. The SRVP was developed to overcome these challenges. |The SRVP is installed downhole inside a concentric tubing string and is powered by injecting a high pressure fluid. The injected (power) fluid causes the SRVP to reciprocate, driving a piston pump to produce formation liquids and power fluid back to surface up the concentric string by production tubing annulus. Removal of the produced fluids decreases backpressure on the formation, enabling gas production up the casing. Because there is no mechanical linkage to surface for pump operation, the SRVP can be deployed in highly-deviated and/or small-diameter wells that standard artificial lift methods would struggle with. Additionally, the SRVP is designed to be pumped into and out of the well following initial installation, greatly reducing deployment costs. |Three industry-first SRVPs were installed consecutively in a concentric flush-joint tubing string and were powered with a compact surface pumping unit. The SRVP proved the ability to lift 20 to 40 BFPD net fluids up the concentric string by production tubing annulus from more than 12,000 ft vertical depth while gas was produced up the casing. The SRVP was retrieved and redeployed several times either hydraulically and/or with slickline. System design, operation, and performance were continuously improved through the duration of the pilot program.

The solution was developed primarily for flat circular foundation resting in clay underlain by an infinitely stiff rigid layer. Its application to offshore  jackup  foundations  operating  in  multi-layer stratigraphies needs to be examined from two aspects. Firstly, to improve positioning and extraction jackup foundations are typically conical in shape and secondly, soil is of finite stiffness. To investigate the squeezing mechanism in more detail an extensive centrifuge testing program has been conducted utilising the UWA drum centrifuge in clay with interbedded sand. High-resolution digital images are captured in flight and analysed using the PIV (particle image velocimetry) technique providing insight into the soil failure mechanisms. The centrifuge tests indicated that the bearing resistance in the top clay layer is not independent of the underlying sand and clay layers as assumed in the squeezing theory and also observed consistently in field CPT tests. It was consistently shown that the resistance of the top clay layer strongly correlates with the peak bearing capacity (qpeak) in the underlying sand layer. Complementary large deformation finite element (LDFE) analyses are conducted in soft clay overlying a rigid stratum improving on the squeezing factors adopted in Meyerhof's theory. The LDFE analyses revealed that the conical tip of spudcan foundation precludes the generation of higher resistance near the rigid base predicted by the squeezing theory. The performance of the squeezing approach shows poor performance when compared with carefully controlled centrifuge experiments. A new approach is suggested in which the bearing capacity in the top clay layer can be adequately predicted by successfully overcoming the limitations of the squeezing theory.|","squeezing,  LDFE,  clay-sand-clay,  centrifuge testing, Finite element,  spudcan,  bearing capacity",3

The keying process of SEPLA is investigated by using discrete element method. The numerical model is validated by the centrifuge model test. The results show there is a strong dependence on loss in embedment with loading eccentricity (e/B), at e/B=1.0 the loss in embedment is almost negligible, whereas at a small e/B the loss of embedment is large; the horizontal displacement of the anchor is far less than its vertical displacement. The loading velocity of keying process has impacts on embedment loss. |Introduction |The research effort, concerning anchoring systems suitable for deep water environments, has been mainly focusing on three sorts of anchors: Suction Embedded Plate Anchors (SEPLA), Vertical Loaded Anchors (VLA) and Suction caissons. The typical configuration of SEPLA is shown in Fig. 1. The common feature of SEPLA system is the utilization of a suction caisson, called follower', to embed an initially vertical plate anchor, typically inserted in a vertical slot at the follower base. When the system has reached the designed penetration depth, the plate anchor mooring line is disengaged from the follower, leaving the follower free to be retrieved and reused for the next installation. At this point, the plate anchor is embedded vertically in the seabed and mooring line attached to the embedded plate anchor is tensioned, causing the plate anchor to rotate or key' to the designed orientation that is perpendicular to the direction of mooring line.

A multidisciplinary approach was successfully rationalized and implemented to capture 3D formation properties, hydraulic-fracture propagation and interaction with a discrete-fracture network (DFN), reservoir production/depletion, and evolution of magnitude and azimuth of in-situ stresses by use of a 3D finite-element model (FEM). |The integrated workflow begins with a geocellular model constructed by use of 3D seismic data, publicly available stratigraphic correlations from offset-vertical-pilot wells, and openhole-well-log data. The 3D seismic data were also used to characterize the spatial variability of natural-fracture intensity and orientation to build the DFN model. A recently developed complex fracture model was used to simulate the hydraulic-fracture network created with typical Eagle Ford pumping schedules. The initial production/depletion of the primary well was simulated by use of a state-of-the-art unstructured grid reservoir simulator and known Eagle Ford shale pressure/volume/temperature (PVT) data, relative permeability curves, and pressure-dependent fracture conductivity. The simulated 3D reservoir pressure field was then imported into a geomechanical FEM to determine the spatial/temporal evolution of magnitude and azimuth of the in-situ stresses. |Importing the simulated pressure field into the geomechanical model proved to be a critical step that revealed a significant coupling between the simulated depletion caused by the primary well and the morphology of the simulated fractures within the adjacent infill well. The modeling workflow can be used to assess the effect of interwell interferences that may occur in a shale field development, such as fracture hits on adjacent wells, sudden productivity losses, and dramatic pressure/rate declines. The workflow addresses the complex challenges in field-scale development of shale prospects, including infilling and refracturing programs. |The fundamental importance of this work is the ability to model pressure depletion and associated stress properties with respect to time (time between production of the primary well and fracturing of the infill well). The complex interaction between stress reduction, stress anisotropy, and stress reorientation with the DFN will determine whether newly created fractures propagate toward the parent well or deflect away. The technique should be implemented in general development strategies, including the optimization of infilling and refracturing programs, child well lateral spacing, and control of fracture propagation to minimize undesired fracture hits or other interferences.|","Fracture hit, Interwell fracturing interference, Geomechanical finite-element model",21

Recent advances have shown that microfracturing can help improve reservoir management by guiding well placement, optimizing injection rates, and managing perforation strategy. |Microfracturing consists of isolating small test intervals in a well between inflatable packers, increasing the pressure until a small fracture forms and then by conducting a few injection and shut-in cycles, extend the fracture beyond the influence of the wellbore. Results show that direct stress measurements can be successfully acquired at multiple intervals in a few hours and the vertical scale nearly corresponds to electric log resolution. Therefore, microfracture testing, generally performed in a pilot/vertical well, is an appropriate choice for calibrating log-derived geomechanical models and obtaining a complete, accurate, and precise vertical stress profile. |This paper describes the microfracturing process and presents several examples that led to increased hydrocarbon recovery by efficient stimulation and/or completion design. Case studies presented include optimizing hydraulic fracturing in unconventional reservoirs (Delaware Basin, USA), determining safe waterflood injection rates in brownfields (Offshore UK), and helping improve perforation placement in ultradeepwater reservoirs. |Introduction |Hydraulic fracturing has changed the landscape of hydrocarbon production and reservoir dynamics, especially in unconventional reservoirs, and has also proved very successful in conventional reservoirs, but “getting it right” can still be very challenging for profitable production. Some important factors for success are ensuring optimum lateral landing placement and having accurate and sufficient knowledge of the stress profile across the reservoir.

The paper has not been peer reviewed. |In organic shales, hydraulic fracturing is important for optimizing the production of horizontal wells. For a standalone lateral, the propped surface should be maximized to increase production. In the case of a pad, well spacing is an additional factor. Competition for production between laterals of a given pad should be minimized and is the result of both well spacing and hydraulic-fracture design. A numerical model coupling an explicit description of the hydraulic-fracture geometry and reservoir simulation is proposed to evaluate production interference. |Introduction |Well Spacing. One of the more critical questions that any asset team must consider concerns well spacing when designing the development plan for a new field. Well spacing defines the total number of wells, the drilling and completion schedule, and the field-production curve. The ultimate decision relies on economic analysis, balancing the expected ultimate recovery against capital and operational expenditures. |This work focuses on methods to evaluate different well spacing and on how to reduce the range of uncertainty in the development of the Vaca Muerta play. |Well-Spacing Evaluation. Well spacing depends on geomechanics, petrophysics, stimulation design, hydraulic-fracture geometry, and reservoir fluids. These factors are combined by use of numerical simulation to study their effects on the well spacing. The following are some of the methods that are applied to define possible well spacing. |Analogs. Using analog methods requires an older field already in development with similar rock and fluid quality, structural complexity, well architecture, and hydraulic-fracture stimulation. The analog approach leads to large uncertainties if any of these parameters are not within the same range or if the older analog field does not have sufficient statistical representation. |Simple Reservoir Description Without Explicit Hydraulic-Fracture Description. |The first step in simulation is to start with a simple reservoir description in which each property is uniform (porosity, permeability, and fluid saturations). The reservoir model is then coupled with an analytical or numerical production simulator. This kind of approach is appropriate for a field with minimal information. The hydraulic fractures are represented as parallel planes that intersect the wellbore. Hydraulic-fracture properties are kept constant over their whole surface and along the lateral.|",,13

(2004) described three zones at the edge of steam chambers on the basis of drainage conditions: drained, partially drained, and undrained. In the drained zone, the pore pressure is controlled by injection pressure, and fluid mobility within this region is sufficient to drain additional pore pressures because of shear dilation and pore-fluid thermal expansion. The undrained zone lies beyond the partially drained zone and extends to virgin reservoir far beyond the chamber. In this zone shearing behaves under undrained conditions; by this, Li et al. (2004) mean no volume change occurs but shear lead to changes in pore pressure. Li et al. (2004) proposed that the boundaries of these zones are dependent on bitumen viscosity, which relates to the temperature distribution beyond the steam interface. Because drained/undrained conditions affect the geomechanics at the edge of the chamber, we investigate whether the assumption of Li et al. (2004) that there is no volume change within the sheared zone is correct and is supported by field data. Here, we establish the physics associated with the undrained zone at the edge of steam-assisted gravity-drainage steam chamber and explore the pressure front vs. temperature front of different oil-sand field projects. The results reveal that the drained zone governed by pressure-front advancement is greater in extent than the sheared zone. The thermodynamics of the undrained zone are discussed to derive a new theory for mechanothermal phenomena at the edge of the chamber. The results from the theory show that the drained zone extends beyond the temperature front and thus, from a geomechanical point of view, the system solely consists of the drained and partially drained zones.|","internal energy, undrained condition, strain energy, heat transfer, geomechanics",31

The work flow estimates a pixel-based radial distribution of water saturation and porosity extending several feet into the formation at each log depth. Radial changes in saturation and porosity are caused by mud-filtrate invasion and mechanical damage, respectively. The flexural-wave and array-induction data have similar multiple investigation depths extending several feet into the formation. Furthermore, flexural-wave data are sensitive to porosity but have weak sensitivity to saturation, whereas induction data are sensitive to both porosity and saturation. Thus, integration of these data in a joint inversion can help to characterize the formation beyond the altered zone and reduce uncertainty of the interpretation. The work flow is validated on synthetic data for several scenarios of near-wellbore alteration.

Although, it was demonstrated that LSF is an efficient IOR method for many sandstone reservoirs, the potential of LSF in carbonate reservoirs is still not well-established because only a limited number of successful coreflood experiments are available in the literature. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the oil-recovery improvement by LSF in carbonate reservoirs by performing coreflood experiments. |This paper proposes an experimental approach to qualitatively evaluate the potential of LSF to improve oil recovery and alter the rock wettability during coreflood experiments. The corefloods were conducted on core plugs from two Middle Eastern carbonate reservoirs with a wide variation of rock properties and reservoir conditions. Seawater (SW) and several dilutions of formation brine and SW were flooded in the tertiary mode to evaluate their impacts on oil recovery compared with formation-brine injection. In addition, a geochemical study was performed with PHREEQC software (Parkhurst and Appelo 1999) to assess the potential of calcite dissolution by LSF. |The experimental results confirmed that lowering the water salinity can alter the rock wettability toward more water-wet, causing improvement of oil recovery in tertiary waterflood in plugs from the two reservoirs. Furthermore, SW is more-favorable for improved oil recovery than formation brine because injection of SW after formation brine resulted in extra oil production. This demonstrates that the brine composition plays an important role during waterflooding in carbonate reservoirs, and not only the brine salinity. It was also observed that oil recovery can be improved by injection of brines that cannot dissolve calcite on the basis of the geochemical modeling study. This implies that calcite dissolution is not the dominant mechanism of IOR by LSF. |To conclude, this paper demonstrates that LSF has a good potential as an IOR technology in carbonate reservoirs. In addition, the proposed experimental approach ensures the verification of LSF effect, either it is positive or negative. However, further research is required to explore the optimum salinity and composition and the most-influential parameters affecting LSF response.|","calcite dissolution, carbonate, improved oil recovery  , coreflood protocol, low salinity water",60

However, it has been the observation of the authors that interference is often inferred without direct evidence of its occurrence, or without an understanding of the various mechanisms of interference. Some common discussions on interference among engineers refer to fracture “hits” and fracture-fluid production that suddenly appears at offset producing wells. These are indications of communication, but do not necessarily imply that a strong connection will be maintained throughout the life of the wells. |This paper presents a rigorous procedure for correctly identifying interference by use of data acquired during a typical multiwell-pad-production scheme. First, the various mechanisms of interference are defined. Next, analytical simulations are run to reveal the expected behavior for interference through fractures and reservoir matrix. Data provided from an eight-well pad in the Horn River basin are then scoured, revealing evidence of interference between at least two wells. Through this exercise, a procedure is developed for identifying interference by searching for changes in buildup trends while wells are staggered on/off production. Finally, the data are history matched with numerical models to confirm the interference mechanism. |The procedure in this paper is designed to help production analysts diagnose interference and avoid common pitfalls.

Axial alignment refers to the special case where the borehole axis is the existing common interface of all planes defined by the fracture faces. The solution uses a familiar load decomposition and coordinate-transform scheme.

Despite remarkable efforts on the physics of foamy oil flow, the mechanics of its flow through porous media is not properly understood yet. This is mainly because of lack of detailed experimental studies at the core scale to clarify the physics of the process and to support numerical-modeling studies. One also should test foamy-oil flow for different types of EOR gases dissolved and evolved at different conditions under pressure depletion. The objective of the present work is to perform detailed laboratory experiments on foamy-oil flow through porous media. Pressure/ volume/temperature (PVT) studies were conducted to determine the actual pressure ranges in the coreflooding experiments in the beginning. After dissolving different gases in dead oil at 400 psi for methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) and 112 psi for propane, the oil was injected into a sandpack to saturate it. The solution-gas-drive test was started by opening the outlet valve of the coreholder after reaching equilibrium. To mimic typical post-CHOP EOR conditions with methane, propane, or CO2 injection, the pressure was kept high (400 psi for CO2 and CH4 and 112 psi for propane). The produced oil by solution-gas drive and the gas evolved were monitored by collecting them in a graduated cylinder and a gas cylinder, respectively, while the pressure was recorded by an automatic data-acquisition system. The experimental data provided information about the effect of initial pressure of the depletion test in the amount of oil and gas measured as well as the visual observations of bubble characteristics of the foamy oil. Results showed that, among the three gases, CO2 is a good candidate for foamy oil.

Steven Jr., Newfield Exploration","|Summary |The importance of evaluating well productivity after hydraulic fracturing cannot be overemphasized. This has necessitated the improvement in the quality of rate and pressure measurements during flowback of multistage-fractured wells. Similarly, there have been corresponding improvements in the ability of existing transient models to interpret multiphase flowback data. However, the complexity of these models introduces high uncertainty in the estimates of resulting parameters, such as fracture pore volume (PV), half-length, and permeability. This paper proposes a two-phase tank model for reducing parameter uncertainty and estimating fracture PV independent of fracture geometry. This study starts by use of rate-normalized-pressure (RNP) plots to observe changes in fluid-flow mechanisms from multistage- fractured wells. The fracture “pressure-supercharge” observations form the basis for developing the proposed two-phase tank model. This model is a linear relationship between RNP and time, useful for interpreting flowback data in wells that show pseudosteady-state behavior (unit slope on log-log RNP plots). The linear relationship is implemented on a simple Monte Carlo spreadsheet. This is then used to estimate and conduct uncertainty analysis on effective fracture PV by use of probabilistic distributions of average fracture compressibility and gas/water saturations. Also, the proposed model investigates the contributions of various drive mechanisms during flowback (fracture closure, gas expansion, and water depletion) by use of quantitative drive indices similar to those used in conventional reservoir engineering. Application of the proposed tank model to flowback data from 15 shale-gas and tight-oil wells estimates the effective fracture PV and initial average gas saturation in the active fracture network. The results show that fracture-PV estimation is most sensitive to fracture closure compared with gas expansion and water depletion, making fracture closure the primary drive mechanism during early-flowback periods. Also, the initial average gas saturation for all wells is less than 20%. The parameters estimated from the proposed model could be used as input guides for more-complex studies (such as discrete-fracture-network modeling and transient-flowback simulation).

Innovation and advances in technology have enabled the industry to exploit lower-permeability and more-complex reservoirs around the world. Approaches such as horizontal drilling and multistage hydraulic fracturing have expanded the envelope for economic viability. However, along with enabling economic viability in new basins come new challenges. Such is the case in the Middle East and North Africa regions, where basin complexity arising from tectonics and complicated geology is creating a difficult geomechanical environment that is impacting the success of hydraulic fracturing operations in tight reservoirs and unconventional resources. The impact has been significant, including the inability to initiate hydraulic fractures, fracture placement issues, fracture connectivity limitations, casing deformation problems, and production impairment challenges. 
Completion quality (CQ) relates to the ability to generate the required hydraulic fracture surface area and sustained fracture conductivity that will permit hydrocarbon flow from the formation to the wellbore at economic rates. It groups parameters related to the in-situ state of stress (including ordering, orientation, and amount of anisotropy), elastic properties (e.g., Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio), pore pressure, and the presence of natural fractures and faults. Collectively, this group of properties impacts many key aspects determining the geometry of the fracture, particularly lateral extent and vertical containment. Heterogeneity in CQ often necessitates customizing well placement and completion designs based on regional or local variability. This customization is particularly important to address local heterogeneity in the stress state and horizontal features in the rock fabric (e.g., laminations, weak interfaces, and natural fractures) that have been identified as key contributors impacting the success of hydraulic fracture treatments. 
Given the observation that a wide range of CQ heterogeneity was creating a complex impact on hydraulic fracture performance, CQ classes were introduced to characterize the risk of developing hydraulic fracture complexity in the horizontal plane and the associated impact on well delivery and production performance. They indicate the expected hydraulic fracture geometry at a given location and are analyzed in the context of a wellbore trajectory in a given local stress state. CQ class 1 denotes locations where conditions lead to the formation of vertical hydraulic fractures, CQ class 2 denotes locations where conditions lead to the formation of a T-shaped or twist/turn in the hydraulic fracture, and CQ class 3 denotes locations where conditions lead to the formation of hydraulic fracture with predominantly horizontal components. Wellbore measurements indicate that these CQ classes can vary along the length of the wellbore, and 3D geomechanical studies indicate that they can vary spatially across a basin. By understanding this variability in CQ class, well placement and completion design strategies can be optimized to overcome reservoirheterogeneity and enable successful hydraulic fracturing in more challenging environments. 
This paper introduces the novel concept of CQ class to characterize basin complexity; shows examples of CQ class variability from around the world; and provides integrated drilling, completion, and stimulation strategies to mitigate the risks to hydraulic fracturing operations and optimize production performance.|","fracturing, stress, completion, geomechanics",14
206,207,181624-MS,Numerical Investigation of the Effect of Nonuniform Fracture Aperture of Eagle Ford Outcrop Maps on Production Performance,"Sun, Jianlei, Texas A&M University| Schechter, David, Texas A&M University| Rui, Zhenhua, Independent Project Analysis","|Nonuniform fracture aperture not only might affect initial reservoir fluids in place, but also production behavior. Previous experimental work has already demonstrated the importance of nonuniform fracture aperture on permeability and residual oil distributions. This study investigates its impact on unconventional liquid reservoirs through outcrop analysis of Eagleford maps, unstructured gridding, and reservoir simulation of hydraulically fractured horizontal wells. |Previously documented Eagleford outcrop maps are digitized as fracture patterns. Fracture networks for reservoir simulation are generated by duplicating the fracture patterns along horizontal and vertical directions. Then, in order to evaluate production performance of the complex fracture networks, unstructured gridding algorithms are developed to discretize the fractured reservoir domain. Furthermore, previously CT-measured lognormal fracture apertures are populated along each fracture. Finally, the impact of nonuniform fracture apertures on production performance is evaluated under different closure stresses and compared with corresponding uniform fracture apertures. |The complex fracture networks generated from outcrop maps show very high natural fracture density than what we usually observe in the literature about Eagle Ford formation. Fractures with nonuniform apertures show responses of finite fracture conductivity. In the early period, fracture drainage is observed around the horizontal well, even if fractures in outcrop maps are very well connected. At the later period, matrix-fracture transient flow dominates the production, showing a long tail in production rate plots. In addition, stress-dependent nonuniform fracture apertures affect cumulative oil production. The higher the closure stresses, the higher the chance the aperture decreases, and thus the lower the production performance. Moreover, when fracture mineralization is taken into account, the decrease of nonuniform apertures can bring down the cumulative oil production by almost half. Furthermore, the cumulative oil profile of nonuniform apertures is bounded by those of arithmetic and harmonic averaged apertures. Therefore, it is possible to quickly estimate well production using uniform fracture apertures that are obtained by applying averaging techniques to nonuniform apertures. |This paper proposed a workflow to simulate well production performance of Eagle Ford outcrop maps with nonuniform fracture apertures. Besides, the impact of nonuniform fracture apertures due to closure stresses and mineralization is presented together with comparisons with uniform fracture apertures.|","Reservoir Simulation, Nonuniform Fracture Aperture, Eagle Ford Outcrop Map, Production Peformance, Hydraulic Fracturing",50
207,208,181454-MS,Insights on Overflushing Strategies from a Novel Modeling Approach to Displacement of Yield-Stress Fluids in a Fracture,"Osiptsov, Andrei, Schlumberger| Zilonova, Ekaterina, Schlumberger| Boronin, Sergei, Schlumberger| Desroches, Jean, Schlumberger| Lebedeva, Natalia, Schlumberger| Willberg, Dean, Schlumberger","|Overflushing to displace the fracturing treatment away from the wellbore and into the fracture is common in multistage completions of horizontal wells in unconventional formations, but it can damage overall fracture performance by overly displacing proppant to leave the fracture unsupported or allowing gravity slumping to occur, again leaving unpropped area. A novel modeling approach was investigated to gain insight into the process and determine reliable bounds for overflushing. |From a fluid mechanics viewpoint, overflushing is displacement of a Hershel-Bulkley fluid by a power law fluid in a Hele-Shaw cell, leading to Saffman-Taylor instability at the fluids' interface. Most hydraulic fracturing simulators use power-law rheology. A novel numerical model accounting for the yield-stress behavior exhibited by proppant-laden slurries was developed using the lubrication approximation and includes transport equations for fluid volume fractions and a nonlinear elliptic equation for pressure with mixed-type boundary conditions. The pressure equation is solved with a fixed-point (Picard) iterations method, with the multigrid linear solver used at each iteration. |The model was validated against three sets of experiments in Hele-Shaw cells: gravitational slumping, displacement of Newtonian fluids with fingering, and displacement of a yield-stress fluid by a shear-thinning fluid, leading to formation of fractal fingering patterns. Good agreement is obtained. Based on fracture mechanics, we analyzed what portion of the fracture may be left unsupported before it is severely pinched during drawdown as a reliable bound for overflushing volumes. A parametric study was focused on the displacement of the yield-stress slurry by the overflushing fluid, varying overflush volume and rate and rheology contrast between slurry and displacing fluid. Qualitatively, when fingers of the overflushing fluid can be created at the overflush/slurry interface, large slurry pillars are preserved in the near-wellbore area, which may keep the fracture open; gravitational slumping is mitigated by the yield stress. Three scenarios occur, depending on slurry rheology: from slumping-dominated (low-viscosity base fluid in the slurry), through intermediate to a fingering-dominated scenario, where gravitational convection is suppressed by high viscosity of the slurry (~1 Pa s) and considerable yield stress (>1 Pa). The third scenario minimizes the geomechanical risks of overflushing by providing tiny fingers that are unlikely to be pinched out during fracture closure. |From the study, bounds for reliable overflushing are proposed, which are a lot more restrictive when the slurry base fluid does not exhibit a yield stress (e.g., for slickwater treating fluids).|","overflushing, particle transport, proppant placement, well stimulation, hydraulic fracturing",27

The workflow comprises four main steps: 1) estimating SRV and fracture parameters from surveillance microseismic interpretation and flowback data analysis; 2) comparative analysis of estimated SRV, ye and Vf values; 3) Calculating volumetric ratios (e.g. flowback load recovery) to evaluate the effectiveness of fracturing and flowback operations; and 4) investigating possible relationships between operational designs and estimated reservoir and fracture parameters. |The application of this workflow on an eight-well pad completed in the Horn River Basin (HRB) shows that the SRV and ye from microseismic interpretation are generally several times larger than those from flowback data analysis. This indicates that over half of the stimulated rock does not contribute to gas production. Besides, a large percentage of the effective fracture network closes during early-time (the first 200 hrs) flowback. The results show that SRV increases as total perforation clusters increases, and this relationship appears to be formation-dependent. Also, the estimated Vf seems to be smaller for wells that are opened later for flowback.

209,210,181410-MS,Cubic Law Evaluation Using Well Test Analysis for Fractured Reservoir Characterization,"Denetto, S., TOTAL| Kamp, A. M., TOTAL","|In fractured reservoir, the use of the so-called cubic law represents a method to describe fluid flow through fractures and to estimate effective fracture porosity from effective fracture permeability and matrix block size. The method supposes perfect fracture connectivity. In practice, however, it often underestimates field fracture porosity. This paper explores the relation between fracture porosity, fracture permeability and matrix block size using field, and in particular well test, data. |We used field data coming from four naturally fractured sand-stone reservoirs in foothills. Values of storativity ratio (?) and inter-porosity flow coefficient (?) coming from thirty-three pressure buildup derivatives interpretations are listed and used to estimate fracture porosity and matrix block size. The effective permeability associated to each well test, which is obtained from the stabilization of the pressure derivative, was also recorded. A non-linear regression was put in place in order to correlate fracture porosity, matrix block size and effective permeability. Obtained fracture porosities and block sizes are similar to values from other sources, such as thin section analysis and image log data. |The most significant finding is that field data can be correlated by introducing in the cubic law a correction parameter that increases fracture porosity by about two orders of magnitude. The reason for deviation from the theoretical cubic law can be threefold: first, the cubic law considers the entire hydraulic aperture of the fracture as contributing to the fluid flow, while in reality the flow may be hindered by presence of cement in-filling the fracture (thin section data supports this assumption); secondly, the cubic law assumes a perfectly connected fracture network, while in real cases some fractures may die out without intersecting any other fracture; thirdly, transient flow effects and distribution of block sizes may lead to a less well pronounced dip in the derivative, which may be interpreted as a larger fracture porosity when using a pseudo steady-state model for analysis. The correction parameter is likely not universal, and will depend on the degree of fracture in-fill and connectivity in a given field. |The work presented in this paper provides fracture permeability, fracture porosity, and block size estimates for the given type of environment. It issues a strong warning with respect to the application of the cubic law to estimate fracture porosity, and proposes a corrected cubic law expression that gives more accurate results. The methodology is useful for characterizing fracture porosity, a parameter that is notoriously difficult to measure.|","Fractured Reservoir, Fracture Porosity, Well Test Interpretation, Dual Medium, Fracture Permeability",14

Conventional openhole sand control techniques include stand-alone-screen (SAS), expandable screens and openhole gravel packing (OHGP). In some cases, the uniformity, size and level of compressive strength of the formation dictate the use of an OHGP completion. This has proven to be a highly effective technique and eliminates the concerns of plugging and erosion associated with a SAS. |However, an OHGP is not always feasible and/or practical for some reservoirs and geographic locations. Some of the challenges of OHGP include lack of deck space and equipment, incompatibility with annular zonal isolation tools, difficulty to gravel pack across shale zones, and unavailability of equipment or fluid design to effectively gravel pack extremely long laterals without exceeding reservoir fracture gradient. The SMP technology can fill the gaps that exist with current OHGP techniques. |The performance of the SMP centers on its inherent glass transition property. It is run into the wellbore in its compacted state and then activated to expand to the openhole size at the target depth when exposed to a catalyst. Once expanded, the SMP conforms to the sandface including washouts and any irregularities within the SMP expansion limit.

It is often reported that around 60% of hydraulic fracturing stages are ineffective. If so, it is likely that the design accuracy is limited by the current state of modeling and hydraulic fracture (HF) simulations. Our study presents a new alternative – a full 3-D simulation with geomechanics coupled to fluid flow. With the conventional simulation, it is extremely hard to model opening of weak lamination (Lam) and nearly impossible to generate induced horizontal fractures against the vertical overburden stress. However, horizontal fractures are routinely evident in shale reservoirs as healed fractures observed along the bedding planes. Hence, the need and importance of a true 3-D simulator that could incorporate complex geology and dynamically simulate fracture propagation by accounting for realtime changes in geomechanics and fluid pressures. Case study uses shale reservoirs, which are heavily laminated with complex natural fractures (NFs). Numerical simulations consisted of four separate coupled modules - geomechanics, hydrodynamics, a geomechanical joint model for interfacial resolution, and an adaptive remeshing module. Reservoir stress condition, rock mechanical properties, and injected fluid pressure dictate how fracture elements could open or slide. Critical stress intensity factor was used as a fracture criterion governing the generation of new fractures or propagation of existing fractures and their directions. Simulation was run on a Cray XC-40 HPC system. Typical laminated shale reservoirs anisotropic geomechanical properties obtained from literature were used to estimate a 3-D geomechanical model and NF network. HF geometry was significantly different in the presence of weak bedding, compared to when bedding was strong enough to transmit crack tip stresses across the interface. Significant amounts of fracturing fluid can be diverted into creation of horizontal fractures, even when the pressure was below the vertical stress, once bedding discontinuities are activated. Choices of NF network and Lam thickness significantly affected observed fracture propagation. The value of 3-D modeling was clearly established. This method provides more accurate solutions for stimulation design optimization, e.g., landing points, number of stages, number of clusters, spacing between stages, and stimulated reservoir volume.|","simulation, discrete-fracture-network, 3-D modeling, hydraulic fracturing, laminated shale",33

Realizing the potential benefits automation brings, many operators have turned to managed pressure drilling (MPD) techniques as a technical and cost-reward solution to hard-to-reach assets, an approach which not only saves time but also enhances the safety capabilities of the operation. The evolving industry shift toward MPD-ready rigs demonstrates the significant need for a reliable software system to interact with the equipment and simultaneously deliver enhanced models able to precisely control annular pressure in geological complexities where drilling windows are narrow. 
Several studies have demonstrated the operational benefits of MPD through the application of the constant bottom hole pressure (CBHP) method, imbedded automated kick detection, and control capabilities. MPD technology relies substantially on applying surface back pressure (SBP) using automated chokes to precisely control the annular pressure profile in a closed loop circulation system. During drilling, CBHP connections, mud displacements and fluid anomaly incidents, the SBP is dynamically adjusted in response to operational changes that yield annular pressure changes; such as circulation rate, top drive speed, and rate of penetration to name a few. 
The integrated MPD drilling software platform is used in combination with interactive models and surface and downhole data measurement in a unified computing system to enhance real-time analysis of drilling performance. By employing real-time models such as hydraulics, well control, pore and fracture pressure estimation, surge and swab, and drilling optimization torque and drag, the system quantifies the boundaries and aid in understanding the real operational limits. Additional software platform applications deliver the common integration baseline that enables both operations within the pre-drilling, while drilling and post analysis.

Optimization of well construction process by utilizing more economical and efficient materials can help in reducing overall well expenditure.

The development of unconventional shale gas formations in North America with horizontal multifractured wells is mature enough to identify production malpractices and abnormal productivity declines generally observed within 18 to 24 months of initial production. The primary objective of this study is to address all known causes of these productivity declines and to develop a fully coupled geomechanical-flow simulation model to simulate these production conditions. 
This model mimics the impact of depletion-induced in-situ stress variations on short-term and long-term productivity by taking into account several phenomena, such as stress-dependent matrix and natural fracture permeability as well as reduction in hydraulic fracture conductivity due to proppant crushing, deformation, embedment, and fracture-face creep. Matrix permeability evolutions, considering the conflicting effects of non-Darcy flow, and compaction, have also been accounted for in this model. Numerical solutions for simplified hydraulic fracture planar geometries are then obtained using a finite element method (FEM) scheme. 
A synthetic case was defined to investigate the effects of each individual phenomenon on short-term and long-term production. Results show that the combined effects of permeability alterations in matrix and natural fractures as well as conductivity losses in hydraulic fractures may result in substantial gas cumulative production loss. The model also reproduces familiar field-observed trends, with lower long-term production corresponding to higher and higher drawdowns. This behavior is attributed to the stress-dependent evolution of reservoir permeability and hydraulic fracture conductivity. The results conclude that ignoring impacts of any of the above phenomena results in overestimation of ultimate recovery. Furthermore, it is shown that proper management of pressure drawdown and the penalty for lower initial production rates in unconventional shale gas reservoirs can yield substantially higher ultimate recovery. 
The model is fully versatile and allows modeling and characterization of all profoundly different (on a petrophysical level) shale gas formations as well as proppant materials utilized for the stimulation treatments. This integrated model can be used for optimization of key parameters during the hydraulic fracture design, for fine-tuning production history matching, and, especially, as a predictive tool for pressure drawdown management.|","Pressure Drawdown Management, Shale Gas Formations, Fractured Horizontal Wells",31

The determination of the preferential flow direction in a reservoir becomes a very important subject for the development of an oilfield, especially for the selection of the optimum exploitation strategy taking into account that porous media is a very complex environment in which representing the flow behavior of fluids becomes a tough task, mainly in carbonates where the distribution of fractures, lithology changes and diagenesis play a major role in this topic. 
Naturally Fractured Reservoirs (NFR) represent a great technical challenge for the petroleum industry because they behave as a heterogeneous medium with a strong influence of diagenesis, a term that encompasses fractures, dissolution, compaction, dolomitization, cementation and recrystallization to conform a reservoir with totally different distribution of properties. The dynamic data must be evaluated in order to match with the static model achieving a good reservoir characterization. 
In this paper we present a way to determine the preferential flow direction by the monitoring of the field through permanent real-time downhole gauges that allowed the identification of the interference between wells in a deep naturally fractured reservoir that originally did not show any degree of communication. Suddenly, after some producing time, the field demonstrated a great level of interference among wells and as a consequence, the determination of the preferential flow direction was possible through Pressure Transient Analysis (PTA) and Rate Transient Analysis (RTA).

Rospo Mare is a heavy oil fractured karstic carbonate reservoir producing since the 80's. Reservoir pressure is constant due to a strong aquifer tilted toward north east. The producing wells are systematically operated at critical rate to prevent water production (no water treatment installation). The paper is focused on the modeling of the fractures and the karst system in conjunction with an innovative history match approach used to match the forced anhydrous oil production and to represent the complex water position and behavior through time. 
As the main fracturing phase of Rospo Mare reservoir occurred before the karstification phase, the dissolution of the carbonates was guided by the existing fracture network. The karst system and the fracture network were modeled together thanks to a fracture model that includes several enlarged fracture sets and lineaments. The fracture modeling was also guided by the relative compactness of the matrix facies distribution. Because of limited data for fracture characterization, the dynamic characteristics of fractures, particularly the aperture of enlarged fractures, were fully considered as history match parameters. The history match approach consisted in using both the historical oil production and the prediction period to make sure that the wells were producing at their critical rate and ensure a realistic displacement of water at both field and well levels. This unusual strategy was necessary because of lack of data to constrain history match (no water and gas production, no pressure variation). 
Therefore the history match was performed by taking into account the prediction period through a do nothing case scenario. Based on the assumption of critical rate, a decline of the oil production rate is expected during the prediction period. This allowed assessing the vicinity of water at wells: both the rise of the water table and the coning effect at wells. The matched model successfully honors the water displacement and position at key wells including the last two side tracks drilled in 2012. The model allows a good representation of the reservoir physical behavior and provides a useful tool for piloting the field and assisting future decisions.|","karstic fractured reservoir, under constrained history match, critical rate, water displacement, forecasts",27

Existing commercial simulators, such as CMG, ECLIPSE and VIP, have been widely used in the past several decades for their robust performance in computing and scaling. In these reservoir simulators, the fluid flow models are based on Darcy's law or its extended form; the volume of the adsorbed phase or component is overlooked as well. While this is acceptable for conventional oil/gas reservoirs or chemical flooding reservoirs, the gas flow regimes such as slippage flow, transition flow, and molecular-free flow significantly is deviated from Darcy flow for shale gas reservoirs. Besides, a large portion of the gas is stored in the pore in the form of adsorbed gas. If the volume of the adsorbed gas is still overlooked, the volume of free gas and original gas in place (OGIP) will be seriously overestimated. For the above reasons, it is commonly thought that existing commercial simulators could not be ideally used to simulate the development of shale gas reservoirs. Hence, it is desirable to attain a feasible approach to correct the petro-physical properties of shale gas effectively within the commercial simulators, in order that one can use them to accurately simulate the development of shale gas reservoirs. In this paper, we first derived the correction formulas for the bulk porosity, free gas saturation, and connate water saturation used for correcting the disregarded volume of adsorbed gas in commercial simulators. Then, we derived the models of permeability and porosity multipliers in matrix considering gas adsorption/desorption, geomechanics, non-Darcy flow regimes, and diffusion of adsorbed layer. Finally, the above models were used to attain the corrected petro-physical properties for simulating gas production based on the practical properties of shale gas reservoirs using commercial simulators. The validation was performed by comparing the simulation results of commercial simulator with the published mechanism simulator using gas field data. The results show that the simulation results using commercial simulator achieve good agreement with the published mechanism simulator with the corrected petro-physical properties. The corrections of bulk porosity, connate water saturation, and free gas saturation are very essential. The correction formulas for these properties can largely decreases the error of OGIP and the calculated gas production. Both permeability and porosity multipliers are the functions of gas pressure, but they are not a monotone decreasing/increasing function. The gas production may be significantly overestimated or underestimated without consideration of these characteristics of shale gas in different fields. The contributions of different mechanisms are also demonstrated using the commercial simulator. This work can evently solve the issue that existing commercial simulators cannot accurately simulate shale gas production. The researchers can easily use these commercial simulators with these corrected formulas, which is a great progress for modeling the development of shale gas reservoir.|","petro-physical properties, shale gas, numerical simulation, commercial simulator, correction model",46

In the quest to achieve higher production, extended reach drilling (ERD) wells are planned to be drilled in the Bassein cluster, offshore India, threatened by high risk of wellbore stability after severe hole problems drilling low-angle exploration and appraisal wells. The key to successful drilling is to predict optimal mud weight windows for safe and stable ERD wells with a casing plan to drill the critical buildup section from 30° to 75° through overlying shales. The in-situ stress profile is built and further calibrated with closure pressures obtained during extended leakoff tests and stress testing with the modular formation dynamics tester. Rock mechanical properties are estimated to history match actual failures with predicted failures using the geomechanical model and mud weight used while drilling. 
Reported cavings and stuck tool incidents in shale formations are at depth intervals where the estimated breakout mud limit exceeds the mud weight used during drilling of offset wells. There is variation of rock elastic properties like Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio with direction in shale. Intermediate lower-strength coal and shale layers are seen in the Panna sandstone against overgauged hole condition observed in offset wells. Stable mud weights to avoid breakouts are in range of 11.6 to 12.5 ppg depending on well azimuth and deviation across different shale layers. Variations in minimum stable mud weight are in the range of 0.3 to 0.5 ppg based on well azimuth with reference to minimum horizontal stress direction from same platform. Even with depletion of 1.2 ppg in hydrostatic limestone, the minimum mud weight required to safely drill the horizontal section is 8.7 to 8.9 ppg due to lower- strength layers. Well deviation should remain same in the 12.25-in. section to avoid hole cleaning issues in shale. The breakout-mud loss window varies between 1.3 and 1.8 ppg at high well deviation in the 12.25-in. section. The 20-in. casing shoe plan was modified by setting deeper by 100 to 150 m to obtain a higher mud weight window. Lower core recovery at the top of the target limestone reservoir coincides with overgauged hole conditions seen across all offset wells. The local normal fault regime identified against regional strike-slip geological setting. 
The modifications resulted in significant reduction of nonproductive time with no lost-in-hole incidents and time savings of 1 week on each ERD well compared to offset wells. The good hole condition made it possible to acquire formation pressure measurements across the field to update the reservoir model and understand the structural connectivity of different target layers.|","stress direction, anisotropy, Breakouts",12
223,224,181395-MS,Comparative Analysis of Various Failure Theories for Borehole Breakout Predictions,"Morita, Nobuo, Texas A&M University| Nagano, Yu, Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation","|Numerous papers have been published for predicting the borehole breakout problems (McLean 1990; Zoback 2007; Ewy 1999). The original theory proposed by Zoback (Zoback 2007) used the Mohr-Coulomb failure theory with a linear elastic stress strain relation. Initially, it was applied to igneous rocks and large diameter boreholes. With these original applications, the linear Mohr-Coulomb theory predicted the breakout width within a reasonable accuracy. Recently, the applications have been expanded to breakout problems for shales, mudstones and sandstones. However, there are some drawbacks. For sedimentary rock applications, the Mohr-Coulomb failure theory significantly over-predicts the breakout width. In addition, strong rocks show significant non-linearity before failure, hence, we need to artificially increase unconfined rock strength (UCS) and friction angle. The theoretical breakout width cannot be matched with the breakout width observed from the image logs unless these adjustments are made. Using the image logs and the rock strength measurements obtained from several fields, comparative analyses were conducted for various failure theories with linear and non-linear stress strains. These failure theories include Mohr-Coulomb, Drucker-Prager, Lade, Modified-Lade, Mogi and critical plastic strain. The authors also compared linear and non-linear stress strain theories. The authors estimated the increase in UCS necessary to match the breakout widths observed from the image logs obtained from several fields. The authors utilized caliper logs to compare the breakout depths as well. |The results show that if a linear stress strain relation is used, UCS must be increased artificially by 1.09-2.25 times. This increase is as much as 2.25 times for the Mohr-Coulomb failure theory. On the other hand, if a non-linear stress strain relation is used, no artificial increase is necessary except for the Mohr-Coulomb failure theory. In addition, the effects of temperature change and shale swelling are varied depending on the failure theories. These effects are supposed to de-stabilize the boreholes. Interestingly, the borehole stability differs depending on the failure theory used. Moreover, the actual breakout depths are always deeper than those predicted with a linear stress strain theory while they are shallower than those predicted by a slip line failure theory. |This paper compares the merits and demerits of each failure theory when applied to borehole breakout problems. Many triaxial tests were conducted to determine the stress strain and failure envelopes. The predicted breakout widths were compared with the measured breakout widths from the image logs. This kind of comprehensive evaluation (theoretical, experimental and field analyses) has not been performed in previous studies.|","borehole stability, rock failure theories, borehole breakout",11

Permeability is one of the most important parameters in formation evaluation, reservoir characterization, and hydrocarbon production. There are many methods in the industry to model in-situ permeability, but it is also critical to know that permeability decreases with the increase of effective stress as has been reported in many case studies i.e. permeability is sensitive to changes in stress and pore pressure. In this study, a relationship between permeability, porosity, velocity and effective horizontal stress is developed for carbonate reservoirs using both core and field data. 
In-situ horizontal stress is related to permeability for several reservoirs around the globe. This paper addresses fundamental controls on stress dependent permeability, as identified through analysis of core samples. The model developed provides a description of effective stress and explains the dynamic impact of geomechanical stresses on key production parameters in an effective way. This will lead to a more robust simulation model and history match for the life of the reservoir. 
Core plug samples from carbonate formation were tested for conventional measurement (porosity, permeably, and grain density), while acoustic slowness is obtained by wireline and/or LWD measurement to create empirical correlations between permeability, porosity, velocity and effective stress. The correlations show a good agreement with available data that are commonly used in the industry for carbonate. 
The developed workflow is presented to improve evaluation and enhance the productivity and management of stress-dependent reservoir, also predict sweet spots, optimize completion and predict production that will help in the development of both conventional and unconventional reservoirs.|","Stress dependent Permeability, Carbonates, Permeability, Formation Evaluation, Effective Stress",37

Waterless fracturing for shale gas exploitation with supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) is effective and environment-friendly, which has become an international fascinating research topic. The formers mainly focus on the chemical and physical properties, and microstructure of sandstone, carbonate and shale caprock, rather than the properties of shale gas formation. And the macroscale mechanical properties and nanoscale fracture characteristics of Wufeng shale under scCO2 conditions (above 31.8 °C and 7.29 MPa) is still not clear. |Methods, Procedures, Process. To study multiscale change characteristics of shale under scCO2 condition, the Chinese Wufeng shale crops (upper Ordovician formation) is obtained from Yibin, Sichuan Basin, China. Firstly, SEM and XRD are taken to study the original microstructure and mineral content of shale. Then, triaxial tests with controlled coring angles and gas conditions (immersed scCO2 and N2 for 10 hours) have been carried out on shale f25 <U+00D7> 50 mm cylindrical specimens for the objective of studying macro mechanical change of Wufeng shale. In addition, SEM and XRD are also conducted after the triaxial tests. |Results, Observations, Conclusions. Some results are concluded as follow. (1) In the SEM figures, the Group 2 (after testing) are similar to the original ones: the tight bedding planes and undamaged minerals (with sharp edges and smooth surfaces) are found in Group 1 (before testing) and Group 2 (before and after testing), which indicating that the triaxial test with N2 can't damage the microstructures of shale. (2) However, the microstructures in Group 1 SEM figures (after testing) are quite different than the others: the bedding planes are damaged, which lefts some connectivity micro-fractures and corrosion holes; the minerals are broken into lots of small debris and left some uneven mineral surfaces. That demonstrates the scCO2 can change the microstructures and make some minerals (e.g. calcite) fracture more easily. (3) A relative content reduction of calcite, dolomite and pyrite have been found in Group 1, significantly. (4) The scCO2 reduce the triaxial compressive strength of shale with a decline of 3.82% to 19.38%. (5) huger fractures in macroscale have been found in the specimens of Group 1, scCO2 and bedding plane lead to the diversities of failure modes. |Novel/Additive Information. The multiscale physical and chemical changes of shale under scCO2 are essential for scCO2 fracturing, scCO2 jet breaking rock and the geological storage of CO2. The complex microscale fractures, the macro decrease of strength in shale are helpful to the seepage and gathering of shale gas, and finally enhance the shale gas recovery.|","triaxial compression experiment, multiscale characteristics, Chinese Wufeng shale, microstructure, supercritical carbon dioxide",24

Issues related to drilling dynamics have varied widely among rigs, even among those that are in the same field and that have the same equipment and specifications. The standard answer has been that drilling is different on the ‘other side of the road, river, or anticline', or that one rig crew is better than the other. While there are significant differences in the drilling environment and between crews, recognition of the effects of the control systems employed can explain many of these differences and expand the tools and techniques available to improve drilling performance and reduce dysfunctions.

Development plans in largely depleted carbonate gas bearing reservoirs are dependent upon having a complete understanding of reservoir mechanical behavior under change of in-situ stress state. The accuracy of 3D geomechanical models relies highly upon proper tectonic strain and stress calibration using in situ straddle packer microfrac testing conducted in vertical pilot wellbores. Pipe-conveyed straddle packer microfrac tests have become an important technology to measure in-situ fracture closure stress in depleted and non-depleted reservoir layers in order to quantify the stress contrast among multiple intervals with different reservoir pressure regimes. 
This case study describes the use of microfrac tests to validate and calibrate the horizontal stress profile in various reservoir intervals of a carbonate formation that had been developed to a substantially depleted condition. Well-injection plans, cap-rock integrity assessment, stress contrast, hydraulic fracture containment, and minimum horizontal stress estimations can all be quantified from multiple microfrac tests recorded at various depths of the reservoir formation. The fracture closure analysis was conducted using three different methods: (i) square-root of time, (ii) G-function and (iii) Log-Log plot. The final fracture closure measurement was obtained after consolidating the three fracture closure identification methods in all injecting cycles conducted on each microfrac station. 
The integrated post job microfrac analysis includes borehole acoustic processing and resistivity imaging. The borehole acoustic response is used to estimate not only formation mechanical properties but also log-derived stress profiles while borehole Imaging is used to select the microfrac points and to confirm the induced borehole fracture created during the pressurization of the straddle packer tool. Formation breakdown, fracture reopening, propagation and closure at multiple reservoir layers provide the necessary in situ measurements to calibrate the stresses change due to pore pressure depletion. This information provides a better understanding of the in situ stress state in depleted formations that reduce risk in designing future gas development strategies in the field.|","Tectonic calibration, Depleted Reservoirs, Microfrac Testing, Carbonate Reservoirs, In-situ Stress",13

This paper presents a coupled reservoir-geomechanics model with multi-phase fluid flow for sand production prediction in a weakly consolidated formation. Sanding criteria are based on a combination of tensile and shear failure from Mohr-Coulomb theory and strain-hardening/softening. Once the failure criteria are met, an algorithm for entrainment of the sand based on the calculation of hydrodynamic and other forces is implemented to predict sand erosion. The flow of two immiscible slightly compressible fluids coupled with geomechanics has also been modeled. This allows us to account for relative permeabilities and capillary pressure dependent cohesion and rock residual strength. 
The onset of sanding and the sand production rate have both been simulated for open-hole and cased-hole completions under different flow conditions. The model utilizes a dynamic mesh which removes the grid blocks of sand that have failed and meet the erosion criteria. This allows the proper boundary condition to be applied to the sand face as sand is continuously produced. Good agreement with experimental observations is obtained for both the onset of sand production and the rate of sand production when simulations are conducted for open-hole completions. The post-failure elasto-plastic properties of the sand are seen to play an important role in determining the extent of sand production and the shape of the cavity created. In addition, the effect of wellbore pressure drop rate, controlled by choke adjustment, has been studied on the sanding risk. Multi-phase fluid flow effects, including relative permeability and capillary cohesion, are also shown to significantly impact the sand production.|","3-D, mechanical failure and erosion, multi-phase, sand production, capillary cohesion",61

Dahi, Louisiana State University","|Stimulated shale wells show sharp decline rates after several months of production imposing the need for rejuvenating production via re-fracturing or other methods. The sharp decline in production from shale gas/oil wells is attributed to full or partial closure and damage of the induced fracture network within the rock. The poor economic conditions stirred by low oil prices has persuaded operators to consider re-fracturing as an affordable option but the mechanisms behind this technique is not fully understood. In this paper, we utilize a fully coupled model to understand stress re-distribution and identify different modes of fracture closure during production from initial hydraulic fractures. Rock creep, proppant failure and differential fluid depletion are identified as primary causes of closure within shale fracture networks. We incorporate these phenomena into a poroelaso-plastic model that simulates fracture conductivity evolution during production, and re-fracturing treatments illustrated by re-fracture propagation, fracture coalesce or fracture extension along pre-existing fractures. This methodology provides a realistic initial condition to simulate varying re-fracture designs - different treatment schedules and fracturing fluids. The Influence of degradable mechanical and non-mechanical diverters is also incorporated in this model. |Our results reveal major stress redistribution in the fracture network especially at the intersections due to depletion. The results show how fracture closure at the fracture intersections causes abrupt or time dependent shrinkage of the drainage area. Under certain conditions, re-fracturing may effectively open up these bottlenecks while in extreme situations, it creates new fractures which reorient obliquely. Results also reveal the role of in-situ stress anisotropy, magnitude of depletion and complexity of fracture networks in the successful re-fracturing of lower- clay content naturally fractured formations such as the Barnett shale. The results do not suggest strong dependency on stress anisotropy and natural fractures orientation in high clay content reservoir rocks like Haynesville or Marcellus. It shows the quantifiable effect of creep on closure rate and conductivity loss. Results show diverters have a profound effect on the expansion of the re-fracture network, although it hinders reactivation of some clogged fractures. Using adaptive cohesive elements provides the opportunity to model longitudinal, transverse or oblique re-fracture propagation. |The Proposed model introduces a realistic fracture closure mechanism and stress re- distribution during drainage, prior to re-fracturing. This plays a vital role in explaining initial fracture extension, re-frac propagation, fracture coalesce, re-fracture re-orientation, and therefore the effectiveness of re-fracturing treatments. This model offers a practical tool for identifying potentially successful re-fracturing candidates.|","Natural Fractures, Rock Creep, Poroelasticity, Fracture Closure, Re-fracturing",17

Integrated modelling is of paramount importance while determining optimum development plans for any asset, especially for high-stakes offshore plays. It can be used for generating reliable reserve estimates and short to long-term forecasts. However, performing such studies has been a difficult proposition for the petroleum industry. 
A number of logistical and technical challenges are present for any integrated modelling project. The logistical challenges appear because of multiple engineers working on multiple tools for different parts of the modelling work. The lack of timely feedback between teams often leads to the forecasts being unreliable. Moreover, several different tools and models need to be maintained for various disciplines and for different stages of asset development – presenting training and staffing issues. 
The technical challenges appear because of missing features in current tools. For example, it is common in the current workflow to see discontinuities across the use of various model fidelities. This deficiency can be seen in the application of reservoir models, where complex reservoir structures and processes are described in standalone reservoir forecasts by refined discrete models (particularly for long-term forecasts and reserve estimates) and in integrated forecasts by material balance tank models (typically used for short- to medium-term forecasting). The latter approach is often not suitable for making longer-term forecasts, yet the current tools fail to suggest when such simplifications lead to significant errors. Furthermore, in assets with multiple reservoirs and complicated fluid blending in the production facilities, the traditional modelling approach may lack the required physics to adequately model operational constraints or perform allocations. Lastly, an end-to-end uncertainty and optimization framework is generally missing in the conventional approach, particularly where decisions are being made on the integrated production system. As a result, while users can often explore uncertainties and design decisions within the scope of their particular discipline, a coherent, integrated picture is difficult and often impractical to pull together. 
In this paper, an innovative solution to the above mentioned problems is discussed. For demonstration purposes, a synthetic asset model has been developed, which represents a complicated deepwater asset. The asset has two heterogeneous reservoirs, with unique and complex fluids, such that modelling should account for fluid blending in the shared production network. A multi-user, multi-discipline, multi-fidelity tool is used that allows for collaboration and sharing of data between reservoir, production, and geomechanics engineers through a relational database. Multiple fidelities are used in the reservoir, wells, production network and geomechanics, with lower fidelity proxies typically being automatically generated from the more rigorous corresponding model – allowing for an easy-to-use, consistent and fit-for-purpose integration of model components. Even so, the adequacy of lower fidelity models is ensured by quick and easy comparisons with high fidelity models. All the relevant physics are modelled for a gas re-injection project, system bottlenecks are identified, and reliable short, medium and long-term forecasts are created using a consistent modelling approach. Forecasts are optimized for production, and valuation of forecast options including the timing and design of in-field drilling and compression upgrades are considered within the stochastic uncertainty of the dynamic reservoir models.|","Offshore, Gas re-injection, complex fluid blending, Integrated Production Modeling, simulation",35

Having the means to efficiently evaluate different forms of artificial lift early in the planning cycle significantly improves the ability to influence other planning decisions (well count, well design, facility capacities etc.) and to realise the potential upsides made available by new artificial lift technologies. Artificial lift screening involves evaluating multiple criteria including rate, well design, cost, reliability, environmental impact, flow assurance, solids handling, operability etc. This paper focusses on a fit-for-purpose methodology to evaluate well production performance for a wide range of artificial lift techniques including Electric Submersible Pumps, Gas Lift, Sucker Rod Pumps, Progressing Cavity Pumps, Jet Pumps, Hydraulic Submersible Pumps and Hydraulic Piston Pumps. The five important attributes of the methodology presented are:  
Consistency: To ensure a fair comparison is made when evaluating each lift technique, the same assumptions about reservoir performance, fluid properties, multi-phase flow behaviour, geomechanics etc. are used. 
Auditability: Later in the development planning process, decisions and assumptions will inevitably change, and it is important that there is a proper audit trail regarding how artificial lift screening had been performed to help understand the potential impact of these changes. 
Efficiency: Early in the field planning cycle, many alternative well counts, well designs and facility configurations will be under evaluation, and assumptions about reservoir and fluid properties will be changing as new data become available. It is therefore important that the artificial lift screening method can be readily applied to accommodate the many scenarios. 
Technical Rigour: While detailed artificial lift design is not required (or desired) at the screening stage, it is important that the screening methodology applies a fit-for-purpose level of technical rigour to ensure reliable results are achieved and opportunities are not missed through the misapplication of various industry ‘rules of thumb’. 
Vendor Independence: While sufficient industry research is required to understand the available technologies and new innovations, the screening process should be independent of any particular equipment vendor to prevent any undue bias. |The well performance calculations use a nodal analysis approach to develop inflow and outflow curves at the depth of the artificial lift equipment. Then, using knowledge of the fundamental operating principals of the artificial lift techniques, calculations are performed to determine the range of production rates achievable based on constraints including power, flow capacity and gas handling ability. 
The paper will also present a range of real field cases where these screening calculations have been applied to deep water subsea, onshore conventional and coalbed methane (CBM) developments.|","Well Performance, Screening, Selection, ESP PCP JP HSP HPP SRP, Artificial Lift",39

This paper presents an anomalous diffusion based approach for modeling two-phase oil/water flow in fractured nanoporous media, such as that encountered in unconventional oil and gas reservoirs. Production is assumed to be from a multiply fractured horizontal well and the focus of the discussions is 1D linear flow in the region between hydraulic fractures. To account for the complexity and heterogeneity of the fractured medium, anomalous diffusion is considered in the flow domain between hydraulic fractures. To do so, the conventional Darcy phase fluxes are replaced by more general fractional flux laws which incorporate the non-local and hereditary nature of flow by means of fractional space-time phase and capillary pressure gradients. A modified IMPES scheme is derived for linear oil/water flow under specified terminal pressure production, and the impact of sub- and super-diffusion on phase rates, as well as pressure and saturation distributions across the system is studied.|","Heterogeneous Nanoporous Formation, Fractured Horizontal Wells, Multiphase Flow, Anomalous Diffusion",45

Thus, fluids and salt exchange between matrix and fracture network are critical and worth detailed investigation. Moreover, matrix imbibition as an important EOR mechanism has been extensively studied but the focus was mostly given to capillary effect. However, for shale, due to the pore structure and clay content, some physico- or electro-chemical forces at molecular level cannot be overlooked anymore, such as osmosis. |A multi-mechanistic numerical shale matrix imbibition model is developed. The model takes into account dynamic water movement caused by capillary pressure and osmotic pressure as a function of water saturation and salt concentration, respectively. The rock matrix is considered as the mixture of two different components, one with small nano/micro-pores and semi-permeable membrane property and the other having larger meso-pores. The model properly simulates water and salt transportation occurring across the matrix-fracture network contact surface driven by capillarity, osmosis, and salt diffusion. To honor the physics, the salt/ions concentration equation differs from previous work by removing the osmosis component and a new membrane efficiency coefficient is defined and properly incorporated in the model. |Spontaneous imbibition test results were used for matching and validation purposes. The simulation results well explained laboratory high-salinity water imbibition curve, which can be divided into three processes. Initially, a capillary driven imbibition sucks high salt-concentration water into matrix near the matrix-fracture contact surface. However, due to the significant salinity contrast between imbibed fluids and in-situ matrix salinity, a drainage process can be induced. Eventually, as salinity difference decreases and osmosis is weakening, final imbibition stage starts. This model provides a basis for laboratory measurements interpretation and brings some insights to reveal the underlying mechanisms for field post-frac flow-back behavior.|","Hydraulic Fracturing, Imbibition Model, Shale EOR, Capillarity and Osmosis",60

This paper experimentally reviews the geomechanical factors governing the hydraulic fracture interactions with the formation's preexisting fractures and the fracturing completion's simultaneous hydraulic fractures. The methodology followed in this study uses a series of laboratory fracturing tests. The experimental tests used rock samples made of synthetic, gypsum-based cements, such as hydrostone and plaster, and were performed in a number of experimental settings to investigate some geomechanical factors of relevance. Among such factors, the preexisting fracture's cementation, aperture, and relative height as well as the design of the fracturing stage completion were examined in the course of the experimental portion of the work. As a result of the laboratory experiments, it has been found that a hydraulic fracture crossing the preexisting fracture is largely dictated by the preexisting fracture's cement fill type relative to the matrix of the host rock. Likewise, the height of the hydraulic fracture relative to the preexisting fracture may govern their intersection mode, however, there seems to be an insignificant impact of the preexisting fracture aperture on the intersection outcome. Moreover, the fracturing stage completion design was found to have considerable impact on the hydraulic fracturing outcome. Stress interference between the fracturing sources in a stage highly affects the outcome of each fracturing source. Middle fracturing sources tend to result in inhibited hydraulic fracture propagations while outer fracturing sources achieve hydraulic fracture propagations with outward curvatures. Overall, the experimental data and findings enable us to validate some theories, calibrate numerical simulators, and answer some pressing questions. The results discussed in this paper provide very useful insights into fracturing unconventional formations.|","Hydraulic Fractures, Pre-Existing Fractures, Multistage Fracturing, Geomechanics, Unconventional Formations",45

A methodology based on sensitivity and uncertainty analysis is presented for performing a wellbore stability analysis in order to quantify model uncertainty and improve the predictions made. This methodology is applied to the safe mud window design for a study case. 
A wellbore stability model is set up, as of constitutive equation and failure criteria selection. Based on available data, a stochastic approach is used to assess the uncertainty associated to input parameters, or otherwise other alternatives like expert opinion are utilized. Secondly, a sensitivity analysis is carried out by means of OAT and RSM methods displaying results on tornado and spider diagrams. Finally, an uncertainty analysis is performed using Monte Carlo simulations for quantifying uncertainty in model outputs and obtaining the required mud weight to drill successfully as a probability function. 
Four approaches for assessing uncertainty in input data of wellbore stability models are presented. Sensitivity analyses showed maximum horizontal stress and cohesion as the most critical parameters in collapse pressure determination while minimum and maximum horizontal stresses were the major variables in fracture pressure evaluation. On other hand, vertical stress and Poisson ratio were considered as constants during the uncertainty evaluation due to their subtle impact in model results. Ultimately, an uncertainty analysis is presented via probabilistic graphs, which enables a better decision making since uncertainty in input data is considered and safe mud window is obtained as a probability function of drilling successfully. 
The workflow proposed makes up a complete uncertainty study useful for developing wellbore stability analyses which optimizes the decision making in drilling process design. Aspects like evaluation of input data uncertainty and incorporation of sensitivity analyses are novel components for complementing the simulation Montecarlo as uncertainty analysis method and risk analysis tool.|",,45

Capillary pressure is incorporated as a function of pore size, wettability, and fluid phase properties. Simulated reservoir production is compared for cases with and without including capillary pressure effects due to small pores. During thermodynamic modeling, oil and gas phases are assumed to exist at different pressures, which difference is the capillary pressure. This becomes significant for small pores and is described by the Young-Laplace equation. Including capillary pressure using this method effectively and rigorously couples pore size with the thermodynamic calculations involved in compositional reservoir simulation. The interfacial tension (IFT) required for capillary pressure calculations is determined using the Weinaug and Katz parachor method. These methods are incorporated into an in-house developed compositional reservoir simulator to predict changes in production. Results from modeling show changes in fluid behavior due to confinement. The phase envelope calculated including capillary pressure exhibits a decrease in the cricondenbar and increase in cricondentherm compared to the bulk space phase envelope. Therefore, the bubble point pressure decreases and two-phase flow is reached later in production from an oil reservoir. When the reservoir contains both oil and gas phases, the oil saturation is higher in confined space compared to bulk space. Simulation results show that in a tight oil reservoir, oil production rate including confinement is larger than when assuming no capillary pressure due to this higher liquid saturation. Therefore, produced gas-oil ratio is smaller. Implementation of capillary pressure into compositional reservoir simulation until present has been achieved by use of the Leverett j-function with and without IFT correction. The method proposed here is more rigorous in that capillary pressure is calculated based on pore size and fluid compositions. Thus, as fluid compositions in the reservoir change due to production, capillary pressure successfully reflects those changes.|","Shale Gas and Tight Oil, Phase Behavior, Capillary Pressure, Compositional Reservoir Simulation",28
239,240,181684-MS,The Impact of Geomechanics and Perforations on Hydraulic Fracture Initiation and Complexity in Horizontal Well Completions,"Waters, George, Schlumberger| Weng, Xiaowei, Schlumberger","|As is well known, hydraulically fractured horizontal wells have been extremely successful in the development of low permeability reservoirs throughout the world. The vast majority of these completions employ cased and cemented wellbores drilled approximately in the direction of minimum horizontal stress. Multiple, relatively short perforation clusters are included within each frac stage along the lateral. This efficiently creates many hydraulic fractures propagating orthogonal to the well, but it does not insure that each perf cluster is effectively stimulated. |Many efforts have been made to improve the effectiveness of horizontal completions. This has mainly focused on using lateral measurements to place perforation clusters in rock of similar stress so they are more likely to be successfully stimulated. But this ignores the impact of formation initiation pressure and tectonics on fracture initiation. In addition, the number, dimensions and orientation of the perforations in each cluster can greatly influence the effectiveness of the stimulation at each initiation point. |To address these issues a near-wellbore fracture initiation calculator has been developed that predicts whether a fracture will initiate at a perforation, the minimum initiation pressure, the fracture initiation location and orientation at each perforation, and the injection rate into each perforation. These parameters are a function of the casing size and orientation, the mechanical properties of the rock and cement, the principle effective stresses, and properties of the perforations. |A series of sensitivities have been performed to quantify the impact of injection rate, tectonic setting, stress variation between clusters, and perforation properties on hydraulic fracture creation, orientation and complexity at each perf cluster. The sensitivities demonstrate that fractures may not initiate at many clusters and that within an active cluster some perforations may not be accepting fluid. Incorporating the results from this model enables engineers to design completions that insure all perforation clusters are effectively stimulated and near-well fracture complexity is minimized. |This methodology does not just look at a single perforation, or cluster. Instead, it accounts for the stress variation between multiple perforation clusters within a frac stage, in addition to perforation orientation, dimensions and eccentricity, to predict the likelihood that each perforation cluster will be stimulated. By employing this methodology one can better design a perforating system and optimize perforation placement within a lateral to insure hydraulic fractures are created at all perforation clusters.|","Horizontal Well, Perforating, Hydraulic Fracturing",16

Diatomites are high-porosity, low-permeability reservoirs with elastoplastic properties and high geo-mechanical responsiveness. Despite that, diatomites have great potential for oil recovery. Withdrawal of fluids from the reservoir rock leads to subsidence causing compaction and shear stresses. This disturbed stress distribution results in well failures that causes loss of millions of dollars. Successful maintenance of pressure support through optimum injection/production is key to preventing subsidence to mitigate the risk of well failure and achieve better sweep efficiency for recovery. 
There have been different approaches to tackle subsidence and well failures in diatomites including the use of ‘backpressure method’ coupled with a neural network to optimize injection-production to ‘balance’ the rock in terms of stress-distribution and thus decrease well failure due to shearing. However, using such methods may mask other problems the well is experiencing, such as, mechanical issues that influence production. Another existing approach, satellite-imaging (InSAR) cannot be used to take real-time actions that is crucial in diatomites. 
Surface tiltmeter data is collected to undertsand the relationship between injection/production and resulting surface deformation, which also provides information about well-to-well connectivity. A neural network-based approach is followed to determine the nonlinear relationship between surface subsidence/dilation and injection-production. This is then used to build an objective function that works to minimize the differences between well-to-well subsidence/dilation measured by the tiltmeters, by adjusting injection-production for the wells. 
In this paper, a method that harnesses real-time surface tiltmeter data to adjust injection-production distribution in diatomites to decrease well failures is used beyond the existing applications of surface tiltmeter, such as, in the areas of detection of early steam breach to surface in steam operations and fracture orientation and it provides real-time data for robust reservoir management of such reservoirs where satellite imaging is not effective.|","subsidence, neural network, tiltmeter, soft rocks, diatomites",34

With large scale production of gas from shale resources, large volumes of pore space have been vacated. Therefore, there is a large capacity for storage of carbon dioxide in these resources. Furthermore, due to the higher affinity of the organic matter to carbon dioxide compared to methane, injection of carbon dioxide can replace the adsorbed methane and therefore, enhances the recovery of natural gas. The objective for this work is to investigate the sorption (adsorption of carbon dioxide and desorption of methane) in carbon-based organic channels using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. 
In this study, adsorption isotherms of methane and carbon dioxide are compared by performing grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations in identical setups of carbon channels. Excess and absolute adsorption isotherms of these gases are plotted and compared. Furthermore, the surface selectivity of carbon dioxide over methane is computed to determine the competitive adsorption of these two gases. To simulate the displacement process, MD simulations of displacement of methane molecules with carbon dioxide molecules in presence and absence of pressure gradients are performed. The results are compared for different values of gas pressures and pressure gradients. 
According to the results, adsorption capability of carbon dioxide is found to be higher than that of methane under the same pressure and temperature. The selectivity values of carbon dioxide over methane is found to be higher than the ones for pressure range of 100 to 200 atm, which shows that carbon dioxide molecules have higher affinity to the surface compared with methane. It is also found that carbon dioxide molecules replace adsorbed methane molecules due to their higher affinity to the surface. Concentration of methane sharply decreases as carbon dioxide molecules are introduced in the channel. The results show that the amount of carbon dioxide storage and methane production rate increases as injection pressure increases. The results in this study can impact on the research and development of new tools for both candidate selection (selection of the sites for carbon dioxide storage) and development of predictive models for estimating of the amount of carbon dioxide intake.|","Surface diffusion, Multicontinuum modeling, Unconventional reservoirs, Shale gas, Molecular Dynamics Simulation",36

Steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) is a widely used thermal recovery method. During steam injection in interbedded sands, the portion of the deposits above the vertical permeability barriers is likely not recoverable with current practices. This paper examines the reservoir engineering aspects of using multistage fracturing in SAGD operations in interbedded sands such as IHS, where the vertical permeability barriers impede the gravity drainage process. 
Assuming that the permeability barriers can be targeted and broken with vertical hydraulic fracturing treatments before steaming, it is very likely that the steam can pass through the shales, effectively heat the otherwise isolated oil, and eventually drain it. The flow mechanism and the recovery response of a fractured SAGD well are discussed and it is shown that the suggested process has a great potential to improve production rate and recovery factor. The desired fracture properties and expected production rates are obtained by using both analytical and numerical reservoir engineering techniques. Some quick assessment criteria are also introduced. 
Analytical equations to estimate the SAGD peak rate were derived for various sand-shale sequences and fracture configurations. The analytical equations can be used for quick evaluation of the fracturing potential in such SAGD wells. A correction factor was suggested to compensate for simplifying assumptions. 
Through numerical simulation, a matrix of sensitivity cases was developed with variation of key parameters such as fracture permeability, fracture half-length, fracture spacing and orientation. It was shown that fractures with short half-length but high conductivity are required for the process to work. Using the sensitivity results, an optimum range for key fracturing parameters was determined. Furthermore, a dimensionless fracture conductivity criterion was used as a general design criterion. The issues around fracturing design and sand-shale geomechanics are presented in a separate paper. 
The multistage fracturing technique in horizontal wells was first used in tight and shale gas plays, and different variations of the field execution of this technique are now widely available. To our knowledge, this work is the first detailed examination of the potential of multistage fracturing for improving SAGD in interbedded pays. It is shown that, if this technique can be combined with in-situ steam operations, some of the problems with steaming interbedded pays can be addressed. In particular, it is shown that the recovery can be substantially improved to be comparable to clean sands. However, the use of multistage fracturing in SAGD process also introduces unique execution challenges that require thorough analysis and design, which were the focus of the companion paper (Saeedi and Settari, 2016).|","Interbedded Sands, Oil Sands, SAGD, Multistage Fracturing, Fracture Conductivity",21

However, no existing non-linear mathematical models and numerical simulations account for the effect of throat radius heterogeneity and fluid on non-linear flow characteristics. Additionally, they aslso do not account for the mutation of relative permeability curve resulted from non-linear flow characteristics. Therefore, in this paper, based on the method to characterize the non-linear flow characteristics and to calculate the relative permeability with non-linear flow characteristics, non-linear mathematical model is built. Then the numerical simulation module is developed. It is found that because of the effect of non-linear flow characteristics and quasi threshold pressure gradient, the early oil production of conventional model is largest and that of quasi threshold pressure gradient (QTPG) model and non-linear model are the same. Additionaly, QTPG model overestimates the threshold pressure gradient. Therefore, the sweep and cumulative oil production of conventional model is larger than that of non-linear model, larger than that of QTPG model. Becasuse the middle of the production well and injection well has the minimal pressure gradient, it has the minimal effective permeability. Accounting for the effect of non-linear flow characteristics and permeability stress sensitivity on relative permeability, the sweep area of injected water is small. Although the permeability is the same, the non-linear flow characteristics and permeability stress sensitivity are more obvious when throat distribution is narrower. As a result, the effective permeability is lower and sweep area become smaller.

High-clay shale formations could behave as a semi-permeable membrane, thus causing osmotic water molecules flow from low-salinity side to the high-salinity side. This chemical potential dominated flow, we believe, has non-negligible influence on water leak-off and flowback during the treatment of hydraulic fracturing, since there is a considerable salinity difference between the low-salinity fracturing-fluid and the high-salinity formation brine. 
In this paper, we present the development of a comprehensive triple-porosity (organic materials, inorganic materials and fracture network), dual-permeability, chemical potential dominated water/gas flow model that uses experimentally determined formation properties to predict the fracturing fluid flowback of hydraulically fractured shale gas wells. The dual-permeability includes the chemical potential dominated flow within inorganic materials and the pressure dominated flow within fracture network. Fracture network is considered as an interconnected continuum embedded in shale matrix, where organic shale is interspersed within vast inorganic shale. The organic material is thus considered disconnected in the entire reservoir. The chemical potential dominated flow model accounts chemical osmosis, capillary and viscous forces. 
The water saturation profiles for both osmosis-induced and capillary-induced cases are compared, revealing a region of saturation that effectively is immobile even though irreducible saturation has not been reached. The results indicate that chemical osmosis is a key mechanism for fluid loss during the hydraulic fracturing and should not be ignored under high clay content cases. This work provides a basis for flowback data analysis of hydraulically fractured shale gas wells and also helps define value adding laboratory measurements.|","shale, flowback, osmosis pressure, fracturing-fluid, chemical potential",34

Solids production is relatively uncommon in tight reservoirs, but it has been identified as a common problem in the fractured, superdeep, hot tight gas reservoirs in the Tarim Basin of China (TVD is 21,000+ ft., temperature is 320+ °F, closure stress is 20,000+ psi, formation pressure is 14,500+ psi, drawdown pressure is very low, etc.). We are investigating the fundamental mechanisms governing solids production in such reservoirs, and exploring for potential solutions. 
It is necessary to recognize the differences between failure mechanisms and sand production potential in unconsolidated/weakly consolidated sands and indurated, low permeability sandstones. We have observed several phenomena during and after fracturing in this high-temperature, low-permeability reservoir. These are: (1) there is a substantial difference between the formation temperature and bottomhole fluid treating temperature during fracturing, about 230+ °F; (2) the fracturing fluid has an high salinity (40% NaNO3 was used to the fracturing fluid to increase weight/hydrostatic head in order to reduce surface treating pressure) and there has been a long interaction time due to partial flowback; (3) there is an extremely high gas production rate; and (4) on occasion, there has been aggressive and frequent bean-up or shut-in. After recognizing these complicating considerations, we analyzed their impact on rock integrity, and on the resistance to solids production (both proppant and formation). We are conducting an in-depth analysis of field observations of sanding. With this effort, we are attempting to develop solutions to mitigate or prevent sand production for future wells. 
There is a history of significant solids production. The large temperature difference between the static formation temperature and the fracturing fluid temperature incurs extreme thermal stress near the wellbore, and to a lesser degree, along the fracture. These thermoelastic/plastic effects may incur damage near the wellbore, through the completion and along the fracture surface. In addition, failure by shear or extension might be induced in the intact tight rock with extended contact with the high salinity base fracturing fluid. Hydrodynamic drag and significant energy expenditure due to high gas rates, non-Darcy losses, and in-situ erosion are anticipated. Some authors have coined a term, ""C-Factor,"" to quantify this rate sensitive behavior. The ""C-Factor"" embodies the second order rate dependency of kinetic energy expenditures. With large velocities, kinetic energy expenditure is observed to be extremely high, and may be a root cause for damage to perforation tunnels and intact rock. In order to prevent solids production in the future, we may need to consider controlling salinity, production rate, the temperature of fracturing fluid, bean-up and shut-in frequency, along with standard geomechanical controls such as borehole trajectory.

The relative degree of impact on hydrocarbon extraction per acre varies from one play or formation to another, but the phenomena is generally attributed to asymmetric induced fracturing from the development (child) well into the previously partially drained and lower static pressure delineation (parent) well reservoir volume. This paper briefly discusses two solutions that have been employed to minimize the negative fiscal ramifications and improve recovery. 
Rigorous 3D unstructured grid reservoir modeling can assist in the quantification of the phenomena; however, options for mitigating the problem for cases where the impact is extreme are typically limited. Synthetic history matching and forward modeling were performed with a grid-based numerical simulator that mimicked a series of asymmetric oblique fractures interacting with a drained reservoir volume, comparing acceleration of reserve recovery and total recovered reserves with a similar case involving symmetric fracturing. Two scenarios for preventing extreme asymmetric fracturing are discussed. These included dramatic shortening of the time between completions, and performing pressure sink mitigation (PSM) via refracturing of the delineation wellbore. 
It is shown that the asymmetric fracturing into drained volumes can materially impact reserves and rate of recovery if the acreage position of a given project is substantial. It is demonstrated that the overall stimulated reservoir system permeability, the degree of permeability contrast between reservoir layers, and the degree of asymmetry are all factors that have an impact on the degree to which the long-term time between completions affects recovery of hydrocarbons over and above simple volumetric depletion. 
Integration of rigorous 3D reservoir modeling and far-field fracture mapping have established that the negative ramifications of extreme induced fracture asymmetry can be overcome with careful application of drilling and completion (D&C) timing and offset drainage pressure management process.|","fracturing, hydraulic, horizontal, asymmetric, wellbore",44

J., Baker Hughes| Saric, D., Baker Hughes| Yin Yin, M., PETRONAS","|This paper presents a case study of a geomechanical evaluation used in sand management decisions in a mature oil field offshore Malaysia. Elements of a field-wide geomechanical model were constrained from various data types from a vast number of wells drilled in 1980s and new re-development wells drilled in 2013–15. Extensive production from multilayer stacked reservoirs has resulted in large pressure depletion; hence drilling of infill wells and water injection is used to enhance oil production in the field. |A poroelastic analytical sand production prediction approach was used to investigate the risk of sanding in both existing and new wells under high depletion conditions. Historical production data were used to calibrate and verify the sand production predictions. The analysis also included rock mechanics laboratory experiments on core samples saturated with mineral oil and brine to characterize the amount of rock weakening in the presence of water, which showed target sandstones may weaken by 13–16% when they are exposed to brine compared to the mineral oil saturated condition. |The results showed a very low risk of sanding for the target oil reservoirs over the field life, using expected final reservoir pressures of 100 psi for cased and perforated completions drilled in any direction. The risk of sanding for open holes, however, was found to be slightly higher with further depletion from the current reservoir pressures, particularly with the likely rock weakening effect under water production and injection conditions. Moreover, hole instability and solids production resulting from the failure of the shale interbeds under low downhole pressures and water production could be a well integrity risk, jeopardizing production in open hole completions. |The sand production prediction model is used to identify the optimum completion strategy in new wells considering the strength of target reservoir rock, well trajectory, and reservoir pressure and production conditions on a well by well basis. For most planned wells, cased hole completions with oriented and selective perforations appeared adequate to mitigate the sanding risks in both production wells and water injectors. Sand-free production to date from recently-drilled cased and perforated infill wells confirms the accuracy of the pre-drill sanding evaluation and sand management decisions.|","Sand Control, Water Injection, Geoemechanics, Sand Production Prediction, Water Hammer Effect",53
251,252,181328-MS,Effect of Dynamic Active Fracture Interaction DAFI on Activation of Natural Fractures in Horizontal Wells,"Daneshy, Ali, Daneshy Consultants Int'l","|Abstract 
Activation of natural fractures is generally assumed to be a major contributor to the productivity of unconventional reservoirs completed by creation of many fractures in horizontal wells. These natural fractures are assumed to form an interconnected high permeability network that shortens the length of the flow path and facilitates higher flow rates from the reservoir. 
This paper reviews activation of the natural fractures that lie in the formation adjacent to, or in between, hydraulic fractures, but not directly connected to them. The solution uses the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion and general equations for stress distribution around a hydraulic fracture. 
The paper shows that under favorable conditions the stresses induced by the growing hydraulic fracture can activate existing natural fractures by either tensile or shear failure. Natural fractures close to the hydraulic fracture have the best chance for limited tensile activation. This type of activation is insensitive to differences between the original in-situ principal stresses. Activation by shear sliding is more likely to happen in cases of larger difference between the in-situ principal stresses and, again, will be of limited extent. 
Hydraulic fracture conditions that increase probability of natural fracture activation are higher extension pressure, and proximity to the natural fracture. Natural fractures farther away from the wellbore have a better chance of activation if they fall within the influence zone of a long hydraulic fracture. 
Activation of natural fractures by tensile stresses may create a zone of formation dilation and enhanced permeability around the hydraulic fracture. This increases the productivity of the hydraulic fracture and the reservoir. 
Creation of a single hydraulic fracture is more likely to activate natural fractures than two or more concurrent fractures. The zone of activated natural fractures will also be larger. Increased normal stresses caused by creation of multiple concurrent fractures can actually close or narrow natural fractures that have already existed within the formation between these fractures. 
Shorter spacing between adjacent hydraulic fractures can increase the percentage of the formation volume between them that contains activated natural fractures.|","natural fractures, Hydraulic fracturing, fluid pressure, Horizontal wells, Fracture interference",19

Based on recent reports, there is little doubt that hydraulic fracturing can result in the generation of seismic events with magnitudes greater than zero as related to the activation of faults situated within or within proximity to reservoirs. The question that arises is whether fault activation is related to the presence of fluids and proppant or is related to perturbations in the local stress field. In other words, are these events triggered through stress perturbations or induced by pore pressure reducing effective stress? 
Fault activation is also related to the degree of surface roughness, asperities and barriers to slip, frictional stress of the rock and the resulting rupture velocity. To derive a picture of the faulting and sub-faulting processes, we examine signals of a M>0 event associated with stimulation in the Marcellus formation as recorded near surface with low-frequency sensors along with the sub-faulting behaviour as observed in high frequency signals recorded close to the source. We investigate the dynamics of sub-fracture failures during the rupture process and growth of the overall fracture from initiation to rupture arrest, the role of asperities, roughness, fluids, the failure mechanisms (shearing versus tensile dominance of behavior), and the conditions under which induced-triggered failures may occur. 
Based on our observations, fault activation was related to decreasing frictional resistance on the fault surface due to the presence of fluids. The increasing magnitude for sub-events during fault activation suggests that slip over a larger contact area such as an asperity and that fluid influence was dissipating. 
Overall, failure was dominated by a shearing mode of failure, whereas the sub-fracture failures were mixed-mode, that is, more complex than a simple shearing process and included a strong tensile component of failure that evolved in time. However, from this example, it is difficult to ascertain if fault activation was triggered or induced; it appears both modes are plausible.|","Fault Activation, Rupture Characterization, Induced Seismicity",16

Understanding the mechanisms driving proppant, fluid, and formation interactions, especially in shale reservoirs, provides many advantages, including helping design new treatment methods for stabilizing faces of shale fractures, mitigating proppant embedment, controlling clay and fines migration, and ultimately improving well production. This paper describes new imaging tools and processing methods used to demonstrate the impact of treatment fluids applied during hydraulic fracturing in shale formations. Results are correlated to provide guidance for selecting appropriate clay stabilizers to enhance propped fracture conductivity. 
Four types of outcrop shale formation samples (Mancos, Barnett, Eagle Ford, and Marcellus) were studied after conductivity tests were performed using fresh water. The workflow involves the following: (1) perform a computed tomography (CT) scan on the shale wafers; (2) process and segment the image to separate proppant, void space, and formation material; (3) calculate proppant embedment depths on both sides of the shale wafers; (4) calculate proppant-induced fracture widths and extract fracture patterns; (5) determine the percentage of void space and broken proppants; and (6) correlate these measures. 
Fluid interactions with shale materials were manifested in the presence of proppant under closure stress through proppant embedment, effective propped fracture width, proppant-induced fractures, void space, and broken proppant percentage. By performing comparisons between Eagle Ford shale samples with fresh water or certain treatment fluids, proppant embedment depths were observed to be shallower under treatment conditions. While the number of proppant-induced fractures increased, their widths were observed to be narrower in treated shale samples, which is consistent with the trend. This reflects the importance of the treatment fluids, which help reduce the impact of proppant embedment to maintain the effective propped fracture width. The proppant-induced fracture pattern became more complicated in shale samples that were exposed to treatment fluid, resulting in a significant increase in surface area for hydrocarbon desorption. The proppant bed void space was shown to increase significantly after treatment. In addition, broken proppant amounts were reduced in the shale samples after treatment with the fluid, which reaffirms its positive effects. Overall, quantitative comparisons between samples treated with fresh water and certain treatment fluids substantiated the positive impact of clay stabilization for providing protection for various formations. The results provide guidance for selecting appropriate treatment fluids for certain reservoirs and help reduce formation damage risks and costs. 
Applying novel digital rock techniques to study the interactions between fluid, proppant, and rock samples provides the most straightforward method to visualize and quantify changes. The developed nondestructive workflow proved to be useful for selecting the proper fluid system for treating certain reservoir formations and thus enhancing production. Quantifying proppant-rock interactions enables operators to determine the effects of the fluid system more accurately compared to using current conventional methods.|","production enhancement, formation, image analysis, proppants, fluid interactions",61

Pressure Transient Analysis (PTA) is commonly used in Industry to estimate parameters such as dimensions (length, height) and skin of induced (hydraulic) fractures, and reservoir permeability. PTA interpretation methods are well established for the limiting cases of ‘low’ leak-off [Mini-Frac Analysis (MFA) of stimulation hydraulic fractures] and ‘high’ leak-off [Injection Fall-Off (IFO) analysis of waterflood-induced fractures]. However, traditional methodologies used for these two limiting cases differ fundamentally and there exists no established approach for intermediate leak-off, in spite of many efforts to date. 
We present exact 3D simulations of hydraulic fracture propagation at arbitrary rate and for arbitrary leak-off (from very low to very high), followed by fracture closure as a result of shut-in and after-closure reservoir flow. Based on the trends resulting from these simulations, we propose a novel very simple analytical PTA method for estimating fracture dimensions, skin, leak-off coefficient, and reservoir permeability. This method is applicable both to fractured waterflood injectors and mini-fracs in hydraulic fracture stimulation. It presents a consistent approach to before-closure analysis (BCA) and after-closure analysis (ACA). 
We compared the exact simulations with our novel analytical PTA method, and with more conventional MFA and IFO approaches, such as g-functions, square root time, and other existing BCA and ACA methods. For all these cases, it is demonstrated that the currently existing approaches present limiting cases for either low leak-off (MFA) or high leak-off (IFO) of our proposed PTA method, and that our novel methodology provides superior results to the existing approaches particularly in the intermediate leak-off range. We also use our numerical methodology to demonstrate that more recently proposed analysis methods using generalized versions of the Agarwal/Bourdet derivative do not necessarily result in a ‘correct’ interpretation, in particular with respect to identifying the point of fracture closure. With respect to the latter, we also demonstrate that often identification of fracture closure from PTA will be virtually impossible. 
Finally, we apply our PTA method to a few field cases, thereby demonstrating its simplicity of usage.|","Minifrac Analysis, Pressure Fall-Off Analysis, Hydraulic Fracture Stimulation, Fractured Water Injection, Pressure Transient Analysis",56

Permeability is one of the most important petrophysical parameters in formation evaluation and reservoir description. Unlike porosity and saturation, permeability can be a non-zero rank tensor. Most published log-based permeability models are only used to determine scalar or isotropic permeability. However, more and more oil/gas reservoirs have been found in anisotropic formations. In these geological environments, the permeability, resistivity, and some other petrophysical parameters are frequently anisotropic. From an industry-wide viewpoint, very few logging tools provide measurements that can be used as inputs for the calculation of log-based permeability anisotropy (horizontal and vertical permeability). Multicomponent induction (MCI) tools are examples that can measure resistivity anisotropy. This paper describes the algorithms and interpretation workflow that can be used to assess permeability anisotropy from an integrated interpretation of resistivity anisotropy and conventional log-derived permeability. 
As an extension of present permeability models in isotropic formations, a new permeability model in an anisotropic formation is obtained. Based on this anisotropic model, a new relationship between resistivity anisotropy and permeability anisotropy is determined in anisotropic formations. This relationship shows that the permeability anisotropy is a function of the resistivity anisotropy ratio and pore structure parameters. By comparison, the previously published results include only a few special cases in the new relationship. Assuming that the log-derived permeability data are available and are calibrated based on the effective permeability or one component of the permeability tensor, the remaining permeability components can be obtained from the relationship of resistivity and permeability anisotropy. In thinly laminated shale-sand formations, log-derived permeability and horizontal or vertical permeability cannot accurately represent true reservoir permeability because of the vertical-resolution limitation of logging tools. To overcome this limitation, the true reservoir permeability is evaluated from the calculated horizontal and vertical permeability based on a multimodal permeability tensor model. For practical applications in anisotropic reservoirs, an interpretation workflow is presented for permeability anisotropy evaluation with the joint interpretation of resistivity anisotropy and log-derived permeability from conventional/advanced sensor logs (e.g., resistivity, imaging, and sonic). 
The algorithms and workflow are validated by using the numerical simulation and field data. The new workflow has been used in the permeability anisotropy interpretation of synthetic data with and without random errors. After the synthetic data validation, the workflow is applied to field log interpretation. Both applications showed that this new addition of the permeability anisotropy should significantly assist in the accurate assessment of the reservoir, as well as in fracture detection and subsequent oil development and production.|","resistivity logging, workflow and applications, conventional perm, perm anisotropy, integration",42

Attempted in isolated cases in small scale, such operations have been considered too complex, expensive, risky, and finally not economically attractive compared to other development opportunities. Technological breakthroughs in hydraulic fracturing in the past decade have enabled the renaissance of the oil and gas industry with the development of tight and source rock reservoirs mainly in onshore applicationsland in North America. |New and dramatically improved operational efficiency standards have been set for fracturing in the last years. However, the same efficient operational set up, successful in onshore North America, cannot be directly emulated in an offshore environment due to limited space, more complex logistics, cost and environmental constraints. DPE, oil operator headquartered in Dubai-UAE, was able to overcome these challenges successfully and in 2016 drilled, completed and produced the world's first offshore horizontal multi-stage proppant fractured well that targeted a tight carbonate source rock, the Shilaif Formation at 8,400ft true vertical depth, source rock for most of the oil produced in Dubai. The successful concecusion of this project has allowed DPE to unlock a very significant volume of reserves in the Dubai acreage and possibly in the whole region. |Albeit being one of the most complex and largest offshore stimulation jobs ever attempted, it was executed with minimum environmental impact; no freshwater was used, the post-frac flow-back was performed in a closed loop system where clean-up and production testing packages were specially designed conveying the flow-back fluids directly to the offshore production facility. The use of a modular type frac-package with continuous seawater mixing capability minimized environmental impact and avoided any freshwater consumption. The stimulation was executed from a lift boat, less sensitive to maritime conditions, which accommodated equipment and crews for continuous wellsite operation. Eight proppant fracturing treatments were performed in 48hr. Wellbore conditions and petrophysical data acquired while drilling allowed for a robust multi-stage open-hole completion design. The eight stage proppant fracturing treatment was engineered using channel fracturing techniques with 560,000 lb of proppant. This specific technique was applied to optimize proppant volumes and operational footprint while limiting screen-out risk in this complex reservoir stress setting and maximizing frac conductivity.

The literature is rich with fracture tip phenomena theories. In particular, the effect of tip plasticity has been the subject of much debate. However, little has been done to investigate the effect of rock mass plasticity, a potential controlling factor in weak and compactible rocks. This paper advances a 3D dynamic computational model to replicate the growth of hydraulic fractures in elastoplastic rocks. |The proposed model is based on a non-linear Finite Element formulation that couples solid deformation and fluid flow. Rock is treated as a work-hardening elastoplastic material whose plastic deformation can be found using an associated flow rule. This paper features a new computational method to find material tangent stiffness tensor in non-linear Finite Element Analysis. A meshing/remeshing scheme is employed to maintain a high mesh resolution and to reach infinite boundary effect while keeping simulation runtime reasonable. The model tested successfully against analytical solutions for pressurized cracks and radially growing hydraulic fractures. |Due to the action of fracturing fluid pressure on fracture faces, normal stress increases on the fracture faces and a zone of tensile stress forms ahead of the fracture. The size of this zone dictates fracture growth rate. Due to plastic deformation, when subjected to loading, compared to elastic rocks, elastoplastic rocks experience less increase in normal stress on the fracture face and a smaller tensile zone. Combined with typically high permeability of compactible rocks, this results in slower fracture growth, larger fracture widths and higher fracture pressures. Another significant observation is that elastoplastic rocks can undergo shear localization, depending on rock properties, stress state and treatment conditions. |This paper presents a unique method to account for rock mass plasticity during fracturing operations. It showcases a robust 3D computational non-linear Finite Element model with a concrete physical foundation.

It is now well established that poro-thermo-elastic effects substantially change the magnitude and orientation of in-situ stresses. Fractures induced in injectors during water injection for waterflooding or produced water disposal have a profound impact on waterflooding performance. These effects, coupled with injectivity decline due to plugging caused by injected particles, lead to permeability reduction, fracture initiation and propagation. Models are available for fracture propagation in single injection wells and single layered reservoirs that account for these effects. However, the impact of fluid injection and production on fracture growth in multiple wells and multi-layered reservoirs with competing fractures has not been systematically modelled at a field scale. 
In this work, a three-dimensional, two-phase flow simulator with iteratively coupled geomechanics has been developed and applied to model the dynamic growth of injection-induced fractures. The model is based on a finite volume implementation of the cohesive zone model for arbitrary fracture propagation coupled with two-phase flow. A dynamic filtration model for permeability reduction is employed on the fracture faces to incorporate effects of internal damage and external filter cake build-up due to the injection of suspended solids and oil droplets. All physical phenomena are solved in a single framework designed for multi-well, field-scale simulation. 
The pressure distribution, saturation profile, thermal front, mechanical displacements and reservoir stresses are computed as fluids are injected and produced from the reservoir. Simulation results are discussed with single as well as multiple fractures propagating. Stress reorientation due to poroelastic, thermoelastic and mechanical effects is examined for the simulated cases. The orientation of the fractures is controlled primarily by the orientation of the stresses, which in turn depends on the pattern of wells and the rates of injection and production. The sweep efficiency of the waterflood is found to be impacted by the rate of growth of injection-induced fractures. Heterogeneities in multi-layered reservoirs strongly govern the expected vertical sweep and fluid distribution, which impacts the cumulative oil recovery. 
This is the first time a formulation of multiphase flow in the reservoir has been coupled with dynamic fracture propagation in multiple wells induced by solids plugging while including poro-thermo-elasticity at the reservoir scale. The model developed in this work can be used to simulate multiple water injection induced fractures, determine the reoriented stress state to optimize the location of infill wells and adjust injection well patterns to maximize reservoir sweep.|","coupled Reservoir Geomechanics, Reservoir Simulation, Particle Plugging and Filtration, Waterflooding, Fracture Propagation with Multiphase Flow",61

This paper investigates the impact of high-rate production on well performance of a cased-hole gas well with a fracpack type of completion. We modeled fluid dynamics in the near wellbore region, where the most drastic changes in pressure, velocity and temperature are expected to occur, using a computational fluid dynamics approach. 
Fluid flow modeling was based on Navier-Stokes equations coupled with Forchheimer equation, which enabled us to study inertial and turbulence effects in regions where velocity suddenly increases and then decreases in the same way in a relatively small length scale. In addition, gas properties were incorporated into the momentum balance equation via the Soave-Redlich-Kwong equation of state. Simulations were pressure-driven at steady-state and isothermal conditions so that external pressure was kept constant and pressure at the wellbore was varied to generate the well performance curve for the simulation model. 
The concept of rate-dependent pseudo-skin factor was then introduced as a tool to assess the level of nonlinearity caused by inertial and turbulence kinetic energy losses at different pressure drawdowns. Analysis of simulation results showed that rate-dependent pseudo-skin went from a negative value at low rates to positive at medium-to-high producing rates. This is because inertial and turbulence effects were negligible at low superficial velocity, hence negative skin factor of completion prevailed, while the opposite happens at high superficial velocity. Therefore, we hypothesize that optimum operating condition of a well is at the maximum possible flow rate at which inertial and turbulence kinetic energy losses are minimum; we found this condition coincides with the well flowing condition at which the rate-dependent pseudo-skin is zero.|",,3

The responses of geologic models to injection of large volumes of CO2 are evaluated using a proxy that approximates pressure distribution using a random walk particle tracking algorithm and computes surface deformation using a stress-field solver. The geologic models showing similar proxy responses are grouped into clusters by invoking multi-dimensional scaling and k-means clustering. A representative model of each cluster is chosen and its simulation results are compared to the observation. The resultant posterior ensemble consists of models that belong to one or more clusters whose representative models are not only in good agreement with given observation data but also non-dominated to other representative models. The usefulness of the model selection approach is demonstrated on CO2 sequestration of a fractured gas reservoir at In Salah, Central Algeria. The explicit coupling of the connectivity estimator and the stress solver reproduces similar migration patterns of CO2 plume to those obtained using full-physics numerical simulations. Incorporating time-lapse observations measured using satellite-based interferometric synthetic aperture radar imposes additional constraints to refine geologic models by improving the matching quality of bottomhole pressure, and thereby contributes to a further reduction in geologic uncertainty. The multi-objective optimization process implemented in the model selection process yields a diversified model set than those obtained using a global optimization procedure. The posterior ensemble exhibits consistent geologic characteristics in terms of spatial distribution and orientation of migration pathways.

A polymer flood pilot has been ongoing since 2008 in Suriname in the heavy oil Tambaredjo field operated by Staatsolie. The pilot started with one injection well and four producers and was subsequently expanded to three injection wells and nine producers. 
Initially, a polymer solution with a viscosity of 45 cP was injected and this was later increased, first to 85 cP then to 125 cP in order to improve the sweep efficiency. The response to polymer injection has been positive even though some wells have not responded as expected to the injection. The incremental recovery (over primary) to date is estimated at 11.3% STOOIP. Additionally, some wells outside the pilot have also shown response to injection. 
The performance results of the pilot have already been presented in previous paper SPE-180739-MS (Delamaide, Moe Soe Let, Bhoendie, Jong-A-Pin, & Paidin, 2016). The current paper focuses on the interpretation of the performance of the pilot. Several factors have contributed to make this interpretation challenging: the reservoir heterogeneity with permeability of up to 30 darcy (to air) measured in cores and in pressure transient tests; the characteristics and contribution of a water-bearing formation of Cretaceous age below the main reservoir which remains not very well understood. But also the fact that the pilot patterns are not confined; the increases in injected polymer viscosity over the course of the pilot and the role of induced fractures or pseudo-fractures created during the injection of the polymer solution. 
Salinity data recorded over the whole production history of the wells was invaluable for the analysis thanks to differences in salinity between the reservoir, the water-bearing Cretaceous and the injection water. 
The results of the interpretation of the pilot performance have given a higher confidence for possible future expansion of polymer flood in the Tambaredjo field. Contrary to the common practice of using reservoir simulations to interpret pilots, this work has been conducted with classical reservoir engineering techniques and calculations, and thus presents an interesting case study. Some main conclusions for this project are:  
Polymer injection has generated an incremental recovery of 11.3% OOIP; Polymer Utilization Factor ranges between 0.41 bbl/kg and 0.57 bbl/kg of polymer. 
Fluid movement outside the patterns has been observed; it was due to the unconfined nature of the pilot patterns and was probably exacerbated by the limited drawdown imposed on the pattern wells. It is likely that incremental recovery would have been higher had the wells been produced more aggressively. 
A first response to polymer injection was obtained when a viscosity of 45 cp was injected. Increasing the viscosity further did not result in any obvious increase in oil recovery.  |For the future polymer expansion, it is recommended to maximize well drawdown and to reduce injected polymer viscosity to improve the economics (Polymer Utilization Factor).|","Polymer flood, Field pilot, Heavy oil",39

Fracture stimulation of infield or offset wells in unconventional developments can involve communication between the legacy (parent) wells and newly drilled offset (child) wells. Production from the legacy well results in a decrease in reservoir pressure and stress, which can cause pressure sinks that ultimately lead to fracturing fluid communicating between the child and parent wells. Depending on the reservoir conditions, completing infield wells can result in production losses for the parent well, and in some cases, the parent well might never fully recover its full production potential. One of the current strategies used to minimize offset well completion communication with a parent well is to perform a preemptive protection refracture of the parent well. However, for the majority of these restimulations, the operator does not receive confirmation of refracturing effectiveness—even after production data from the refractured well become available. 
Under the auspices of the Gas Technology Institute, the Department of Energy helped fund a research project hosted by Laredo Petroleum (the operating company) in the Wolfcamp to better understand, among other things, the relationship between lateral well placement, production interference between laterals, effectiveness of completion sequences, and hydraulic fracture geometry in unconventional reservoirs. Two vertically stacked parent wells that had been producing for approximately 15 months were chosen as the subjects for this study. The two vertically stacked parent wells were landed in the Upper and Middle Wolfcamp formations in the Midland basin of West Texas. The objective of the study was to understand the impact of refracturing these two wells immediately before the stimulation of 11 offset child wells (part of a development program within a production corridor setting) with regard to the reservoir pressures and stresses surrounding both the parent and child wells. Conclusions were drawn based on well treatment and downhole microseismic data, which were acquired during the restimulation of the two parent wells and the completions of the 11 child wells, and data from radioactive (RA) tracers that were pumped during the refractures. Overall, microseismic analysis revealed positive pressure protection effects were achieved during the refracture. 
Downhole microseismic data for the refractured wells focused on events that occurred both near the wellbores and in the far-field and the time at which they occurred relative to the execution of the restimulation. Results from the first restimulated parent well indicated that less than half of the well was successfully restimulated and, therefore, only a portion of the reservoir between the laterals was repressurized. This resulted in the development of asymmetric fractures in the offset child well in the lower pressure portion of the reservoir, while the section that was repressurized resulted in symmetric fracture development. Using real-time microseismic monitoring during the completion of the parent wells allowed for an immediate review of the acquired microseismic data and on-site adjustments to the pump schedule. As a result, the restimulation of the second parent well appeared to have more effectively repressurized the reservoir and promote the creation of symmetric fractures during the completion of the offset child well that was landed in the same formation (as the second refracture parent well). RA tracer results were in alignment with the microseismic data.|","repressurize, bashing, protection frac, refrac, diversion frac",17

The Montney Formation has natural gas, natural gas liquids (NGL) and oil from conventional and unconventional reservoirs. The first multiple fractured horizontal well (MFHW) was drilled in 2005. However, since the first MFHW, different methods were proposed to optimize completion designs in the Montney Formation. Some of the optimized completions utilized the ""operational effectiveness"" of high-rate slick-water fracture designs while other designs utilized energized fracturing fluids. What has been missing was an integrated methodology that utilizes all available data to improve well stimulation and productivity. The objective of this paper is to present a new methodology for selecting lateral well placement, completion strategy and determination of stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) by integrating available data such as curvature data from 3D seismic, micro-seismic, geo-mechanical data, logs, fracability index, mini-frac test, step-rate test, DFIT analysis, core data, and fracture treatment design to optimize well productivity, hydrocarbon recovery and economics. |The process of developing the hybrid model involved integrating the completions design with compositional reservoir simulator using a two-step process; first, the hydraulic fracture design was calibrated using only the micro-seismic data from the stages that were closest to the geophone/receiver (avoiding location bias or signal-noise ratio issues) in order to develop a reliable fracture geometry model. The calibrated fracture model was used for history matching and re-modeling of all the fracture stages in each well. Fracture geometry and dimensions for each stage were obtained from the calibrated fracture model. Secondly, the compositional reservoir simulators were built using reservoir geology, PVT data, production data and well deviations. Fracture dimensions obtained from the calibrated fracture model were then transferred into the reservoir simulator. Finally, curvature data obtained from 3D seismic was used to predict the location of secondary fissures within the well drainage area, and were then incorporated into the compositional reservoir simulator. |The result from this study shows that the hybrid integrated completion and reservoir model can be used for the selection of optimum lateral placement targeting sweet spots that have secondary fissures and good fracability index to maximize production rates, hydrocarbon recovery and to improve well economics. Additionally, this study presents a new hybrid model for determining a representative stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) with discrete fracture networks that captures secondary fissures, which can then be used for production history matching and forecasting. |The key features of this work that will benefit the petroleum industry are:  |A new methodology for building calibrated fracture model using micro-seismic survey even if the micro-seismic data is of low quality as a result of location bias or signal-noise ratio issues  |Extending the stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) to include secondary fissure contributions to the overall well production and recovery.   |Use of a discrete fracture network with stress dependent fracture permeability in the compositional reservoir simulator to capture the effects of geomechanical changes during depletion.   |A comparison of well productivity and EUR derived from a planar fracture model versus discrete fracture network based reservoir models.  |","Integrated Completion and Reservoir Modeling, Stimulation Model Calibration, Montney (Canada) Condensate, A Hybrid Integrated Modeling, Horizontal well Optimization",46

The Eagle Ford Shale is a primary contributor to the added U.S. proved oil and gas reserves (EIA 2015). Successful exploration and development of the Eagle Ford Shale play requires reservoir characterization, recognition of fluid regions, and the application of optimal operational practices in all regions. |Various approaches have been used to determine which geologic parameters have the greatest influence on Eagle Ford Shale well productivity. Previously, regional statistical studies of production and geologic parameters were employed to analyze the relative importance of depth, thickness, and total organic carbon content on cumulative production. Regression coefficients and P values were examined. Although those studies provided insights to regional controls on Eagle Ford production trends, understanding which geologic parameters have the greatest impact on production performance of individual wells required more detailed simulation models. |Based on the frameworks provided by stratigraphic and petrophysical analyses, a single well compositional model for a representative Eagle Ford gas condensate well was built, and history matching based on production and pressure data was performed. PVT reports were available to simulate phase behavior. Multiple good history matches were obtained by varying a set of uncertain input parameters, such as water saturation, and relative permeability. Porosity and permeability were modeled as functions of pressure to consider reservoir compaction effects. The distribution of parameters from various history match results was plotted, allowing their impacts on the production behavior of the well to be quantitatively correlated and analyzed. This approach was preferred to traditional sensitivity study approaches, where a single parameter is changed each time, and the ranges of the parameters are not guided by historical data. In addition, interactions among the parameters cannot be considered without history matching. Well deliverability was also modeled to optimize the oil production rate by designing appropriate operational parameters. |Hydraulic fracture geometry and reservoir drainage area are the dominant controls on production. Reservoir modeling suggests low bottomhole flowing pressure was the key to optimizing cumulative gas condensate production. Minor changes in porosity significantly impact production Eagle Ford Shale condensate production, whereas production is less sensitive to variations of water saturation and matrix permeability.

P., Hess Corporation","|Lost circulation is a major challenge in well construction operations, especially where drilling margins are narrow or in pressure-depleted reservoirs. Wellbore strengthening techniques (e.g., StressCage) have successfully been used to increase formation fracture resistance and reduce mud losses during drilling operations. The increase of fracture resistance in sands has been used to improve wellbore stability (through the use of higher mud weights), reduce casing requirements, and access resources that may have been undrillable using conventional drilling methods. |The StressCage technique requires the estimation of the width of an induced fracture at a target fracture length for a given wellbore pressure. This estimation involves either a finite element calculation or a closed form line crack analytical solution. Populating and running the finite element solution requires specialized software and expertise, which has limited its use to larger operators and service companies that are staffed with geomechanics experts. The closed form line crack analytical solution is both simple to implement and easy to use, but it assumes transverse isotropic in-situ stress conditions relative to the borehole axis, which is almost never the case in the presence of a deviated well. This assumption results in either the underestimation of the calculation of the fracture width in the presence of deviation or abnormal in-situ stresses, which can result in a failed implementation of a StressCage formulation. |We have developed a new semi-analytical line crack solution that accounts for stress anisotropy from either borehole inclination or abnormal in-situ stresses.

Artificially strengthening the wellbore is now becoming of crucial importance in order to successfully drill and cement deepwater wells in mature fields and any other wells with narrow drilling margins. |In this paper, we introduce an innovative thermal wellbore strengthening (TWBS) technique to elevate the tangential stress (also known as the hoop stress) near the wellbore, and consequently increase the fracture gradient. A ""thermal fluid,"" consisting of a carrier mud with heat-releasing (""exothermic"") coated particles, has been designed to target depleted zones and release heat at exactly the right time to increase near-wellbore thermal stress, which directly elevates the near-wellbore tangential stress and in turn elevates the effective fracture gradient. Ultimately, this lowers the risk of lost circulation and improves the chance of successfully cementing and achieving zonal isolation. For instance, a TWBS treatment can be executed as an integral part of the cement job by using it in an extended spacer train for mud displacement, pumped directly prior to cement placement. |The coated exothermic particles were designed such that they could release their ""payload"" via an extended time-release mechanism, to ensure that the heat release reaches the appropriate target location in the wellbore at the right time.

The first highly deviated Deep Water well with an inclination up to 80° was drilled in Mexico. A strategy developed in collaboration with the owner and Directional Drilling contractor allowed to safely drill the well within AFE and reach all planned objectives. 
In order to maximize production, avoid geological risks and optimize utilization of existing subsea infrastructure the Deep Water well (with water depth over 3000ft) was designed with inclination reaching 75°, demanding dog leg severity (2.5°/100ft) and several sections to be enlarged while drilling. 
Being the first well with such high angle in Mexican Deep Water, Lakach-52 did not have much of a reference. Many design and operational issues had to be solved for the first time. 
Besides problems typical for highly deviated wells, such as hole cleaning, wellbore stability, high ECD, etc., potential issues were anticipated with a kick off from vertical in very soft formation, perform directional work within interbedded formations and a zone of conglomerates, pass between faults and simultaneously enlarge the hole. 
Additionally, a number of factors were taken into account in order to design the well: existing subsea infrastructure, local practices, geological/geomechanical risks, operational risks (direction, S&V, stuck pipe, etc.) 
In order to ensure flawless performance and address all potential issues, the service company ran the project under integrated management roof. A special communication protocol/structure was designed in order to optimize the decision making process than response time. A specific project drilling strategy was developed for each stage of the well construction process. 
All BHAs as well as drilling parameters were designed using the following approach: fit to purpose BHA tendency, bending stresses below critical, minimum shocks and vibrations and optimized hydraulics. 
As a result, the well was successfully drilled within AFE curve, all given targets were successfully achieved. All sections were drilled with ROP faster than planned. The conductor was jetted and the following section was drilled ahead using a straight motor with a minimum deviation from verticality 0.26° The kick off successfully performed at very shallow depth and very soft formation with push the bit Rotary Steerable system.

The sub-salt challenges include drilling through interbedded formation triggering drillstring vibration, hard and abrasive sandstone and pressure transition. |In most exploratory areas where operators are currently active, the water depth is greater than 4,000 ft. As a result, long drill strings are required which increase the likelihood for drilling dynamic issues. Torsional oscillations, lateral vibrations, and whirl pose the risk of bottom hole assembly (BHA) failure, resulting in an unplanned trip. Drilling through interbedded formations of variable hardness often initiates dynamic instability. If not managed, instability shortens the BHA run life and adversely impacts the success of the operation and exposes rig personnel to additional safety risks. |The majority of deepwater drilling applications require the use of an expandable hole opener in the BHA. Drilling through an interbedded formation with an expandable hole opener increases the possibility of the pilot bit and reamer losing synchronization, causing the reamer to overload, which can result in a premature failure and unplanned trip. Alternatively, having an aggressive hole opener in the BHA with an unaggressive pilot bit can result in whirl and the resultant loss of drilling efficiency or eventual failure. Therefore, it is important to use a bit with managed aggressiveness to ensure the bit and reamers remain synchronized. |The use of polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) bits often aggravates the drilling dynamic instability because of inherent shearing action and resultant downhole torque fluctuations.

This paper identifies wellbore stability concerns caused by transient surge and swab pressures during deepwater drilling tripping and reaming operations. Wellbore stability analysis is presented that couples transient surge and swab wellbore pressure oscillations and in-situ stress field oscillations in the near wellbore (NWB) zone in deepwater drilling. 
Deepwater drilling is usually subjected to narrow drilling windows and significant wellbore pressure oscillations during tripping/reaming because of well depth. However, integration of transient surge and swab pressure analysis, and its effects on in-situ stress analysis around the wellbore, is rarely industry studied. 
A transient surge and swab model is developed by considering drillstring components, wellbore structure, formation elasticity, pipe elasticity, fluid compressibility, fluid rheology, etc. Real-time pressure oscillations during tripping/reaming are obtained. Based on geomechanical principles, in-situ stress around the wellbore is calculated by coupling transient wellbore pressure with surge and swab pressure, pore pressure, and original formation stress status to perform wellbore stability analysis. 
By applying the breakout failure and wellbore fracture failure in the analysis, a workflow is proposed to obtain the safe operating window for tripping and reaming processes. Based on this study, it is determined that the safe drilling operation window for wellbore stability consists of more than just fluid density. The oscillation magnitude of transient wellbore pressure can be larger than the friction pressure loss during normal circulation process. With the effect of surge and swab pressure, the safe operating window can become narrower than expected. Although it is stable and not a concern during a normal penetration process, the wellbore stability can become problematic. By using the methodology described, unnecessary breakouts and borehole failures during tripping and reaming can be avoided. This work can also be used in the next generation of drilling automation. 
This study provides insight into the integration of wellbore stability analysis and transient surge and swab pressure analysis, which is rarely discussed in the literature. It indicates that, when surge and swab pressure analysis is not carefully performed, the actual safe operating window can become narrower than originally predicted.|","Wellbore stability, swab and surge pressure, mud weight window, transient, deep water",15

Large-particle-size (d50 > 300 µm) lost-circulation materials (LCMs) are often used to plug large fractures and manage downhole losses. They are usually added to a fluid to form a pill, which is pumped downhole. If downhole temperatures are high, these large particulates can settle out of the fluid, likely resulting in unsuccessful LCM treatments. This paper discusses temperature-stable fluids that suspend large LCMs and, thereby, efficiently address this challenge and mitigate lost circulation at high temperatures. 
A detailed experimental study was conducted to study the rheology-vs.-temperature behavior of several fluids up to 325°F on advanced rheometers/viscometers. The suspension of large LCMs in these fluids at these temperatures was studied experimentally in a lab environment. The same LCM-fluid combinations were also investigated using the standard laboratory permeability plugging apparatus (PPA) tests at high temperatures. The slotted disc in a PPA simulates the fractures in the wellbore, and the slot plugging test is widely used in the industry to test the plugging efficiency of LCM particulates. 
The temperature effect on the rheology of the fluids was demonstrated by plotting rheology-vs.-temperature data obtained from the rheometer/viscometers at various applied shear rates. The rheological investigation showed that fluids designed with certain combinations of viscosifiers provided stable rheologies (only a slight drop in rheology with temperature) at high temperatures. During the suspension tests, these temperature-stable fluids demonstrated a superior ability to suspend the large LCMs at high temperatures. The information agreed with the quantitative correlations in the literature on rheology requirements of the fluids to suspend given LCMs. The temperature-stable fluids also improved the LCM performance during the PPA tests, indicating their potential to mitigate losses effectively in high-temperature wells.|","lost circulation, LCM pill, high temperature, suspension, large LCM",24

Achieving quality cement performance in deep water wells with large amounts of salt present requires fundamental understanding of the salt effects on the interactions of cement additives with cement on the slurry performance. Many problems encountered later in the life of the well can be traced to slurry performance issues during placement and the initial setting process. Cement slurry designs for an oilwell can range from simple to highly complex depending on the geology, lithology, placement logistics, wellbore conditions and long-term performance. Logically designed cement slurry formulations and dependable additive behavior are critical to meeting cement performance requirements. Formulations can include mineral admixtures added in substantial quantities and additives in smaller (<2% by weight of cement) quantities. The performance of the additives in cement slurries depends strongly on competitive adsorption on cement and mineral surfaces. Adsorption interactions are directly influenced by downhole temperature, the nature of the formation, and the mix water composition. These aspects underline the need for understanding additive interactions with cement under wellbore conditions. 
Of particular relevance to deep water cementing is the performance of additives in sea water containing monovalent and divalent salts with chloride and various other anions present in amounts close to 4% by weight. The problem of additive performance becomes even more of a concern when cement is placed against salt formations. High ionic strength of sea water or of a sea/fresh water slurry placed against a salt formation, can compress the electrical double layer of cement clinker particles, alter chain conformations of ionically charged or hydrophobically modified polymeric additives, or change the solubility of additives. Additives may perform extremely well in fresh water slurries, but may perform poorly in slurries with high salt content. Additionally, the salt itself can affect cement performance. For example, sodium chloride is a set accelerator in small quantities (=13% by weight of cement) while it functions as a retarder in large quantities. 
The objective of this presentation is to gain molecular level understanding of relationships among additives based on chemical structures, adsorption onto cement surfaces, and the mix water ionic strength. 
In this study, typical additives for dispersion and retardation are contacted with Portland cement in deionized water, synthetic sea water, water containing 2% to saturation level of NaCl or divalent salts in a formation brine. The reactions were analyzed by isothermal calorimetry, UV/Visible spectroscopy and rheology.

The advances in hydraulic fracturing and horizontal well technology have unlocked considerable natural gas reserves contained in the shale formations. Reliable values of the shale key petrophysical properties including permeability and porosity are necessary to estimate the original gas-in-place, predict the production rates, and optimize the hydraulic fracturing treatments. The quantification of the key shale petrophysical properties however remain challenging due to complex nature of the shale foramtions. Unsteady state techniques are commonly used to estimate permeability of the shale samples because the shales typically have permeability values in nano-Darcy range. The measured permeability values by these techniques however suffer from a large margin of uncertainty and reproducibility problems. Furthermore, the unsteady state measurements cannot be performed under the reservoir stress and temperature conditions. 
In this study, a fully automated laboratory set-up, which has been designed and constructed for the evaluation of the ultra-low permeability petrophysical properties under the reservoir conditions, was utilized to measure the porosity and permeability of the Marcellus shale core plugs. The core plugs were obtained from a vertical well drilled specifically for the laboratory research and other scientific purposes (science well) on the site of the Marcellus Shale Energy and Environment Laboratory (MSEEL). MSEEL is a field site and dedicated laboratory in the Marcellus Shale unconventional production region of north-central West Virginia. The filed site is owned and operated by Northeast Natural Energy, LLC and contains several horizontal Marcellus Shale wells. MSEEL provides a unique opportunity to undertake field and laboratory research to advance and demonstrate new subsurface technologies and to enable surface environmental studies related to unconventional energy development. 
One of the core plugs obtained from the science well was used in this study for the evaluation of reliable Marcellus Shale petrophysical properties. The permeability of the core plug was measured under different gas pressures at constant net stress. The absolute permeability was then determined by applying the appropriate gas slippage correction. The porosity and the permeability of the core plug were then measured under a wide range of net stress. The measured porosity and permeability values were found to be sensitive to the stress. The permeability measurement results exhibited two distinctive behaviors with respect to the net stress that can be attributed to the natural fracture and matrix properties. The experimental results were then utilized to determine the natural fracture closure stress. The measurements also revealed that gas adsorption, when an adsorbent gas was used for the mesurements, resulted in a reduction in the absolute permeability of the sample.|","Permeability, Marcellus Shale",55

Studying kerogen structure and its interactions with fluids is important for understanding the mechanisms involved in storage and production of hydrocarbons from shale.

For the final structure, density values are calculated and compared with the reported density range for kerogen density. Adsorption isotherm, self and transport diffusion coefficients of methane in the final kerogen structure are also calculated.

Induced hydraulic fractures interacting with in-situ natural fractures results in complex or discrete fracture networks (DFN). Even though well testing characteristics in fractured reservoirs with vertical wells have been investigated extensively, there is indeed a lack of good understanding of well testing behaviors for hydraulically fractured horizontal wells in complex fracture networks. 
First, three practical approaches are presented regarding how to generate complex fracture networks in the context of developing unconventional shale reservoirs with hydraulically fractured horizontal wells. Complex fracture networks can be generated 1) from stochastic algorithms that input fracture density, length and strike distributions, or 2) from the flowing-producing DFN (FP-DFN) area that is constrained by microseismic information, or 3) from digitization of realistic outcrop maps. Then, new unstructured fracture gridding and discretization techniques specially tailored for complex fracture networks are developed to handle nonuniform fracture apertures, extensively fracture clustering and nonorthogonal fracture intersections. Finally, numerical simulations of pressure build-up are performed in complex fracture networks that are generated from three proposed approaches using both synthetic and field examples. Flow regimes are identified and discussed based on pressure derivative plots. 
Complex fracture networks show that the most representative characteristics are formation-fracture bilinear flow and formation linear flow regimes. The appearance of the bilinear flow regime during early period might be not clear due to the impact of wellbore storage effect for the fractal fracture generation approach. In addition, the microseismic-based approach reduces uncertainties of fracture characterization by using percentiles of FP-DFN areas. The pressure build-up responses clearly indicate that the higher the percentiles of FP-DFN areas, the lower the pressure difference and derivative curves. The fracture mineralization affects pressure build-up responses significantly. The decrease in nonuniform fracture apertures cause pressure diagnostic plots shift upward. The effect of boundary in the outcrop-based complex fracture network shows an early deviation from the formation linear flow regime. No classic dual porosity behavior is observed in all cases to quantify related parameters. 
Three practical techniques are proposed to generate complex fracture networks. Pressure transient characteristics are identified and summarized. The open research areas are discussed and highlighted. This work helps us better understand pressure transient behavior of complex fracture networks and after-closure analysis of fracturing calibration test.|","Hydraulically Fractured Horizontal Wells, Numerical Simulation, Unconventional Shale Reservoirs, Complex Fracture Networks, Pressure Transient Analysis",16

Nanomaterials are the new additives for drilling fluids that can improve its properties and eliminate problems due to increased downtime and well costs. The objective of this research is to select the optimum concentration of nanoparticles that enhance drilling fluid properties and hydraulics. This study investigates the effects of commercially available nanoparticles on the rheological and filtration properties and optimizes the hydraulics of water-based drilling fluids. 
In this study, the samples were prepared as water-based muds with and without various concentrations of 5.7 nm colloidal silica dioxide nanoparticles. Series of laboratory experiments were carried out for all samples using standard API Low Pressure Low Temperature (LPLT) filtration and rheological tests. Two mud systems at different pH conditions were used to evaluate the impact of nanoparticles. A commercial software was used to evaluate the impact of the nanoparticles on the Equivalent Circulation Density (ECD) and the circulation pressure loss in a deviated wellbore. 
Results show enhancements in the rheological and filtration properties for water-based muds treated by the nanoparticles used in this study with concentrations below 0.7% by weight. Furthermore, the results show the ability of these nanoparticles to make the filter cake consistent, compacted, and thin. The results reflect the negative impact of the nanoparticles with concentrations above 0.7% by weight on some of the rheological properties. The optimum nanomaterial concentrations with the best properties were observed as (0.1%-0.3%) by weight. Furthermore, the concentration of 0.1% by weight reflected the significant reduction in the ECD and the circulating pressure loss. 
Nanoparticles used in this research can play a vital role in reducing drilling problems. Multilateral wells, slim holes and deep horizontal wells can be drilled by using water-based mud with the addition of proper nanoparticles and eliminating the need for oil-based muds that are expensive and environmentally unacceptable. However, it is critical to select the proper size and concentration of nanoparticles in order to eliminate its negative impact on the drilling fluid properties.|","Rheology, Filtration, Drilling Fluids, Nanomaterials, API Tests",2

Unconventional reservoirs require hydraulically fractured horizontal wells in order to produce reservoir fluids economically. Induced hydraulic fractures interacting with pre-existing natural fractures results in complex fracture networks (CFNs). Even though hydraulic fracture propagation has been investigated extensively, there is indeed a lack of good understanding of characterization approaches for pre-existing natural fractures. This work presents a practical CFN generation approach by incorporating stochastic algorithms, core, and microseismic data. 
Based on analysis of geological structures and core observation, natural fracture density, length, and strike distributions can be obtained. Fracture length follows a power law distribution constrained by minimum, maximum and cutoff lengths as well as a distribution exponent. Fracture strike follows a Fisher distribution. Then, microseismic event locations are used to constrain fracture centers of stochastically generated natural fractures. Moreover, a fast proxy model is developed for hydraulic fracture propagation, which honors both the total mass volume of the pumped proppants, and the pre-defined reference lengths. Finally, a field case study is used to demonstrate how to apply the proposed fracture generation and simulation workflow to model hydraulically fractured horizontal wells. 
The proposed workflow implemented stochastic algorithms with the capabilities to incorporate as much information as possible such as core analysis and microseismic information, and to evaluate uncertainties due to pre-existing natural fractures. With the assumption that microseismic event locations are reactivation of pre-existing natural fractures, the perturbed event locations constrained the locations of the natural fracture centers, resulting in a better description of microseismic-derived stimulated reservoir volume. The simplified hydraulic fracture propagation scheme was able to efficiently estimate the resulting complex fracture networks, and to accurately honor the material balance during fracturing treatment. Sensitivity analysis showed that fracture permeability, matrix porosity, and matrix permeability of the CFNs affect well production performance, significantly. 
This paper discusses how to utilize available data resources to generate representative CFNs for hydraulically fractured horizontal wells. The process of data preparation for each step of the workflow is discussed in details to facilitate engineers to solve practical problems with the developed methodology.|","Fracture characterization, Unconventional Liquid reservoirs, Production performance, Stochastic Discrete Fracture Networks, Microseismic and outcrop data",2
280,281,184043-MS,The Effect of Inner Borehole and Outer Boundary Dimensions in Thick-Walled Cylinder Test,"Tehrani, Soroush T., Curtin University| Sinaki, Ahmadreza Younessi, Baker Hughes| Sarmadivaleh, Mohammad, Curtin University| Golmohammadi, V., Curtin University","|Abstract 
It is well-known that the risk of sanding varies for different completion systems, i.e. open hole versus cased and perforation, in a given wellbore and reservoir. Part of this difference comes from the scale effect of the borehole. Pragmatic approaches are usually taken to consider the borehole scale effect in the sand production prediction analysis. A more rigorous approach is needed to take this effect into account. 
Experiments have been conducted by researchers on Thick-Walled Cylinder (TWC) samples with different inner to outer diameter ratios (ID/OD) for samples with standard dimensions (1.5in ID, and 3in length) to investigate the borehole scale effect on the failure of the inner borehole. However, the results partially suffer from the outer boundary effect of the tests and may not purely represent the inner borehole scale effect. Here in this paper, the outer boundary effects of TWC experiments were distinguished from the inner borehole scale effect using analytical approaches followed by extensive laboratory experiments. For this purpose results from comparing different failure criteria (i.e. Mohr-Coulomb, Drucker-Prager, Mogi and modified Lade) from Tehrani's results (2016) were used. Then, the volumetric strain was formulated against confining pressure to explain the elastic, elastic-plastic, and plastic behaviour of the rock. 
Variation of TWC strength of samples with different inner borehole sizes may not be fully captured by the analytical approach which only considers the effect of the ID/OD. Hence, the differences between the analytical and experimental approaches can be considered as the inner borehole scale effect. As expected, the analysis showed that the size of the inner borehole and the outer boundaries significantly change the TWC strength of the rock. After distinguishing the outer boundary effects, the results shows a decreasing trend between the inner borehole size and the TWC strength of the sample, which can be considered as the borehole scale effect. 
This study has also broadened the understanding of the effect of borehole and boundaries dimensions in TWC test, which may be generalized to real scale cases, i.e. wellbores and perforations.|","Geomechanics, Sand Production, Analytical Approach, Thick-Walled Cylinder, Borehole Scale Effect",36
281,282,184054-MS,Managed Pressure Drawdown in Utica/Point Pleasant with Case Studies,"Belyadi, Hoss, Consol Energy| Fathi, Ebrahim, WVU| Belyadi, Fatemeh, WVU","|Abstract 
Pressure drawdown management (PDM) has been heavily studied in offshore and onshore environments as a way to improve the well productivity and in general Estimated Ultimate Recovery (EUR). There has been a great interest in this topic, especially in unconventional oil and gas reservoirs, where multi-stage hydraulic fracturing and horizontal well technology is used to enhance oil and gas production. Recent studies on Inflow Performance Relationship (IPR) of shale oil/gas reservoirs have shown that unmanaged pressure drawdown (UPD) can potentially impact well productivity and profitability in different ways. Hydraulic fracture conductivity impairment is an example and can occur through proppant crushing, embedment, and fine migration. Uncontrolled pressure drawdown can also cause geo-mechanical effect in high-pressured reservoirs. Aggressive pressure drawdown has shown detrimental impact to EUR, flow capacity, and economics of the wells in Haynesville, Eagleford, and Point Pleasant/Utica shales. Wilson (2015) used a coupled geo-mechanics model with a large Haynesville data set that showed that effective stress on fractures is influenced by operational changes, and managed pressure drawdown can improve gas recovery. Deen et al. (2015) also illustrated that aggressive pressure drawdown can damage a well's performance in the Eagle Ford, while conservative pressure drawdown can impact the near term economic value. In shale reservoirs the impact of pressure drawdown management on well performance and EUR is mostly related to pressure dependent permeability. 
Unmanaged pressure drawdown has also shown rapid transition from transient flow to boundary dominated flow in unconventional gas reservoirs. There is a balance between the rate in which the wells are produced and economic feasibility of the wells over time. Optimal economic production rate must be found for each area. The goal of this study is to analyze well productivity between wells that use managed drawdown versus unmanaged drawdown in over pressured formations such as Utica/Point Pleasant. The production performance of the wells will be analyzed using various reservoir techniques including superposition plot, diagnostic plots, history matching, and decline curve analysis. In addition, economic sensitivity will be run to find out the incremental increase in EUR needed to justify the delay in production. The optimum economic rate to produce the reservoir while maintaining the integrity of the reservoir is the ultimate goal producing from shale gas reservoirs, which will provide the maximum value for the shareholders.|","Utica/Point Pleasant, Managed Pressure Drawdown, Flowback and Production Optimization, Geo-mechanical Impact, Optimum Economic Rate",36
282,283,184053-MS,RJD: A Cost Effective Frackless Solution for Production Enhancement in Marginal Fields,"Kamel, Ahmed H, University of Texas of the Permian Basin","|Abstract 
With the worldwide trend of low oil prices, high maturity of oil fields, excessive cost of horizontal and fracking technologies, and necessity for green drilling applications, radial jet drilling (RJD) technology can be a cost effective and environmentally-friendly alternative. RJD is an unconventional drilling technique that utilizes coiled tubing conveyed tools and the energy of high velocity fluid jets to drill laterals inside the reservoir. 
In recent years, rapid advances in high pressure water jet technology has tremendously increased its application in oil and gas industry not only in drilling operations to improve drilling rate and reduce drilling cost, but also in production to maximize hydrocarbon recovery. In addition, RJD can be used to bypass near wellbore damage, direct reservoir treatments/injections, improve water disposal and re-injection rates, and assist in steam or CO2 treatments. 
This paper highlights the theoretical basis, technological advancement, procedures, applications, and challenges of high pressure water jets. Several worldwide case studies are discussed to evaluate the success, results, pros, and cons of RJD. 
The results show that nearly an average of four to five fold production increase can be obtained. The present paper clearly shows that radial jet drilling is a viable and attractive alternative in marginal and small reservoirs that still have significant oil in place to capture the benefits of horizontal drilling/fracking and to improve productivity from both new wells and/or workover wells that cannot be produced with the existing expensive conventional completions.|","Marginal Fields, RJD, Laterals, Completion",16

The variability of reservoir properties across the lateral section of horizontal shale wells remains a prevalent phenomenon that has been observed in the development of numerous unconventional plays. However, the majority of wells in these plays are completed geometrically without account for the heterogeneity present across the wellbore thereby resulting in non-uniform production profiles along the length of the wellbore. This assertion is further validated by production logs from over 250+ horizontal shale wells which show that only about 60% of perforation clusters contribute to production in these wells, meaning 40% of the wellbore are not effectively stimulated. In recent years, operators have improved upon the geometric completion technique using an engineered approach which has resulted in better completion efficiency and production performance. 
This paper presents a case study of a horizontal well drilled in the Marcellus shale and equipped with a permanent fiber optic cable to investigate the effectiveness of the engineered completion approach compared to the standard geometric method. For this evaluation, the lateral length of the horizontal study well was divided into different sections. One section of the lateral employed geometric perforation placement while the perforations on another section were designed using an engineered approach. To address the challenges of perforation placement introduced by the fiber-optic cable, an enhanced perforation design methodology was implemented which leveraged the available geomechanical properties along with the wellbore and fiber-optic configurations, perforation gun specifications, and stimulation treatment design parameters to predict perforation breakdown pressures along the wellbore. Using the predicted breakdown pressures, the limited entry technique was then applied to engineer the perforation strategy for each of the stages to improve the likelihood of initiation from all of the perforation clusters. The distributed temperature and acoustic measurements from the fiber optic cable were then analyzed during the fracturing treatment to provide insight into which of the perforation clusters were initiating hydraulic fractures and being effectively stimulated. 
Observations from the fiber optic data consistently showed that all perforation clusters were immediately initiated for the engineered stages with uniform acoustic energy distributions occurring across all clusters which further indicated uniform stimulation across all of perforation clusters. For the geometric stages, only about 40% to 60% of the perforation clusters became activated with intermittent acoustic energy distributions being observed across all clusters throughout the treatment stages. 
The case study discussed in the paper presents and validates a novel approach for improving the wellbore stimulation coverage in an unconventional development. Through the characterization and incorporation of reservoir heterogeneity into the engineered completion design workflow, completion efficiency can be improved leading to enhanced well performance and project economics.|","Engineered Completion, Lateral Measurements, Marcellus, Fiber Optic, Stimulation",16

Demonstrate how to improve well delivery performance by strengthening discipline integration at key decision points. This draws on insight from implementing a well delivery process at Maersk Oil.   Methods 
This paper analyses well delivery team performance, identifying issues and success factors through 30+ interviews and feedback from 100+ practitioners. It identifies five decision points with the greatest performance improvement potential. The study consistently found Subsurface/Wells integration challenges at the heart of issues, decisions and success stories. 
It presents methods to systematically strengthen integration at each decision to improve performance. It defines enablers for effective integration, including learnings from prior projects and subject matter experts. The approach was implemented globally in all 2015/16 projects.   Results and Conclusions 
Integration was strengthened through activities leading up to each decision. This covers deliverables, peer reviews, freezes and gates. For deliverables, this required clearer expectations and divisions of responsibilities. Peer reviews were adjusted to force trade-off debates and fulfil sharper requirements. Freeze points were created representing leadership commitment to minimise re-work. The gates were reinforced to drive cross-discipline integration and finalise decisions. 
These integration activities aren't effective in isolation. They depend on enablers: building a robust case for integration, up-front collaboration, communicating the intent and cross-discipline leadership commitment. The paper describes best practices for each and how they fit together. 
By strengthening integration and implementing enablers, project teams have improved efficiency, risk management and decision quality. The results are quantified with metrics and supported by examples and interviews.   Novel Information 
Novelty lies in the systematic approach to strengthening cross-discipline integration at decision points. This goes beyond existing literature in scope and specificity. Operators can apply this to improve performance. The approach can be applied to other decision points, disciplines and capital project processes.|","Decision quality, Wells subsurface, Discipline integration, Performance improvement, Well delivery",63

The oil and gas industry has increased its efforts in preventing and mitigating risks associated with loss of well control and loss of primary containment. Initiatives have primarily focused on increasing the awareness and education of field and operations personnel. The foundation of this strategy rests on the belief that increased awareness of threats, risks and enhanced training will lower well control risks and eliminate well control events. Despite this renewed focus, industry data show that well control events and high-potential near-misses have not diminished. In addition, findings from incident investigations point to human-factor-related causes, including lack of procedural discipline, non-compliance errors and cognitive errors. 
For organizations to deliver flawless execution at the wellsite while effectively preventing or mitigating well control or loss of primary containment events, a robust closed-loop methodology that leverages smart risk detection and mitigation systems must be employed. This paper analyzes the critical process safety requirements in the industry and provides solutions centered on a smart integrated digital platform. This platform, built on technologies such as precursor sensor and alarming technologies, barrier and equipment health monitoring, wellsite performance analysis, sophisticated workflow management and video and audio analytics, will effectively coordinate and manage these dynamic risks. 
A data management workflow that uses automated risk assessments, threat detection, structured and nonstructured contextual data will minimize the impacts of human factors and drive operational efficiency, process assurance, reduction in nonproductive time and project cost. These enhancements will enable global organizations to proactively drive effective risk management of well control and loss of primary containment events.

It is not unusual that the difficulties encountered during a drilling operation can be tracked down to choices made during the planning stage. However, generating a robust drilling operation plan is not easy as there are often substantial uncertainties associated with the actual geological context. To address this problem, a method is proposed that evaluates quantitatively the risk levels of a drilling operational plan as a function of the underlying uncertainty associated with its description. 
To achieve that goal, the first task is to describe precisely the sources of uncertainties. The limits by which a drilling operation shall conform may be uncertain therefore defining fuzzy risk boundaries. The actual well construction may deviate from the plan, either because of unavoidable uncertainties in measurements as with the actual wellbore position, or because adjustments will be made during the operation such as changes in mud weight and rheology. Finally, the actual possible drilling performance may be subject to unforeseen geological variations and unprecise formation rock strength characteristics. 
Equipped with this probabilistic environment, we can perform drilling optimization in two successive steps. First, the uncertainty is propagated into drilling simulations, and risks associated to pressure control, cuttings transport, and drillstring stability are evaluated. Second, parameter optimization within the allowed window, can provide a strategy to obtain the best performance possible with respects to acceptable risk levels. As a result, both quantitative risk analysis and drilling optimization under several constraints are available to the drilling engineer as a decision support tool for well planning.|","Uncertainty, Drilling Optimisation, Risk Analysis, Well Planning",52

Such a technique would make engineered completions part of the factory approach on every lateral completed. |The solution described in the complete paper starts with data that already exist on every lateral. Current drilling practices include use of an electronic drilling recorder that collects data such as weight on bit (WOB), torque (TOR), rotational speed (RPM), rate of penetration (ROP), mud-flow rate (Q), standpipe pressure (SPP), and differential pressure (DIFP) on every well. The completions department can leverage these data to drive superior well productivity through a drilling parameter known as mechanical specific energy (MSE). |Adapting MSE for Reservoir Evaluation The completions department can take advantage of MSE by recognizing the close relationship between it and unconfined compressive strength (UCS). MSE can be used as a qualitative predictor of UCS within each fracturing stage. By calculating MSE from drilling data (a process discussed in the complete paper), one can then predict zones of comparable UCS within each stage. This will enable placement of perforation clusters in zones of similar UCS within each stage, which is exactly what many completions departments are attempting to do with wireline measurements.|",,37

In certain regions, the seawater contains more than 4,000 ppm sulfate, and the formation contains more than 19,000 ppm calcium; this will cause calcium sulfate precipitation at the reservoir conditions. The precipitate at the reservoir conditions will be anhydrite, and it will cause formation damage that will reduce the well injectivity. Stimulation treatments are required to recover the well injectivity; this requires stopping water injection to perform the stimulation treatments, and also it requires flowing back the well after stimulation treatment. In this study, we are proposing a new method that we can use to stimulate water injectors without stopping the water injection. The new method includes adding a chelating agent to the injected seawater at the wellhead at 15 wt% concentration. The fluid will be injected at the surface with the seawater with a specific dose to achieve the required concentration. Several solubility and coreflooding tests were performed with actual carbonate cores and GLDA (glutamic-di acetic acid) chelating agent at different temperatures. The chemical injection does not need coiled tubing and can be injected at the surface with the seawater. The chelating agents will sequester all calcium in solution and will prevent the calcium sulfate precipitation. GLDA chelating agent will be used with seawater, with no need to use treated or fresh water. Also, flowing back the well is not required because the fate of GLDA in the aquifer is soluble. Solubility tests up to 250?F at high pressure showed that the GLDA is stable with seawater. Coreflood experiments and computed- tomography scans showed the ability of GLDA in the creation of dominant wormholes through 6- and 1.5-in. carbonate cores at 212 and 150?F, respectively. GLDA chelating agent can be used to stimulate seawater injectors without additives because this chemical is stable and mild with the well tubulars.

We describe how the real-time systems were implemented for a number of global drilling operations without installing a real-time operation center. A case study of implementation in one area is presented. This approach enabled the decision makers in the field to access the experience of and support from the rest of the organization. The global real-time collaboration environment allowed the specialists to direct their attention, as required, to operations most in need of support at any particular time. By not installing a real-time operations center, the organization saved resources and encouraged the local teams to use the analysis tools themselves to manage their operational performance. The head-office organization provided technical and administrative support. It facilitated the design of the work flows and set common standards for the information-technology and communications architecture. The work flows were essential to create a structure for using the software tools within a local drilling team and to make sure that problems were detected as early as possible. The work flows aimed to strike a balance between not allowing early-warning signals to be overlooked while giving the operations team the freedom to responsibly manage the operation on the rig. Through the way that the system and the work flows were used on a daily basis, the rig personnel gained confidence that the system was set up purely to support them and for their benefit. The design and the implementation of these work flows used state of the art real-time drilling-data analysis and drilling-support tools. The setup of the infrastructure and software worked surprisingly well because of permanent communication between all stakeholders in the organization. The fully operational status was reached without the need for any capital expenditure, and the operating costs are low because of nearly no additional personnel requirements for the operator. The organizational changes to increase collaboration and support in the dispersed organization are harder to implement. Especially the development of an up-to-date skill map of the drilling-skill pool is a challenge. The methodology defining how and when to escalate a support request upward in the operator’s organization was proved to work satisfactorily. When operational problems were encountered, by acting as a knowledge broker, the central organization drew from its worldwide skill pool to organize problem-specific multidisciplinary support for problem-solving, peer review, and functional sign-off for program changes. These “on-call” teams ensured that the knowledge of the organization was leveraged and experience shared. It enabled the head-office organization to provide resources to assist in following up that the analysis of positive and negative events will be performed properly and result in lessons learned and updated best practice.|","Seamless, Drilling, Real Time",12

Methane (CH4) hydrate existing in marine sediments or in permafrost regions worldwide is anticipated to be a promising source of natural gas (Makogon, 1981, 1982; Kvenvolden, 1988; Kvenvolden et al., 1993). The most effective procedure for CH4 recovery from CH4-hydrate reservoirs is considered to be a depressurization method in which the pore water pressure in sub-seabed layers is decreased, and CH4 hydrate is dissociated into CH4 gas and water in the reservoir. Since CH4-hydrate dissociation is an endothermic reaction, the temperature of the subseabed layers decreases, resulting in a gradual reduction in the rate of CH4-hydrate dissociation. Thus, heating the sub-seabed layers in the neighborhood of the CH4-hydrate reservoir is a possible supplementary method for enhancing CH4-hydrate dissociation and CH4 recovery. CO
2-hydrate formation in sub-seabed layers was suggested as a heating method (Ikegawa, 2008; Ikegawa et al., 2010). Because CO
2-hydrate formation is an exothermic reaction, CH
4-hydrate dissociation in the reservoir would be enhanced by CO
2-hydrate formation in the neighboring layers. Methods of continuous carbon dioxide injection and CO
2-hydrate formation are currently in the research and development phase.|","triaxial compression,  hydrate, Carbon dioxide (CO2),  stress-strain relationship,  strength,  elastoplastic constitutive model,  methane (CH4)",15

This paper focuses on applying the CEL method to deep penetration analyses of the spudcan foundation and suction anchors. Some well-controlled centrifuge tests available in the literature are selected for the back analyses. A real case of spudcan-subsea template interaction during installation of the spudcan foundation at the Brynhild field is analyzed. Some semi-empirical methods recommended in industry guidelines and the small strain finite element (FE) method with the Press-Replace (PR) technique are also utilized for predicting the spudcan penetration capacity. From a comparison of all the results, it is concluded that combining the CEL method with the modified Mohr-Coulomb constitutive model provides a robust and suitable numerical tool for not only estimating the foundation-bearing capacity but also predicting complex failure mechanisms. |Introduction |During installation of offshore foundations and anchors, the soil might undergo large deformation. The effects of installation, such as penetration resistance, squeezing failure, punch-through failure, and changes in contact stresses and strengths, should be accounted for in the design and planning. Such effects have been typically assessed through the use of semi-empirical methods and engineering judgment skills obtained from field and model testing. Over the past two decades, large deformation finite element (LDFE) analysis has been extensively applied to evaluate the installation effects of the deep penetration of offshore foundations and anchors. Using the LDFE analysis does not require any a priori assumption of a failure mechanism, and thus the LDFE analysis can reflect the natural development of the failure zone and provide reasonably good prediction of the bearing behaviour. Wang and Carter (2002), Hossain and Randolph (2010b), and Yu et al. (2012) employed the Remeshing and Interpolating Technique with Small Strain (RITSS) developed by Hu and Randolph (1998) to simulate the penetration process of spudcan foundations in stratified soils. This RITSS method falls into the category of Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) methods. Qiu and Grabe (2012), Tho et al. (2012), Khoa (2013), Hu et al. (2014), and Zheng et al.

Based on the idea of tubercles at the leading edge of a whale flipper that improve stall characteristics, a new device for reduction of fluctuating lift acting on a riser pipe is developed. As a result, the fluctuating lift acting on the stationary cylinder with the tubercles is reduced by 89% from the normal cylinder. In addition, at a mass damping parameter of 1.3, the maximum amplitude of the oscillating cylinder with the tubercles is one-sixth as much as that of the normal cylinder. |Introduction |A cylinder like a riser pipe in ocean current has a problem of vortex-induced vibration (VIV). Studies with hydrodynamically controlled devices for suppressing VIV have been conducted. Various suppression devices, helical fins (Chung and Whitney, 1993), shroud (Wong and Kokkalis, 1982), fairing (Allen, 2003), and changes to pipe geometry (Owen and Bearman, 2001) have been developed. |Helical fins and fairing are used commonly as the existing technology for suppressing VIV. Although both devices have a good effect on the suppression of VIV, they have some technical issues. The drag acting on helical fins is larger than that on the normal cylinder. The size of fairing is nearly twice as large as that of the normal cylinder. Furthermore, additional operation for mounting and dismounting the vibration-controlled devices is necessary. Therefore, a device that offers less resistance and is more compact, with no need for extra operation, is desired. |On the other hand, studies on the mechanism of improving stall characteristics of tubercles at the leading edge of a whale flipper have been conducted (Miklosovic et al., 2004; Arai et al., 2010; Weber et al., 2011). These studies show that longitudinal vortex shedding downstream of tubercles on a whale flipper suppresses flow separation. Therefore, after objects like tubercles of a whale flipper are attached at the leading edge of a cylinder, it is likely that longitudinal vortex shedding downstream of tubercles will suppress Karman vortex shedding. First in this study, for riser pipes in unidirectional flow, the shape of tubercles that are effective in the reduction of fluctuating lift is developed by using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Second, for riser pipes in multidirectional flows like ocean currents and tidal currents, hydrodynamic forces acting on a cylinder with tubercles arranged in a spiral are investigated by using CFD and a tow tank test. Finally, a free vibration test in a wind tunnel is conducted to verify the effect on suppressing VIV.|",,57

A detailed analysis of the causes of inundation wells shows that in addition to water filtering which is pumped into highly permeable streaks, the main aggravating factor is formation of waterflood induced hydraulic fractures in the injection wells (fracture initiated by injection). In order to improve the efficiency of water flooding system in the oilfields of Vietsovpetro JV the issues of identifying and predicting the formation of w-induced hydraulic fractures were analyzed using statistical and field research data of the wells. Using actual mini-frac data and reservoir pressure measurements in production wells on the Block 09-1 offshore Vietnam, the statistical dependence was designed to evaluate the initial minimum principal horizontal stress (pressure of fracturing initiated by injection). Verification of established dependence was performed by comparing the calculated values of pressure of fracture initiated by injection with the actual data, obtained as a result of hydrodynamic research of injection wells at steady state regime. The analysis of changes of the minimum principal horizontal stress, based on the data of falloff test in injection wells with waterflood induced hydraulic fracture, was performed to study the possibility of control the development of cracks and to prevent its re-opening. It was determined that under the influence of periodic regime of the injection wells within conditions when bottom hole pressure exceeds the pressure of fracture initiated by injection, the considerable modification of the stress-strain state of the formation takes place. This accompanies with decrease of the minimal principal horizontal stress values, which increases the risk of uncontrolled crack growth and premature inundation of wells.|В настоящее время в СП «Вьетсовпетро» при вводе в разработку новых участков месторождений блока 09-1 шельфа Социалистической Республики Вьетнам, приуроченных к нижнемиоценовым отложениям, отмечается снижение эффективности заводнения из-за преждевременного обводнения добывающих скважин. Детальный анализ причин обводнения скважин показал, что наряду с фильтрацией закачиваемой воды по высокопроницаемым прослоям основным усугубляющим фактором является образование техногенных трещин гидроразрыва пласта (ГРП) в нагнетательных скважинах.

Hydraulic fracturing is the primary completion method in the unconventional Sohagpur Block coal seam gas (CSG) project targeted at low to high-volatile bituminous Barakar coal seams. Each well contains up to four to six seams with an aggregate thickness of 6 to 32 m and depths ranging from 400 to 800 m. 
The coal seams are mostly comprised of naturally fractured material (butt and face cleats) with very unique geomechanical properties, which poses many challenges in terms of coal stimulation. The coal is inherently prone to creating multiple fractures during hydraulic fracturing stimulation treatments, including T-shaped, parallel, or branched fractures. Commonly, during multiple seam stimulation, the probability of complex fracturing increases dramatically. The higher value of pressure-dependent leakoff tendency and high process zone stress (PZS) leads to higher treating pressures (relative to depth) during fracturing treatment, which, in turn, normally causes breakout into and possibly through the lower stress boundary zones. Poor proppant placement and inconsistent areal proppant distribution leads to minimized proppant pack conductivity and ultimately productivity loss. As a result, the hydraulic fracturing treatment options dwindle significantly, thus reservoir stimulation results are not optimum in each seam. 
During the CSG unconventional stimulation case discussed in this paper, the determination of fracture height and proppant pack quality was of the utmost importance. To evaluate fracture height and proppant pack quality and minimize complex fracturing growth and breakouts, a unique and environmentally acceptable high thermal neutron capture compound (HTNCC)-coated proppant technology was adopted for the first time in this CSG basin in India. The new proppant system was pumped during multiple seam stimulations to verify the post-fracture analysis of the coal seam observed using a three dimensional (3D) planar numerical model. The results were then used to sensitize fluid systems and volumes and tune proppant volumes with optimum treatment pumping rates against the standard ""cookie cutter"" method of 4,000 lbf/ft of coal. The normally observed extensive height growth and proppant distribution was then re-evaluated during the next interval treatment. 
The application of this nonradioactive (RA) tracer technology has resulted in achieving increased effective fracture length of each individual seam, increased proppant conductivity, and significant fracturing pressure drop during the treatment execution. Overall, this technology has greatly helped the development of effective coal seam fracturing design and validation. Selection of the correct diagnostics has helped improve the understanding of some of the significant questions remaining in regard to unconventional CSG basins. This paper discusses the lessons learned to achieve optimized seam completion design and verified results, which can be applied in other CSG basins.|","Unconventional, Fracturing, Diagnostics, Case History, Coal Seam Gas",12

Historically, different fracture diagnostic methods have been used for hydraulic fracturing treatments to obtain estimates of reservoir characteristics, fracture design parameters, and treatment progress. However, the advent of horizontal drilling techniques and expanded interest in unconventional reservoirs has increased the challenges to overcome to achieve a successful hydraulic fracturing treatment. This paper details advancement made to conventional methods of fracture diagnostics to meet these emerging challenges. 
A comprehensive study was conducted on the latest advancements in different diagnostic techniques. Several published case histories were studied where these techniques were adapted and modified from their conventional form. The effectiveness of the advanced techniques in terms of providing additional information was analyzed. A comparative review of the diagnostic methods was performed to determine individual limitations and to identify fit-for-application scenarios. An attempt was made to classify and categorize them according to the ease of application and usefulness for treatment design and analysis. 
This study suggests that proper planning, deployment, execution, and analysis of the techniques are essential to helping prevent erroneous conclusions about the treatment and job design. When conducted in unconventional reservoirs, conventional pressure diagnostic methods, as a result of the underlying assumptions of rock properties and fracture geometry, can be interpreted inaccurately. Use of high-fidelity forward models for the inversion of data acquired through these methods can lead to better understanding and help mitigate incorrect interpretation of the results. Similarly, fracture injection-falloff analysis combined with microseismic monitoring and distributed temperature and acoustic (DTS/DAS) data can provide deeper insight into the treatment, particularly for horizontal wells with simultaneously propagating multiple transverse fractures. Thus, a synergistic combination of different diagnostic techniques leads to more effective treatment designs and should be preferred if economically justified. 
The current work provides information on advanced fracture diagnostic methods and is useful for determining suitable diagnostic techniques for designing hydraulic fracture treatments.|","Hydraulic Fracturing, Diagnostics, Injection-Falloff, Subsurface Insight, Treatment Design",36

Hydraulic fracturing and horizontal well drilling technologies have enabled the oil and gas industry to safely unlock large reserves of oil and gas in unconventional resources, especially in shale gas and oil, and tight gas and tight oil reservoirs. However, there is an ongoing debate on whether ""the best practice"" is to drill a horizontal well in the direction of minimum horizontal stress, which would create transversely fractured well or to drill the well in the direction of maximum horizontal stress, which would create longitudinally fractured well. Additionally, little work has been done to understand the complex relationship that exist between principal stresses, well azimuth and/or lateral direction. 
This paper presents the results of a comprehensive multiphase flow study that investigated the relationship between the principal stresses and lateral direction in hydraulically fractured horizontal wells, and its impact on well performance. Secondly, the study also incorporated previous studies, where applicable, of a single phase flow study that was conducted by the co-authors of this paper. Both studies focused on transversely fractured wells versus longitudinally fractured wells, and how well azimuth affects productivity, reserves and economics of horizontal wells. The previous study primarily focused on wells that produced single phase fluids, and used single phase reservoir numerical models to study well performance. The study investigated the importance of lateral direction as a function of reservoir permeability, lateral length, fracture-half length, number of fracture stages, fracture conductivity, and well completion type (open-hole vs cased-hole). The Single phase study also included a number of actual field cases where the results were compared to actual wells in both oil and gas reservoirs that had transversely fractured or longitudinally fractured horizontal wells. 
This study would extend the findings of the single phase flow study by adding multiphase flow dimensions such as effects of relative permeability, non-Darcy flow, adsorption gas, stress dependent permeability on induced fractures and conductivity changes in the fracture from the tip to the wellbore. The study used black oil reservoir simulator to study two phase flow mechanisms such as gas-water (dry gas reservoir) and under-saturated oil reservoir (oil-water), and compositional reservoir simulator to model three-phase flow (oil-gas-water) to investigate each parameters' impact on well performance. This study is unique as it examines the permeability ranges from wells with 1 Nano-Darcy (0.000001 md) to 10.0 milli-Darcy in a multiphase flow reservoir simulation. Additionally, this paper presents the first multiphase flow study that thoroughly compared the performance of transversely fractured versus longitudinally fractured horizontal wells. 
Key features of the study that would benefit the petroleum industry are;  
Methodologies for modeling shale gas and shale oil wells with stress dependent permeability, adsorption gas and non-Darcy flow effect using black oil models and compositional reservoir simulators. 
Reservoir permeability based cut-off criterion that can be used as guide when selecting whether to drill transversely fractured vs longitudinally fractured horizontal wells. 
Integrating the reservoir objectives and geo-mechanical limitations into horizontal well completions and stimulation strategies. 
Incorporate the effect of reservoir fluid type and fluid properties such as oil composition and density (API) into the decision analysis when comparing transverse horizontal wells to longitudinal horizontal wells.

The staged fracturing and microseismic monitoring techniques are used for horizontal well stimulation in the Fuling shale gas field. From the analysis of the microseismic data, most of the wells are well stimulated. However, there are still some zones which are not broken thoroughly between adjacent two clusters. When decreasing the cluster space in the adjacent well, this bad phenomenon can be avoided. The cluster space is the key factor for the multi-stage hydraulic fracturing. How to choose it? Two things must be concerned, one is the fracture geometry, and the other is the induced stress field between each two adjacent fractures. 
A three-dimensional (3D) multi-fracture propagation model was developed. The mixed boundary element method was used to describe the propagation of the 3D fractures. The fluid flow in a fracture was modeled by the lubrication equation and the Navier-Stokes equations. The fluid flow in the wellbore was considered as the one-dimensional flow. Newton-Raphson and Picard iterative methods were used to discrete the 3D multi-fracture propagation model. Based on the geomechanics parameters of the Fuling shale reservoir, the fracture geometry and stress interference between each two adjacent fractures are studied. 
Numerical simulations are carried out to study the influences of the cluster arrangements, fluid displacement and viscosity, bedding plane, shale anisotropic, etc. on the fractures geometry, net pressure inside the fractures and induced stress fields, which reveals the fracture propagation interference mechanism of multi-stage hydraulic fracturing. An optimized cluster space exits for a specific well. 20-25 meter cluster space is recommended for the shale gas formation with well-developed bedding planes, and 25-35 meter recommended for the shale gas formation with non-developed bedding planes. The results are used for the on-site perforation cluster spacing optimization in about ten shale gas wells in Fuling shale gas field, the microseismic signals are full in the shale formation between two adjacent fractures.

Horizontal well drilling and multistage hydraulic fracturing are essential to economic recovery of unconventional tight/shale reservoirs. Multiple transverse fractures are ideally supposed to be perpendicular to the minimum stress direction, but slanted fractures might be seen in practice, which might bring a better connection between wellbore and fractures. However, for the same fracture half-length, the stimulated reservoir area might be less. Thus, the well performance of slanted faractures is full of uncertainty. Little research work is currently conducted on the horizontally slanted fracture scenario. 
Our transient pressure analysis of horizontal well performance with slanted hydraulic fractures utilizes the concept of rate-normalized pressure and transient productivity index. The novel Fast Marching Method (FMM) is adopted to characterize the drainage volume evolution for multi-stage horizontal wells and validate the proposed methodology. Sensitivity studies contrast transient pressure behavior and productivity index for slanted fracture angles from 0 to 90 degrees, e.g. from longitudinal to transverse fracture angles. Additionally, transient pressure behavior and long term reservoir performance of horizontal well for different scenarios are investigated, such as reservoir anisotropy and different proppant allocation strategies under the constraints of given horizontal well spacing and total proppant mass. 
Contrast to what we are usually expecting, results show that for the same fracture spacing, and the same total proppant mass, the well with slanted fractures will have a higher productivity index than that for strictly transverse fractures. Different from productivity index, the long term reservoir performance, however, turns out to play a different game, given specific horizontal well spacing and the same total proppant mass. Reservoir performance for horizontal well with slanted hydraulic fractures can be significantly improved by optimally allocating the proppant and designing hydraulic fracture placement strategies through this research.|","Fast Marching Method, Performance Evaluation, Transient Pressure Analysis, Unconventional Reservoir, Slanted Hydraulic Fractures",33

The main pay of the Keshen gas field is a tight sand formation with very low porosity (2% to 7%) and permeability (0.001md-0.1md). Due to the ultra-deep formation depth and superior high reservoir pressure (greater than 116 MPa) and temperatures (above 160°C), the well construction and field development costs are very high. Therefore, stimulation treatments is essential for achieving sufficiently high production rate and the basis for justifying the costs. Natural fractures (NF) are developed in the reservoir with high heterogeneity which leads to complex production mechanism due to interaction between matrix and NFs, and causes difficulties on stimulation optimization. 
To better understand the reservoir and optimize the well stimulation, the matrix properties, natural fracture, geomechanical data and stimulation data has been reviewed along with production data. Massive production history matching work has been done to evaluate the NFs. Other dynamic data like the well testing data and pressure data also reviewed to help understand NFs development in the full field scal. Production analysis was conducted to link the rock properties, NFs and wells' performance, and provided full understanding of production controlling factor in this reservoir. The post production analysis helped to understand the efficiency of stimulation. The production behavior for different stimulation strategy also have been illustrated by the simulation models to investigate the impaction on the stimualtion optimization strategy by the interaction between matrix and NFs. 
The study provided a good understanding of the production mechanism in this kind of natural fractured reservoir and NF's impact on the stimulation efficiency. The heterogeneity of NF results in very different production mechanism given similar matrix petrophysical behavior. Based on production mechanism, each well requires a customized stimulation to maximize the production potential.

The success of fracture stimulations depends on the ability to fracture the rock and to maintain fracture conductivity. Therefore, in order to have a successful treatment, the effect of rock and proppant characteristics should be understood. This paper investigates the relationship between fracture conductivity and rock properties for two different locations in the Marcellus shale. 
In this work, a series of experiments were performed in order to better understand the mechanical behavior of the Marcellus Shale. Multiple cores from Allenwood and Elimsport locations in Pennsylvania were collected to ensure repeatability in the results. The core samples were cut parallel and perpendicular to the bedding planes in order to analyze the effect of anisotropy in fracture conductivity. Additionally, compressive triaxial tests were performed to obtain the rock mechanical properties such as Young's Modulus, Poisson's Ratio and Ultimate Compressive Strength, and X-ray Diffraction analysis was used to obtain mineralogy composition. 
The laboratory results were carefully compared with previous fracture conductivity data and surface roughness data from the same Marcellus shale locations where proppant concentration was kept constant to reduce the variables affecting the fracture conductivity behavior. The findings showed that the anisotropy effect is present for this formation and reflected in the fracture conductivity values, where samples parallel to the bedding plane seem to have higher Young's Modulus. It was confirmed that at proppant monolayer concentration the main mechanism for conductivity loss is proppant embedment, where due to the high localized stress, the rock-proppant interaction goes directly to permanent deformation of the rock. It was also observed that a higher Young's Modulus helps to maintain the fracture width which translates in lower rate of conductivity loss with increasing closure stress, therefore, rock mechanical properties have impact on fracture conductivity. The phenomenon observed is less pronounced if a multilayer proppant concentration is used, where the proppant pack characteristics become an important parameter in fracture conductivity. 
In this paper, we present an analysis of the effect of rock properties in the fracture conductivity behavior based on a series of experimental results from the Marcellus Shale, where the role of permanent deformation was taken into consideration as a parameter causing fracture conductivity lost. This is the first time the effect of rock characteristics in fracture conductivity is analyzed based on experimental work for the Marcellus shale.|","Fracture Conductivity, Plastic Deformation, Young's modulus, Rock Mechanics, Marcellus Shale",39

Unconventional gas/oil exploitation and stimulation depends strongly on the efficiency of the hydraulic fracturing (HF) treatment, via which connecting fracture networks are created and thus the conductivity for fluid flow in low-permeability reservoirs is enhanced. However, the cost related to hydraulic fracturing increases monotonically with the number of fractures. Therefore, methods to reduce the fracturing cost while still achieving the desired stimulation effect is an important factor to be considered in the hydraulic fracturing design. Although thermal effects on stress distribution and deformation have been recognized for decades, the effect of temperature change on shale gas stimulations has not receive enough attention. The injection of a cold fluid into a deep horizontal well can produce a large temperature difference between fluid and rock, for example, during the drilling of a horizontal well and later during the hydraulic fracturing of the well. This paper investigates numerically the thermal effects on the hydraulic fracture initiation and propagation for the condition of constant fluid pressure along the horizontal well by using the coupled 2D displacement discontinuity method (DDM) model, MineHF2D. In particular, the fluid pressure used is set to a value less than the required value in driving the growth of an open fracture with a finite length. And the thermal cooling induced tensile stress is needed for the fracture to extend. A comparison is carried out for the mechanical responses, such as fracture length and opening and fluid pressure, under different cooling conditions. The numerical results show that the fractures can propagate with the assistence of thermal cooling. The thermal cooling can increase the fracture aperture to facilitate fluid flow, although the fracture propagation speed is then relatively slowed down. It is aslso demonstrated that, the thermal cooling tensile stress can propagate multiple fractures and the reduction of fluid temperature in the horizontal well will reduce pressure to initiate fractures and potentially lower the cost of fracturing treatments.|","thermal effects, Displacement discontinuity method, Shale gas, hydraulic fracturing, Horizontal wellbore",21

Stresses induced near a hydraulic fracture are calculated in an elastoplastic Mohr-Coulomb type formation. While an effective compressive stress increase may reduce the permeability in the formation, the induced shear stresses and dilatant zone developed can increase the stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) and the size of an enhanced permeability zone. Therefore, the induced shear stresses and dilatant zone are used in this article in order to quantify the size of the SRV. It is emphasized that when the SRV can be characterized by elastic strains generated during a fracturing process, this reversible SRV may not be maintained during production. It is those irreversible SRV (ISRV) or dilatant volumetric strains that are the key for producing low-permeability reservoir economically. It is suggested therefore that a production enhancement in these formations is dominated by the possible ISRV which are quantified by the cohesion, the orientation of the natural fracture network and in-situ stress ratios.|","Stress-dependent Permeability, Stimulated Rerservoir Volume, Fracture Mechanics, Multiple fracturing, Induced Shear Stresses",42

Hydraulic fracturing is a very robust tool in terms of not only increasing production in tight reservoirs but also accelerating production from reservoirs with higher permeability and porosity. The success of a hydraulic fracturing treatment is highly correlated with control of the created fracture geometry. Control of fracture growth and geometry is challenging in formations where the boundary lithologies are not highly stressed compared to the pay zone, allowing out-of-zone migration of fractures. As several factors influence the growth and geometry of fractures, including the reservoir, wellbore, and fluid/proppant parameters, it requires a good understanding of reservoir parameters, including stress distribution along with appropriate use of corresponding wellbore components and fluid/proppant for successful and efficient results. Our objective is to outline the main differences between different fracture models along with the key parameters and their significance in fracture performance. 
Fracture treatment designs involve selecting fracturing fluids, additives, proppant materials, injection rate, pump schedule, and fracture dimensions. Although hydraulic fracturing has become more important due to development of unconventional resources in tight formations, the use of fracture models before implementation of the treatment is limited, leading to undesired fractures either with limited growth or propagation out of zone. Literature lacks a study that combines the evaluation of different fracture models in an optimization process where economics is taken into account with an objective function maximizing the net present value (NPV), providing detailed information on the financial side of this technical phenomenon, too. 
In this study, different numerical fracture models are used to design the fractures in a tight oil reservoir, the performance of designed fractures are analyzed to measure the success of different numerical models applied in design along with an overview of critical operational parameters together with the significance of parameters, including size, number, and location, phasing angle of perforations, fluid and proppant type, rock strength, porosity, and permeability on fracture design optimization? 
In our paper, a comprehensive literature review of previous studies on tight oil reservoirs and hydraulic fracturing provides a thorough theoretical comparison of fracture models used in oil industry along with the analysis of significance of each factor throughout the process of hydraulic fracturing tight oil reservoirs. An objective function that maximizes NPV is used in this study investigating the phenomenon not only from the physical but also the economical aspects of fracturing that is still an expensive but an effective way of production enhancement technique when applied wisely.|","economics, hydraulic fracturing, optimization, fracture modeling, fracture",42

We numerically investigate a potential fault activation in Tarim Basin, west China, during hydraulic fracturing operations, by considering rigorous coupled flow and geomechanics. In this study, we find that the fault can be activated by water injection, when it is nearly critically stressed, being sensitive to small changes in stress. Lower cohesion, lower frictional angle, and higher injection rate can activate the fault more easily. Interestingly, the fault becomes activated away from the hydraulic fracture, before the injected water reaches the fault plane. Then, when the hydraulic fracture meets the fault plane, the injected water changes the effective stress of the fault significantly, causing large shear failure. We also calculate the magnitudes of the seismic moment, which are low, because only limited areas of the fault plane are failed. Thus, from this preliminary numerical study of Tarim Basin, we can possibly consider the fault activation as a reservoir stimulation technique for the Tarim Basin field.|","Fault activation, Coupled flow and geomechanics, Numerical simulation, Hydraulic fracturing",46

We developed a fully coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) model for hydraulic fracturing treatments, which was verified via comparison to published literature. This model was then utilized to investigate complex fracture network propagation in naturally fractured reservoirs. Mixed finite volume and finite element methods were used to solve this coupled system, in which the MPFA L-method was employed to evaluate the fluid-heat, inter-element flux because of the existence of full tensor permeability caused by imbedded fractures. To elucidate the crossing behaviors as hydraulic fractures meet inclined natural fractures, we extended Gu et al.'s (2011) crossing criterion to a 3D scenario. Moreover, we integrated the modified Barton et al.'s model (Barton et al., 1985) proposed by Asadollahi (2009) to address the shear dilation process, which is helpful for accurately estimating the dynamical fracture aperture responding to changes of stresses, fluid pressure, and temperature. Numerical experiments showed that principal factors controlling the complexity of the induced fracture network included stress anisotropy, injection rate, natural fracture distribution (fracture dip angle, strike angle, spacing, density, and length), fracture filling properties (the degree of cementation and permeability), fracture surface properties (cohesion and friction angle), and tensile strength of intact rock. We found that: (1) the lower the injection rate and the smaller the stress anisotropy, the more complex fracture network the could be developed; (2) high tensile strength could increase the possibility of the occurrence of shear fractures; and (3) under the conditions of large permeability of fracture-filling combined with small cohesive strength and friction coefficient, shear slip could become the dominant mechanism for generating a complex fracture network. The model developed and the results presented can be used to understand the propagation of complex fracture networks and aid in the design and optimization of hydraulic fracturing treatments.|","3D crossing behavior, Complex fracture network, Shear dilation, Geomechanics, Thermal stress",46

Hydraulic fracture treatments may induce complex network geometries that are challenging to incorporate in numerical flow simulators. To capture this complexity, we propose a workflow that integrates a semi-stochastic Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) generator constrained by Microseismic events, core data and an efficient Perpendicular Bisector (PEBI) grid generator for the explicit discretization of the network. We applied this workflow to evaluate the effect of DFN related uncertainties on production performance. 
We developed a DFN model that constrains the location of natural fractures by microseismic events and samples fracture characteristics from core-data-based Probability Density Functions (PDFs). The model also interconnects natural and hydraulic fractures through a geomechanics-based algorithm. For an efficient fracture discretization, we developed a PEBI meshing technique capable to conform to low-angle intersections of extensively clustered network, incorporating optimization algorithms that reduce highly skewed cells, and ensure good mesh quality. Finally, to evaluate the impact of DFN related uncertainties on production, we implemented an efficient Monte Carlo (MC) methodology that minimizes flow simulations. 
We implemented the workflow in a stage of a hydraulic fracture treatment to evaluate the impact of two type of DFN related uncertainties on production: those coming from the randomness of DFN modeling and those coming from the lack of accurate knowledge of PDF parameters. We show that the proposed DFN modeling approach can be applied to calculate the ""Fluid-Producing DFN (FP-DFN),"" which is the network area connected to the well and able to produce, to minimize flow simulations for the MC runs. After performing efficient-based MC simulations with our DFN model, we were able to generate the FP-DFN Cumulative Density Function (CDF) incorporating the aforementioned uncertainties. From this CDF, different percentiles were selected with the respective DFN realizations for fluid simulations. We show that the developed PEBI meshing algorithm is capable to grid efficiently these complex DFN geometries with good mesh quality. Finally, 20-year production simulations suggest that a difference of several MSTB between the lowest and highest percentiles may exist revealing the effect of the DFN related uncertainties on production. 
Our integrated workflow provides a methodology to efficiently model and mesh explicitly complex DFN systems for numerical fluid simulations, incorporating microseismic and core data. Furthermore, this methodology, together with the implementation of an efficient MC technique, allows a quantitative evaluation of the impact on production forecast of DFN related uncertainties.|","Reservoir Simulation, Uncertainty Analysis, Microseismic Evaluation, Hydraulic Fracturing, Unconventional Liquid Reservoirs",1
308,309,181876-MS,Temperature Behavior of Multi-Stage Fracture Treatments in Horizontal Wells,"Li, Xinyang, Texas A&M University| Zhu, Ding, Texas A&M University","|Abstract 
Downhole temperature measured by distributed temperature sensors (DTS) shows distinct response to injection and shut-in during a multi-stage fracture treatment in horizontal wells. A thermal model predicting temperature distribution along the wellbore is essential to use the technology quantitatively diagnose the treatment. With inversion, the model can be used to translate downhole temperature measurement to downhole flow distribution, and therefore to estimate fracture efficiency. 
In this paper, we present a thermal/flow model that predict temperature distribution in a system that contains reservoir, wellbore, and fractures during fracture propagation and after shut-in the well. We coupled a wellbore flow model with a simple fracture propagation model to predict fracture half-length, and fluid distribution. For a single-stage fracture treatment, a transient wellbore thermal model is coupled with the fracture and formation thermal model, which are based on the energy conservation equation. A sequential simulation method is then applied for multi-stage fracture treatments by introducing a time control factor. Warm back of the entrained fracture fluid during shut-in periods is simulated while other stages are run by removing the fluid injection term and implementing corresponding boundary conditions. Numerical solutions are necessary for time dependent fluid-loss and complex non-linear heat exchange. Mass and energy conservation equations are solved by fully implicit finite difference approach for the conjointly gridding system. The results of the fracture and formation model are verified by analytical solutions for simplified cases. 
This paper provides synthetic case studies in a low-permeability reservoir using the integrated model. The influences of fluid distribution, fluid-loss due to natural and induced fractures, DTS deployment locations, and reservoir heat transfer parameters on temperature behavior are investigated for single-stage fracture treatment. At initiating and propagating of fractures, injection flowrate plays an important role on fracture half-length and leak-off front movements. Heat conduction is the dominant mechanism governing temperature response during shut-in. Using the algorithm for single-stage treatment, a work flow for multi-stage fracture simulation is created by performing a single-stage stimulation, shutting in the stage, and moving to the next stage along the wellbore. Large temperature signal change occurred at fractured locations during the injection period, and warm back behavior is observed after shut-in of the well due to the large temperature difference between the injection fluid and the formation. For a shale reservoir, the time scale to reach thermal equilibrium is on the order of weeks. Observed sensitivity to fluid distribution, fluid-loss, DTS fiber cable locations, and reservoir parameters in proposed examples allow for fracture diagnosis using distributed temperature data during stimulation operations. 
The methodology can be a complimentary component to a model that predict temperature behavior during production to provide better boundary condition, and it can also be a stand-alone tool to analyze fracture injection fluid distribution.|","Modeling of the Fracture Stimulation Operation, Multi-Stage Fracture Treatments, Thermal Model, Distributed Temperature Sensing, Fracture Diagnostics",1

Multi-stage fracturing is currently the most effective method to exploit tight sand reservoirs. Various analytical models have been proposed to fast and accurately investigate post-fracturing pressure- and rate-transient behaviors, and hence, estimate key parameters that affect well performance. However, these models mainly consider 2D flow, neglecting fluids flow from upper/lower reservoir when vertical fractures partially penetrate the reservoir. Although for linear flow model, Olarewaju et al. (1989) and Azari et al. (1990, 1991) have studied the effects of fracture height, they merely used a skin factor. Moreover, reservoir heterogeneity is seldom included. This paper presents an analytical model for multi-stage fractured horizontal wells (MFHWs) in tight sand reservoirs, accounting for upper/lower reservoir contributions, reservoir heterogeneity and threshold-pressure gradient (TPG). 
The model is extended from ""five flow region"" model and subdivides the reservoir into seven parts including two upper/lower flow regions, two outer flow regions, two inner flow regions and hydraulic fracture flow region. Reservoir heterogeneity along the horizontal wellbore is considered, thus, the fracture distribution can be various, and fracture pattern optimization strategies are documented. Fracture interference is simulated by locating a no-flow boundary between two adjacent fractures. The exact locations of no-flow boundaries are determined based on boundary's pressure which is a function of time and space. Thus, the no-flow boundary has minimum pressure difference between its two sides during the well production, making the no-flow assumption reasonable. The experimentally observed TPG and pressure drop within the horizontal wellbore are included. 
Modeling results are compared with those from well-testing software KAPPA Ecrin, obtaining a good match in most flow regimes. Specifically, the effects of upper/lower reservoir contributions and TPG are studied under constant-rate and constant-pressure conditions respectively. Log-log dimensionless pressure, pressure-derivative and production type curves are generated. Results suggest that fracture penetration ratio dominates the early-middle time pressure response. The start time of boundary-dominate flow are significantly influenced by penetration ratio. The larger the penetration ratio is, the earlier boundary-dominate flow regime will arrive. As for production response, with penetration ratio increases, the early dimensionless rate becomes larger, indicating higher flow rate, however, the late-time (tD>10) production becomes smaller, that is, the production declines quicker when penetration ratio is large. When TPG is considered, differences in both pressure and production response mainly appear in middle-late time. Greater TPG results in higher pressure drop and accelerates production decline. But this influence is marginal when TPG is small (TPG<0.4psi/ft). Effects of other relative parameters, such as formation permeability, heterogeneity, fracture length, conductivity, and wellbore storage are systematically investigated. Besides, field data are analyzed and compared graphically, using type curve matching, and reliable results are obtained. 
Low CPU demands and minimal data requirement of this model enable the operators to predict well testing results under different fracture patterns in a simple but effective way.|","threshold pressure gradient, analytical model, multi-stage fractured horizontal well, tight sand reservoir",11

With the recent development on several shale gas plays in the Sichuan Basin, shale gas has emerged as one of the viable and economical energy options in China. The drilling and completion practices are mostly echoed the success of shale gas developments in US, and hydraulic fracturing treatments are primarily dominated by slickwater owing to its low cost and benefit in maximizing the stimulated reservoir volume (SRV). However, these shale plays are usually in high tectonic stress environment, complex in geological structures and usually with rich natural fractures, which are quite different from most of the plays in US with relatively simple structure and more relaxed stress environment. Thus, critical design parameters for hydraulic fracturing that drive the production performance still remain unclear with the lack of integrated production evaluation. 
Although microseismic mapping results were widely collected and used for the SRV estimation and post treatment evaluations, it cannot provide the insight of effective SRV or underlying production mechanisms because of the uncertainty in correlating micro-seismicity with hydraulic fracture propagation and proppant placement. A direct production comparison with different treatment types and design strategy would often lead to inappropriate conclusions due to too many variables involved in reservoir quality, stresses, completion design and flowback practices. Thus it is necessary to apply an integrated approach to obtain a thorough understanding of production performance in relation to fracturing design and flowback management. 
This paper discusses an integrated workflow that incorporates all the valuable data into production evaluation, and presents the detailed analysis on the horizontal wells in Longmaxi shale gas reservoirs in Huangjinba block. The workflow starts with the use of 3D geological models to build numerical reservoir models that honor key features of reservoir heterogeneity, and advanced fracture modeling to integrate 3D geomechanics and microseismic results into fracture simulations and provide inputs to reservoir models for production history matching. 
The study revealed the stress sensitivity in all the wells in which the fracture system starts to deteriorate when the effective stress reaches the critical value, resulted in many perforation clusters not contributing to production due to the loss of connectivity to wellbore. This leads to an important conclusion that fracture conductivity is equally important as the SRV for such a high stress shale gas play, and the treatment strategy shall be recalibrated from current slickwater treatments that do not provide sufficient fracture conductivity due to low proppant concentration as well as challenges of proppant placement experienced in many stages. This study has provided a much better understanding of production mechanism and effectiveness of stimulation treatments, as well as a list of design changes and actions on the flowback management to overcome current production challenges.|","Shale Gas, Sichuan Basin, Production Mechanism, Integrated Production Evaluation, Numeric Model",16

The Glauconite Formation in southern Chile is an unconventional resource made up of approximately forty percent clay and glauconite, thirty-four percent feldspar, twenty-three percent quartz, and three percent tuff. Like many unconventional reservoirs outside the United States, establishing commercial production from the Glauconite Formation was difficult given the make-up of the reservoir, the availability of equipment and materials, and the logistics associated with drilling, completing, and fracture stimulating wells in a remote area like Tierra del Fuego in southern Chile. 
This paper describes the effort to establish commercial production from the Glauconite Formation beginning with a couple of marginal wells in late 2011 through a nearly seventy-five well development by early 2016. As part of this effort, a basis of fracture design was established by developing a profile with depth of in-situ stress, Young's Modulus, and leak-off coefficient. These geomechanical assumptions were then tested and modified with core and pump-in data and used to make revisions to the fracture stimulation design. The designs were optimized to ensure that the critical fracture dimensions (fracture length, conductivity, and height) were achieved to maximize well performance. 
Next, a data collection plan was developed to capture key information about completions, mini-frac analysis, fracture design and execution, fluid, proppant, and chemical additives, reservoir quality, and post fracture flowback and clean-up data. The database was then utilized to monitor the Glauconite fracture stimulation program to ensure that the basis of design for the fracture program maintains viability and to ensure that the appropriate equipment and materials were mobilized for fracture optimization and to meet the program objectives. 
This paper focuses on the key elements of well completions and fracture stimulation practices as they apply to tight gas and unconventional formations by using the database to manage project risks and develop appropriate mitigation strategies. For example, preliminary fracture stimulation designs were based on initial reservoir permeability estimates of 4 md, however, the data collection plan incorporated a well test program which determined that the actual reservoir permeability was nearly one thousand times less. 
Another example was the rock mechanics and geomechanical data derived from dipole sonic logs indicated little in-situ stress contrast and raised concerns about the ability to achieve the desired fracture dimensions. In addition, the log derived Young's Modulus was low and inconsistent with the core tri-axial compression and ultrasonic data as well as the on-site mini-frac net pressure data. As a result, a number of tri-axial compression tests were conducted and it was determined that the Young's Modulus was much higher than indicated from the logs. The collected data and monitoring program resulted in significant treatment modifications ranging from the small cross-linked stimulations conducted initially to linear gel, hybrids, and ultimately treated water fracture stimulations as equipment and materials became available.

In order to predict fracture propagation in naturally fractured reservoir, several fracturing models have been proposed. Especially, for analyzing interaction between hydraulic fracture and natural fracture, previous models have limits in representing fracture propagation, taking into account multiple planar fracture only with opening mode in fracture mechanics. When hydraulic fracture non-orthogonally encounters natural fracture, hydraulic fracture tip shears along natural fracture interface and then propagates into matrix once it meets the boundary of elastic region. Therefore, not only opening mode but sliding mode also needs to be considered in fracture propagation analysis. In this study, we proposed hydraulic fracture propagation model considering geomechanical factors as functions of Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus using multiple planar fracture with mixed mode by linearly superposing opening and sliding modes. 
The proposed model was used to analyze the fracture propagating behavior for different shales of Marcellus, Barnett, and Eagle Ford with respect to geomechanical properties. From the results of sensitivity analysis for Poisson's ratio, Young's modulus, and stress anisotropy on crossing angle of hydraulic fracture into natural fracture, it indicated that Young's modulus is mostly sensitive among geomechanical properties on fracture crossing angle. As Poisson's ratio and stress anisotropy increase, or as Young's modulus decreases, hydraulic fracture can easily penetrate into natural fracture. In the aspects of fracture mechanics, as Young's modulus increases, the implementation of sliding mode is more significant, whereas, almost no effect regardless of magnitude of Poisson’ ratio or stress anisotropy. Based on the results of sensitivity analysis, the proposed model was run for Marcellus, Barnett, and Eagle Ford shales having different geomechanical characteristics for examining the importance of sliding mode. From the results, since Poisson's ratio is low and Young's modulus is high in Barnett shale, the largest effect of sliding mode was yielded due to its highly brittle characteristics, in which this shale presents larger deformation in longitudinal direction than transverse. Meanwhile, in Marcellus shale, hydraulic fracture more easily crosses natural fracture with low value of crossing angle, because its Young's modulus is lower than Barnett shale, consequently, the implementation of sliding mode is less dominating. Furthermore, since Eagle Ford, representing higher Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus than Barnett shale, shows higher deformation in transverse direction by local stress change, the fracture crossing angle was estimated as higher value than Barnett shale. That is, hydraulic fracture is difficult to cross natural fracture, and thereafter, propagating direction of fracture is highly deviated. Therefore, particularly in Eagle Ford, the model with mixed mode was found to be extremely important on fracture propagating behaviors. As overall result, hydraulic fracture propagates diversely corresponding to shale characteristics as well as the existence of natural fracture, the stimulated reservoir volumes were estimated quite differently.|","stimulated reservoir volume, sliding mode, geomechanics, hydraulic fracture propagation, naturally fractured shale reservoir",21

This work presents a model for refracturing horizontal wells employing diverting agents. The goal is to quantitatively model the placement of diverting agents and fracture propagation, when re-stimulating the entire wellbore with multiple clusters of perforations accepting fluid. The model can be used to help estimate the outcome of refracturing and provide recommendations for refrac treatment design. 
Three types of perforations are identified before a refract operation: propped-depleted fractures, unpropped-depleted fractures and new perforations that have not been previously fractured. In the simulation, fractures are discretized into segments for leak off, pressure drop and width calculations. Fracture width and propagation are correlated to pressure by PKN fracture model. During refrac, the fluid distribution is calculated by a flow resistance model, and is shown to gradually divert from low pore-pressure zones to high pore-pressure zones by diverting agent stages. This diversion process is reflected in the increase of fracturing pressure for each successive stage in the refrac treatment. When bottom-hole pressure reaches a critical value, the propped-depleted fractures will widen. 
Two simple test scenarios are presented to show the fluid diversion process. A field refracturing treatment in the Haynesville Shale is simulated next. For the field case, a complete simulation workflow of the initial fracturing treatment, production history match and refracturing treatment was completed. The production history was simulated using a coupled geomechanical reservoir model to account for the pore pressure and stress change. The refracturing treatment simulation was performed using the model presented in this paper. The modeled bottom-hole pressure (BHP) during the refracturing treatment is compared with field data and matched the field BHP trend very well. This match can be expected to provide an estimate of the fluid diversion process. The estimated propped fracture length after refrac can be used for production prediction. Questions such as the amount of diverting agent to use, the desired diverting agent permeability as well as maximum diverting agent stages are explored based on the simulation results.|","horizontal wells, model, refracturing, diverting agent",21

Proppants are placed in fractures to provide highly conductive paths for hydrocarbons to flow from the reservoir to the wellbore. Hydraulic fracturing technology is constantly improving to achieve better production performance. Ultra-lightweight (ULW) proppants are one of the technologies introduced to improve fracturing effectiveness. Compared to sand, ULW proppants can be carried farther and distributed more evenly within fractures, resulting in more propped fracture area. This paper evaluates the impact of ULW proppants on production performance in tight reservoirs and examines characteristics of formations where ULW proppants are most beneficial. 
To explore the advantages of ULW, hydraulic fracture models are developed. These models help in understanding the fracture geometric properties. This information is then incorporated into reservoir production models to evaluate the impact on production performance. Fractures using ULW proppants and the resulting well productivity are compared to those using sand. No technology provides a solution for all situations, and neither do ULW proppants. To better understand if ULW proppants bring the most benefit for production performance, data-mining techniques were used to identify ULW proppant field applications. 
Results showed that ULW proppants had better vertical distribution within the fractures than sand (sand had a tendency to settle to the lower part of fractures, leaving the upper part unpropped). In a thick reservoir formation with insufficient vertical conductivity, fractures created by ULW proppants connected larger volumes of rock, leading to higher well productivity and increased EUR. 
This study discusses the benefits that ULW proppants can bring to unconventional producers and identifies potential candidate formations where ULW proppant may be very effective. Field cases are included to show the benefits of ULW and the circumstances where they can bring the most value.|","field cases, numerical simulations, ultra-lightweight proppant",24

Using a BEM-based hydraulic fracture model and the Coulomb frictional law, the generation of slip and shear rupturing produced by fluid injection is investigated. A wide range of factors can contribute to injection-induced seismicity. In addition to injection rate, fluid viscosity and existing permeability, several other factors are considered in this paper to determine their effects on slip development during continuous fluid injection and during shut-in. These factors include dilatant strengthening, slip weakening of frictional coefficients, structural complexities along a rupturing path like jogs and branches and the application of far-field wave-form stresses. The numerical method is summarized and the theoretical formulation of the above physical processes associated with generation of seismic events is provided. The numerical results show a rich and complex local slip rate change during extension of the slip zone. Under fluid injection, the slip can first produce a seismic event either caused by rapidly increasing pressure or by abrupt slip initiation, and then slows. When the permeability is large enough, the slip pattern manifests itself as long-term slow slip period coupled with aseismic slip transients. The long-duration and low-magnitude seismic events are associated with the slipping state in the conditionally stable regime, in which fluid pressure is marginally equal to a value required to produce slip using the effective stress and the static frictional strength. A small perturbation in the fluid pressure caused by any of the above factors can stop and/or generate relatively faster slip rates. The slip continues varying with time after shut-in in the presence of the above influencing factors. The slow slip on a fault, which is difficult to detect by seismology, could be a significant process in dissipating elastic strain energy during hydraulic fracturing stimulations. In addition, the model can capture a tendency of the slip rate to become significantly large. The results demonstrate the importance of fracture and fault permeability enhancement on variations of fluid pressure and slip rates.|","numerical modelling, fully coupled deformation and flow, Coulomb's friction, Source mechanism of microseisimicity",5

Production rapid decline is the major problem for the tight sandstone reservoirs in Jilin oilfield. For the particular reservoir investigated in this study, production is not only subjected to the reservoir properties, but also the well completion designs especially fracturing. A comprehensive study has been conducted for multi-stage fractured horizontal wells. New fracturing improvement strategies are presented in this paper for future operations in the studied field and also those who may have similar tight sandstone reservoirs to share. 
Through the integrated studies of the petrophysical characteristics, geomechanical properties and fracturing data from the fractured wells of the tight oil reservoirs in Jilin Field, numerous fracturing modeling scenarios were compared with actual fracturing monitoring data. A fully three dimension finite element simulation, associated with the analytical result from earlier production data, and the theory of interaction between fracture clusters, were built in this study. We conducted the inversing design parameters from the multi-stage hydraulic fracture with some monitoring data to improve the understanding of the reservoir properties. Additionally, a calibrated geomechanical stress model for a completed well in this field was built. At the end, the production model was presented. Data was provided to facilitate later comparison with the actual multi-stage hydraulic fracture production and valuable lessons have learned through those iteration studies. 
With thoroughly trained and well calibrated model, a new fracturing strategy has been developed for the studied tight oil field. The best NPV can be achieved with the optimal fracture conductivity, fracture geometry and well performance. But first of all, the most valuable lesson we learned is that, the Effective Propped Volume (EPV) is the dominating factor for the fractured well performance, instead of the so-called Stimulated Reservoir Volume (SRV). SRV is a misinterpreted concept yet un-calculable. By adopting a numerical simulator and a proficient technology, we developed the most suitable design (perforation, fracture spacing etc.) and the fluid system (slick water, linear gel etc.) for this reservoir so that the optimal fracture geometry and fracture conductivity can be achieved. Besides that, the fracture geometry and proppant distribution were simulated. The simulated oil production data from the finite element fracture and production software is highly matched with the recorded oil production data. 
An adaptability evaluation was conducted along with this study. To ensure the relevance and the authenticity of design, we analyzed the effective factors of treating material from both the laboratory and the field data in this field. A novel fracturing fluid system was applied. The fluids are more effective and leave less damage to the formation.|","Net Present Value, Improvement strategies, Effective  Propped Volume vs SRV, horizontal well multi-stage fracture, Fracture optimization",58

Preventation of shale formation damage by fracturing fluid-rock interactions plays an important role in well production performance and subsequent refracturing design. In this paper, the effect of converting typically hydrophilic fracture surface to hydrophobic ones on fluid-induced damage and softening is investigated. In particular, nanoindentation experiments were employed to characterize changes in the mechanical properties of shale samples with different surface treatments. 
Shale samples were treated by octadecyltrimethoxysilane (OTMS) to convert the initially hydrophilic surfaces to hydrophobic ones, followed by inundation in water to allow for fluid-rock interactions. Nanoindentation testing was then conducted on the samples to characterize hardness, Young's modulus, and fracture toughness to examine the effect of fluid-rock interactions on shale mechanical properties and whether surface treatment can mitigate shale-softening. Its unique advantage is that the near-surface properties (but not the entire bulk sample) can be characterized, thus elucidating how water-rock interactions migrate from the surface to the interior of the rock. 
Results obtained from nanoindentation testing were analyzed by statistical analysis and by a proposed clay matrix criterion. Different treatments lead to variable alterations to rock properties. The hardness and Young's modulus exhibit a reciprocal steady state trend at certain depths. Samples with hydrophobic surfaces exhibit a higher resistance to fluid-shale interactions, as reflected by a 40% higher hardness, a 25% higher Young's modulus, and a 35% higher fracture toughness, when compared with untreated shale samples. The untreated rock actually shows a 48% reduction in hardness, a 27% reduction in Young's modulus, and a 43% reduction in fracture toughness in the rock interior. This study also demonstrates that nanoindentation testing provides multiple advantages in characterizing the fracturing fluid-rock interactions at the micro/nano scale, since these interactions start from the rock surface and propagate to the interior without significantly involving the bulk rock. Nanoindentation testing is competent in characterizing micromechanically fluid-shale interactions and how surface treatment can mitigate the softening of shales.|","Fluid-Shale Interactions, Hardness, Nanoindentation, OTMS, Young's modulus",48

Keshen Gas Field is part of Kuqa Foreland thrust belt, located in Southern foothill of Tianshan Mountain, northern margin of the Tarim basin, West China. The main pay zone, Cretaceous Bashijiqike (K1bs), has extreme reservoir conditions of ultra-deep (6500-8000 m), high temperature (170-190°C), high pressure (110-120 MPa)(HTHP). Thick salt and gypsum layers with high dip angle above the pay zone also increase safety concerns during drilling and completion. Because of its low porosity (2-7%), low matrix permeability (0.001-0.5 md) and high heterogeneity of nature fractures (NF), well production rates vary largely, ranging from zero to 300,000 m3/d. Stimulation has become the only way to enhance single well performance and gain economic production for the long run. Finding controlling factors for well production and effective workflow is the key to realize efficient field development for this tight gas reservoir. 
In this study, an integrated workflow covering comprehensive reservoir characterization (evaluations of geology, geophysics, geomechanics and reservoir engineering), engineering design and execution (stimulation design and operation) was formulated and conducted to discover main controlling factors which influence production. Firstly, wells were divided in three groups based on their current production rates. Wells in best group have good production in DST tests and higher production after stimulation. Wells in better group have no production in DST tests but obtaining good production after stimulation. Wells in bad group have no production in DST tests, yet very low production after stimulation. Then correlate well production with structure, reservoir property, geomechanics and natural fracture properties to reveal the key controlling factors. Further study was focused on combining multiple parameters to decipher productivity secret based on multi-domain evaluation results. Lastly it was found out that the well performance in this field is controlled by both Stress and NF, i.e. the angle (?) between NF and the maximum horizontal stress. When ? is small, well productivity is good. Otherwise well productivity is poor. According to this new finding, different stimulation methods were chosen, designed and executed in the field. 
Through integrated study on different levels, from core analysis to reservoir evaluation, the main factors controlling the tight gas field productivity were deciphered. Together with the understanding of the reservoir, the selection criteria for well stimulation were formulated with the intersection angle?. After application of study results in stimulation design, gas production shows significant improvement: the average daily production rate increases 50% per well.|","Productivity, Tight Gas, Stimulation optimise, Natural Fracture, Integrated study",63

Currently, staged multi-cluster perforation fracturing was proved to be an efficient method to achieve the maximum stimulated reservoir volume in unconventional reservoir stimulation. However, an extensive work was conducted to study the influences of net fracturing pressure, fractures spacing and in-situ stresseses. However, the pore-pressure distribution, may affecting hydraulic fracture growth, was not well understood. Therefore experimental and numerical simulation are used to study the influence of pore-pressure distribution on sequential and simultaneous fracturing in tight sandstone. 
In this paper, the experiments are divided into two categories, to investigate the interference of staged fracture propagations in porous sandstone subjected to true tri-axial stresses. Two independent fluid pumps are used to control the growth of two neighboring fractures. After the experiment, the specimens are sliced to analyze fracture paths. Then 3D fluid-solid coupling model is applied to simulate fracture propagation under the influence of pore-pressure distribution. Both experimental results and numerical modeling with pore pressure show attraction between the adjacent fractures, instread of repulsion in both sequential and simultaneous fracturing in experiments. More specifically, when the ratios of fracture spacing to fracture half-length are small, the fractures turn towards and coalesce with each other. And when the ratios of fracture spacing to fracture half-length are large, there is no obvious interference between the fractures. Consequently, among the parameters, other than net fracturing pressure, the fracture spacing and in-situ stresses, pore-pressure distribution plays a vital role on the fracture propagation, which leads to non-planar and asymmetric bi-wing fractures. The influences of pore pressure can attribute to shear failure of rocks, caused by reduced effective stress. Thus, increasing the perforation clusters interval can lower the possibility of deflection or coalescence of the multi-fractures, which promotes the performance of staged multi-cluster perforation hydraulic fracturing in tight sandstone.|","Staged multi-cluster perforation fracturing, Pore-pressure Distribution, Tight Sandstone, Propagation Interferences, Multi-fractures",28
320,321,181856-MS,Comprehensive Global Fracture Calibration Model,"Liu, Guoqing, Texas A&M University| Ehlig-Economides, Christine, University of Houston| Sun, Jianlei, Texas A&M University","|Abstract 
Up to now, only one study has provided a global model for the fracture calibration test, but this model included only normal closure with homogenous reservoir behavior after closure. Recent work has revealed new models for abnormal before-closure leakoff behaviors. This study combines normal and abnormal leakoff behaviors with a more general after-closure reservoir model that incorporates a wellbore storage analog and dual-porosity heterogeneity. 
The new global model will mimic the previously successful strategy using splines to connect fully general before- and after-closure behaviors. 
The resulting model permits highly insightful sensitivity studies addressing plausible combinations of abnormal leakoff behaviors and likely after-closure features. For instance, parameters that can be quantitatively determined include flow friction, fracture dimensions, leakoff coefficient, natural fracture properties, fracture closure pressure, and permeability, formation pressure, etc. Field data will be matched before and after closure using the new global model. 
Matches with field data reflect highly enhanced understanding of the nature of hydraulic fracturing and naturally fractured flow mechanisms that have not been possible up to now and that greatly refine well design strategies. Compared with the traditional piecewise before- and after-closure analysis, many more parameters can be quantified from the complete global fracture model, and it provides more insight on the main fracturing design and post-treatment production estimation. The global history match ensures consistence and validity of the model well beyond what can be achieved with isolated before- or after-closure analysis.|","Natural fracture, Before closure analysis, After closure analysis, DFIT, Fracture Calibration Test",23

Shell and PetroChina are partnering in a pioneering Joint Cooperation Project in the Sichuan Basin targeting the Lower Silurian Longmaxi shale gas play. Since 2010, over 20 wells, including both verticals and horizontals, have been drilled and completed with various hydraulic fracturing technologies. Unlike most of the North American shale plays, the Sichuan Longmaxi shale play is characterized by abnormal formation pressure, closure pressure close to overburden, low stress anisotropy, and regionally active tectonics, all of which contribute unique challenges to hydraulic fracturing stimulation. The combination of these geological challenges results in high treating pressures, difficulty in proppant placement, constrained fracture height growth and complex fracture geometry. Under such subsurface complexity, an optimal completion design requires insightful understanding of the geological settings and reservoir characteristics, as well as a large number of wells for technology trials in a ""trial and error"" approach, which often results in a large capital investment and a long value realization cycle time. 
To meet these challenges, an advanced workflow that integrates geomechanics modelling for hydraulic fracture simulation and 3D reservoir modelling for well performance using reservoir simulator is developed in collaboration with Shell global experts in unconventional resources. This workflow provided a much more economical and efficient solution in understanding the reservoir responses to hydraulic fracturing, quantification of estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) ranges, and potential maximum EUR uplift by increasing completion intensity or technical limit EUR. 
The geomechanics modeling workflow (Bai et al. 2016) is a truly 3-D hydraulic fracture simulation platform that integrates structural framework, stress setting, formation characterization, flow dynamics, hydraulic fracturing monitoring, and well completion parameters into a finite-element based modeling environment. Key capabilities that distinguish this platform from conventional hydraulic fracture simulators are the ability to model complex fracture initiation and propagation as a consequence of natural fracture systems, hybrid stress regimes, and formation heterogeneity. Once calibrated with hydraulic fracturing field diagnostics, the model performs hundreds of numerical runs accounting for multiple subsurface realizations and well completion design scenarios. The optimized well completion design is selected based on the modelled Stimulated Rock Volume (SRV) that corresponds to increased EUR at optimized costs. Two suites of models were built for this study, each of which represents key play segment in the concession block in terms of profitability and materiality. EUR uplift potential is identified through optimizing well placement and completion design, such as well orientation, landing interval, pump rate and job volume, perforation spacing, and stage spacing. 
With the hydraulic fracture or SRV geometries derived from the geomechanics modelling, the reservoir simulation workflow was then performed to evaluate EUR uncertainty and estimate the EUR uplift based on geomechanics modeling results hydraulic fracture or SRV geometries from both the reference and optimized cases. These derived hydraulic fracture geometries and their corresponding SRVs were built in the reservoir simulation model and history matched to generate EUR ranges through multiple-realizations.|","Unconventional, Completion Optimization, Sichuan, Fracturing Modelling, Shale Gas",27

Egypt's Western Desert contains a series of basins underlain by organic-rich shales that provide the source for conventional hydrocarbon. The primary objectives for exploring the gas-rich shale plays and unconventional reservoirs in the Western Desert were to evaluate the Middle Jurassic Khatatba source rock reservoir qualities, demonstrate the availability of reserves, and identify optimal technology to maximize productivity of unconventional low-permeability reservoirs, stimulation, and testing strategies. 
In 2014, a vertical exploratory data well was drilled and completed in the appraisal program before the completion of horizontals in this formation. Logs, core testing, and analysis service data were performed on or collected from this well. A stimulation model was built, which integrated petrophysical and geomechanical data. This model was used to aid the completion and stimulation design, including fracturing fluids and proppant selections. One-stage hydraulic fracturing was implemented, and the well was then flowed back and produced. 
The Khatatba Shale was systematically studied in this work. Various methods were used to understand this source rock. A geological study identified the lithostratigraphic section of the Khatatba Shale formations by collecting core samples. Core tests measured total organic carbon (TOC), brittleness, and sensitivity to fluid. These understandings helped reduce uncertainty during hydraulic fracturing operations. A successful hydraulic fracturing treatment was performed for this formation, which showed that low-viscosity fracture fluid can be used as the treatment fluid to carry proppant into the formation. During fracturing, near-wellbore (NWB) multiple fractures can be an issue. From an operational point of view, there might be options better than performing high-rate fracturing treatments. The lessons learned from this work and presented in this paper helped define completion and stimulation technologies for horizontal wells. 
This paper presents hydraulic fracturing treatment of the first shale gas well in Egypt for the Khatatba formation. Lessons learned about geochemical, rock mechanical, and petrophysical properties of this shale formation and their effects on hydraulic fracturing and production formed the basis for subsequent development of various shale plays in Egypt and worldwide.|","unconventional resources, Hydraulic Fracturing best practices, shale gas development",14

Experimental measurements of the fracture conductivity and rock mechanical properties are presented for the five different geological facies of the Eagle Ford shale (A, B, C, D and E) as defined by Donovan el al. (2012). In this classification, facies A lies right above the Buda limestone, followed by facies B which has the highest total organic content and production. This study places emphasis in this zone. Facies A and B are known as the lower Eagle Ford shale, whereas facies C, D and E are known as the upper Eagle Ford shale. Facies E underlies the Austin chalk. Conductivity samples in three orientations and core plugs in two orientations were obtained from outcrops samples. The orientations represent vertical fractures with flow in the horizontal direction (X0 orientation) or flow in the vertical direction (X90 orientation), and horizontal fractures with horizontal flow (Z orientation). 
Short term fracture conductivity experiments were performed using a modified API conductivity cell at room temperature. Unpropped and propped conductivities were measured with gas flow. Low proppant concentration was used in order to simulate a slick-water treatment. Proppants of various sizes were placed manually on a rough fracture face. The fracture faces were scanned with a surface profilometer to calculate the fracture roughness. Compressive triaxial tests were performed on the core plugs in order to determine the elastic rock properties such as Young's Modulus and Poisson's Ratio. Additionally, Brinell hardness tests were completed to determine the resistance to embedment. Mineral composition was acquired by X-ray Diffraction analysis. 
The obtained fracture conductivities were compared to the fracture face roughness, elastic mechanical properties, Brinell hardness and mineralogy of the samples. It was found that propped and unpropped conductivities decline exponentially with closure stress. Propped conductivity was found to be dominated by proppant characteristics. Conductivity is positively related to rock brittleness and inversely related to Poisson's ratio. For the samples cut perpendicular to the bedding, no significant difference was found for between horizontal flow (X0) and vertical flow (X90). The parallel-bedding samples (Z) in general have lower conductivity compared with the perpendicular-bedding (both X0 and X90). Within facies B, samples with flow on the bedding plane (Z) were found to have the lowest conductivity. 
The findings of this study provide useful information to understand the outcomes of fracture stimulation in Eagle Ford, and therefore to assist fracture treatment design.|","rock mechanics, fracture conductivity",46

This paper describes the safety and cost benefits as an onshore operator shifts from conventionally stacked (i.e. bowl and slip type wellheads) to unitized wellhead systems while transitioning from exploration to development phase. There was a paradigm shift in operational safety coupled with multi-million dollars of cost savings during the course of development drilling spanning across 500+ wells. This paper draws a detailed comparison between conventional and unitized wellheads elaborating on the safety as well as operational aspects. 
The timing of full-fledged deployment of unitized systems by the operator coincided with development of the operator$s onshore Rajasthan block. The unitized wellheads had been previously deployed by the operator in a number of offshore platform wells. Hence, the operator had sufficient data to demonstrate that the overall economics was in favor of using unitized wellheads. Until 2007, mostly conventional wellheads were used by the operator across nearly 140 exploration wells. Thereafter, unitized wellheads were extensively used during development drilling in Rajasthan post 2009. The unitized wellhead plays a major role in ensuring two barriers throughout drilling and completion operations, which is a requirement in the NORSOK standards. Through careful scope definition and technical evaluation, the operator had ensured incorporation of a number of safety/operational critical specifications of the unitized wellheads including surface casing hanger landing rings, diverter adaptors, mandrel casing hangers, integral lockdown for casing hanger pack-offs, metal-end-cap seals, multi-stage compact bowls, quick make-up BOP adaptors, tubing hangers with integral body seals, TWCV (Two-way-check-valve) profiles, bonnet-LMV (Lower-master-valve) interface with dual seal provision etc. In contrast, the slip-and-bowl systems are associated with time consuming and relatively risky operations such as casing string space-outs, wait-on-cement, hot cuts, cold cuts, welding of riser/wellhead, nippling down of BOP with less than two physical barriers, BOP/wellhead housing installation after every hole section, dependence on cement sheath as sole barrier, risk of leaking lock down screws etc. 
The time saving unitized wellhead has translated into well construction cost savings for Rajasthan development wells drilled by the operator. Though the cost of unitized wellheads is approximately 20%-40% higher than the conventional wellheads, the rig time savings and the resultant cost savings clearly offset the higher cost of unitized equipment/service in the Rajasthan onshore environment, both in development and exploration drilling. This is a step change from the previous belief that the unitized systems would only be economical for offshore operations. In addition, the usage of unitized wellheads offers safety advantages in terms of maintaining well barriers and brings greater efficiency and quality into well construction operations.|","Unitized, Unitized wellhead, Multi bowl wellhead, Compact wellhead",17

This work briefly reviews the literature reported in the References section on a widened mud weight window (MWW) by wellbore strengthening, including both hydraulic plugging and stress cage for shale formations with natural fractures. The workflow for designing the mud density for hydraulic plugging and the effectiveness of stress caging are presented. An example of widening the MWW is presented with a simplified model for a well section in a shale gas formation in a field in southwest China. With numerical simulation, the following conclusions are obtained: (1) the task of widening the MWW with the value of 1.66 lbm/gal can be realized by opening the fracture to 1.285 mm with hydraulic plugging; (2) the mud weight pressure required to create this value of 1.285 mm fracture opening is 39 MPa, which corresponds to a 15-lbm/gal mud weight gradient (i.e., 1.81 g/cm3 mud density); (3) because the value of the fracture opening is determined to be 1.285 mm, the size of the lost circulation materials (LCMs) is chosen accordingly. 
The case study described in this paper provides a workflow of widening the MWW for safely drilling through a naturally fractured shale formation. A best practice of this type of MWW design is also presented.|","numerical modeling, hydraulic plug, natural fracture, widened mud weight window, shale gas formation",5

Constructing wells in reservoirs with high concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) is a challenge in itself. In South East Asia region drilling campaign in a high-CO2 reservoir was made even more difficult because of high well deviation, long production sections, a narrow drilling window, and loss of circulation. Prior attempts to develop the field established that this reservoir would not be easily exploited. One complicating factor was that the reservoir has multiple stacked layers of sand up to 8 zones in each well, These zones have different pressure regimes that are spread out in the reservoir section of average 3,000 meters per well. Effective mud removal is essential to achieve zonal isolation in these wells because mud left behind the cement will likely result in communication between the zones. In order to realize the long-term production plans for these offshore wells, the operator needed a fit-for-purpose cementing solution. 
The operator was able to successfully overcome the aforementioned challenges and successfully cement seven wells using a system that incorporate blast furnace slag (BFS). The wells were drilled with a jackup rig in a water depth of 90 m [274 ft]. A cement evaluation log and the absence of sustained casing pressure confirm that there have been no zonal isolation concerns since the first well started producing in November 2013. The BFS system has proven to be cost effective and has the added advantage of being compatible with the existing cementing equipment without any special modifications.|","carbon dioxide, zonal isolation, cementing, south east asia",63

It is generally recognized that oil influx from pay zones creates high-temperature fluid streams in Underbalanced drilling (UBD) and increases drilling cost due to bore hole complications. However there is lack of an accurate and simple method to predict the fluid temperature that is necessary for taking actions to prevent down hole complications. This study fills the gap. A simple analytical method was developed to replace sophisticated mathematics involving numerical solution procedure. The analytical model includes closed form equations for predicting the fluid temperature profiles inside the drill string and in the annulus. The analytical model considers formation oil influx, entrained cuttings and Joule-Thomason cooling effect at the drill bit. A field case study and a sensitivity analysis with the analytical model were conducted. The field case study with the analytical model indicates that the model can match temperature measurement perfectly by tuning three parameters namely temperature drop at bit, formation oil influx rate, and thermal conductivity of cement sheath. Result of sensitivity analysis shows that the temperature profiles in UBD is very sensitive to the temperature drop at bit and sensitive to the formation oil influx rate and thermal conductivity of cement sheath, especially in the low range of influx rate and thermal conductivity. More clean data sets are required to further validate the newly developed analytical model. Once fully validated, this analytical model can be used in the petroleum industry to improve Underbalanced drilling performance by reducing drilling complications and thus cost of operations.|","Model, Drilling, Temperature, Underbalanced, Predictive",5

Brittleness is an important mechanical property of rocks, and has great implication in well stability analysis, hydraulic fracture evaluation, sand production control, rate of penetration (ROP) prediction, and many other aspects of the exploration and production business. Although no standard or universally accepted formulation exists to date for brittleness quantification, many brittleness indices have been developed by various authors. 
In this paper, five brittleness indices are studied, which are all derived from unconfined compressive and tensile strengths, but in different mathematical forms. The relationships between these indices and various petrophysical and geomechanical properties of rocks are investigated, and global correlations are built that relate the brittleness indices to Young's modulus, P-wave velocity, and porosity. The correlations are global in the sense that they represent a diverse dataset comprising various types of igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks from various locations across the world. Therefore, they can be applied to most rock types encountered in the petroleum industry, and are especially useful in the early exploration phase when few core data are available. 
A workflow is further established for predicting the ROP of polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) bits from gamma ray, neutron, density, and sonic log data based on the global correlations. A field example is presented to illustrate the workflow, in which one of the brittleness-porosity correlations is used in the ROP calculations. The results of the field example show a good correspondence between the measured and predicted ROP values, which demonstrates that the global correlations, together with the workflow, are feasible and useful in real-time analyses, e.g., during geosteering processes.|","compressive strength, porosity, Young's modulus, brittleness, p-wave velocity, rate of penetration",39

For the ultra-deep ultra-high pressure wells in the Kuqa foreland basin of the Tarim basin in western China, it has been an ongoing challenge for more than a decade to drill through the Cretaceous Bashijiqike (K1bs) formation in a more efficient and economical manner.

Kuwait Oil Company (KOC) was planning further development of the Sabriyah (SA) and Raudhatain (RA) fields by drilling a number of horizontal wells. Both fields presented considerable challenges that included, among other factors, drilling through several problematic shales. The major drilling issues experienced in the shales comprised of tight spots, packs-off, etc. To optimize the drilling process and minimize the risks while penetrating the shales, a decision to conduct a geomechanical study was made. The geomechanical study was focused not only on improvement of the mud weight program (mechanical wellbore stability analysis was conducted) but also on drilling fluid optimization as well. 
The drilling fluid optimization analysis was carried out in order to evaluate the potential time-dependent wellbore instability mechanism(s) in the Ahmadi, Wara and Middle Burgan shale formations in the two fields, to define salt concentration for nominated mud types, and to develop solution and strategy to mitigate and/or manage the wellbore instability problems. 
Based on the time-dependent shale stability analysis, recommendations were made for drilling the Ahmadi, Wara and Middle Burgan shale formations for water-based mud (WBM) and oil-based mud (OBM). Mud salinities were provided for several combinations of designed mud weight and evaluated breakout mud weight. 
The following conclusions were drawn based on the geomechanical study:  
Water activity of the Ahmadi, Wara and Middle Burgan shale formations was moderately high. Hence, it was feasible to select an optimum drilling fluid design (whereby the mud pressure penetration was fully counteracted by the chemical potential mechanism) for WBM and OBM for the shale formations, even though overbalance pressure in the formations was relatively high. The Ahmadi, Wara and Middle Burgan shale formations could have been drilled using the designed mud weight programme and salinities for the two mud types without significant time-dependent wellbore instability problems in the analyzed planned wells. 
If the recommendations on mud weight and/or salinities were not fully followed, the shale formations could deteriorate with time due to either mud pressure penetration mechanism being not fully counteracted by chemical potential mechanism or over-dehydration. Increase in drag that could indicate formation deterioration should be established based on drilling parameters and rig capabilities. |","Wellbore Stability, Shale Time dependent, Geomechanics",16

Operators exploring presalt areas report issues with bottomhole assembly (BHA) wear and failure resulting from factors such as vibrations, stick-slip, and torsional resonance during drilling operations in salt layers. This study presents a new real-time analysis based on geomechanics capability to optimize energy consumption and rate of penetration (ROP) in salt-layer drilling and improve economic results. 
A real-time geomechanical analysis based on mechanical specific energy (MSE) was used to optimize drilling and prevent nonproductive time (NPT) when drilling in evaporite intervals. This analysis defined two energy limits as a function of depth. Both maximum and minimum energy limits were calculated in real time based on estimates of confined compressive strength and intrinsic MSE, respectively. The intrinsic MSE calculation depends on the mechanical properties of the rocks [i.e., unconfined compressive strength (UCS), friction angle (?), and the cutting environment]. 
When both limits were estimated, a real-time analysis was successfully developed based on measuring and comparing the following:  
MSE applied during the drilling process, which depends on drilling parameters, such as ROP, rev/min, weight on bit (WOB), and torque 
MSE intrinsic values 
Confined compressive strength (CCS) of the evaporate |The analysis identified excessive energy consumption to help reduce and mitigate factors, such as axial/lateral vibrations, stick-slip, torsional resonance, and wear of BHA components in this geological environment. All factors were estimated and analyzed through empirical relations based on logging while drilling (LWD) logs and mud logging parameters. 
Results of two case studies show how excess energy results in excessive vibrations and wear of the BHA when this energy analysis is not applied and energy stabilization, ROP efficiency, and mitigated vibrations when the methodology is implemented. A depth versus time plot shows drilling performance optimization with 12 operational days saved and no operational NPT registered. Economic results were also positive.

Production of natural gas from unconventional gas-hydrate reservoirs faces several challenges. One of them is the well control issue due to the natural gas released from gas hydrates during well drilling. It is very important for drilling engineers to know if the temperature of drilling fluid in the borehole is lower than the critical temperature that causes hydrate dissociation. However, there is no method to predict the fluid temperature with consideration of the effects of Joule-Thomson cooling and drilling cuttings entrained at the bottom hole. This paper fills the gap. An analytical model was developed in this study for predicting temperature profile in drilling gas-hydrate deposits. Result from the analytical model was verified by a numerical model developed using finite difference method. A case study indicates a good consistency between model-implications and field observations. Sensitivity analyses with the model show that the bottom-hole temperature in gas-hydrate drilling is dominated by the temperature and flow rate of the injected drilling fluid. The temperature of drilling fluid in the annulus can become greater than the geo-temperature at the same depth at high fluid flow rate. The Joule-Thomson cooling effect below the drill bit nozzles rapidly diminishes in a short interval above the bottom hole due to the heating effect of geo-thermal gradient.

Fault reactivation is an unfavorable incident during petroleum well drilling and production because the reactivated fault imperils the well integrity potentially. Coring and rock mechanics experiments are performed to obtain the rock properties of the fault in a Uganda oilfield. The three-dimensional finite element model of directional wells passing through reactivated faults is established. The mechanical behaviors of wells under various scenarios are analyzed by numerical simulation. The influence rules of slip displacement of fault, well inclination angle, wall thickness of casing, steel grade of casing and property of cement sheath on mechanical state of wells through faults are revealed. Research results indicate that decreasing the intersection angle between directional well and fault plane and employing cement sheath with low elastic modulus can enhance well integrity effectively. The research achievements provide the integrity assessment method and mitigation measures for the directional wells through reactivated faults.|","well integrity, fault reactivation, directional well, casing damage, mechanical analysis",10

The Sin Pu Horm Field is challenging in terms of formation and well location. Past experiences from offset wells in the field and nearby fields showed that drilling has been challenging due to several issues, including hole instability, severe lost circulation zones in shallow depths, steering difficulties, shock, vibration, bit and BHA damage caused by hard, dense, and abrasive formation in the deeper interval. The best strategy to optimize drilling performance and minimize drilling risk is to drill this interval with minimal steering requirements and move all directional requirements to the deeper interval. With this strategy, the main challenge now is to achieve the directional requirement through the hard, dense, and abrasive sandstones. The service company proposed drilling the section with a new-technology bit that utilizes conical diamond elements (CDEs) on the bit blade with a 7:8-lobe 5.0-stage motor. The objectives were completing the build section through the hard, dense, and compact sandstone and enabling smoother toolface control to complete the directional work. The rock strength of the formation ranges from 18,000 to 36,000 psi. 
The PDC bit has CDEs with an ultrathick synthetic diamond layer that gives extra durability for drilling at higher ROP. The bit can withstand more weight on bit compared with conventional PDC bits of the same size, resulting in more mechanical energy to fail the formation more efficiently. The CDEs protect the PDC bit and makes it more stable, resulting in better toolface control. 
The 8<U+00BD>-in directional section was successfully built from 10° to 49° with excellent toolface control and an average ROP of 3.5 m/h. The strategically placed CDEs on the bit blades in conjunction with conventional PDC cutters not only increased the point loading but also enabled smoother torque control, leading to smoother toolface control. None of the offset wells achieved the feet of drilling directional profile through this interval. The bit achieved the directional objectives and came out in good dull condition. By putting the directional requirement in the deeper section, the operator finished its well in 80 days, compared with an average of 100 days required by offset wells. 
The operator accepted that the bits with CDEs are not only more durable but enable drilling directional profiles better than conventional PDC bits. The operator changed the drilling strategy to put all directional work in the 8<U+00BD>-in section. This strategy will increase drilling efficiency and lower the drilling risk of having directional work in the 12<U+00BC>-in section that poses a challenge to formation stability. The next well is planned with the same bit with CDEs to minimize the number of runs.|","in Directional Drilling Performance, in Thailand, Conical Diamond Element Technology, Delivers Step Change, Hard Dense Sandstone",36

A tight-gas reservoir commonly refers to a low-permeability reservoir that mostly produces natural gas. Irrespective of the reservoir rock type (e.g. sandstone, shales, coal seams or volcanics), they all have one thing in common—these reservoirs cannot be produced at economic rates without an effective hydraulic fracturing treatment. 
In conventional reservoirs, rock flow capacity is usually sufficient to allow for hydrocarbons flow; therefore, hydraulic fracturing is broadly considered as a remedial technique to improve the productivity of suboptimal producing wells. In this study, fracturing was not originally considered in the primary drilling and completion planning phases, which in many cases limited the effectiveness of fracturing treatments because of challenges resulting from the well architecture, trajectory, azimuthal orientation with respect to dominant stress regimes, and other factors. As the importance of unconventional resources for hydrocarbon production has increased dramatically during the past decade and more attention and efforts are focused globally to explore these reserves, the demand for hydraulic fracturing techniques to prove the economic profitability of these resources has in turn tremendously increased. This has created a paradigm shift, as operators are beginning to recognize that they need to drill and complete wells for hydraulic fracturing to maximize the return on their assets. Therefore, hydraulic fracturing has gained an advanced position in the planning phase of unconventional assets. 
Volcanic formations are one of the rarer rock types with the potential for accumulations of hydrocarbons that can produce economically. This rarity has resulted in a lack of understanding across the industry on the nature of these reservoirs and how to successfully turn them into lucrative assets. Because of the tight nature of these formations, optimal hydraulic fracturing strategies are intrinsically necessary for economic production. Without a thorough and integrated understanding of the petrophysical and geomechanical properties of these formations, it will be difficult to interpret the fracture growth behavior and its inherent effect on fracture flow capacity in the production phase.|","Tight gas, Volcanics, Petrophysics, Stimulation, Fracturing",10

Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) injection methods are increasingly applied globally as the effective method in oil wells. Fluid injection alters the formation stress around the wellbore. In this study an iterative coupling method is proposed to evaluate wellbore stresses for one cycle of water alternating gas (WAG) injection. The effective parameters such as pressures, temperature, saturations and stresses are obtained for the multiphase flow condition using mathematical modeling. In this study, finite difference method is used to calculate pressure, temperature and saturations; and finite volume method is applied to evaluate stresses. Iterative coupling method is used to improve the accuracy of the results. The results show the pressure is boosted around wellbore after injection and how the water bank is pushed by injected gas. Maximum value of radial stress is obtained in the direction of horizontal maximum in-situ stress. Maximum value of tangential stress is determined in the direction of horizontal minimum in-situ stress. Vertical stress around the wellbore is not related to horizontal maximum and minimum in-situ stresses. The shear stress values are small in comparison with other stress types. The accuracy of model results are increased by iterative coupling, which the maximum correction is about 20 psi (0.14 MPa) for pressure. The developed model is capable to be applied in the wellbore to ensure stability for different injection or production cases.|","Gemechanics, Flow, Iterative coupling, stress, Wellbore",39

Tight oil is a new energy in nearly two decades in the world. Due to the increased demand for energy and enhanced environmental protection awareness, tight oil resources gradually attracted the attention of our government. Tight oil reservoirs usually have extremely low permeability and relatively low porosity, so currently tight oil reservoirs that have been put into industry development often has well developed fracture system with massive fracturing. Fracture system generally has the characteristics of anisotropy and pressure-sensitivity. Therefore, tight oil reservoirs development is extremely complicated. The research of percolation mechanism to tight oil reservoirs is necessary. 
This paper typically researches anisotropic medium in consider with pressure sensitivity in tight oil reservoir. The similarity criterion for physical simulation experiment in tight oil reservoir is obtained by dimensional analysis. Percolation experiments simulated anisotropic fractured tight oil reservoirs are done by new physical experiment method with similar materials. Ffracture deformation can be observed at low pressure or atmospheric pressure. The percolation mechanism and principle in pressure sensitive deformation and anisotropy fracture medium is revealed. A new fracture deformation characteristics model is established, and this model has strong applicability. With tensor theory and coordinate transformation method, full tensor permeability model of anisotropic fracture medium is established. Based on the established mathematical model, the main factors affecting the development of tight oil reservoirs are analyzed. Full tensor permeability is of ‘rotation effect’ with nonlinear deformation of multiple groups of fractures. The rules of numerical calculation and experimental results are consistent. Fracturing parameters, pressure sensitivity, anisotropy have great impact on the permeability in tight oil reservoirs. Research shows that in the exploitation of tight oil reservoirs, fracture development and reservoir reconstruction in tight oil reservoirs play a significant role in the contribution of tight oil production capacity.|","Full Tensor Permeability, Tight oil Reservoirs, Pressure Sensitivity, Similar Simulation, Fracture Deformation",5

In situ stress magnitude and orientation are necessary for oil and gas field development planning to achieve optimal well placement whether vertical, deviated or horizontal, wellbore stability analysis for safe and stable drilling to reduce non-productive time, fault stability and cap rock integrity modeling for CO2 geosequestration and stage placement of hydraulic fracture for optimum production in unconventional plays. These were evaluated using wireline logs, leak off test and vertical seismic profile data in an onshore field, Eastern Niger Delta whose stratigraphic sequence is the typical interlayered, normal to abnormal pressured shales and sandstones of the Agbada Formation. The vertical stress magnitude ranges from 23.08 - 25.57 MPa/km, minimum effective horizontal stress from 13.80 - 14.03 MPa/km and maximum effective horizontal stress from 16.06 - 17.65 MPa/km inferring a normal fault stress regime. The minimum horizontal stress orientation varies from 16° - 33° forming the most stable orientation for geosteering a directional well while the maximum horizontal stress orientation is N60°E - N123°E in agreement with the regional fault orientations in the Niger Delta. ENE – WSW, WNW – ESE and other maximum horizontal stress orientations suggest multiple sources of stress, and in situ stress rotation across fault surfaces depicts wellbore instability issues. Structural evolution depicts NE – SW and NW-SE trending faults in the direction of the maximum horizontal stress. Directional well inclination angles of 16° and 33° were predicted in wells 10 and 11 respectively and mud weight window predicted using 2D Mohr - Coulomb failure criterion yielded an optimum mud weight window of 10 - 14.0ppg with overpressure accounting for mud weights as high as 25ppg and minimum mud weight exceeding the maximum mud weight in some sections.|",,5

Modeling instability in shales is pertinent to managing risk and uncertainty associated with drilling troublesome formations. Design parameter such as Unconfined Compressive Stress (UCS) is usually estimated from sonic or other porosity logs and calibrated with results of triaxial test from core samples. However, sonic logs may not be available for some wells, making UCS estimation difficult thereby increasing uncertainty. In this work, a compositional approach was used to evaluate UCS and the Volume of Shale (Vsh) of the rock was modelled from the spectral gamma ray (SGR) or gamma spectrometry as a measure of shaliness instead of the gamma ray. This is because the sandstone sequences as obtained in Niger Delta fields contain some non radiactive clay which gamma ray log may not delinate clearly. Subsurface geological issues like bedding plane and faults were also modelled and the estimated UCS at various intervals and lithologies were calibrated with offset well data. Field results showed consistent and reliable estimates of UCS in the absence of Sonic logs with a percentage error of ± 0.0208. The predicted safe drilling mud weights must be accompanied by good drilling practice and proper hole cleaning. ECD and fracture gradient issues were captured to prevent excessive loss circulation.

Drillstring vibration has adverse effect on rate of penetration, causes equipment failure and increase in non productive time (NPT). In carrying out this research work on torsional and lateral vibrations of Polycrystalline Diamond Compact (PDC) bits in directional drilling, harmonic and modal finite element analyses were adopted for the obvious advantage that it is able to approximate the real structure with a finite number of degrees of freedom. The effect of weight on bit on rate of penetration, resonance, damping effect of drilling mud and friction between drillstring and the wellbore were analyzed. In the cause of the analysis, different critical load, critical speed for the finite element of the drillstring and the BHA and saturation points were developed for the different components of the drillstring from the Euler model to determine the crippling loads that will cause each component to buckle and propagate lateral and torsional vibration. The effect of angle inclination was also considered in the design of the vibration analysis model for directional wells application. A new concept, managing WOB while drilling was also advanced to avoid reaching the founder's point in real time drilling operation. The deductions and findings resulted in the development of a computer model, vibraCOM which detects, analyses and mitigates torsional and lateral drillstring vibrations realtime for practical applications. The results shows that it is better to drill below the critical speed of the finite elements of the drillstring and BHA to avoid resonance and to ensure the axial forces acting on the BHA is below the critical load.|",,15

Drilling activities have progressed to deep and ultra deep seas in recent times and with it comes more challenges. Due to the difficulty of directly obtaining important parameters like in-situ stress and fracture gradient, simple models have been evolved. This study is a novel attempt to make up for the gap inherent in such models namely that they neglect chemical and thermal effects, settling for only effective stress and a time-dependent analysis. The study applied the Neural Network (NN) technology to predict geomechanical parameters.

In the absence of a gas market, the management of the gas associated with oil production often poses serious challenges to the development of oil fields, resulting in potentially stranded gas resources. While gas flaring was the default solution, more stringent carbon constraints have rendered this solution unattractive, owing to its negative health, safety, environmental and socio-economic impacts. One potential solution entails injecting the otherwise stranded associated gas (AG) into underground geologic systems for temporary storage, but re-producing same when a viable gas market becomes available. 
Faced with the challenge of providing temporary AG solution for a new oil development in the shallow offshore area of the Niger Delta, this paper presents an overview of candidate solutions, which include (i) venting, (ii) flaring, (iii) injection for improved oil recovery, (iv) underground sequestration (AG injected but not re-produced), and (v) on-site conversion to natural-gas hydrates to facilitate evacuation to other outlets. Their relative strengths and weaknesses are examined relative to this case study. 
The paper details the key aspects of a reservoir-engineering assessment of temporary AG storage in a non-associated gas (NAG) reservoir for later monetisation of both the native NAG and alien (injected) AG resources. Rigorous numerical-simulation studies highlight the key factors that control both the injection and production phases of the subject reservoir. For a given set of abandonment conditions, effects of the gas volume injected prior to the production phase on the ultimate recovery factors of the native and alien gas resources are presented. Additionally, the relative advantages of matrix, pseudo-fractured, and fractured injection modes are explored. 
Compared against the above-mentioned alternative solutions in terms of (i) effective sales volume of hydrocarbon, (ii) infrastructural requirements, and (iii) net carbon savings, underground storage is the most attractive solution to address stranded AG in this example field, and possibly others.|",,31

Borehole instability is one of the major factors that contribute significantly to additional unplanned cost in drilling operations irrespective of the wellbore inclination. Problems generally build up in time, starting with the tensile or compressive failure of the borehole wall, followed by transfer of fragments to the annulus and finally-if hole cleaning is insufficient-culminating in such difficulties as tight hole, breakouts, caving, pack off, borehole collapse and stuck pipe. 
Horizontal and highly deviated wells in normal faults stress regimes present more difficult challenges than low inclined wells due to compressive or shear failure of the wellbore. Wellbore stability issues are more pronounced as the wellbore stress difference reaches at maximum with increase in inclination. Proper planning of the well trajectory and mud weights are crucial to avoid such complexity which causes huge rig downtime, NPT and cost. With the aid of in-situ stress, pore pressure and rock strength analysis the wellbore stability can be assured with suggested optimum deviation profile and mud weights window for different inclinations and azimuths. 
An attempt has been made to perform the wellbore stability analysis for three high angle and three horizontal wells (with drain-extension of about 500ftahd) development wells in Niger Delta which is planned for production in near future. In our workflow, the seismic data and offset well information have been incorporated to generate pore pressure, optimum mudweight, shear failure (minimum envelope) and fracture pressure gradient. Rock physical parameters have been calculated from the offset well's logs and calibrated with laboratory tested dataset to use in the stability analysis for well KTY 02, KTY 03 and KTY 04. In the study area, wellbore stability analysis was carried out in both the pilot and drain hole sections of the horizontal wells. However, because of horizontal drilling plan in drain holes, differences in principal stresses in the wellbore and their physical implication on stability was plotted and interpreted through stress concentration plot and safe MW window analyzer extensively. The stresses and the rock strength datasets input were used to derive the collapse failure gradient curve (CFG) using the Mogi failure criteria. The wellbore circumferential and radial stress distribution analysis has been done for different depths with the inputs from stresses and the corresponding cohesive strengths and the Frictional Angles. 
With these analytical results, we have recommended the wellbore trajectory along Shmin and SHmax direction and along the maximum good reservoir facies with corresponding mud weight (window) profile required to drill these wells with NPT as a result of instability consequences such as stuck pipes and jeopardizing wellbore integrity during logging, casing running and completions.|",,35

The geomechanical knowledge of rocks physical and mechanical properties could reduce the NPT incurred while drilling and production of a reservoir to a large extent by selection of proper/optimum operating envelope. Hence, a field development plan for each oil/gas field may contain optimized geomechanical procedures that take into accounts the rock mechanical principles and failure scenarios. ""The unconfined compressive strength (UCS) and internal frictional interplays of rocks is the important rock mechanical parameters that plays crucial role when drilling an oil or gas wells"". ""(UCS) is the stress level at which rock is broken when it is under a uniaxial stress state (Bruce et al 2004)""; it can be used for real – time wellbore stability evaluation, bit selection management, and design of enhanced geomechanical earth models and cap integrity evaluation. Rock strength can be estimated along drilled wellbore using different approaches, including laboratory tests, core – log relationships and rate of penetration models. The benefit of a petrophysical log- derived method is that, it provides continuous strength profiles with depth. This is useful in delineating differences between near uniform zones, and identifying weaker zones. There is also a cost advantage in obtaining these data without having to perform extensive laboratory testing throughout the core interval. 
""In this study, new equations for estimation of rock strength in Niger Delta formations are formulated based on empirically derived models that accommodate petrophysical log information such as the degree of shaliness detected over the entire logged interval, corresponding to shale and sand units (Fjaer, et al. 1990), lithology index etc., hence they are utilized for estimation of the rock strength profile for easy and effective geomechanical evaluations"" (Dosunmu 2007). 
A geomechanical enhanced framework coupled with discrete finite element analysis is utilized for prediction of UCS in any predefined well trajectory and batch depth analysis on the course of this research (study). Cross/post – validation shows that, the results from the formation discretization were compatible with realities (based on MEM utilization). This approach has proven to be useful for estimation of rock strengths and frictional interplays in any design well trajectory prior to drilling (predrill scenarios).

A calibrated model of hydraulic fracture growth in the Muskwa Formation of the Horn River Basin in British Columbia was developed using a coupled hydraulic-geomechanical simulator. The reservoir geomechanical model was represented by log-derived stresses and elastic properties, and the DFN geometry was refined using the attributes of the microseismic events, with strength properties derived from correlations. |Fracturing fluid injection into the geomechanical model is simulated using the field pump schedule and fluid characteristics, including proppant transport (with settling, bridging and the potential for screenouts). Fluid injection results in mechanical deformation, and the associated stress changes may cause slip and microseismic events. As the simulation progresses, the model computes the deformation and consequent stress changes, predicts where failure could occur, and whether microseismic events would be associated with those failures. The accuracy of the model is determined by quantitatively comparing the synthetic microseismic events with those observed in the field. |In this case study, the model was initially calibrated by determining the input parameters which both honored the known data such as logs, and best matched the field microseismic data. These initial simulations were used to gain an understanding of the key variables governing the model response and assess the sensitivity to uncertainty in the available geomechanical data or changes in reservoir geomechanical properties. |The calibrated model was then used to determine how changes in completion parameters (such as fracturing fluid type, injection rate and volume, and stage and cluster spacing) would affect fracture geometry and proppant placement. The results of this modeling can be used both to explain the production response to various completion scenarios and also to guide future field testing of alternative completions. |Understanding the coupled geomechanical and hydaulic processes is key to understanding the fracture geoemetry and contact with the reservoir and more crucially the proppant placement and associated enhanced permeability. Ultimately, a customized hydraulic fracture design can be defined for specific reservoir conditions to both enhance production and optimize operational costs.|","Document Type

It is well understood that an induced hydraulic fracture propagates in the direction of maximum horizontal stress, suggesting that horizontal wells must be perpendicular to this direction for efficient well-reservoir hydraulic connection during treatment and production. The horizontal stress anisotropy also affects the optimum well spacing and stage length. |Numerical studies show that in naturally fractured reservoirs, higher horizontal stress anisotropy promotes more planar stimulation patterns that extend farther away from the well. For the same treatment parameters, low horizontal stress anisotropy leads to near-wellbore complexities. The magnitude of stresses also controls the minimum horsepower requirement for treatment. The bottomhole injection pressure must exceed and be maintained above the minimum reservoir stress for a hydraulic fracture to initiate and propagate through the formation. A relatively accurate estimate of the vertical stress magnitude can always be obtained by integrating the density logs to the reservoir depth. The minimum horizontal stress magnitude can also be determined from well tests, such as a mini-frac test or diagnostic fracture injection test. There is, however, no direct and easy way to measure the magnitude of maximum horizontal stress (SHmax) at the reservoir depth. Wellbore breakout analysis is commonly performed to constrain the SHmax magnitude based on observed wellbore breakouts. The result of such analysis, however, is more representative of the well-scale stresses rather than the reservoir-scale stress state, unless several wells within the same region can be studied simultaneously. |In this paper, we present a new methodology to estimate the direction and magnitude of maximum horizontal stress using microseismic focal mechanisms. The moment tensor inversion technique is applied to establish a moment tensor for all acquired microseismic events. The event focal mechanism and fracture orientation is determined by the fault plane solution of the moment tensor. Each focal mechanism is treated as an independent field experiment by which we can back-calculate the magnitude of SHmax. The field SHmax magnitude is then determined by analyzing all calculated values for all qualified events. The described methodology is used to estimate field SHmax for five cases in three different formations; the Marcellus, Eagle Ford, and Wolfcamp. Using the known orientation of fractures and full-field stress tensor, the minimum failure pressure is calculated. An example of this analysis is provided for one of the studied Marcellus cases.|","Document Type

The Vaca Muerta play is immature in comparison to North American unconventional counterparts, and does not benefit from the learning that accompanies intense development activity. For example, there are currently ~4,900 producing and permitted wells in the Eagle Ford whereas, there are 566 wells in the Vaca Muerta play (most of these are vertical wells YPF's Loma La Lata block), and only ~80 of those horizontal wells. |To accelerate our assessment of commerciality, we chose a de-risking approach that strives to be more predictive and incorporates lessons learned from other unconventional plays. A key de-risking component is the availability high quality 3D seismic data. We have employed a focused data acquisition strategy that includes log, geochemistry, geomechanics, core, PLT, and microseismic data on select pads in order to facilitate a detailed understanding of vertical and lateral distribution of rock and reservoir properties. We are able to create rock types using learnings from our data acquisition program at the core and log scale and translate them into the seismic scale. With the use of seismic inversion techniques, we can predict vertical and lateral reservoir properties away from the well bore. |After completing 9 horizontal wells, with 2 of these wells in the top 5 producers of the Neuquen basin, we have developed and calibrated a predictive subsurface model for the Vaca Muerta play within the oil window. The integration and interpretation of well and seismic data indicates a potential dual layer development. The lower layer is present through our acreage with minimal lateral and vertical variation in properties. This reservoir has a large hydrocarbon storage capacity, however long term production behavior is still to be understood due to its geomechanical properties. The best producing well of the basin is located in this layer. The upper layer has significantly more vertical and lateral variation characterized by carbonate-marl cycles with relatively lower storage compared to the lower layer but with more favorable geomechanical properties. Given these learnings, this predictive subsurface model is key to the Vaca Muerta continuing successful de-risking and development planning.|","Document Type

This process creates new tensile fractures and reactivates existing natural fractures, forming a highly conductive stimulated-reservoir volume (SRV) around the borehole. Although this process has been extensively studies and modeled for isotropic rock, only a limited number of studies have been performed for anisotropic rocks, such as shales, gneisses, and foliated granites. The fracturing process of anisotropic rocks such as shales is examined in this study. We divide the rock anisotropy into two anisotropic groups: conventional and veined. Two members of the conventional first group are Lyons sandstone, a brittle, quartz-dominated, low-porosity and -permeability, anisotropic (11%) material; and pyrophyllite, a monomineralic-clay-rich, strongly anisotropic (19%) metamorphic rock similar chemically and mechanically to shale with extremely low porosity and permeability. The second group consists of a suite of natural shale samples (18% anisotropy) from the Wolfcamp formation containing mineralized veins. Fracture initiation and propagation are studied during Brazilian tests. Strain gauges and acoustic-emission (AE) sensors record the deformation leading to and during failure. Scanning-electron-microscope (SEM) imaging and surface profilometry are used to study the post-failure fracture system and failed surface topology. Post-fracture permeability is measured as a function of effective stress. The influence of anisotropy on fracturing is investigated by rotating the sample-fabric direction relative to the loading axis through increments of 15°. |The rock microstructure, lamination, and brittleness control the activation of the layers. Lyons sandstone shows a wide brittle fracture with larger process zone with twice as much layer activation at lower stress levels than pyrophyllite. The fracturing process in veined shale is, however, a coupled function of rock fabric and mineral veins. The veins easily activate at 15° orientation with respect to the loading axis at stress levels of 30% of the unveined-failure load. The resulting unpropped fracture has enhanced permeability by orders of magnitude. We suggest that fracturing from a deviated well reduces the breakdown pressure significantly (compared with a vertical well) and activates a large number of veins with enhanced conductivity without the need for excessive proppant.|","Shale , Hydraulic fracturing, Anisotropy",36

Our study offers a model for an improved understanding of the influence of key reservoir and fracture properties on intensity of well interference, which may help field operators to further optimize the spacing of wells in a multi-well pad. We combine numerical, semi-analytical, and analytical model tools to identify, analyze, and visualize the inter-well interference process. Our analysis can account for complex non-planar fracture geometries using a semi-analytical model. The stimulated rock volume is visualized by an analytical streamline model. Three scenarios for well interference are investigated including interference through a single slanted fracture hit, multiple slanted fracture hits, and multiple complex fracture hits. For the first scenario, we examine the effects of connecting fracture conductivity, primary fracture conductivity, and matrix permeability on the pressure response of a shut-in well. For the second scenario, we vary the number of connecting fractures to investigate the impact on the pressure response of a shut-in well. For the last scenario, we use a complex fracture propagation model to generate non-planar fracture geometries with and without natural fractures. The semi-analytical model is used to evaluate the effect of both hydraulic and natural fractures on the pressure response of a shut-in well. The simulation results show that the pressure drop of the shut-in well increases with the increasing conductivity of connecting fractures and primary fractures and number of connecting fractures, while decreases with the increasing of matrix permeability. Furthermore, the pressure drop of the shut-in well through complex fracture hits without natural fractures is larger than that with natural fractures. |Introduction |Determination of the optimum well spacing is a key factor to improve the economic performance of unconventional oil and gas resources developed with multi-well pads. Tighter well spacing often results in well interference through complex connecting fractures, also known as fracture hits (Lawal et al. 2013; King and Valencia 2016). It is common to drill infill wells in a multi-well pad to effectively increase the stimulated area and maximize recovery (Safari et al. 2015). However, infill well drilling increases the risk of well interference. Ideally, the infill wells should have the minimum well interference with the existing wells (Ajani and Kelkar 2012). When the well spacing is much closer, the well interference is more frequent (Ajani and Kelkar 2012; Malpani et al. 2015; Kurtoglu and Salman 2015). The fracture hits can negatively affect well performance when damaging a well (Yaich et al. 2014; Malpani et al. 2015). Hence, a better understanding of well interference is fundamentally important for further well spacing optimization.|","Document Type

Countless operators have invested billions to develop new resources and implement factory mode completions which have changed the landscape of the oil and gas industry. The impact of unconventional completions has led to a global market surplus of both oil and gas at the date of this publication. To succeed in today's market, operators must evolve by testing innovative methods to drill and complete unconventional developments with a focus on capital efficiency. |The most common completion method for shale horizontal wells is a cemented plug and perforation stage design. Although aspects of the plug and perforation design have been optimized to deliver improved well performance and operational efficiency, there is still an opportunity to maximize cluster efficiency and zonal isolation. One of the methods is creating pin point fractures through the use of coiled tubing cemented sleeves. The sleeves allow for single point injection and greater control of fracture initiation to maximize stimulated rock volume and reservoir drainage across the lateral. |While some in the industry have trialed the technology, few have focused on how to optimize the sleeve design in terms of fracture interaction and completion design. Linking the design of the sleeve technology to upfront modeling efforts can accelerate the application in unconventional plays. This paper will present the modeling aspects and surveillance to optimize shale completions through the use of coil tubing frac sleeves. Furthermore, operational aspects of this alternative completion method and various learnings that provide for future optimization will be discussed. Finally, field data will be used to illustrate the impact of the completion design. |Introduction |This paper focuses on upfront modeling efforts, field implementation, and resulting analyses of a non-traditional type of completion technique — single point entry completion system. Plug and perf is the operator's completion method of choice and it is widely believed that achieving complete cluster efficiency is challenging using this method. In contrast, the single point entry completion system is expected to provide the technical limit for cluster efficiency.|","Document Type

353,354,2460794-MS,Combining the Stochastic Earth Model with Geomechanical Modeling to Quantify Well Performance: Application to Mississippian Shale,"Aimene, Yamina E., Halliburton| Yarus, Jeffrey M., Halliburton| Davila, Carlos, Halliburton| Dusterhoft, Ron, Halliburton| Siddiqui, Shameem, Halliburton","|Summary |This paper presents a new workflow that combines the stochastic earth model and geomechanical analysis to assess the best geological landing intervals and geomechanical targeting zones in unconventional reservoirs before drilling and completion operations. The stochastic earth model uses geostatistical algorithms and multivariate analytics to create a shale quality index (QI) that identifies potential zones with a high probability of containing organic-rich, brittle shales with low effective shale water saturation. The geomechanical analysis uses the material point method (MPM) solid mechanics tools to assess the stress field in the fractured reservoir. This helps identify the best zones for hydraulic fracturing operations that can enable the development of a complex stimulated reservoir volume. The value of combining the two methods is illustrated in two generic areas (Areas A and B). Both areas have the same high shale QI but have different fracture sets characteristics. Area A has a broad range of fractures orientation and Area B has a uniform orientation. A sensitivity analysis highlighted the importance of shear fractures for deriving stress variability. Fractures oriented along and perpendicular to the maximum horizontal stress showed less impact. However, the final stress field was driven by the interaction between different fractures sets, when present. Geomechanical analysis of Area A indicated many zones of low-to-medium differential stress (DS) within high QI zones. However, Area B had a zone of high DS. Area A had a broader range of fracture orientation, which could result in more stress variability and possible connectivity of the induced fractures to the reservoir. These observations could affect the production of wells in similar areas. Therefore, the combined geomechanical and earth model analysis workflow is important to better understand shale reservoirs and adapt stimulation treatments according to local stress conditions related to the reservoir geology and geomechanics sweet spots. Thus, the integrated shale QI and geomechanical analysis can be used to design a fracturing operations strategy for wells to determine target stages. |Introduction |The current low commodity prices present numerous challenges in the oil and gas industry, particularly in the unconventional reservoirs that have experienced tremendous growth in the past decade and still hold significant untapped potential. The positive aspect of the current downturn is the recognition that current hydraulic fracturing practices do not meet expectations, thus initiating new industry-wide efforts to optimize drilling and completion strategies in unconventional reservoirs.|","Document Type

354,355,2461948-MS,What I Wish My Geologist Knew about Drilling: Geosteering from a Drilling Engineer's Perspective,"Noynaert, Samuel F., Texas A&M University","|Abstract  |It has been noted in many publications that the two technologies which allowed unconventional reservoir development to succeed: hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling. The reality is that hydraulic fracturing is the true game-changing technology which allowed initial development to occur as these reservoirs do not necessarily require horizontal wells to produce. However, the ability to drill horizontally is the technology which actually made most unconventional plays economic, an equally important contribution. Looking at it closer, one realizes that the ability to drill horizontally by itself is not the key, it is the ability drill ever increasing lateral lengths within precisely defined, generally small windows which has truly allowed economic development to take off in unconventional reservoirs, otherwise known as geosteering. |In spite of its importance, it often does not look like a common goal exists at the implementation level of geosteering. Drilling engineers, geologists and field personnel seem to drill and steer wells in spite of companies’ workflows instead of because of those processes. Outside observers such as management would say the geosteering process works fine, yet when viewed from within, it is a fractured, uncertain process that can be somewhat antagonistic at times. |After discussions with a variety of drilling, geology and field personnel and managers, the issues with the geosteering process can be distilled down to two primary issues. The most common issue noted was a lack of knowledge around basic drilling fundamentals by geologists (and vice versa) which led to an inability to understand the consequences of geology geosteering decisions on the ability to drill a well. The second issue was that the job performance metrics by which technical employees are measured, and thus tend to drive their decisions, are not well aligned between disciplines. While different goals and measures of success will obviously continue to exist from discipline to discipline, the fact that each group rarely understands the reasoning behind other teams’ decisions leads to a potentially inefficient and combative geosteering process. Each technical discipline has a reason for their basis of design and how they manage real-time processes and performance. When other disciplines do not understand this basis for decisions by others or the consequences of their own decisions, the geosteering operation and thus the well productivity are at risk. |This publication discusses the dynamic between geologists, engineers and field personnel from a drilling engineer’s perspective. It covers the common problem areas and dissimilarities in goals which are the root of most differences between these three groups as well as the knowledge gaps between the groups. It must be made clear that this presentation is not designed to be a soliloquy on drilling basics or how geologists hurt the drilling process. Instead it is meant point out the primary dysfunctions within the geosteering process and propose some general solutions. Overall, the hope is to foster a practical discussion on how to understand and subsequently utilize the differences that exist within E&P companies’ operational teams to improve the well steering process.|","Document Type

355,356,2448745-MS,Brittleness Index - A Parameter to Embrace or Avoid?,"Mathia, Eliza, Chemostrat Ltd| Ratcliffe, Ken, Chemostrat Ltd| Wright, Milly, Chemostrat Inc.","|Summary |“Brittleness Index” has become a popular parameter in unconventional plays, used in an attempt to describe the behavior of rocks under in-situ hydraulic stimulation. However, with a multitude of different definitions and more critical assessments of the brittleness index (BI) emerging in recent years, the shortcomings in the interpretation of the brittleness index as a fracability parameter are increasingly evident. Calculating brittleness from both rock elastic properties and mineralogy has become commonplace due to the almost ubiquitous acquisition of those data in “shale” plays. The temptation is then to directly apply them in reservoir stimulation decisions. However, taking into account many shortcomings in the computation and physical interpretation of the brittleness index, questions arise about the meaning of rock brittleness when defined as a combination of different rock properties. In this paper we look into three different brittleness index definitions based on dynamic elastic moduli and mineral composition, and critically appraise their similarities, and potential for application in hydraulic fracture programs. |Introduction |Effective exploitation of tight oil and gas shale resources is possible due to a combination of horizontal drilling, and hydraulic fracturing with slick water. To enhance flow from these extremely low permeability reservoirs, pressurized water is pumped into a borehole initiating fractures that propagate away from the borehole into the reservoir. The right combination of treatment conditions, rock properties, and stress regime allows not only the propagation of new complex fractures that enhance permeability, but also results in cross-cutting and activation of pre-existing fractures. Furthermore increased pore pressure in the reservoir induces slippage on pre-existing faults. As rock properties are an important part of this mix, a great amount of research has been focused on searching for the association between effective hydraulic fracturing and brittleness of rocks. |The concept of brittleness evolved as an idea of a rock's ability to fail in a brittle manner, i.e. the point at which elastic strain that dominates a rocks deformation up to the point its strength is exceeded and the rock fractures (Altindag, 2003). Brittle failure was therefore opposed to ductile failure, when inelastic strain prevails over elastic strain, causing rocks to deform irreversibly and ultimately fail. In an attempt to classify rocks based on their ability to undergo brittle failure, or conversely, showing varied degree of ductility, a brittleness index (BI) can be defined. Today, three main groups of brittleness definitions exist, referring to different concepts of rock properties or behavior. The first group focuses on the static mechanical properties of rocks, by comparing different rock strength (compressive, tensile, residual, fracture toughness) and strain relations. In this paper we will not discuss these definitions, but they are reviewed elsewhere (Hu et al., 2015a, Yang et al., 2013, Zhang et al., 2016)). The second group focuses on different aspects of rock composition, comparing weight or volume fraction of minerals that are supposed to favor brittle failure, to those that are supposed to be less favorable to brittle failure. The main concept behind mineralogy based brittleness is to highlight the right combination of mineralogy that would represent zones that require relatively low pumping pressures in order to overcome a fracture gradient and ensure that the propagated fractures remain open. Brittleness indices based on mineralogy and proposed by different authors are not consistent, attributing varied importance to different rock components. For instant Jarvie et al. (2007) introduced an index that would facilitate to identify the most quartzose and best producing intervals in the Barnett Shale, and therefore quartz is their most desired component as opposed to calcite and clays. Wang and Gale (2009) introduced a second desired parameter, dolomite, as another brittle component. The mineralogy concept of classifying rocks is very convenient to apply, as it only requires knowledge of rock's composition, accessible from logs or cuttings. Even more convenient in producing continuous brittleness information is an idea of using elastic parameters calculated from Pand S-wave sonic logs or seismic survey, forming a basis of the third group of brittleness definitions. Rocks undergo elastic deformation when subject to sonic waves, but despite that, little information about inelastic deformations is generated in this manner. However with the right calibrations to static moduli, one can successfully calculate such parameters as Young's modulus or Poisson's ratio at the depth of interest. The application of elastic moduli in describing rock's brittleness is still regarded as lacking a physical meaning because they describe different rock characteristics, i.e. deformation vs failure (see Bai, 2016 and references therein). Moreover, there is an objection to treating brittleness as a rock property, but rather a rock's behavior, dependent on the stress regime in the reservoir (Hu et al., 2015a), variability in the stress gradient, and an extent of time-dependent rock deformation and stress relaxation (Sone and Zoback, 2014). The purpose of this paper is therefore to compare popular brittleness index definitions and reconcile any discrepancies between different approaches for the estimation of rocks brittleness.|","Document Type

These parameters generally have quite large uncertainty ranges and need to be calibrated by available production data. Using an ensemble of history matched reservoir models to predict the Estimated Ultimate Recovery (EUR) is one of popular approaches when parallelized computing facilities become cheaper and cheaper to customers. The Randomized Maximum Likelihood (RML) method has been proved quite robust for generating multiple realizations by conditioning to production data. However, it is still expensive to apply traditional optimization algorithms to find a conditional realization by minimizing the objective function defined within a Bayesian framework, especially when adjoint-derivatives are unavailable. How to generate multiple conditional realizations efficiently is critically important but still a very challenging task for proper uncertainty quantification. |In this paper, a novel approach that hybrids the direct-pattern-search and the Gauss-Newton algorithm is developed to generate multiple conditional realizations simultaneously. The proposed method is applied to history match a real unconventional Liquid Rich Shale reservoir. The reservoir is stimulated by multiple stage hydraulic fractures. In this example, uncertainty parameters include those characterizing uncertainties of reservoir properties (including matrix permeability, permeability reduction coefficient, porosity, initial water saturation and pressure) and those for hydraulic fractures (height, width, length, and effective permeability of SRV zone). Uncertainty of production forecasts are quantified with both unconditional and conditional realizations. |The case study indicates that the new method is very efficient and robust. Uncertainty ranges of parameters and production forecasts before and after conditioning to production data are quantified and compared. The new approach enhances the EUR assessment confidence level and therefore significantly reduces risks for unconventional assets development. |Introduction |For unconventional reservoirs, the key reservoir properties, such as effective flowing fracture length (Xf), effective fracture height (Hf), permeability and permeability reduction coefficient, fracture conductivity (FCD), drainage area (A) etc., that govern fluid flow in subsurface are very difficult to obtain due to unknown fracture growth in tight rock. Uncertainties associated with these parameters are usually quite large. Understanding the uncertainty of the subsurface model is helpful to define how to drill wells and determine fracture stages spacing or the number of wells. There are mainly three categories of Estimated Ultimate Recovery (EUR) prediction methodologies for unconventionals:|","Document Type

357,358,2423315-MS,Estimation of TOC and Brittleness Volumes and Correlation with Reservoir Production,"Verma, Sumit, The University of Wyoming| Zhao, Tao, The University of Oklahoma| Marfurt, Kurt J., The University of Oklahoma| Devegowda, Deepak, The University of Oklahoma| Grana, Dario, The University of Wyoming","|Abstract |The Barnett Shale in the Fort Worth Basin is one of the most important resource plays in the USA. TOC and brittleness can help to characterize a resource play to assist in the search for sweet spots. Higher TOC or organic content are generally associated with hydrocarbon storage and with rocks that are ductile in nature. Brittle rocks, however, are more amenable to fracturing with the fractures faces more resistant to proppant embedment. Productive intervals within a resource play should therefore contain a judicious mix of organics and mineralogy that lends to hydraulic fracturing. Identification of these intervals through core acquisition and lab-based petrophysical measurements can be accurate but expensive in comparison to wireline logging. In this work, we estimate TOC from wireline logs using Passey's method and attain a correlation of 60%. However errors in the base line interpretation can lead to inaccurate estimates of TOC. Using non-linear regression with Passey's TOC, normalized stratigraphic height and acquired wireline logs the correlation was increased to 80%. This regression can be applied to uncored wells with logs to estimate TOC and thereby provides ground truth within the seismic survey. Core measurements provide relatively more accurate measures of both TOC and mineralogy. Brittleness index (BI) is computed based on mineralogy using Wang and Gale's formula. The correlation between this mineralogy based BI and BI estimated using elastic logs (<U+03BB><U+03C1>, <U+03BC><U+03C1>, VP/ VS, ZP and ZS) and wireline logs is 78%. However, this correlation decreases to 66 % if the BI is estimated using only wireline logs. Therefore, the later serves as a less reliable proxy. We correlate production to volumetric estimate of TOC and brittleness by computing distance weighted averages about assumed perforations in 120 horizontal wells. We obtained a production correlation of 38% on blind wells, which was encouragingly suggesting that the geologic component in completions provides an important contribution to well success.|","Document Type

Capillary pressure and osmotic pressure are the driving forces during the imbibition process and are associated with different rock components. Ions and surfactant in water can modify the surface properties of minerals and organic component, thus wettability moves towards more water-wet to enhance oil recovery. Depending on the membrane efficiency and in-situ water salinity, osmosis can contribute to the imbibition as well. In this paper, a multi-component matrix imbibition model is coupled with wettability alteration by low water salinity/surfactant. |The simulation results are consistent with the experimental observations reported in the paper and literature. Some insights on the ion/surfactant and rock interactions are drawn and water imbibition volume is controlled by rock components (clay, organic matter and other minerals) and different concentrations of salt ions and surfactant. Depending on the ion strength of ion species and surfactant, the concentration of water-wet site on the rock surface increases, thus the contact angle is changed to more water-wet. In addition, interfacial tension can be lowered by surfactant. The combination effects determine capillary pressure imbibition. The concentration of charged ions and surfactant molecules affect the osmosis imbibition. These processes for different rock components associated with pore size distributions are incorporated into the imbibition model. The results showed that there is an optimum water salinity for maximum imbibition. Explained by adsorption/desorption theory, anionic surfactant has stronger wettability alteration ability than nonionic surfactant. High TOC rock is prone to bigger contact angle change. To validate the model, spontaneous imbibition tests were performed on cleaned and dried Three Forks core samples for fluids with varying water salinities or surfactant. The imbibition curves were matched very well using the developed model and proved that the interplay of capillarity and osmosis controls the imbibition rate and amount following the adsorption dominated imbibition.|",,42

Petroleum Engineering","|Abstract |Field production data from unconventional reservoirs including Eagle Ford, Marcellus, Wolfcamp, Utica, and Vaca Muerta formations indicate that the landing location of horizontal wellbores is a critical control variable to well productivity, and that small changes in the landing depth (e.g., from 15 to 30 ft.) may result in significant changes in well performance. The reasons for these changes are not yet well understood. In this paper, we show that hydraulic fracture height growth is less extensive than anticipated from hydraulic fracturing modeling or microseismic monitoring, and that proper landing depth selection helps improve the final propped and connected fracture height. We also show that a primary source of height growth suppression is the pervasive rock layering in mudstones and hybrid reservoir systems, which often exhibit strongly contrasting properties between layers and weak interfaces at their contacts. In some reservoirs, bed parallel ash beds, mineralized veins, and slickensides are also present, and all of these interfaces can be weakened further by tectonic deformation. We studied rock layering and various types of weak interfaces in outcrops and cores, including their geologic and stratigraphic context. We also studied the effect of these on hydraulic fracture height growth, using large-scale laboratory hydraulic-fracturing testing, and through field diagnosis of hydraulic fracture height growth in vertical pilot wells. These evidences indicate that the pervasive layering and weak interfaces induce step-overs and branching during hydraulic fracturing, which close after pumping and truncate the initial hydraulic connectivity of the fracture. We observe that during fracturing, the distance from the wellbore to the weak interfaces is a critical measure that controls whether or not these can be overcome without developing step-overs. Proper selection of the lateral landing depth thus depends on understanding rock layering and the distribution of weak interfaces in the section to be fractured. It depends on anticipating critical step-overs and truncation points, and reducing their effect on the hydraulic fracture by adjusting their distance from the wellbore. It depends on choosing the optimal wellbore location that will extend the propped and connected surface area and will maximize economic well production. Using this methodology we have recommended lateral landing depths on multiple wells in the Wolfcamp, Eagle Ford, Utica, Velkerri, and Vaca Muerta plays. This was done while maintaining the same completion and fracture design, so as to evaluate the effect of lateral landing depth alone. Results show a 22% to 46% increase in well production and greater consistency in production from well to well. Some of these results are publicly available. |Introduction |Field production data from unconventional reservoirs including Eagle Ford, Marcellus, Wolfcamp, Utica, and Vaca Muerta formations indicate substantial variability in well productivity, which is incommensurate with the variability in reservoir properties. Despite our industry's improved understanding of reservoir quality, reservoir thickness and reservoir pressure, we still observe that a substantial number of the wells drilled are uneconomical or marginal, while others perform well, and few outperform all expectations (Hodenfield, 2012). Given our understanding of reservoir quality, what then drives the large variability in well production?|","Document Type

Historically operators have invested billions of dollars to develop unconventional resources and enhance their factory mode development. With the push for optimization and operational efficiency, pad drilling has taken the forefront in development, allowing operators to drill and complete many wells at a time from a single location while minimizing the amount of surface impact and movements they have to make with equipment. |Many operators have implemented multi-well completion techniques to maximize operational efficiency, especially in plug and perf designed completions. The most popular method seen to date in multi-well completions is referred to as zipper fracking, where wells are completed in a back and forth manner, one well pumping while the other well is performing wireline operations. While maximizing operational efficiency by eliminating some downtime between stages, zipper fracking has a profound effect on the fracture geometry created in the reservoir. These effects are relatively poorly understood among industry, as it is very difficult to measure and understand fracture geometry and fracture interaction between wellbores. |This paper will provide examples of a strategy and understanding of zipper fracturing developed in the Eagle Ford Shale over a 3 year period. The findings are based on extensive field studies and surveillance data targeted at understanding the effects of different zipper fracking strategies. Details of the study will be linked to an in-depth look at fracture interaction and geological complexities to provide insights around zipper fracture behavior. Conclusions will be linked to production and a comparison of strategies with key learnings will be outlined. |Introduction  |Zipper fracturing is a completion methodology commonly executed in many shale developments. Initially, operators implemented zipper fracs to enhance operational efficiency and to reduce cycle time between frac stages. However, recent industry work and publications indicate zipper fracturing can lead to enhanced production and ultimate recoveries. This paper will use a combination of surveillance and completions trials to explore the impact zipper fracs can have on hydraulic fractures. |On multiple well pads, the zippering technique is used on horizontal well plug and perf completions. During the pumping operations of a frac stage, wireline is rigged up on an offset well running in hole to set a plug and perforate casing. At the conclusion of the stimulation job, wireline rigs down from the offset well and moves to the next well on the pad to prep for pumping operations. The crews then isolate the wells that have a completed stage and redirect the pumps to frac the well that was just prepared with wireline. The sequence is reminiscent of a zipper closing to link the protruding teeth along the seams of a jacket – one by one each stage is completed in an alternating sequence.|","Document Type

361,362,2435484-MS,A Geomechanical Study of Refracturing Based on Microseismic Observations - Case Study of Haynesville and Eagle Ford Wells,"Agharazi, Alireza, MicroSeismic Inc.| Kashikar, Sudhendu, MicroSeismic Inc.","|Summary |Microseismic monitoring of refracturing of depleted horizontal wells frequently shows a concentration of microseismic activity at the heel area when no mechanical isolation is used. This observation suggests that a considerable length of the well toward the toe does not benefit from refracturing and remains unstimulated. Different completion techniques, ranging from injecting diverters to using mechanical intervention methods, are usually used to avoid the localized stimulation and to enhance the treatment effectiveness. However, often overlooked is the effect of the reservoir rock's mechanical characteristics and how they contribute to the treatment results. |In this study we investigated the potential contributing factors to the observed microseismic response: i) fluid pressure drop along the lateral, ii) diverter ineffectiveness, and iii) stimulation of pre-existing fractures versus developing fresh fractures from new perforations. Estimation of pressure losses along the well for the common casing diameters and fracturing fluids indicates that a high pressure gradient develops along the well during refracturing. It results in significantly higher injection pressures at the heel than at the toe, leading to higher discharge rates at the heel. If the added diverters fail to seal off the perforations at the heel area, this condition persists throughout the treatment and causes the localized stimulation of the rock, as is usually observed by microseismic monitoring. |The numerical simulation of refracturing indicates that under a non-uniform treatment pressure profile and in the absence of effective diverters, the initiation and propagation of new hydraulic fractures is unlikely. The dominant stimulation mechanism is the shear failure of natural fractures, driven by the increase of fluid pressure by injection of fluid through the old perforations. This result is consistent with the observed long delay in microseismic response to refracturing and the increasing event counts as pumping continues. |Based on these findings, we developed an alternative refracturing method that aims at increasing the reservoir effective complexity and enhancing the conductivity of the pre-existing hydraulic fractures uniformly along the well. The proposed method consists of a prolonged low-pressure and low-rate pad stage to pressurize the reservoir, followed by a high-pressure injection stage to stimulate the pressurized natural fractures and to place proppant in the new fractures. Critical to the success of this method is to avoid a high pressure contrast along the well. This can be achieved by proper selection of injection pressure and fluid viscosity with respect to the reservoir stresses and pressure, and the well characteristics. Numerical simulations indicate that the proposed method can considerably enhance the efficiency of refracturing, at no additional cost compared to the common refracturing methods.|","Document Type

As horizontal drilling activities have grown the areal heterogeneity in the unconventional play is revealed to be far more complex than what was initially thought. In order to address this complexity a 3D model is necessary to guide landing the horizontal well, designing the completion and determining the appropriate well spacing. Fortunately, 3D models can be built from the thousands of commingled vertical wells that exist in many development areas in the Permian Basin that provide valuable information, ranging from cores and logs, to pressure and production. In some areas, 3D seismic data exists to provide inter-well information. In this paper, we present an integrated workflow which utilizes multi-scale data from multiple sources that has been successfully applied to our unconventional reservoir factory-model development in the Permian Basin. |The proposed workflow adapts a top-down concept and fits factory-model batch development: progressing the model from a big 3D model to pad-scale and single well models. A fine-grid field-scale earth model covering tens of square miles including structure, reservoir properties and geomechanical properties is built based on existing vertical wells, newly drilled horizontal wells and seismic interpretation if available. A pad-scale model can be modified from the field model based on local information and used to evaluate multi-well interference, landing strategy and well spacing. A single well model with the smallest scale can be cut from the pad-scale model for landing and completion design. Hydraulic fracture with a discrete naturally fractured network is modeled subsequently and directly converted to unstructured reservoir simulation grid fitting reservoir simulator. The workflow forms an iterative process to update field-, pad- and well-models, as existing wells deplete and new wells are put on production through time. A case using more than 1,000 vertical wells from the Midland Basin will be presented, clearly demonstrating an approach to effectively leveraging all existing data and improving factory-model deployment. |In-house uncertainty analysis package is linked to both hydraulic fracture modeling and reservoir simulation. The package handles a variety of key parameters for hydraulic fracturing and flow performance, such as completions design, discrete fracture network (DFN) characterization and generation, unpropped hydraulic fracture properties, fracture compaction, and matrix permeability. The uncertainty analysis helps understand the relative impacts of different parameters and drive specific data collection.|","Document Type

The method is based on the observation that fractures retain a finite aperture after asperities come into contact (mechanical closure). An empirical, nonlinear joint-closure law is used to relate the after-closure fracture aperture and stiffness (the reciprocal of compliance) to effective normal stress. Fracture closure increases fracture stiffness, which, in low-permeability formations, causes an increase in the pressure derivative. On the basis of these insights, we propose the fracture-compliance method, which consists of picking closure at the first point of deviation from linearity on a plot of pressure or G<U+00D7>dP/dG vs. G-time (after the end of the very-early-time transient associated with wellbore and near-wellbore friction and fracture tip-extension). The contribution of this paper is to provide theoretical justification for why closure is best picked with the fracture-compliance method, and not with other widely used methods. We provide a series of numerical DFIT simulations to demonstrate the sensitivity of the pressure transient to input parameters. Governing equations are derived and used to demonstrate the effect of changing fracture aperture after closure. A field DFIT data set is analyzed with the new method. Finally, a field example is presented in which downhole tiltmeter measurements provide an independent estimate of the minimum principal stress.|","Fracturing, Simulation, Diagnostic Fracture Injection Tests, Geomechanics, DFIT",15

Upscaling of hydrocarbon transport processes in shales is challenging because of the low permeability and strong heterogeneity. Rock characterization with high-resolution imaging [X-ray tomography and scanning electron microscope (SEM)] is usually highly localized and contains significant uncertainties because of the small field of view. Therefore, an effective high-performance computing method is required to collect information over a larger scale to meet the ergodicity requirement in upscaling. The lattice Boltzmann (LB) method has received significant attention in computational fluid dynamics because of its capability in coping with complicated boundary conditions. A combination of high-resolution imaging and LB simulation is a powerful approach for evaluating the transport properties of a porous medium in a timely manner, on the basis of the numerical solution of the Navier-Stokes equations and Darcy’s law. In this work, a graphics-processing-unit (GPU) -enhanced lattice Boltzmann simulator (GELBS) was developed, which was optimized by GPU parallel computing on the basis of the inherent parallelism of the LB method. Specifically, the LB method was used to implement the computational kernel; a sparse data structure was applied to optimize memory allocation; the OCCA (Medina et al. 2014) portability library was used, which enables the GELBS codes to use different application-programming interfaces (APIs) including open computing language (OpenCL), compute unified device architecture (CUDA), and open multiprocessing (OpenMP). OpenCL is an open standard for cross-platform parallel computing, CUDA is supported only by NVIDIA devices, and OpenMP is primarily used on central processing units (CPUs). It was found that the GPU-accelerated code was approximately 1,000 times faster than the unoptimized serial code and 10 times faster than the parallel code run on a standalone CPU. The CUDA code was slightly faster than OpenCL code on the NVIDA GPU because of the extra cost of OpenCL used to adapt to a heterogeneous platform. The GELBS was validated by comparing it with analytical solutions, laboratory measurements, and other independent numerical simulators in previous studies, and it was proved to have a second-order global accuracy. The GELBS was then used to analyze thin cuttings extracted from a sandstone reservoir and a shale-gas reservoir. The sandstone permeabilities were found relatively isotropic, whereas the shale permeabilities were strongly anisotropic because of the horizontal lamination structure. In shale cuttings, the average permeability in the horizontal direction was higher than that in the vertical direction by approximately two orders of magnitude. Correlations between porosity and permeability were observed in both rocks. The combination of GELBS and high-resolution imaging methods makes for a powerful tool for permeability evaluation when conventional laboratory measurement is impossible because of small cuttings sizes. The constitutive correlations between geometry and transport properties can be used for upscaling in different rock types. The GPU-optimized code significantly accelerates the computing speed; thus, many more samples can be analyzed given the same processing time. Consequently, the ergodicity requirement is met, which leads to a better reservoir characterization.|","Lattice Boltzmann, GPU, OCCA, Reservior Characterization, Parallel Computing",27

The Sichuan Basin with comparatively favorable Lower Paleozoic shale geology is multi-tectonic event stacked basin located in the northwest of Yangtze Platform. Abnormally large fluid pressure has been encountered in widely separated anticlines in the Eastern and Southern Sichuan Basin. At the same time, the Central Uplift zone provides a case in which the system evolved from overpressure to normal pressure due to the effects of uplift and erosion. However, the mechanisms responsible for over-pressuring maintenance and productive potential have not been well conducted and there are even many uncertainties to identify productive potential of the shale plays under considerably structural complexity and present-day active compression mainly influenced by the subduction and collision between the Indian Plate and the Eurasian Plate. |In this paper, the impact of the long-term and the short term cycles variations in the distribution and quality of organic matter rich shale reservoirs through a completed sequential analysis are discussed and also the characteristics of fractures related to the detachment anticline and fault for the thrusting under the background of regional tectonics and burial history, especially bedding-parallel fibrous calcite layers situated between strong layer and week layer within relatively brittle siliceous and carbonaceous shale of the lower Longmaxi interval, are integrated with fluid inclusion microthermometry and documentary geologic data to interpret key deformation events, hydrocarbon generation and variation in fluid pressure and temperature through time. Further consideration of tectonic compression in different geologic setting is taken in the study to shed light on the dynamic processes involved in the preservation potential of subsurface high fluid overpressures and the great effect on shale gas production. Evidences suggest that considerable complexity of structure and in-situ stress is not simply negative for the Lower Paleozoic shale in Southern China. That the drilling and completion practice matches the geological condition is significantly helpful to face fracturing and production challenges of shale gas reservoirs in Sichuan Basin and surrounding.|","Document Type

The code is efficient enough to perform field-scale simulations of hydraulic fracturing in DFNs containing thousands of fractures, without relying on distributed-memory parallelization. The simulator can describe propagation of hydraulic fractures and opening and shear stimulation of natural fractures. Fracture elements can open or slide, depending on their stress state, fluid pressure, and mechanical properties. Fracture sliding occurs in the direction of maximum resolved shear stress. Nonlinear empirical equations are used to relate normal stress, fracture opening, and fracture sliding to fracture aperture and transmissivity. Fluid leakoff is treated with a semianalytical 1D leakoff model that accounts for changing pressure in the fracture over time. Fracture propagation is modeled with linear-elastic fracture mechanics. The Forchheimer equation (Forchheimer 1901) is used to simulate non-Darcy pressure drop in the fractures because of high flow rate. A crossing criterion is implemented that predicts whether propagating hydraulic fractures will cross natural fractures or terminate against them, depending on orientation and stress anisotropy. Height containment of propagating hydraulic fractures between bedding layers can be modeled with a vertically heterogeneous stress field or by explicitly imposing hydraulic-fracture-height containment as a model assumption. Limitations of the model are that all fractures must be vertical; the mechanical calculations assume a linearly elastic and homogeneous medium; proppant transport is not included; and the locations of potentially forming hydraulic fractures must be specified in advance. Simulations were performed of a single propagating hydraulic fracture with and without leakoff to validate the code against classical analytical solutions. Field-scale simulations were performed of hydraulic fracturing in a densely naturally fractured formation. The simulations demonstrate how interaction with natural fractures in the formation can help explain the high net pressures, relatively short fracture lengths, and broad regions of microseismicity that are often observed in the field during stimulation in low-permeability formations, and that are not predicted by classical hydraulic-fracturing models. Depending on input parameters, our simulations predicted a variety of stimulation behaviors, from long hydraulic fractures with minimal leakoff into surrounding fractures to broad regions of dense fracturing with a branching network of many natural and newly formed fractures.|","Hydromechanical, Modeling, Unconventionals, DFN, Hydraulic fracturing",21

The objective for this work is to develop a multicontinuum formulation for the gas transport in shale that is valid for high Knudsen number flow regimes in organic nanopores. The multicontinuum model (dual porosity-dual permeability) incorporates microfractures, inorganic matrix, and organic matter and is useful for interpretation of pulse-decay experiments. In the formulation, a mass balance equation is established for the gas in shale. The R13-AP model is used to develop transport equations in inorganic matrix. A Fickian diffusion flow is used for flow in organic nanopores based on the understandings from molecular dynamics simulations. Flow in each continuum is coupled with the other ones using mass exchange terms. In the presented results in this study, the thermodynamic behavior of gas is simplified by the real gas equation of state. A more realistic relationship between pressure and concentration should be developed to have more accurate results. The developed model has the advantage of having less input parameters that need to be history-matched with experimental data. It also incorporated the multilayer adsorption. |Introduction |Shale gas reservoirs are becoming an increasingly important source of energy throughout the world. Flow of gas in these resources is of multi-scale nature; each scale with different underlying physics. The fabric of these valuable resources are mainly organic matter (kerogen), inorganic material, and natural fractures. In shale resources, large portions of the original gas in place is stored within the organic nano-scale pores of kerogen in the form of free gas, adsorbed gas, and dissolved gas. The governing equations describing the flow in this pores is described by Fickian transport. The stored gas from kerogen flows from the kerogen to inorganic matrix, which consists of microfractures and fissures Depending on the sizes of the openings in inorganic matrix (and therefore, the Knudsen number), the flow regime may fall into non-continuum flow regimes (slip and transition flow regimes). In the largest scale, flow of the free gas from the inorganic matrix into the hydraulic fracture. In this scale, the conventional flow equation, i.e., Darcy equation, is valid; however, high velocities of fluids in this scale can cause deviations from the Darcy equation in the form of interial flow regimes, i.e., Forchheimer equation. Therefore, to accurately model the initial fluids in place and their rates of production from the shale reservoir to the surface, all the scales with the underlying constitutive equations should be put into a framework to simulate the fluid flow. Moreover, shale core characterization methods should be equipped with this formulations to determine the storage and transport properties of the shale cores.|","Document Type

The integrated analysis included a combination of geochemical, petrophysical, geomechanical, and pressure transient analyses for the following objectives: 1) emphasize the importance of the kerogen transformation ratio (TR) as a key factor governing abnormal pressures in source rocks, 2) provide a regional understanding of the subsurface pressure environment that typifies the existence of unconventional resources in the Jurassic source rocks in Saudi Arabia, and 3) predict abnormal pressures to support the optimization of horizontal drilling and multi-stage hydraulic fracturing completion designs for maximizing estimated ultimate recovery (EUR), reducing cost and increasing efficiency. |Abnormally high pressures in source rocks are caused by the diffusion restriction of petroleum-generation pressures. Upon thermal maturation of organic matter, volume expansion, including organic- and inorganic-porosity development (i.e., petroleum-expulsion fracture porosity), is governed by the TR of the higher-density organic matter into lower-density petroleum fluids. The petroleum-generation pressure diffusion was simulated considering one-dimensional models of different sets of rock properties surrounding an actively petroleum-generating source rock with increasing the TR. Results indicate that at a high TR, there is inadequate elastic deformation (porosity dilation) of pre-existing organic and inorganic pore space to offer storage for all of the expelled petroleum. This imbalance between the rate of organic matter transformation and porosity dilation causes pressure to increase and fracture porosity to develop with 40% to 70% diffusion restriction for pressures. This restriction can maintain pressures above the regional normal hydrostatic pressure resulting in prolific, abnormally pressured hydrocarbon reservoirs. |A new integrated approach is introduced in this study for generating three-dimensional models for pore pressures in source rocks as follows: 1) estimate the TR through rock-evaluation data analysis, 2) apply total organic content (TOC) normalization and TR corrections to sonic log data, 3) use a modified TR-derived method for pore pressure prediction, and 4) build a three-dimensional property model for pore pressure. |Pressures were also estimated from the analysis of dynamic data (extended flow and pressure buildup data). The standard analysis method is enhanced to take into account the uniqueness of unconventional resources. A consistent estimate of abnormal pressures is obtained from this integrated analysis. |Field examples are also included to demonstrate the implications of this integrated methodology for the optimization of horizontal drilling and multi-stage hydraulic fracturing designs.

369,370,2448089-MS,Geomechanical Modeling of Flowback Scenarios to Establish Best Practices in the Midland Basin Horizontal Program,"Wilson, Kurt, Chevron Corporation| Ahmed, Ibraheem, Chevron Corporation| MacIvor, Kirk, Chevron Corporation","|Abstract |A multifrac horizontal flowback program in shales must address several competing objectives. The desire for short-term and immediate high initial production (IP) rates must be balanced with the potential for damage to the proppant pack and near-wellbore region resulting from an aggressive drawdown strategy. To understand the potential for this damage, a series of geomechanical models were constructed to calculate the effective stress in the near-wellbore region that results when different drawdown scenarios are applied. The different drawdown scenarios used in the model were based on hourly bottomhole pressure declines that are typically observed in the field, ranging from 0.5 to 20 psi/hour. This model was constructed using core-derived mechanical properties and in-situ stress and pore pressure estimates from a calibrated dipole sonic log. |The study concluded that a drawdown of 1 to 5 psi/hour helps to significantly reduce the peak stress imposed on the proppant pack. Actual production performance has indicated that reasonably high production volumes are still achievable while maintaining these lower drawdown rates. Water handling volumes are also reduced significantly. The modeling was used to support a basin-wide drawdown management document to establish field production practices in the horizontal well program. Finally, a comparison of well performance resulting from various drawdown strategies is presented to support the development of best practices. |Introduction |Flowback practices in unconventional reservoirs have been the subject of increasing interest to the industry in recent years (Jacobs 2015). Unconventional wells are often overpressured, which can lead to very high production rates and rapid drawdowns of flowing bottomhole pressure (FBHP). Due to the low permeability of the formation, high pressure gradients may develop near the wellbore which can lead to increased stress and fracture damage. |Additionally, the proliferation of electronic gauges with high data frequency has allowed real-time monitoring of well performance, providing the engineer with more flexibility in production optimization (Deen, Daal and Tucker 2015). There are many value drivers when designing a choke management strategy for unconventional reservoirs, several of which are summarized in Figure 1. A conservative drawdown strategy utilizes a smaller choke size to restrict flowing bottomhole pressure (FBHP) declines over the course of several months. A conservative strategy has several potential benefits including minimizing fracture damage, maintaining the reservoir pressure above saturation pressure for a longer period of time in order to maximize liquid recovery, and reducing the size of permanent facilities. Additionally, a conservative drawdown strategy can also mitigate sand production to protect surface facilities (Karantinos, et al. 2016). Conservative drawdown strategies are routinely utilized on wells in overpressured gas shales such as the Haynesville (Okouma Mangha, et al. 2011), Montney (White, Lavery and Rock 2014), and the deep Utica (Consol Energy 2016).|","Document Type

One of the most important parameters for engineers is the tensile strength of the shale reservoir rocks, which is affected by the amount of ductile vs brittle minerals, the amount of kerogen, the textures of the rock, and the saturation states. In this study we investigate the effect on the tensile strength measured from Brazilian tests of the lamination and mineral assemblage, using computed tomographic (CT) imaging and X-ray diffraction (XRD). |A group of Mancos and Eagle Ford samples from commercial sources were prescreened (to exclude samples with noticeable fractures) and tested for the Brazilian tensile strength at different orientation relative to the bedding plane, in addition to CT scan and X ray diffraction; Scanning Electron microscopy (SEM) is performed on a selected number of samples. Bulk XRD analysis is performed on pulverized rock subsamples and also on polished rock samples; large scaled lamination analysis is carried out on CT images; SEM images are used to evaluate whether fine scale fractures and mineral orientation has any effect on the tensile strength measured at different relative positions. |Our results show that the amount of ductile clay minerals is the most important factor; overall the brittle-quartz-and-calcite-rich Eagle Ford samples have higher average tensile strength (~700psi) whereas the ductile, clay-rich Mancos samples have a lower average tensile strength (~400psi). Within each group, the trend of the tensile strength and the relative amount of brittle minerals also exists. The sharply defined laminations of Eagle Ford shales results in a larger degree of anisotropy of tensile strength than these in Mancos Shale, and in the Eagle Ford samples there are more shear failures along the weak lamination planes. The failure along the laminations appears related to sedimentary features and not to mineralogy.|","Document Type

371,372,2441857-MS,Improved Petrophysical Interpretation of Laboratory Pressure-Step-Decay Measurements on Ultra-Tight Rock Samples,"Dadmohammadi, Younas, The University of Oklahoma| Misra, Siddharth, The University of Oklahoma| Sondergeld, Carl H., The University of Oklahoma| Rai, Chandra S., The University of Oklahoma","|Abstract |Hydrocarbon-bearing ultra-tight formations generally exhibit heterogeneous, anisotropic, and pressure-dependent petrophysical properties. Consequently, various laboratory measurements on separate core plugs and crushed rock samples from tight formations tend to generate inconsistent petrophysical estimates. These inconsistencies are further escalated by the existence of varied pressure- and pore-size-dependent fluid flow mechanisms in the nanopores of ultra-tight formations. We circumvent such discrepancies in petrophysical estimates by simultaneously estimating six petrophysical parameters from laboratory-based pressure-step-decay measurement on a single ultra-tight rock sample. The proposed method involves nitrogen gas injection into an ultra-tight rock sample at multiple stepwise pressure increments, high-resolution pressure-decay measurement at the outlet, followed by a deterministic inversion of the measured downstream pressure data based on numerical finite-difference modeling of nitrogen gas flow in the ultra-tight rock sample. |This work is performed with an aim to improve the petrophysical estimates previously obtained from pressure-step-decay measurements using only a Klinkenberg-type gas slippage model. We implement a transitional transport model that can handle both slip and diffusion. The proposed method was applied to nine 2-cm-long, 2.5-cm-diameter core plugs extracted from a 1-ft3 ultra-tight pyrophyllite block. We estimated the intrinsic permeability, effective porosity, pore-volume compressibility, pore throat diameter, and two slippage-Knudsen diffusion weight factors parameters. Accuracy of the estimates depends on the physical models incorporated in the forward model and on the error minimization algorithm implemented in the inversion scheme. The estimation results are independent of initial guess of intrinsic permeability, effective porosity pore-volume compressibility, and pore throat diameter in the range of 3 nd to 300 nd, 0.01 to 0.15, 10-2 to 10-6 psi-1, and 60 nm to 500 nm, respectively. The average estimated values of intrinsic permeability, effective porosity, pore-volume compressibility, and pore throat diameter of the nine ultra-tight samples are 86 nd, 0.036, 2.6E-03 psi-1, and 195 nm, respectively. Notably, the two inverted slippage-Knudsen diffusion weight factors indicate that the gas transport mechanism in the nine ultra-tight pyrophyllite samples is completely dominated by slip flow without any Knudsen diffusion or transitional flow even though the Knudsen numbers across the samples during the entire duration of the pressure-step-decay measurements are in the range of 0.01 to 1.|","Document Type

The key parameter that separates the unconventional resources from conventional resources is the formation permeability, so all shale reservoirs need to be hydraulically fractured. Successful hydraulic fracturing requires targeting the most brittle rocks, therefore it is worthwhile to classify the shale in terms of brittle, less brittle, less ductile, and ductile zones. To identify the brittle-ductile transitional zone in shale reservoir, we have correlated the mineralogy-based brittleness index to elastic parameters estimated from well logs. The petrophysical model of the study area were plotted to break a story between brittle mineral contents, organic matter, brittleness indices and pore pressure to differentiate the brittle, ductile and transitional zones. Our results show that change in rock minerals distribution and brittleness index follow the trend in TOC, in less brittle to less ductile zone. In addition, we plotted the data in the crossplot of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio and <U+03BB><U+03C1>-<U+03BC><U+03C1> lithology templates, noticed that shale with high quartz and high clay contents fall in less ductile to less brittle zone while shale with high quartz and low clay contents fall in less brittle to brittle zone. The overall observations of our study will support the previous research idea by suggesting the zone of brittle-ductile transition to design the hydraulic fracturing. |Introduction |For a successful shale gas play in a region, the following characteristics (last but not least) need to be considered before going to the exploitation: (a) organic richness (TOC), (b) brittleness, (c) thickness, (d) gas-in-place, (e) permeability, (f) mineralogy, (g) maturation (Ro%) and (h) pore pressure (i) pore geometry (Zhu et al. 2011). Among these characteristics, shale brittleness is more critical to identify the desirable fracturing intervals and propagation for successful shale gas play (Wang and Gale, 2009). Van Dam et al. (2002) also documented in their research that brittleness is an important property that controls the failure process.|","Sembar shale,  brittleness, TOC, ,  elastic properties,  mineralogy",46

Observations indicated that diagenesis-led mineral distribution predisposes rock to a certain fracture pattern. If this was correct, then next question was whether dolomitization preceded fractures or vice versa. The research effort used advanced microscopy (optical and scanning electron microscopy-SEM) along with high-resolution mineral mapping on many samples to answer these questions. The project established a structural-diagenetic sequence of a dolomitic limestone source rock reservoir and fracturing. Impacts of dolomite influence on fracturing in limestone (mainly composed of calcite minerals) were studied using the quantitative evaluation of minerals obtained from a scanning electron microscope (QEMSCAN) mineral mapping technique. The relationship of other minerals to fracturing such as clay minerals within same rock was also analyzed. |In all observations, dolomitization preceded fractures. This was inferred from the absence of dolomite mineral precipitates within the fracture veins. Other observations noted fractures that cut through the host calcite minerals but were deflected away or around dolomite minerals. In a few instances the deflections created multiple fractures that continued the propagation. Fractures also cut through the clay minerals. This observation implied that the degree of dolomitization and dolomite distribution within the calcite matrix impacted fracture propagation in a carbonate source rock reservoir. A well-dispersed dolomite minerals structure in a limestone source rock reservoir contributed to rock toughness, resisted fracture propagation, and possibly generated multiple fractures, because the dolomite grains acted as stress concentrators. This scenario resulted in a larger surface area created by fractures than the stimulated reservoir volume. The energy required to propagate these fractures was high, compared to fractures that were not affected by dolomite and did not need to change direction. These fractures were expected to remain open to some degree, even after the load was removed, due to the teething created by the need for the fractures to deflect. |These observations have the potential for a better understanding of fracture architecture in relation to mineral distribution within a given rock. This information can provide additional input for consideration when determining fraccability index based on rock properties.|","stress,  carbonate, ,  calcite,  mineralogy, Diagenesis,  fracture,  dolomite,  fraccability",50

Seismicity in certain areas of the midcontinent North America has increased drastically in the past few years. This has come to be understood as a result of pore pressure, and stress field perturbation due to water injection. Water disposal and hydraulic fracturing practices both introduce quantities of water to the subsurface which may alter the mechanical quasi-equilibrium established through geologic time. Such rapid perturbation of established stress fields can in some cases cause earthquakes. Because many of these operations are based in historically seismically quiescent regions, even magnitude 3-5 earthquakes may cause significant damage that can no longer be ignored. The public’s perception, and media’s coverage, of this phenomena has produced a significant discussion topic, which impedes the economies of Shale 2.0, which will seek to achieve a more efficient development of shale resources. It is clear that operators do not understand the mechanical impact of such injections, as unpredicted seismic events have been induced at an increasing rate and of increasing magnitude. Regulators in Oklahoma have taken steps to reduce the risk of operators inducing seismic events, however the lack of means to quantify induced seismicity potential has hindered deployment of effective policy. With the advent of induced seismicity, institutionalized trust is compromised once again, and this time during a serious shift in the economies of unconventional production, underpinning not just the importance of the social license to operate, but the effect such public support can have when attempting to deploy the vast infrastructure necessary to realize unconventional petroleum resources at half of the value which they were previously produced. |In order to address these concerns, a workflow is proposed, to combine advanced modeling techniques, with large geologically and geophysically constrained datasets. This workflow is applied to investigate the relationship between complex regional fault systems, and their collective impact on stress fields in a region. The outputs of this modeling workflow can be combined into proxies, and used to investigate areas of the model with stress fields more likely to be perturbed through high-volume injections. Plotting these proxies on a map provides a tool that is simple to interpret, and which leverages large amounts of data and advanced modeling. This simple tool can be utilized by geoscientists, regulators, and the general public.|","Document Type

Hysteresis effect on production strategies can be even more important in very low permeability reservoirs such as tight sandstone, tight carbonate, and shale formations. The reason is that the stress change associated with permeability hysteresis can affect adsorption/desorption and diffusion transport mechanisms which are among the main driving mechanisms in low or ultra-low permeability reservoirs. In our recent study, we investigated – (a) stress dependent matrix permeability of nano, micro, and milli-Darcy core samples for a wide range of net stress; (b) hysteresis of matrix permeability of these cores during stress loading and unloading cases; (c) cyclic matrix permeability hysteresis of milli-Darcy cores; and (d) effect of temperature on permeability of organic rich mudrock. |In this study, we further investigated – (i) cyclic fractured (jointed) and matrix permeability hysteresis during stress loading and unloading of nano-Darcy permeability Niobrara and Eagle Ford cores, and (ii) pore pressure effect on matrix permeability of organic rich Eagle Ford core at 250 °F. |The following are significant observations of this study: (a) fracture permeabilities are more stress dependent than matrix ones; (b) permeability hysteresis during stress loading and unloading of fractured (jointed) tight cores is larger, compared to that of matrix; (c) matrix permeability decrease with stress and its hysteresis during the second and third stress loading/unloading cycles were negligible; (d) improvements in fracture permeabilities were observed during the second and third stress loading/unloading cycles. The possible reason is that when a repeated stress loading and unloading happens, a new flow path that connect the main fracture to micro and nano cracks could be created; hence, improve the effective permeability. This indicates that re-fracturing of nano and micro-Darcy formations could lead to improvement in connectivity of stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) region; hence, improved hydrocarbon recovery; (e) at constant confining stress, pore pressure loading (adsorption) leads to decrease in permeability, and pore pressure unloading (desorption) increases effective matrix permeability back, but with a hysteresis. The inverse relation of molecular diffusion vs pressure is also playing role to the inverse relation between pore pressure and permeablity.|","Document Type

A., Schlumberger| Xu, Jian, Schlumberger| Fisher, Kevin, Schlumberger| Fischer, Karsten, Schlumberger| Morales, Adrian, Schlumberger| Pope, Timothy L., Schlumberger","|Abstract |As the inventory of single well pads in North American unconventional plays builds up, some critical questions that need to be answered are: What is the optimum spacing for an in-fill well? Where new multiple in-fill wells should be drilled? How should the in-fill wells be fractured? Challenging economics associated with unconventional reservoir development demands for an engineered approach for such multi-well pad development unlike traditional trial and error approach that has been widely adopted by Oil & Gas industry. The engineered approach for evaluating the problem relies on expanded seismic-to-stimulation workflow (Cipolla et al. 2011). The workflow involves complex fracture modeling that honors impact of natural fractures on hydraulic fracture geometry, dynamic reservoir simulation and geomechanical finite element modeling (FEM) to compute spatial and temporal changes in in-situ stresses due to production from parent well, which chronologically is the first well drilled on a pad. |The new integrated workflow used in this evaluation involves the following key steps: A 3D structural geologic model based on a vertical openhole pilot well log in Eagle Ford shale reservoir is built. A discrete fracture network (DFN) representative of the area of interest in the reservoir is created from 3D seismic data interpretation. The parent well stimulation treatment is then modeled using ‘Unconventional Fracture Model', (UFM) (Kresse et al. 2011). An unstructured production grid (Malpani et al. 2015; Ejofodomi et al. 2015) with finer cell size along the complex fractures is then created. Hydrocarbon production from the parent well is modeled using dynamic reservoir simulation, and a geomechanical FEM based simulator is then used to calculate spatial and temporal changes in in-situ stress magnitude and orientation (Morales et al. 2016). The modeling workflow is used to evaluate scenarios for multi-well pad optimization in Eagle Ford shale play. In this paper terms “in-fill” well and “child” well have been used interchangeably. |This study evaluates two critical cases. Case 1 focuses on identifying optimum well spacing for an in-fill well that is to be drilled next to the parent well with a production history spanning a little over a year. Child wells drilled 400 ft., 600ft., and 800 ft. away from the parent well are simulated under similar conditions to identify optimum well spacing. Case 2 focuses on four multi-well pad development scenarios in which multiple wells are drilled in configuration A and B at different stages of field development and in areas with minimum and severe impact of kaolinite and smectite rich altered ash beds (Calvin et al. 2015) on vertical conductivity of hydraulic fractures. In multi-well configuration A, two child wells are drilled 600 ft. and 1200 ft. away from the parent well in B1-B2 (Donovan et al. 2010) unit of the lower Eagle Ford. Whereas, in configuration B wells are stacked in different lithostratigraphic sections of Eagle Ford. One of the child wells that is 600 ft. away from the parent well is landed in shallower section, B3-B5 and the second child well is landed 1,200 away in B1-B2, the same section of the Eagle Ford where the parent well is landed. It is important to note that results from this study are applicable to sections of Eagle Ford, where B unit is less than 150 ft. thick. For regions of Eagle Ford shale play, where B Units can be as thick as 300 ft., a similar comprehensive analysis is required to derive an effective multi-well pad development strategy.|","Document Type

The testing assembly used is capable of characterizing tight shales in terms of permeability and ultrasonic wave velocities. The temperature was maintained at 40 
oC with ±0.3 degree C of accuracy during the testing to minimize the influence of temperature disturbance on the measurements. The measurements have been carried out by increasing the net stress. The measurements have been carried out by increasing the net stress from 200 to 6,000 psi using dry nitrogen as the pore fluid. The Pierre seal shale sample contains approximately 60 percent of smectite clay, no organic composition and has higher porosity and permeability than the reservoir shale and was utilized as a reference shale for comparison. The reservoir shale is retrieved from a shale layer belonging to Eagle Ford containing 65 percent of calcite. The main components of clay of this shale is mica/illite and its mass content is 13 percent. The total organic carbon (TOC) content of the reservoir shale is 1 percent. |The experimental results indicated that the permeabilities of both reservoir and seal shales studied exponentially decrease with net stress. The stress sensitivity for the permeability of reservoir shale is three times greater than that of Pierre shale, although the permeability of reservoir shale is an order of magnitude lower than that of seal shale. The mechanism behind the stress sensitivities in shale permeability is discussed comparing stress sensitivity of the dynamic elastic properties for these shales. |Introduction |Coupling pore fluid behavior and geomechanical properties of unconventional reservoir rocks is of great interest for developing reliable geomechanical models for comparing their behavior to the conventional reservoir rocks. Nano-scale complexities and heterogeneous pore distribution along with presence of various clay minerals and organic matter in reservoir shales complicate their geomechanical response changes in pore fluid pressure and other properties during completion and stimulation operations. |In nanopores, capillary pressure becomes high and promotes capillary condensation of the fluid phase (Bui et al., 2015). In addition, a change in the stress field in the reservoir rocks due to the disturbances from the drilling, hydraulic fracturing and production operations can largely affect the geomechanical properties. However, access to reliable stress-dependent permeability data in the reservoir shale formations coupled with their geomechanical behavior in the laboratory under in situ stress conditions is quite limited because of the high cost of retrieving core samples in addition to the expenses involved for their measurements.|",,4

M., Encana Corporation","|Summary |The success of hydraulic fracture treatments is strongly dependent on the conductivity of unpropped and propped fractures. A detriment to fracture conductivity is proppant embedment, which is affected by “in-situ” stress and mechanical properties of the rock, proppant type, size and concentration. Proppant embedment is expected to increase with increasing effective stress during production, resulting in reduced propped fracture conductivity. The impacts of proppant embedment and effective stress on propped fracture conductivity are not, however, well understood in tight rocks. |This study presents results from an ongoing laboratory study investigating unpropped/propped fracture permeability/conductivity and proppant embedment in tight oil and liquid-rich gas reservoirs. An integrated approach that combines multidisciplinary experimental techniques including steady-state gas flow tests, high-resolution optical profilometry, microscopic observations and mechanical (rebound) hardness is used to characterize unpropped/propped fracture permeability/conductivity and proppant embedment. The main objectives are to 1) examine the applicability of this integrated multidisciplinary approach for characterization of unpropped/propped fracture permeability/conductivity and proppant embedment in tight rocks and 2) analyze the impacts of different controlling factors (experimental elapsed time, mean pore pressure, effective stress) on unpropped/propped fracture permeability/conductivity and proppant embedment within the Montney Formation (Canada). |Experimental observations indicate that propped fracture permeability/conductivity can be significantly higher than unpropped fracture (up to three orders of magnitude) and matrix (up to seven orders of magnitude) permeability under similar effective stress conditions for the Montney Formation. Unpropped fracture permeability values decrease up to 95% with increasing effective stress (685-6640 psi), reaching to a limiting “residual” value much higher (up to three orders of magnitude) than matrix permeability at similar experimental conditions. Propped fracture conductivity values decrease up to 60% with increasing effective stress (900-5000 psi), without reaching a limiting value. Optical profilometry images acquired before and after propped fracture permeability tests are employed to quantify the variation in surface roughness due to proppant embedment. Microscopic images obtained on the analyzed fracture surfaces before/after propped fracture conductivity tests are further examined to characterize proppant embedment. |The evaluation of unpropped/propped fracture permeability/conductivity and proppant embedment has been mainly based on empirical field observations that oversimplified the problem. Through application of an integrated multidisciplinary approach, this study provides a better understanding of these coupled geomechanical/petrophysical phenomena by performing systematic fluid flow test under controlled experimental conditions. The findings of this study will be beneficial to operators of low-permeability Montney looking to characterize unpropped/propped fracture permeability/conductivity for the purpose of optimizing stimulation treatments.|","Document Type

379,380,2461443-MS,A Generalized Methodology for Estimating Stress-Dependent Properties in Tight Petroleum Reservoirs and Its Application to Drill Cuttings Data,"Piedrahita, Jaime, University of Calgary| Lopez, Bruno, University of Calgary| Aguilera, Roberto, University of Calgary","|Abstract |The volume of hydrocarbons contained in tight petroleum reservoirs is gigantic. Thus, their development is crucial to satisfy the worldwide energy demand. A critical aspect for the development of these formations is the stress-dependency of rock properties. As pore pressure changes, porosity, permeability and compressibility of both matrix and natural fractures in tight reservoirs also changes, affecting the wells production behavior. |A practical problem in the estimation of stress dependent properties is that the amount of core data available to perform the corresponding studies in tight formations is generally scarce. Under these circumstances drill cuttings can be used to obtain this information. These observations lead to the key objective of this paper: to develop a reliable approach for estimating stress-dependent properties through the introduction of an innovative methodology that quantifies changes in properties of tight reservoirs and how to apply this methodology in drill cuttings. |The model is developed based on the relationship between the cube root of a normalized permeability and the logarithm of net confining stress. An empirical exponent (<U+03B1>) is introduced to fit the experimental data from confining tests conducted on both vertical and horizontal core samples. This exponent allows developing an equation that works independently of the initial net confining stress, which is the main limitation of the models already available in the literature. A statistical analysis is performed to verify the appropriateness of the proposed model for the prediction of rock properties as a function of net confining stress. |It is shown that current formulations are particular cases of the proposed model based on the results obtained for the empirical exponent <U+03B1>. Semilog cross-plots of the cube root of normalized permeability versus the net confining stress using core laboratory data corroborate the robustness of the proposed method. The application of the method with drill cuttings is also demonstrated. |It is concluded that the proposed method provides a more accurate methodology for estimating stress-sensitive properties of rocks in tight formations which are usually naturally fractured. Porosity, permeability and compressibility of tight formations are estimated following the generalized methodology proposed in this study.|","Document Type

380,381,2460490-MS,"Brittleness and Rock Strength of the Bakken Formation, Williston Basin, North Dakota","Xu, Jingqi, Colorado School of Mines| Sonnenberg, Steve, Colorado School of Mines","|Abstract |The geomechanical characterization is essential for the development of hydraulic fractures in unconventional finegrained reservoirs. Rock brittleness is used to determine the best hydraulic fracturing candidate. The formation with higher brittleness is considered to be more likely to develop fracture networks. We investigate the mineralogy-based and elastic property-based brittleness index of the Bakken Formation. The results exhibit excellent correlation between two methods. It also indicates that the black organic-rich Upper and Lower Bakken Shale typically appears to be more ductile compared to the Middle Bakken and Pronghorn Members. However, certain quartz-rich shale successions, indicated by high brittleness index, could be as brittle as Middle Bakken/Pronghorn Members. The core description of these brittle zones also shows the presence of vertical natural fractures. |Additionally, Leeb hardness tests were conducted to better understand the rock strength. Previous geomechanical studies on Eagle Ford Shale and Niobrara Formation have suggested a good correlation between rock hardness and unconfined compressive strength. In contrast to the traditional triaxial and acoustic tests, hand-held rebound hammer provides a fine-scale, cost-saving and non-destructive method to estimate rock strength. This study demonstrates a relatively low correlation between unconfined compressive strength and Leeb hardness. However, this is very likely due to measurement errors and the poor core conditions. |Introduction |The Upper Devonian-Lower Mississippian Bakken Formation of the Williston Basin is one of the most successful unconventional play in the world. Over the past few years, there has been a tremendous increase in daily oil production in the Bakken region from less than 400 thousand barrels in 2010 to over 1.2 million barrels in 2014 and 2015 (EIA, 2016). Both of the hydraulic fracturing and the horizontal drilling techniques have played essential roles in the successful development of this tight oil reservoir. For this low porosity and permeability unconventional play, the knowledge of elastic properties and rock strength is critical to determine prospective reservoirs with existing natural fractures or high propensity to develop fracture network during hydraulic fracture stimulation. The assessment of rock mechanical properties also provides fundamental input data for planning of drilling, completion, and production strategies.|","Document Type

381,382,2429699-MS,Evaluation of In-Situ Stress Environment in the Utica Play and Implications on Completion Design and Well Performance,"Antoine, Bertoncello, Total E&P USA| Frederic, Brigaud, Total E&P USA","|Abstract: |The in-situ stress condition of an unconventional play has a fundamental influence on well productivity because stress controls how the rock responds to hydraulic fracturing, affects proppant-fracture conductivity and alters reservoir properties such as permeability and porosity. In this study, pore pressure and minimum horizontal stress are assessed in the Utica and Point-Pleasant play using easy-to-acquire data and traditional poro-elastic concepts. |The result exposes the existence of significant in-situ stress variations in the play and suggests that changes in kerogen maturity, tectonic stress and lithology cause these variations. Integration of completion and production data confirms that stress variability has strong implications on well performance. Transformation of the kerogen in oil and then gas generates overpressure in the reservoir that decreases the net-confining stress and leads to high well productivity in the dry gas area. Horizontal stress increases significantly in structured areas due to tectonic footprint, leading to higher breakdown pressure during stimulation and lower well productivity. Stress contrast between the carbonate rich Point-Pleasant and clay-rich Utica formations allows increasing pumped fluid volume without excessive fracture upward growth. This study, while being applied to the Utica play, provides methodologies easily applicable to other unconventional plays. |Introduction |The in-situ stress condition of an unconventional reservoir has a fundamental impact on its productivity because stress affects both the reservoir properties and the fracture initiation and propagation. Variation in net effective stress modifies fracture conductivity, reservoir permeability and porosity (Barree, Gilbert, & Conway, 2009; Heller, Vermylen, & Zoback, 2014). Hydraulic fractures initiation requires that the induced downhole pressure exceed the minimum horizontal stress. Fractures will always propagate along the path of least resistance and create width in a direction that requires the least force meaning that fracture will propagate parallel to the greatest principal stress and perpendicular to the plane of the least principle stress, the minimum horizontal stress orientation (Zoback, 2010). Fractures vertical growth may also easily be limited by high stress layers. (Warpinskhy, Schmidt, & Northrop, 1982).|","Document Type

ATCE will be held in Dubai in September 2016 with the theme of E&P 2.0—Transforming and Shaping the Future. This is timely for the industry to gather at the center of the energy world to discuss and formulate short-term and, more importantly, long-term strategies in response to the immense challenges we are currently facing—strategies that call for more-innovative, more-collaborative, and think-outside-the-box ideas, so that we can do more and better with less. |To do more with less, standardization and automation will be key. To do better with less, transformational and innovative technologies need to be developed, but technologies already available in other relevant industries such as mining need to be assessed carefully first. In this regard, some of the selected papers and additional readings shed light on cross-industry transfer of technologies. |With the challenging low oil price, the industry has cancelled or postponed large-scale exploration and development projects and laid off more than a quarter of a million professionals so far. Operators may now have limited capital and human resources. To prioritize, the trend, in the short term, is to focus more on getting the most from mature fields through integrated reservoir studies and infill drilling. Some of the selected papers here are examples of best practices in integrated petrophysical studies and placement of complex wells in challenging geological conditions. A special panel session on this subject is also being organized for ATCE. Join us there for more lively discussion. |In integrated reservoir studies, core data are used as a reference. Quality control of these reference data has been and is being debated openly. With dramatic changes in the last 3 decades, many experienced laboratory petrophysicists have left the industry, resulting in a very challenging situation in coredata quality assurance. Issues such as how to obtain a core without mechanical damage during coring, as demonstrated in one of the selected papers, are fundamentally important. |Finally, it is worth noting that evaluating reservoir and caprock geomechanical properties is not only important to resources exploration and reservoir development but also equally critical to environmental protection and public safety.

This characterization is the foundation for sweet spot mapping and landing zone optimization. The complex mineralogy associated with source rocks requires modeling to take into account the effects of total organic carbon (TOC), clay volume and heavy minerals in order to properly determine the various matrix and fluid types. Petrophysical interpretation utilizing log, core, and geomechanics data is needed to predict zones of producible hydrocarbons. In this study, we incorporated nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (Mirth et al., 1999), dielectric dispersion (Hizem et al., 2008), capture spectroscopy logs (Radtke et al., 2012), x-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), scanning electron microscope images (SEM), crushed rock porosity and permeability, vitrinite reflectance analysis (VR), dipole sonic logs and geochemical /geomechanical core analysis to determine the quantity and quality of the resource. |This study describes the techniques for building a calibrated multi-mineral petrophysical model based on advanced datasets. The advanced dataset model was then used to develop a workflow for wells that only had triple-combo data. We discuss the methodology and pitfalls of our unconventional petrophysical workflow and guidelines for applying this technique in a larger regional context. |Introduction |The Permian Basin is located in the western portion of Texas and southeast New Mexico and encompasses approximately 86,000 sq. mi. (222,739 sq. km.) It has produced over 29 billion barrels of oil and 75 trillion cubic feet of gas since the first discovery well in 1923 (Ball, 1995).

It is clear that within mudstone systems there are limitations of using density-neutron-resistivity logging to identify reservoir quality & completion quality. |Elemental spectroscopy logging tools represent potentially a “game-changer” opportunity, efficiently screening mudstone reservoirs for promising economic opportunities. Instead of focusing on predicting mineral assemblages, we use elemental logs to visualize what drives acoustic impedance (QI) and geomechanical (GM) rock responses within mudstone reservoirs. We also seek to incorporate long standing & well tested ideas regarding linkages between key elemental proxies & organic matter accumulation-destruction-retention, broadening the appeal of these tools within the overall petroleum geoscience community. This will decrease the cycle time to rapidly screen sedimentary packages for enhanced preservation of liable organic matter. |First, using a similar approach to density-neutron crossover to identify predominant facies in sand-rich environments, a straightforward Th/U vs. Ca/Si geochemical logging crossover plot can be used to break out facies typically encountered within mud-rich environments. The use of Th/U-Ca/Si-Th/K ratios in a cluster analysis classification workflow enhances the identification of distinct rock types. |Geochemical facies are then assessed in terms of key (QI)-(GM) parameters derived from companion bulk density-sonic logging tools to assess resource commerciality. Specifically, we link geological core characterization efforts to rock types identified by elemental logs through Th/U-Ca/Si-Th/K ratios. We then associate those rock types to their corresponding acoustic (Vp/Vs and AI) and geomechanical (YM, Shmin, PR) log responses. |In summary, we present a streamlined geochemical based workflow encapsulating the highest value information regarding what controls organic matter accumulation-destruction-retention, as well as relevant (QI) & (GM) rock properties that control effective stimulation. Utilizing elemental logging to generate rock types instead of mineral assemblages potentially represents a viable way to bridge the current gap between geological core description and (QI)-(GM) rock properties driving reservoir and completion quality for mudstone reservoirs.|","Document Type

Refracturing the underperforming wells is an economical practice to mitigate the flow rate decline and maximize reservoir deliverability, especially at the current low oil price environment. Selecting the correct candidates for refracturing is a crucial step for refracturing jobs. Despite the experience that has been gained in refracturing candidate selection for conventional reservoirs and unconventional tight reservoirs, very little literature is currently available about refracturing candidate selection for multistage hydraulic fractured horizontal wells. |An efficient refracturing candidate selection approach is proposed in this paper based on competition between the produced volume and the drainage volume. The well drainage volume is calculated based on pressure and production data, which measures how much reservoir volume is accessed by the well. Instantaneous Recovery Ratio (IRR), defined as the ratio of produced volume to the drainage volume, is proposed in this paper to measure how quickly or efficiently the accessed volume is being produced. Wells are qualitatively ranked based on their drainage volume and IRR after sufficient production time. Accordingly, well production performance can be compared and refracturing candidates can be selected. |Proposed drainage volume calculation and IRR can efficiently measure the effectiveness of fracture stimulation. The proposed refracturing candidate selection approach is first validated through coupled fluid flow and geo-mechanical simulation, which can account for stress shadow and stress change due to depletion for modeling of the refracturing process. Candidate selection approach is then applied to Eagle Ford shale wells. Results suggest that maximum potential candidate seems to be the well with relatively large drainage volume but with poor depletion rate. |The advantage of the proposed approach is that all calculations are based on pressure and production data, which is purely data driven without any presumptive flow regimes. The result of our refracturing candidate selection criteria is compared to that of previous approaches based on production and completion indices. The proposed approach by this paper can select consistent underperforming wells but additionally can differentiate the wells by giving possible underlining reasons for underperforming. Thus, more appropriate refracturing jobs can be designed accordingly to maximize the chance of refracturing success.|","Document Type

The stimulation process often involves shear slip along fractures which enhances permeability. To investigate the impact of shear slip on fracture permeability variations, fractures mechanical properties such as shear strength, friction, normal stiffness and shear stiffness are needed. In this study, we performed laboratory experiments on several shale samples from the Barnett, Mancos and Pierre, to characterize their geomechanical properties. A multistage triaxial testing strategy was applied on shale samples with saw-cut fractures to measure their shear strength and stiffness under multiple confining pressures. In addition, Mohr-Coulomb and Barton's shear strength criteria were used to determine shear strength envelope and friction coefficient. The normal stiffness and shear stiffness of the saw-cut fractures were also estimated through stress and displacement measurements and test results were correlated with mineralogy composition. |Introduction |Rocks generally exists the form as an anisotropic discontinuum, which always moves, deforms and fails along natural discontinuities such as fractures, joints, beddings and faults, etc. As a result, fractures' properties such as shear strength and stiffness not only affect the reservoir stimulation, but also the wellbore stability and production performance. The fracture properties can be measured in two major experiments: direct shear test and triaxial shear test. Direct shear test is widely used to measure the strength and stiffness properties of rock fractures (Goodman, 1976; ASTM D5607-08, 2008), since it is easy to utilize large scale specimens at both laboratory and field site testing. However, the direct shear test has some disadvantages. For example, fractures are sheared without confinements, and the normal stress is limited by relatively low capacity of the shear apparatus, and displacement measurements are usually affected by grout deformation. The triaxial shear test can overcome some of these shortcomings as it can be conducted under confining pressure (Jaeger, 1959; Lane and Heck, 1964; Rosso, 1976; Li et al., 2012). In this test, a cylindrical specimen with an inclined fracture is subjected to a given confining pressure, and then the differential stress (<U+03C3>diff = <U+03C3>1- <U+03C3>3) is increased until slip on the weakness plane is initiated. Thus, the fractures' deformation properties under confining pressure can be estimated from stress and displacement measurements.|","Document Type

The unique visual and immersive qualities that make these devices such great marketing tools are also what some in the oil and gas industry say make them such powerful training tools. |VR technology has come a long way since its clunky ancestors were first introduced in the 1990s. Thanks to high-resolution screen technology and powerful gaming engines, the latest generation has been deemed by the techno-experts as ready for prime time. Equally important, VR has become affordable; some of the high-end devices now sell for only a few hundred dollars. |This confluence of capability and cost is why Vincent Higgins left his job as a senior-level industry consultant to become the founder and chief executive officer of Optech4D. The 4-year-old Houston-based startup develops custom training programs that recreate oilfield and facility environments inside the VR devices. |Ohio Study Tries To Pin a Number to Earthquake Risk |Trent Jacobs, JPT Senior Technology Writer |Research and development firm Battelle is working on a new induced-seismicity study that aims to help wastewater disposal well operators in Ohio stay on the good side of state regulators. |Expected to be completed later this year, the company says the study will be the first to quantify a disposal well’s potential to cause an earthquake. |Concern over disposal wells in Ohio was brought to the fore when a series of earthquakes jolted residents of Youngstown, Ohio, in late 2011. A disposal well near downtown was assigned responsibility for the tremors and regulators responded by shuttering that well along with several located nearby— the scenario Battelle is hoping its study can prevent from happening again. |Twenty-Year Effort Brings Only Two FPSO Vessels to US GOM |Joel Parshall, JPT Features Editor |The floating production, storage, and offloading (FPSO) vessel is the world’s most widely used floating production system, with 218 units worldwide installed or on order. Yet, despite the United States offshore industry’s major advance into remote, deepwater projects, there are only two FPSO vessels in the US Gulf of Mexico (GOM). |Speaking to the Rice Global Engineering and Construction Forum at Rice University in Houston in June, floating systems consultant Peter Lovie, who has worked on FPSO-related projects for more than 2 decades of a 50-year engineering career, gave a close-up view of the persistent effort to bring FPSO facilities to the US gulf. His talk was titled “2016 and Two FPSOs in the US GOM: The Twenty-Year Saga.” |An FPSO vessel produces oil through onboard wells or is connected to subsea producing wells and in some cases receives oil from nearby production facilities. The vessel stores the produced oil in its hull and offloads the oil to tankers that station themselves next to the FPSO vessel, load the oil, and carry it to market. By offloading to tankers, FPSO facilities can avoid the need for oil pipelines connecting to shore and their major installation costs, although some FPSO units do connect with pipelines. |Shell Stays Committed to Shale Opportunities |Joel Parshall, JPT Features Editor |Shell has reaffirmed its commitment to the shale business and views it as a growth opportunity moving into the 2020s, Executive Vice President for Unconventionals Greg Guidry told members of the media in a presentation on 20 June in Houston. |Following its recent acquisition of BG Group, Shell has set the strategic priorities for its portfolio in a framework of three time horizons: cash engines of today, growth priorities (2016 and beyond), and future opportunities (2020 and beyond). Guidry noted that shale is in the last group. |While some other portfolio choices offer better prospects in the current price environment, shale has “material value upside,” Guidry said. “We have a path to profitability, and we are managing exposure. …. We have the choice to activate shale with the right pricing.” Shell’s current shale production is just less than 300,000 BOE/D.|","Document Type

388,389,2459970-MS,Using Fluid-Induced Microseismics to Image Permeability,"King, Andrew, CSIRO| Muller, Tobias, CSIRO","|Summary |The success of an unconventional well depends on the degree to which gas can be induced to flow, that is, it depends on the pre-existing and fracture-enhanced permeability of the rock. It would be useful to be able to image this permeability during hydrofracturing operations, thereby allowing realtime control of fracturing parameters to optimise the process. Microseismic monitoring can show where hydraulic fracturing is occurring, and could, in principle, be used to make inferences about fluid pressure evolution, and hence about permeability. |Microseismic fractures induced by fluid pressure occur behind a fracture front which, in a homogeneous medium, lies at a distance proportional to the square root of time, and dependent on the permeability. In a medium with inhomogeneous permeability, the propagation front will be more complex, but is essentially determined by the fluid pressure, the in-situ stress, and the distribution of points of weakness in the rock. A Mohr-Coulomb-type failure law describes how pressure decreases normal stress on a fracture, leading to failure. |In this modelling, we ignore the details of fracture strengths and orientations, and of rock stress parameters, replacing these with a “criticality field” — a probability distribution of rock weaknesses, expressed as pressure thresholds. If the pressure exceeds the (random) threshold at a given point, the rock will fail. If we know the probability distribution of the rock strength, expressed as a critical pressure value, then every seismic event is effectively a pressure measurement, with a probability density function given by this criticality. |We use a standard history-matching approach to invert for permeability, using an adjoint method to compute gradient information. The data to be fitted can be pressure measurements in boreholes, or “virtual pressure measurements” at microseismic events. Although the latter are much more uncertain, their greater number and spatial distribution mean that useful information about the rock permeability can be obtained.|","Document Type

This implies understanding sedimentary facies and associated basin scale morphologies, lithological changes in relation with depositional environments, and finally the intimate relationship between the most carbonaceous facies (HC production and storage) and those ensuring the rigid frame of the reservoir (hydraulic frac design and management). Final control has to be ensured reconciling core scale petrophysics and production data. |The sedimentary model assesses geological facies definition, their lateral and vertical distribution in relation with sequence stratigraphy. It is the key to predict the areas combining the best factors in terms of kerogen content and lithological composition. Facies calibration is based on core micro- and macro-lithological description (including local microfauna), mineralogical and petrophysical analyses. The sedimentologist's eyes are also calibrated using continuous elemental profiling of the cores to help differentiating between apparently similar cryptic black mudstones. |The good consistency between depositional facies and their mineralogical composition leads to successfully complete log based shale types prediction along all the studied wells. Large scale correlations then underline the links between facies associations and the stratigraphic patterns highlighted on seismic profiles. |Beside the geological approach and its concepts, well completion and hydraulic fracturing treatments proceed on the basis of geomechanical acquisitions. In the one hand, core measurements help defining the main parameters for designing the stimulation job and assessing long term performance. In parallel to classic brittleness indexes, specific models are prepared to predict formation mechanical behavior using core mechanical tests as learning data and wireline logs as propagators. On the other hand, large scale data such as fracture calibration tests, microseismic survey or production profiles deliver precious information on the Stimulated Rock Volume creation. |This innovative project combines the geomechanicist view and the geological understanding of the reservoir. The sedimentary model allows focusing on the best landing points while facies definition helps predicting the quality of the reservoir and its mechanical properties.|","Document Type

390,391,2461604-MS,Refracturing Vs. Infill Drilling - A Cost Effective Approach to Enhancing Recovery in Shale Reservoirs,"Urban, Edgar, University of Calgary| Orozco, Daniel, University of Calgary| Fragoso, Alfonso, University of Calgary| Selvan, Karthik, Nexen Energy ULC| Aguilera, Roberto, University of Calgary","|Abstract |Multi-stage hydraulic fracturing (HF) of horizontal wells is at the heart of successful oil and gas production performance from tight and shale reservoirs. |Fractures generated during the initial HF completion and natural fractures, tend to close as a well goes on production due to the increase of net stress on the fractures. The fractures closure reduces permeability and consequently productivity of the stimulated well. This study shows that under favorable conditions the production performance of the well can be revitalized with the use of a refracturing job. But there are key questions that need to be addressed: (1) When is the optimum time for refracturing? (2) What is the increase in permeability, production rate and cumulative production performance that can be expected from the refracturing job? (3) Is it better to refracture the well or to drill an infill well? |This paper addresses those three questions by considering multi-porosities known to exist in shale reservoirs. This includes inorganic matrix porosity (<U+03D5>m), natural fractures (microfractures and slot porosity, <U+03D5>2), organic porosity (<U+03D5>org) and adsorbed porosity (<U+03D5>ads_c). In addition, hydraulic fracturing generates porosity around the wellbore (<U+03D5>hf). These porosities form a quintuple porosity system that is further fed by gas dissolved in solid kerogen. |The porosities mentioned above are included in a material balance that is combined with fracture closure for generating a model that calculates the optimum time for refracturing. Production rates and ultimate recoveries from this model and observations of actual refracturing jobs are compared with results from infill drilling. By considering the same reservoir properties and exactly the same hydrocarbons in place the conclusion is reached that refracturing has the potential to be more cost effective as compared with infill drilling. |The novelty of the approach is the development of an easy to use production performance method that can be reproduced readily in a spread sheet for calculating optimum re-fracturing time, production rates, and cumulative recovery; and for making quick comparisons of the benefits of refracturing vs. infill drilling in shale reservoirs. Results of the easy to use material balance are corroborated with a state of the art commercial reservoir simulator.|","Document Type

391,392,2460122-MS,Microseismic Activity: What Does It Really Say? Insights from Coulomb Failure Function Analysis,"Roux, Pierre-Francois, Baker Hughes","|Abstract |Microseismicity induced by hydraulic stimulation is known to exhibit peculiar source mechanisms patterns -namely, dip-slip or strike-slip events with polarity reversal, regardless of the background stress. Such events typically strike parallel to the maximum horizontal stress, which also happens to be the direction of propagation for the hydraulic fracture. It has been proposed to explain these mechanisms as slip on the auxiliary plane instead, i.e. horizontal slip occurring on pre-existing features such as bedding planes or, considering strike-slip mechanisms, on the plane striking perpendicular to the hydraulic fracture. The physical source of such patterns remains however largely unknown, although several authors have proposed coherent models. In particular, it is still unclear whether the ruptured and slipping rock is in hydraulic connection with the hydraulic fracture, thus adding contact surface with the wellbore. |In the present paper, I have computed static, poro-elastic stress changes induced by a tensile fracture using a boundary element method, and projected it on either vertical or horizontal planes – or on planes striking parallel or perpendicular to the maximum horizontal stress, respectively. While the modeling shows that both mechanisms are as likely to occur in such a context, I discuss on the conditions required to induce slip on the auxiliary rather than on the principal nodal plane, and draw conclusions on what information is really carried by microseismicity in each case. |Introduction |Although still an active field of research, the microseismicity associated with hydraulic stimulation remains one of the principal tools to monitor and assess the outcome of a reservoir (Maxwell, 2014). With the exponential development of so-called “unconventional” plays (i.e., reservoirs with ultra-low permeability), many groups have been looking for ways to link microseismic-derived parameters to reservoir parameters. While spatial (Fisher et al., 2002) or temporal distributions (Shapiro et al, 2002) are the most obvious ones to use, they have proven to be difficult to interpret because of an apparent ubiquity of microseismic events in both domains, i.e. the existence of microseismicity away from the stimulated zone, occurring either after shut in or at times too early for fluids to have propagated where they occur.|","Document Type

392,393,2461190-MS,Geomechanics of Fault Activation and Induced Seismicity during Multi-stage Hydraulic Fracturing,"Grob, M., IMaGE| Maxwell, S., IMaGE","|Summary |Induced seismicity associated with hydraulic fracturing has become a significant regulatory issue in Western Canada, after the occurrence of felt events in three specific reservoirs. Seismicity results from elevated pressure of the stimulated fracture network reducing the effective clamping force and triggering slip of tectonically stressed faults. Several published examples indicate activation over progressively larger fault regions, as multiple stages interact with critically stressed faults in various relative orientations to the treatment well. Geomechanical modeling is used to examine progressive fault slip from multi-stage fracturing and the associated seismicity. The modeling explores different operational scenarios to examine progressive fault activation as hydraulic fracture stages sequentially pressurizes more of the fault. Testing these mitigation strategies on faults in different orientations provides potential operational guidelines to support seismic traffic light systems, typically used to mitigate injection induced seismicity. |Simulations show that the amount of injected fluid interacting with the fault plane controls the intensity of observed seismicity for a specific fault. Stages farther away from the fault can have an impact on fault slippage but with a delayed effect. Sequence of propagation of the hydraulic fracture stages compared to fault orientation is important. If the first stage is closest to the fault, more of the injected fluid will interact with the fault, triggering a large slipping patch on the fault plane. Successive stages will have a lesser effect due to stress shadowing. However if the first stage is the most distant from the fault, slippage on the fault plane will be gradual, thus reducing the amount of seismic moment release. The sequence in which wells on a multi-well pad are stimulated could also impact the associated seismicity. |Introduction |There has been increasing occurrences of recent seismicity associated with fault activation during hydraulic fracturing, resulting from elevating pore pressure on optimally-oriented, pre-existing faults leading to triggered release of stored tectonic energy (Maxwell, 2013). Anomalous seismicity is similar to microseismicity, although larger magnitude fault seismicity corresponds to inelastic slip over a larger area. However, triggered fault slip has in certain conditions lead to felt ground shaking. For example, three Western Canadian reservoirs located close to the tectonically-active trust belt have experienced anomalous activity: specifically at localized regions of the Horn River Basin, Montney and Duvernay Shales (Atkinson et al., 2016). Operators and regulators in Canada have proactively engaged the issue, establishing operational practices including seismic monitoring for a traffic light system to guide seismic hazard mitigations strategies. Clearly the topic continues to be of concern and establishing mitigation best practices is increasingly important.|","Document Type

The continued viability and the commercial success of the play are highly dependent on the optimization of field development plans through drilling, completions, and production improvements. |This paper presents an integrated solution that includes geologic, geophysical, and geomechanical properties. The workflow includes a Discrete Fracture Network (DFN), modeled hydraulic fractures, and well diagnostics data, to improve the understanding of the subsurface. The goal is to provide valuable input to optimize the development plan and completions strategy in the Haynesville Shale. |The development of the integration platform (3D geo-cellular model) involved detailed seismic interpretation based on a sequence stratigraphic framework, definition of stratigraphic-mechanical units, and incorporation of a robust petrophysical analysis set in a structurally controlled grid. The structural framework of the model was enhanced using over 100 carefully interpreted geo-steered horizontal wells to improve accuracy and grid calibration to the well paths. The natural fracture analysis included core description and fracture counts complemented by borehole image data, which coupled with a geomechanical stratigraphic characterization study, assisted in understanding the field wide fracture intensity distribution and orientation. |The hydraulic fracture conductivity and net pressure profiles, along hydraulic fracture planes, were developed using a planar geometry fracture simulator. The results served as input to the geomechanical model and as the basis for hydraulic fracture stage design setup in the dynamic model. |A 3D geomechanical model was constructed using the geologic model, based on the pore pressure and mechanical properties from calibrated 1D-geomechanical models. Computational geomechanical simulations allowed us to identify reactivated natural fractures, which produced synthetic-microseismic events, and the Critically Stressed Fracture Volumes (CSFV). These inputs were used in the subsequent identification of Stimulated Rock Volumes (SRV). Interpretations are supported by tracer data and other field observations that assisted in establishing inter-well connectivity. |The products from these processes will be incorporated into a reservoir simulation model. History matching of production data will be conducted for validation and refinement. History matched models will be used to identify and evaluate the impact of key drivers of optimization studies to various field development scenarios in order to enhance well completion and well spacing strategies in the development plan.|","Document Type

Recently, the application of multiple hydraulic fractures along horizontal wells has made possible the exploitation of unconventional reservoirs, such as shale gas and shale oil. However, the process of horizontal-well fracturing is uncertain and it is not fully understood yet. There exist many questions about the number and position of created fractures and whether the fracture stays contained within the main reservoir thickness. |This work presents the modeling and analysis of temperature data during and after the creation of multiple fractures along a horizontal well. Our model accounts for fracture growth and closure, the well effects, and interaction between multiple fractures. |The interference between multiple fractures growing simultaneously and the presence of reservoir-permeability heterogeneity were investigated. Capabilities and limitations of information carried by temperature data are presented through different geometry analyses. |A special consideration of fracture growth out of zone was addressed. For this case, it was considered that one of the hydraulic fractures activates a pre-existing fault and interconnects the reservoir with other zones hundreds of feet away. |Our work shows the advantage of the use of continuous-distributed-temperature data in comparison with the traditional single-point-pressure analysis. The local characteristic of temperature allows us to identify not only which of the created hydraulic fractures has interconnected the main reservoir with a different zone, but also the location of this zone. We also account for the effect of the interconnection on the growth of the other hydraulic fractures along the horizontal wellbore. |The simultaneous multiple fracture growth shows that falloff-distributed-temperature data can predict the number of created fractures. More than that, in the presence of heterogeneity, the interaction between the contained fractures can be captured by the temperature analysis. Different from the pressure analysis, distributed-temperature data can differentiate between heterogeneity locations along the wellbore. |Throughout this study, we present a series of examples in which the temperature can provide information that would not be obtained from the traditional pressure analysis.|","Multiple zone interconnection, Horizontal well, Hydraulic fracture, Temperature analysis",19
395,396,178926-PA,Physical Mechanisms Related to Microseismic-Depletion-Delineation Field Tests With Application to Reservoir Surveillance,"Norbeck, Jack H., Stanford University| Horne, Roland N., Stanford University","|Summary |In unconventional hydrocarbon resources, determining appropriate infill spacing for horizontal wells is a difficult reservoir-engineering task that can have major economic implications. Infill-well spacing should be dense enough to maximize contact with the reservoir, but the wells should not overlap into regions that were depleted previously. Similarly, refracturing operations depend heavily on the reservoir response during production. Techniques must be developed that one can apply in the field to identify the extent of the depleted zones near production wells. Microseismic depletion delineation (MDD) was proposed as one such reservoir-surveillance technique. |MDD takes advantage of a poroelastic-stress change that occurs as a result of reservoir depletion. After a significant period of production, fluid is reinjected into the well at low rates for a short duration to cause pressure to rise in the network of fractures connected to the well. One can determine appropriate injection pressures to ensure that fractures that fail in shear during reinjection must exist within the depleted region. One could infer the shape and the extent of the depleted zone by monitoring for microseismic activity during the injection test. |In this study, we used numerical modeling to investigate the physical mechanisms that underpin the MDD technique. We first modeled a multistage hydraulic-fracture treatment of a horizontal well in a naturally fractured reservoir. After the stimulation treatment, we modeled 1 year of production to cause pressure drawdown and an associated poroelastic response. The field test was then modeled by reinjecting water into the well at low rates and pressures for a short time. Shear-slip events on fractures that occurred during reinjection were considered proxies for microseismic events. The heterogeneous distribution of pressure drawdown was demarcated clearly with the locations of the microseismic events. The results indicate that one could apply MDD in the field as an effective means of reservoir surveillance. One could use the modeling framework that we developed to design field tests and to interpret field data.|","infill well spacing, microseismic monitoring, reservoir surveillance, fractured reservoir simulation",16
396,397,179728-PA,Parallel-Simulator Framework for Multipermeability Modeling With Discrete Fractures for Unconventional and Tight Gas Reservoirs,"Fung, Larry S. K., Saudi Aramco| Du, Shouhong, Saudi Aramco","|Summary |Economic gas rate from ultralow-permeability shale reservoirs requires the creation of a complex fracture network in a large volume known as the stimulated reservoir volume (SRV). The fracture network connects a large surface area of the reservoir to the well. It is created by injecting low-viscosity fracturing fluid (slickwater) at very high rates in multiple stages along the horizontal wellbore. Numerical simulation is used to evaluate the stimulation designs and completion strategy. Microseismic (MS) -survey fracture mapping can provide a measurement of the overall SRV and an estimate of the fracture patterns. Special core analyses provide estimates of shale-matrix permeability. The extent of the fracture network indicates that there is insufficient proppant volume, and many stimulated fractures may be only partially propped or may be unpropped. Thus, fracture conductivity will vary spatially caused by uneven proppant distribution and temporally caused by stress sensitivity upon pressure decline during production. Because of the vast contrast in conductivity between stimulated/hydraulic fractures (darcy-ft) and shale matrix (nd-ft), the transient response in matrix/fracture flow cannot be captured accurately if the stimulated fractures are approximated with large dual-continuum (DC) gridblocks. The gridding requirement to achieve an accurate solution in fractured shale reservoirs is investigated and discussed. In this work, the stimulated and hydraulic fractures are discretized explicitly to form a discrete fracture network (DFN). |This paper discusses the mathematical framework and parallel numerical methods for simulating unconventional reservoirs. The simulation methods incorporate known mechanisms and processes for shale, which include gas sorption in organic matter; combined Knudsen diffusion and viscous flow in nanopores; stress-sensitive fracture permeability; and velocity-dependent flow in the high-conductivity hydraulic fractures. The simulation system is based on a general finite-volume method that includes a multiconnected multicontinuum (MC) representation of the pore system with either a compositional or a black-oil fluid description. The MC model is used to represent the storage and intercommunication among the various porosities in shale (organic matter, inorganic matter, fine unstimulated natural fractures). Unconventional simulation involves many more nonlinearities, and the extreme contrast in permeabilities will make the problems harder to solve. We discuss numerical implementation of the methods for modeling the mechanisms and processes in fractured shale. In addition, we discuss the MC formulation, the discretization method, the unstructured parallel domain-decomposition method, and the solution method for the simulation system. Finally, we explain our efforts in numerical validation of the system with fine-grid single-porosity simulation. We show numerical examples to demonstrate the applications of the simulator and to study the transient flow behavior in shale reservoirs. The effects of the various mechanisms for gas production are also evaluated.|","Multi-Permeability Modeling, Shale and Tight Gas Modeling, Multi-physics Modeling, Multi-component Adsorption, Knudsen Diffusion, Slip Flow, non-Darcy flow",53
397,398,2435418-MS,Optimizing Unconventional Field Development through an Integrated Reservoir Characterization and Simulation Approach,"Shojaei, Hasan, MicroSeismic Inc.| Lipp, Casey, Peregrine Petroleum","|Abstract |In this paper we present the workflow, and a case study, for optimizing wellbore spacing and completion design in unconventional reservoirs by integrating reservoir characterization techniques with numerical reservoir simulation. The case study is from a pilot project for which extensive microseismic, core, PVT, and well-log data have been collected and analyzed. The pilot project includes two horizontal wells targeting the Cleveland formation in Oklahoma, with wellbore spacing that increases from 750 ft at the heel to 1,500 ft at the toe. Different completion designs (e.g. stage length, and number of perforation clusters per stage) have been used for the two wells. |A discrete fracture network (DFN) was constructed from the location, magnitude and focal mechanism of the captured microseismic events, which are assumed to represent rock failure caused by hydraulic stimulation. The proppant volume pumped at each stage was then distributed into the DFN to obtain a subset of the total DFN that is likely to be propped. This allows for the application of different compaction curves (i.e. conductivity reduction due to pressure drop from depletion) for propped and un-propped fractures in the model. The DFN model was then integrated with petro-physical well logs, core data, interpreted horizons, and PVT lab measurements to build a detailed reservoir model. Permeability enhancement in x-, y-, and z-direction was estimated based on the number of fractures, their orientation and geometry in each cell of the reservoir grid. History matching of production data was subsequently performed to calibrate the reservoir model. The reservoir drainage pattern obtained from the history-matched model was used to determine the optimum wellbore spacing, as well as the preferred completion design for different scenarios of oil price. |The reservoir model obtained in this work captures the variations in fracture geometry and intensity along the wellbore, which is fundamentally different from traditional models that assume bi-wing fractures with uniform fracture spacing, half-length and conductivity along the wellbore. The quantified permeability enhancement for each cell, and the subsequent reservoir drainage pattern obtained from reservoir simulation, provide a success measure for treatment design of each stage, as well as the spacing among the wells.|","Document Type

Although hydraulic fracturing has been used for nearly half a century in more than a million wells, understanding and mapping hydraulic fracture growth remains a challenge for shales and ultra-tight reservoirs. A number of approaches have been taken to better understand and characterize hydraulic fractures in the subsurface, but a technology which can accurately map hydraulic fractures with minimal operational interference and negligible cost remains elusive. Microseismic based mapping is arguably the most ubiquitously deployed method, but this approach is costly and provides limited insight into characterizing hydraulic fractures. Alternative technologies for mapping hydraulic fractures are currently being explored, but many of these technologies provide only qualitative information or require expensive data acquisition tools. |This paper discusses a novel hydraulic fracture and proppant mapping technology (IMAGE Frac), which is technically robust, easy to use, and low cost. The technology is founded upon basic poromechanic theory, utilizing measurements from surface pressure gauges during the stimulation process to determine the geometry, orientation, and spatial location of hydraulic fractures with higher precision than other traditional techniques, while providing insight into the proppant distribution. The data acquisition approach requires only minor deviations from traditional practices and can be implemented without impacting completions efficiency. This technology has been utilized successfully in over 30 wells in multiple plays including the Bakken and Eagle Ford and is targeted for deployment in several other plays in mid-2016. An overview of the technology is provided along with an in-depth discussion of the validation studies from both the field and simulations. Two case studies are provided, which show the potential of the technology to provide new insight and improve drilling and completions operations. The case studies illustrate specific examples of how this technology enables better selection of landing zones, proppant size, pumped volumes, well spacing, and overall completions strategy. A companion paper (Kampfer and Dawson, 2016) discusses the fundamentals of the technology and provides in-depth, simulation-based studies, which demonstrate the robustness of the technique.|","Document Type

400,401,2439894-MS,"Geological Considerations during Microseismic Monitoring, Processing, and Interpretation of Hydraulic Fracture Treatment","Le Calvez, J., Schlumberger| Hanson-Hedgecock, S., Schlumberger| Primiero, P., Schlumberger| Al-Wadhahi, T., Schlumberger| Harrasi, O., Petroleum Development Oman","|Abstract |Over the last decade, partly in relation to brown fields and unconventional reservoir development, microseismic monitoring of hydraulic fracture stimulations has increased dramatically. Geoscientists, engineers and decision makers realize the value this measurement brings in terms of reservoir understanding (e.g., geophysics, geology, geomechanics, reservoir quality, well placement, completion strategy, etc.). With proper integration of additional multiscale, multidomain measurements and observations, this value can increase even further. |It is not uncommon for mapped event locations, associated source parameters, and attributes derived from surface, shallow wellbore and/or deep wellbore (vertical, deviated, or horizontal) to be taken at face value without proper understanding as to how they have been obtained. This can lead to misunderstandings, misconstructions of measurement limitations, and more importantly, misinterpretations. Using various treatment and monitoring configurations, we demonstrate that ignoring the geology (e.g., lithology, stress contrast, natural fracturing, structural or depositional dip, faulting) and the associated rock properties (e.g., noise, slowness, anisotropy, attenuation) can potentially lead to poor stimulation and well placement, inadequate monitoring configurations, inconsistent processing approaches, and misleading interpretations. |Geology matters for validation of the exploration and production effort. For example, a producer well landed relative to lithology, but not oriented according to the local stress field, will likely not be stimulated as effectively as a properly oriented one. Moreover, if a well is oriented adequately in terms of local stress regime, but lateral variations in stress contrasts are ignored, perforation placement and stimulation will likely be ineffective. If a lateral is landed in a dipping formation, but recorded acoustic emissions are processed assuming a flat velocity model, mapped events will be erroneously located. If a formation is naturally quiet but monitoring geophones are positioned in surrounding noisy rocks, quality of the monitored signals and resulting processing is not optimum. If the velocity model used to process the recorded acoustic emissions is inappropriately blocked, the geological reality is not properly represented, resulting in a biased interpretation. |Often ignored, geology and rock properties play a critical role in understanding and optimizing stimulation treatments.|","Document Type

401,402,2449239-MS,Discrete Fracture Network Generation Using Microseismic Data from a Single Monitoring Well,"Yu, Xin, Schlumberger| Rutledge, Jim, Schlumberger| Leaney, Scott, Schlumberger| Chapman, Chris, Schlumberger","|Abstract |The geometry of fractures, both natural and hydraulically induced, is commonly represented by a discrete fracture network (DFN) in reservoir simulations. Although microseismic data underestimate the total fracture creation and deformation accompany hydraulic-fracturing, it is considered the best means of representing a DFN used as the initial input framework for modeling hydraulic-fracture stimulations. Extracting a DFN from microseismic data requires both the source location and the corresponding fracture orientations determined from moment tensor inversion (MTI). However, although monitoring from a single array may be the most common geometry used for downhole microseismic, inverting for the full moment tensor is not generally applicable due to the ill-posed geometry. We therefore use a new multi-event MTI approach applicable to single monitoring well geometry. This study presents a workflow to generate the DFN using a probabilistic approach applying the orientation constraints from the fault plane solutions estimated from the single-well microseismic data using a multi-event moment tensor inversion (ME-MTI) method. Firstly, the events are grouped with similar source mechanisms from the P/Sh and P/Sv amplitude ratio patterns and the ME-MTI algorithm is applied to each event group to get the common moment tensor. Secondly, a bi-axial potency decomposition is applied to the common moment tensors to estimate the fault plane solutions. Finally, the DFN is extracted using a modified Hough transform algorithm which searches for the most probable planar patterns from the event locations and the fault plane orientation distributions. We use a dual monitoring well data set, acquired in Cardium sand formation in west Alberta, Canada, to demonstrate the feasibility of the workflow. The two-well monitor data provides a bench mark result by extracting the DFN from the population of individual-event moment tensor solutions results. Using the workflow outlined above, we then compare the single-well DFN results with the benchmark. The results show that, 1) the multi-event moment tensor inversion from a single monitoring well provides results comparable with the dual-well derived population of individual-event solutions, with reduced the uncertainty, and 2) the DFN extracted from the single monitoring well sub-set data is comparable with the results from the dual-well data set. |Introduction |With the development of microseismic monitoring to directly measure hydraulic fracture geometry, it has become evident that a complex fracture network is often activated or created instead of a single bi-wing planar fracture (Cipolla, et al. 2008, Maxwell, et al. 2002) due to the heterogeneity of the formation and the interaction of the existing natural fractures with the hydraulically induced fractures (Cooke and Underwood 2001). Accordingly, the prediction of reservoir performance requires models with more complex fracture geometries. As such, discrete fracture networks (DFN) is designed to represent the complex fracture geometries and flow paths created and affected by hydraulic fracturing and widely used as a framework for reservoir simulation (Cipolla, et al. 2010, Xu, et al. 2009, Williams, et al. 2013, Williams, et al. 2010). A DFN is a collection of connected or disconnected fracture patches with certain orientation and density distribution representing the natural fractures and/or hydraulically induced fractures.|","Document Type

Andres, OptaSense","|Summary |The utilization of fiber optic technology is a relatively new technique however is considered a robust method for determining cluster efficiency for engineering purposes. Applications using fiber optic for seismic purposes have been limited, primarily due to directional detection and noise floor issues (e.g. Rassenfoss, 2014). This paper presents a methodology for comparing conventional, primarily mechanically driven, detection sondes to the use of fiber optic cable via seismically generated sources through vertical seismic profiling (VSP). Ultimately we will demonstrate the two comparative methods, through the utilization of a hydraulic stimulation detection project. |Introduction |Devon Energy conducted a multi-well stimulation monitoring program residing in Lavaca County Texas with a target of the Eagle Ford Formation. Two horizontal wells were drilled 500’ apart laterally and 150’ differential in depth, Well B relative to Well A. The goal of the project was to determine if stimulation of the upper-landed well was detectable through fiber optic and conventional tool downhole geophysical and engineering methods. If detectability was determined feasible, a proxy of fracture description and stimulation would be useful for well placement aid in fracture models. In addition to the above an experimental Walk Above or Vertical Incident VSP (ZIVSP) was attempted inside of casing (e.g. Jones and Pereira, 2010). |Fiber optic recording is a relatively new technique, but has been considered a robust method for determining cluster efficiency. A few case scenarios have been identified utilizing the same cable for vertical seismic profiling, however require a need for an increased source effort. Here we show an example of applying the technique with minimal source effort and relatively high fidelity compared to conventional tools deployed in a nearby lateral. Additional to the downhole mechanically driven tools and fiber optic cable, surface microseismic, image log data and near-by petrophysical data were utilized for integration.|","Document Type

We consider two modeling scenarios in which we vary the orientation of the maximum horizontal stress (SHmax) with respect to the orientation of J1. Multiple stochastic realizations of the discrete fracture network (DFN) describing these joint sets, and two fluid viscosities end-members, were considered. Modeling results show that the fluid pressure perturbations extend to distances along J1 and J2 that are comparable to the microseismic (MS) event cloud, making joint shearing and “wet” events a probable consequence of the stimulation. Furthermore, the tendency of the main HF to be captured and offset by J1 and the extent of the offset depends in part on the fluid viscosity, the orientation of J1 with respect to SHmax, the length of J1, and the extent to which their height spans the zone of fracturable rock between the upper and lower fracture barriers. Comparing model predictions to MS interpretations suggests that the most probable geometric scenario for the pad site requires that SHmax and J1 are ~30 degrees apart. |Introduction |The interactions between hydraulic fractures and geologic discontinuities, such as natural fractures, faults, and bedding that have been documented in sedimentary basins (e.g. the Appalachian Basin), where unconventional reservoirs are usually exploited, are very relevant to fracture stimulation design to enhance oil/gas recovery (Carlson and Mercer, 1991). An efficient fracture stimulation design, one that maximizes hydrocarbon recovery and reduces cost, should consider and possibly take advantage of these interactions, requiring a better understanding of the governing processes and the use of 3D fully-coupled reservoir simulators to effectively capture feedback mechanisms. Fracturing fluid can be diverted or “loss” into the discontinuities, which reduced the hydraulically fractured volume, but those preexisting discontinuities could also be stimulated, increasing the permeability pathways.|","Document Type

404,405,2461768-MS,Investigation of Adsorption Effects on Nanopores in Shale Gas Reservoir by Simplified Local-Density Model,"Pang, Yu, Texas Tech University| Soliman, M. Y., Texas Tech University| Sheng, Jie, Texas Tech University","|Abstract |As an unconventional rock, shale has extremely low porosity and permeability. As an adsorbent for methane (CH4), gas storage mechanism is not only dominated by free gas in macropores and natural fractures, but also controlled by adsorbed gas in microporous organic matter (kerogen) in matrix. The simplified local-density (SLD) model has been successfully applied to analyze gas adsorption for coal and activated carbon. Thus, estimating gas adsorption on shale by applying SLD model is regarded as a reliable method. Moreover, SLD model brings several advantages to calculate volume occupied by adsorbed gas, which has significant effects on nanoscale pores in shale, because even layers of adsorbed gas would result in a large decline of nanoscale porosity and permeability. |In this paper, SLD model is applied to analyze methane adsorption data measured from five shale core samples in lab. The volume occupied by adsorbed gas can be obtained according to density profile provided by SLD model. Thereafter, stress and adsorption effects are incorporated to calculate changes in porosity and permeability in shale. Finally, a new correlation of stress-dependent porosity and permeability including the consideration of adsorption effect can be established. The correlation is entered into a numerical simulator to process history match of production data from a horizontal well with multi-stage hydraulic fractures in Barnett shale. Typically, commercial simulators apply Langmuir isotherm to express gas adsorption. With the drawback that it can only properly depict absolute adsorption rather than Gibbs adsorption from lab experiments. However, SLD model can appropriately express Gibbs adsorption and easily convert Gibbs adsorption to absolute adsorption, since adsorbed gas density is obtained. Therefore, simulator can accurately express amount of adsorbed gas and adsorption influence on nanopores. |The simulation results can properly match producing data in field-scale and a forecast based on build-up simulation model indicates that without considering gas adsorption effect on nanopores in shale, porosity and permeability would be significantly overestimated, which leads to overestimation of cumulative gas production. In order to generate accurate prediction of shale gas production and figure out the most economical producing period, it is necessary to take gas adsorption effect into account.|","Document Type

While increasing fracturing treatment size might improve productivity for a lateral standalone, well spacing must be considered as an additional constrain when moving to pad development. |Work proposes to evaluate numerically pad optimization using a reservoir-centric approach, modelling explicitly the hydraulic fracture geometry and coupling it directly to a production simulator. Model calibration is performed by reproducing observed facture geometry events (such as fracture net pressure level and microseismic events) and history matching production of existing laterals in the Vaca Muerta shale. Different scenarios are then considered to evaluate the interaction of the hydraulic fracturing, the reservoir properties, fluid type and well spacing to be optimized in a single process. |Hydraulic Fracture dimensions must match well spacing. At stage level, hydraulic treatment volume should be adjusted to ensure that no excessive resources are used to cover the targeted volume and limit overlap between fracturing treatments of different wells. At perforation cluster level, stress shadow and natural fractures impact the geometry of each different fracture. Variation of fracture geometry along the lateral should be accounted for to evaluate well spacing and prevent the excessive growth of one single facture within a given stage. Completion design can be engineered by adjusting hydraulic fracture treatments to increase the overall consistency of the resulting fracture geometry and reduce effect of production interference between laterals of a given pad. |Novelty of the proposed methodology relies on the explicit description of the hydraulic fracturing geometry and direct coupling with reservoir simulation, not only for a single well, but considering a whole pad of horizontal wells to be applied to the development of the Vaca Muerta shale. |Introduction |The Vaca Muerta shale is located in the Neuquen basin, Argentina, and is characterized by its areal extent, high gross thickness and high organic content (Maretto et al 2002, Sagasti et al 2014) then ranking amongst the top of world resources for shale oil and gas (US Energy Information Agency 2016). First well was drilled and completed in 2010 and even if the basin counts more than 500 wells to date, the Vaca Muerta shale history is relatively recent compared with other known shale plays.|","Document Type

The behavior can be represented in a geomechanical model whose requirements depend on the complexity of the problem to be solved. However, regardless of whether the problem is addressed with a simple quick-look analysis or more complex and advanced analysis, the in-situ stress state is a common input requirement. More specifically, accurate estimation of in-situ stress magnitude and direction is a prerequisite for robust and reliable geomechanical analysis. A variety of methodologies have been proposed for determining the in-situ stress field. Nevertheless, some limitations need to be addressed for a successful application. For example, some methods require data from different wellbores in the same area at the same depth, and some methods either do not address the non-uniqueness of the solution altogether or do so within a limited context. |The focus of this study is to eliminate the solution limitations by combining fracturing and image log data for determining the complete stress field using data from a single wellbore. Fracturing data (e.g., leak-off tests) and image log information (i.e., tensile fracture characteristics) are utilized to determine the in-situ stress field using a novel inversion algorithm capable of efficiently sampling from the complete in-situ stress solution set conforming to the input data and satisfying a priori domain constraints. |Introduction |Geomechanical models quantify mechanical behavior of geologic formations which, in turn, influences the exploration, development, production, and storage of oil and gas in the subsurface. This includes wellbore and/or reservoir scale phenomena such as wellbore stability, wellbore strengthening, hydraulic fracturing, compaction/subsidence, fault reactivation, discrete network stimulation, sand production and proppant embedment, among others. Each geomechanical model is unique, and model requirements depend on the complexity of the problem. For example, geomechanical models can involve simple and quick-look techniques (e.g., 1D log analysis) or more complex and advanced analysis (e.g., 3D mechanical earth models). Regardless of the complexity of the analysis, in-situ stress state is a common input parameter to all geomechanical models. That is, an accurate estimation of the in-situ stress magnitude and direction is a prerequisite for a robust and reliable geomechanical analysis.|","Document Type

It is 30 nm to 2,000 nm in diameter for tight sandstone reservoirs and 2 nm to 50 nm in diameter for shale reservoirs. In a confined system, the interaction between molecules and pore wall surfaces can alter the hydrocarbon thermal-dynamic properties, resulting in a variation in phase equilibrium. It has been recorded in previous research work. However, there is no clear statement for the reason of the confinement effect on phase equilibrium, and the minimum pore size at which the confinement effect is strong but meaningless is not recorded. |In this paper, multi-component phase equilibrium with the confinement effect is investigated, and the enthalpy and fugacity are recorded. Furthermore, molecular dynamic simulation is performed to study the flow of molecules inside nanopores and the energy is recorded. It can be seen that the effect of confinement contributes to a higher enthalpy in a mixture, which helps to keep a single phase fluid, so the vapor fraction for the fluid can be reduced. Also, the effect of confinement drives a reduction in the fugacity of light components and an increment of heavier components, which makes the vapor and liquid phase equilibrium composition become closer to each other. The critical size for molecules to flow through nanopores is two times the biggest molecular diameter. The confinement effect works until a pore diameter is within 5 nm, and it is extremely difficult for the heaviest hydrocarbon component to move out of pores with a diameter less than 5 nm. |Introduction |Tight oil resources contribute to a tremendous crude supply in recent years.1 Its primary recovery still remains low even with the advanced technology in hydraulic fracturing and horizontal wells.2 Furthermore, the production characterization of tight oil reservoirs is quite different from the conventional one.3 Recent studies have mainly focused on the fluid phase behavior in tight reservoirs.4-12|","Document Type

The paper has not been peer reviewed. |Data now show that the behavior of unconventional wells to in-fill drilling varies significantly across basins. A key influence may be changes in pore pressure and saturation (saturation history). This paper presents results from the analysis of the effect of in-fill drilling on parent-well performance, and describes a simplistic approach to understanding the effect of the quest for operational efficiencies and economic cycles on development strategies. |Methodology |This study focuses on two unconventional plays, the Eagle Ford and the Bakken. The objective was to model the well performance of the parent wells with the aim of matching and predicting in-fill-well performance. Because the two assets are at two significantly different portions of the development cycle (Eagle Ford is very early in its cycle), the Bakken data set has the luxury of modeling and matching the performance of the parent and in-fill, whereas the Eagle Ford portion of this study focuses on forward modeling and optimizing in-fillwell completions. |The methodologies used in this study (parent-well modeling, petrophysical models, geomechanics, fracture modeling, production modeling, and in-fillwell/ depletion modeling) are discussed in detail in the complete paper. |Bakken System Parent-Well Modeling |Petrophysics. The Middle Bakken member was divided into three main facies. Petrophysical evaluation indicates that average porosity and average water saturation were 8 and 50%, respectively, for the Middle Bakken. Average Klinkenberg permeability for the entire Middle Bakken is approximately 0.02 md. Mercury-injection capillary pressure curves indicate that irreducible water saturation is between 30 and 40% for rock with porosity between 1 and 7%. Residual oil is between 30 and 40%. Accordingly, the moveable fluid is low (20–40%), and hydraulic fracturing was recommended to stimulate more production. |The Three Forks formation was divided into five facies. Petrophysical evaluation suggests that the upper part of the Three Forks, Facies TF 23, has oil potential. Most facies are strongly affected by calcite and dolomite diagenesis, which allows alternating porosity development in some cases. In this area, the Middle and Lower Three Forks have higher water saturation, with very-low-permeability streaks (less than 0.007 md).|",,37

In this paper, several effects on water leakoff into shale matrix during shale-gas reservoir stimulation are considered. A simplified structure is used to depict the complex pore network in shale. Different interactive forces involved in water displacement considering the osmotic and capillary effects are taken into account in the mathematical formulation of the model. The proposed numerical model is used to study the water leakoff and the consequent pressure increase caused by gas entrapment. The potential influence of the increase in pore pressure on the generation of microfractures is also discussed. The simulation results show reasonable agreement with the previous studies, and indicate that the water leakoff greatly depends on composition and structure of shale matrix. Clay minerals, for example, are naturally prone to water invasion, and draw water faster than hydrophilic minerals and organic matter because of the osmotic effect. Furthermore, the invaded water significantly increases the pore pressure within the shale matrix because of gas entrapment, which leads to a strong nonlinear relationship between leakoff and the square root of time. An increase in pore pressure also results in a decrease in effective stress that leads to the generation of tension-induced microfractures in shale matrix. This study emphasizes the significance of osmotic and capillary effects as well as gas entrapment on hydraulic-fracturing treatment of shale-gas reservoirs. Moreover, the new leakoff model can be applied to assist the investigation of fracture-propagation behavior in a shale-gas reservoir.|","shale gas, osmotic pressure, leak-off, capillary pressure",15
412,413,178618-PA,Numerical Investigation of Coupling Multiphase Flow and Geomechanical Effects on Water Loss During Hydraulic-Fracturing Flowback Operation,"Wang, Mingyuan, University of Alberta| Leung, Juliana Y., University of Alberta","|Summary |Less than half the fracturing fluid is typically recovered during the flowback operation. This study models the effects of capillarity and geomechanics on water loss in the fracture/matrix system, and investigates the circumstances under which this phenomenon might be beneficial or detrimental to subsequent tight-oil production. During the shut-in (soaking) and flowback periods, the fracture conductivity decreases as effective stress increases because of imbibition. Previous works have addressed fracture closure during the production phase; however, the coupling of imbibition caused by multiphase flow and stress-dependent fracture properties during shut-in is less understood. A series of mechanistic simulation models is constructed to simulate multiphase flow and fluid distribution during shut-in and flowback. Three systems—matrix, hydraulic fracture, and microfractures—are explicitly represented in the computational domain. Sensitivities to wettability and multiphase-flow functions (relative permeability and capillary pressure relationships) are investigated. As wettability to water increases, matrix imbibition increases. Imbibition helps to displace the hydrocarbons into nearby microfractures and hydraulic fractures, enhancing initial oil rate, but it also hinders water recovery. The results indicate that fracture closure may enhance imbibition and water loss, which, in turn, leads to further reduction in fracture pressure and conductivity. Results also suggest that more-aggressive flowback is beneficial to water cleanup and long-term oil production in stiff rocks, whereas this benefit is less prominent in medium-to-soft formations because of excessive fracture closure. Because no direct correlation between high initial oil-flow rate and improved cumulative oil production is observed, measures for increasing oil relative permeability are recommended for improving long-term oil production. This work presents a quantitative study of the controlling factors of water loss caused by fluid/rock properties and geomechanics. The results highlight the crucial interplay between imbibition and geomechanics in short- and long-term production performances. The results in this study would have considerable impact on understanding and improving current industry practice in fracturing design and assessment of stimulated reservoir volume.|","Flow-back, Mechanistic models, Tight reservoirs, Hydraulic fracturing, Secondary fractures",36

This study is based on multiscale description and characterization techniques with cores and drill cuttings, including multimethods laboratory measurements of key reservoir parameters such as porosity and permeability. A second stage of the study involves the use of laboratory measurements obtained from cores and drill cuttings and their integration with well logs to construct a numerical 3D model of the study area. The 3D model is used to history match gas production, and forecast performance of new wells in those areas where the geologic model indicates potential for gas production. The ultimate goal is to provide a better understanding of the distribution of reservoir properties in the study area for developing drilling prospects and their production potential in areas where reliable data are scarce. The reservoir-modeling stage is carried out by implementing a recently developed methodology that integrates a variable shape distribution (VSD) model, capable of capturing different reservoir properties throughout the whole scale spectrum without any data truncation. Truncation is the excuse generally used for eliminating information that does not fit a given distribution. The claim is that the data are of poor quality, something that is not true in many cases. This new methodology eliminates the need for truncation, and introduces an extension of the VSD approach for reservoir-simulation purposes that reduces uncertainty in the generation of drilling prospects. Core analysis shows that the Monteith A member is composed of complex fluvial-dominated deposits with better rock quality than the shallow marine sandstones of the Monteith C member. This is most likely because of larger pore-throat apertures that range between 0.5 and 1 µm, and a relatively higher proportion of preserved intergranular pore space within these coarser-grained framework grains. Furthermore, the best production performance is from wells that are producing from the Monteith A. Variability of production rates also seems to be controlled by the presence of natural fractures. It is anticipated that the resulting 3D reservoir model will allow improving field-development strategies for this and other similar unconventional gas reservoirs in the Deep Basin of Alberta and elsewhere.|","Reservoir characterization, Western Canada Sedimentary Basin, Monteith formation, 3D reservvoir simulation",44

Thus, we began to examine the phase behavior and flow characteristics of multicomponent flow in primary production in nanoporous reservoirs. Besides primary recovery, our long-term objectives included enhanced oil production from such reservoirs. The first step was to evaluate the phase behavior in nanopores on the basis of pore-size distribution. This was motivated because the physical properties of hydrocarbon components are affected by wall proximity in nanopores as a result of van der Waals molecular interactions with the pore walls. For instance, critical pressure and temperature of hydrocarbon components shift to lower values as the nanopore walls become closer. In our research, we applied this kind of critical property shift to the hydrocarbon components of two Eagle Ford fluid samples. Then, we used the shifted phase characteristics in dual-porosity compositional modeling to determine the pore-to-pore flow characteristics, and, eventually, the flow behavior of hydrocarbons to the wells. In the simulation, we assigned three levels of phase behavior in the matrix and fracture pore spaces. In addition, the flow hierarchy included flow from matrix (nano-, meso-, and macropores) to macrofractures, from macrofractures to a hydraulic fracture (HF), and through the HF to the production well. From the simulation study, we determined why hydrocarbon fluids flow so effectively in ultralow-permeability shale reservoirs. The simulation also gave credence to the intuitive notion that favorable phase behavior (phase split) in the nanopores is one of the major reasons for production of commercial quantities of light oil and gas from shale reservoirs. It was determined that the implementation of confined-pore and midconfined-pore phase behavior lowers the bubblepoint pressure, and this, in turn, leads to a slightly higher oil recovery and lesser gas recovery. Also it was determined that the implementation of midconfined-pore and confined-pore phase-behavior shift reduces the retrograde liquid condensation region, which in turn, leads to lower liquid yield while maintaining the same gas-production quantity. Finally, the important reason that we are able to produce shale reservoirs economically is “rubblizing” the reservoir matrix near HFs, which creates favorable permeability pathways to improve reservoir drainage. This is why multistage hydraulic fracturing is so critical for successful development of shale reservoirs.|","compositional modeling of liquid rich shale reservoirs, liquid-rich shales",17

On top of that, there is always pressure to deliver quality results as quickly as possible. This gives rise to a simple question, one that has yet to find a simple answer: How refined is refined enough and how coarse is too coarse? I run the risk of oversimplification here, but it seems we are faced with a classic dichotomy, one that is exacerbated by the pull of advances in high-performance computing that permit ever-greater model refinement, while, simultaneously, we have the push of (possibly stochastic) sampling of uncertainty, thereby encouraging the development of simplified (or surrogate) models that can run hundreds, even thousands, of times. The question is one of striking the right balance between two apparently contradictory approaches to simulation. The adage “horses for courses” is not particularly helpful in itself, even though it is probably appropriate. Does one have two distinct models with roughly commensurate scaling, or can we build a single all-purpose model with different scales within it that is both fast and accurate with multiscale grid? |Dimensional scale represents just one aspect of the term “multiscale,” which I have mistakenly taken to mean just the juxtaposition of, essentially, geometrical scale within a single model (such as that found in coupling a simulation grid and the wellbore). The large ratio associated with domain size, and the resolution of the geological data, is usually managed by upscaling. However, so-called multiscale methods represent a new avenue of research, one that may provide a bridge between the aforementioned push and pull of refinement resulting from the needs of different decision makers. Multiscale, which has been the subject of ongoing study over the past decade, knits together geometrical quantities (dimensional scale) with tailored computational schemas (numerical scale). This multifaceted multiscale concept may offer a means to construct an accurate coarser-scaled model, one honoring the attributes of the fine-scale heterogeneous geological data from both numerical and spatial standpoints. This method class computes local basis functions for the solution variables, to construct a smaller (coarse) system for computing an approximate solution on the original simulation grid. |While it is too early to say whether this broader notion of multiscale (numerical and geometrical) will provide a single, unifying, model for engineers, it is possible that this, or some other such method, may strike that elusive balance between refinement (accuracy) and surrogacy (speed).

416,417,I-16-642,MPM Modelling of Seepage Flow through Embankments,"Zhao, Xuanyu, University of Cambridge| Liang, Dongfang, University of Cambridge","|Abstract
An accurate knowledge of seepage flows through embankments is necessary for the stability analysis and drainage computation. In this paper, a particle-based MPM model with two sets of material points is used to study the phenomenon. Before simulating the seepage flow through an embankment, the proposed numerical model is first applied to a flow through porous dam problem as model validation. Subsequently, the numerical method is employed to simulate the seepage flow through an embankment with different permeability. Taking the analytical solution under the Dupuit’s approximation as the reference, the MPM model gives good predictions of the shape of the seepage water table.
Introduction
The seepage through embankment is not only important for minimizing the water loss, but also critical to ensuring the safety of the embankments. When the embankment is wide and the seepage flow discharge is small, Dupuit derived that the water table roughly follows a parabolic shape (Keady 1990).
Recently, the particle-based Material Point Method (MPM) has drawn more and more attentions due to the capability of modelling large deformations. The MPM can be categorized as a more general class of particle-in-cell methods. The method was developed by Harlow in the 1950s for applications in fluid mechanics (Mackenzie-Helnwein et al. 2010). However, not until Brackbill et al. (1988) addressed the energy dissipation problem, the MPM implementation was developed at a quite moderate pace. Later the MPM was applied to solid mechanics (Sulsky et al. 1995) and dry granular materials (Wieckowski 1998; Wieckowski et al. 1999; Wieckowski 2003). Later on, this method was extended to handle saturated soils (Jassim et al. 2013) with a numerical approach following the so called v-w formulation (Zienkiewicz et al. 1999). This formulation, which uses the velocity of both solid and liquid constituents as the primary unknowns, was applied to several small and large deformation problems and is able to capture the physical response of saturated soil under dynamic loading. However, only one set of material points was used for the solid and liquid mixture; therefore groundwater flow and the transition between free water and ground water could not be captured, as well as fluid-like behavior of the soil.|","seepage flow,  numerical modelling, Material Point Method,  Dupuit’s parabola",52

In the present paper, three-dimensional finite element analyses of tripod skirted foundations for offshore wind turbines are presented. Combined (vertical – horizontal – moment) loading under undrained conditions is considered and the undrained bearing capacity of the foundations is calculated. Emphasis is given on the investigation of the effect of the horizontal load on the bearing capacity. Non-dimensional momentvertical failure envelopes for different horizontal load values are developed. The effect of the footing skirt length, the footing centre-tocentre spacing and the direction of loading on the foundation bearing capacity is also presented.
Introduction
In recent years, the extensive interest in exploiting efficiently the indigenous offshore wind energy potential has led to a rapid development of the Offshore Wind Turbines’ (OWTs) technology. A critical design component of a fixed bottom OWT is its foundation, which should ensure a sufficient connection of the structure to the seabed and should provide an adequate factor of safety against failure of the supporting soil, especially in the case of extreme environmental conditions. Up to now, conventional piled foundations present the most commonly applied foundation solution, considering that OWTs with monopile support structures have been mostly deployed in existing offshore wind farms. However, based on the fact that for a fixed bottom OWT the foundation may account for up to 35% of the total cost (Byrne and Houlsby, 2003), more cost-efficient foundation solutions, such as skirted foundations (suction caissons), may be deployed alternatively to piles.
The use of skirted foundations in OWTs presents a challenging task, since OWTs, contrary to oil and gas platforms, where vertical loading is dominant, are subjected to very large overturning moments, due to the intense horizontal wind loading acting high above the foundation level (e.g. Gourvenec and Jensen, 2009; Houlsby et al., 2005; Villalobos et al., 2004; Huang et al., 2003). Consequently, very large foundation dimensions are generally required to sustain these high eccentric loads, especially, in the case of a single skirted footing (monopod). In order to overcome this drawback, rigidly connected groups of three (tripods) or four (tetrapods) skirted footings can be used. These multiple skirted footings provide increased bearing capacity, while at the same time lead to a significant reduction of the required minimum diameter of each footing. However, the possible interactions between the footings need to be taken into account during the design phase.|","clay,  offshore wind turbine foundation,  failure load envelopes, 3D finite elements analysis,  undrained bearing capacity,  tripod skirted foundation",39

“Rigs-to-Reefs” is one of the options for decommissioning offshore platforms in the Gulf of Mexico. The retired platforms are converted to artificial reefs by laying them down on their sides. In the toppling process, the soil resistance on structural members is important as it controls how deep the structure will be settling into the seafloor. The Coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian (CEL) technique in Abaqus/Explicit was used to estimate the soil resistance on tubular members and piles loaded to very large displacements into the marine clays. Horizontal tubular members were pushed vertically to more than 10 times their diameters into the marine clays to model jacket legs penetrating into the seafloor. Pile sections were loaded laterally to more than 5 times their diameters to estimate the large-displacement lateral soil resistance in the upper portion of the piles. Abaqus/Explicit CEL technique is robust and efficient in the numerically challenging, large-deformation finite element analyses. Benchmark analyses were performed to validate the CEL analysis results in a uniform soil profile with published analytical, numerical, and experimental results. The benchmarked CEL models were then modified to include a typical Gulf of Mexico soil profile, where the undrained shear strength and Young’s modulus of clays increase with depth. Two approaches were used to define the depthvarying soil properties in the finite element model: a) an industry standard approach by discretizing the marine clays into several layers with uniform properties within each layer and b) a more refined approach using a single soil layer with continuous and gradual increase in soil properties with depth. The results from the CEL analyses using the layered soil profile exhibited significant numerical noises, which were greatly reduced by the use of continuous soil profile. The CEL technique can be a powerful tool for other large-displacement soilstructure interaction analyses, such as jack-up spudcan penetration, pipeline embedment/trenching and lateral buckling analyses. |","Tubular Member, Large Deformation,  Finite Element Analysis,  Coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian,  Marine Clay",14

Fractal dimension is one of the physical parameters that can reflect ore and rock fragmentation degrees. By summarizing the inherent law of particle breakage, this paper proposed a new method for characterizing the particle crushing of cobalt crust. Linear slope and correlation coefficient for particle size distribution in log-log coordinate are chosen as the key parameters. To verify the applicability of the method, a large amount of laboratory test were conducted. In the tests, cutting depth, rotating frequency, traveling speed were controlled. Test result show that the granularity of crushed cobalt-rich crust has clear fractal property, a quite good linear fitting can be obtained by the proposed model. Thereafter, the relations among fractal dimension and cutting depth, rotating frequency, traveling speed were analyzed. The outcome of this paper may have significant meaning in application. 
Introduction|Cobalt crust grows on smooth seamount slope from 500 to 3000 meters depth (Yamazaki and Sharma, 2000), is multi-metal ore that is rich in cobalt, nickel, silver, copper, gold, platinum, and rare-earth element. Now the cobalt crust is an emphasis of researching on deep sea mineral resources both in the home and foreign (Manheim, 1986; Glasby, 2003). Because of the complicated environment of deep-sea mining, cobalt crust cut and broken should be lifted to the supporting ship by the collection and lift system (Chung, 1994; Liang et al., 2002). Undersized granularity will pollute seabed environment seriously, yet oversized one will block the collector and lift system, so the granularity should be controlled strictly in a required range. The collective rate, mullock interfusion rate, energy consumption and the rule of granularity distribution are not only related to the structural parameters of spiral mining head, but also related to the different work parameters (penetration depth, walking speed, cutting frequency) in different tiny topography of deep sea bed. So it is necessary to develop an appropriate model of crushing cobalt crust with mining head and to investigate the influence of cutting depth on crushing process.|","laboratory test,  fractal theory, Particle crushing,  linear fitting.",21

High modulus columns have become general engineering practice in terms of liquefaction mitigation although their effectiveness has not been validated thoroughly by both case and numerical analyses. Besides, only total stress analyses that do not take excess pore water pressure into account widely form numerical studies. Thus, in this study, role of high modulus columns as a precaution are investigated parametrically with intensive numerical analyses scheme adopting effective stress approach. It is indicated that high modulus columns can prevent liquefaction by decreasing pore pressure ratio. Their effectiveness increases with decrease of stiffness.
Introduction
Liquefaction is one of the extraordinary phenomena that could indicate the damage or effect caused by dynamic motion. The reason why liquefaction is an important issue is its strength oriented relationship with soil deposit. During liquefaction, especially in saturated loose granular soils, shear strength and stiffness are significantly reduced resulting in loss of selfstability and therefore, soil acts like fluid (Terzaghi & Peck, 1948). In other words, excess pore water pressure induced by a dynamic motion diminish shear strength of soil by means of dramatically reduced effective stress under undrained conditions. 
In order to prevent liquefaction hazard, there exists certain amount of mitigation strategies. Among them, Adalier (2003) was able to indicate that stone columns as high modulus columns are beneficial as a mitigation strategy in non-plastic silty sands according to his findings by means of centrifuge tests. Based on composite shear behavior of improved soil by means of high modulus columns, Ozsoy & Durgunoglu (2003) was able to relate effectiveness of high modulus columns as liquefaction mitigator with ratio of shear modulus of jet grout columns to soil deposit, theoretically. Apart from mentioned theoretical and experimental point of view, contribution of high modulus columns as a remediation against liquefaction were also verified by few numerical analyses. While some of analyses were performed by using “total stress approach”, few of them were based on “effective stress approach” related with pore pressure ratio (Almani et al., 2013). Based on total stress approach combining with probabilistic approach, Unutmaz (2012) proposed that effectiveness of high modulus columns are directly related with by decreasing column spacing and by increasing column modulus. In terms of effective stress approach, Almani et al. (2013) showed that liquefaction induced settlements can be reduced with the help of high modulus columns by controlling development of excess pore pressures.|","pore pressure ratio,  Finn Model,  nonlinear analysis,  finite difference method,  high modulus columns,  effective stress approach, Liquefaction",30
421,422,I-16-599,A New Study on the Behavior of Pile Groups Using Settlement Based Design Approach,"Alver, Ozan, Bursa Technical University| ozden, Gurkan, Dokuz Eylul University","|Abstract
In this study, effects of pile length and number of piles on settlement behaviour of pile groups are investigated. It is shown that the settlement of a pile group becomes independent from the number of piles beyond a certain point. Effect of pile length on settlement behaviour of the example foundation is also investigated. It is indicated that the settlement behaviour is becoming more effective in case the pile is longer. Besides, a relationship for group efficiency coefficient is suggested for estimating stiffness of a pile group using single pile stiffness by considering the interaction among piles and non-linear behaviour.
Introduction
Settlement behaviour of a pile group highly depends on the number of piles and pile length. In general, settlements are reduced by inclusion of piles (Randolph, 1994). However, interaction among piles cause a reduction in the stiffness of pile groups (Fleming et.al., 2009). Stiffness reduction in a pile group due to the closely spaced piles is known as group effect. Beneficial effects of piles vanish beyond a certain number of piles due to the group effect (Poulos, 2001). One of the aims of this study is to show how the number of piles affects settlement behaviour of pile groups. This aim is achieved by introducing an example foundation. Several analyses are done for this purpose and variation of settlement with the number of piles is shown. 
Effects of pile length were investigated by keeping the total quantity of piles constant. Second aim of the study is to reach the most effective solution by keeping the total cost of the construction to be constant which may be regarded as optimization. The first stage in the analysis was to decide the number of piles and pile length using capacity based design approach. After determining the pile length and number of piles for the first analysis stage, total quantity of pile by meter (<U+03A3> nl) was kept constant by changing both the number of piles and pile length. The reason of using different number of piles for the different pile length is to reach the most economical design with satisfactory foundation behaviour. Optimum design may be obtained by investigating the settlement behaviour without changing the cost of the construction. Several analyses need to be done to capture the variation of settlements with varying pile length. Finite element analysis was used for investigation of the effect of pile length. Eight different pile layouts and six different pile length were used in order to capture the variation.|","group efficiency,  nonlinearity,  finite element, Pile group,  interaction",17

A great potential for optimization of pile and bucket-based multi-footed foundations is the adequate incorporation of the non-linear foundation response in the overall structural model of the offshore wind energy converter (OWEC). Currently, this soil-structure interaction problem is treated by a costly and time-consuming iterative procedure between the geotechnical and the structural model. The paper presents a more sophisticated approach which makes the iterative procedure dispensable. Basic idea is to pre-define foundation responses for arbitrary loading conditions by less than twenty load-controlled numerical simulations. The foundation responses are implemented as non-linear macro-elements in the structural model enabling the incorporation of the soil-structure interaction in the equilibrium iteration of the structural model. The basic principle of the proposed approach can be used for all design purposes, i.e. ultimate limit state (ULS), serviceability limit state (SLS) and fatigue limit state (FLS) design.
Introduction
Economical pressure forces the installation of larger offshore wind energy converters (OWEC) located in deeper waters in a more cost effective manner. Due to the limitations of the currently dominating monopile foundations with regard to the economically feasible water depths, pile and bucket-based multi-foundations will probably become of increasing importance in the future offshore wind industry. A great potential for optimization of these structures is the adequate incorporation of the non-linear foundation response in the overall OWEC models. This regards likewise the consideration of the foundation response for the ultimate limit state (ULS), the serviceability limit state (SLS) and the fatigue limit state (FLS) design. 
For pile-based multi-foundations (cf. Fig. 1, left) the soil-structure interaction may be treated by the integration of spring-bedded beam models, i.e. the p-y method for the lateral and moment response and the t-z method for the axial response. However, interaction effects between the lateral and vertical response are nevertheless disregarded by this approach. Anyhow, the soil-structure interaction problem becomes more serious for bucket-based multi-foundations (cf. Fig. 1, right) due to the missing of analytical spring approaches for the determination of the bucket behaviour. Due to the complex interaction mechanism between the single bucket components (lid, tip and skirt) the authors assume that such simplified approaches with sufficient accuracy will be hardly reached in near future even for buckets installed in homogenous soil conditions (cf. Achmus et al. 2013).|","foundation,  OWEC,  soil-structure interaction,  jacket, wind energy converter",53

Lowering the cost for offshore wind energy remains a major challenge. Increasing the accuracy of analysis tools used in the design and optimization process can strengthen the reliability and reduce conservatism, thereby leading to a more cost-efficient design. Although considerable development has been made on representing the interaction between wind, waves and structural aspects in integrated analyses of offshore wind turbines, the modelling of the foundation remains unrefined. The assumptions and shortcomings of the existing models are identified, and alternatives for a better representation of the foundation response are presented and discussed.
INTRODUCTION
Offshore wind energy plays a central role in sustainability-focused international policies and shows one of the fastest growth rates of all renewable energy sources (E&Y, 2015). A higher energy production due to stronger and more frequent winds at the sea and fewer problems with noise production and visual impact are the main advantages over onshore wind turbines. However, the costs for offshore wind energy are around 80% higher compared to onshore wind (Fraunhofer, 2013) and are one of the highest among renewable energy sources. Lowering costs for offshore wind energy will be crucial for its further success (The Crown Estate, 2012). Up to date, costs for offshore wind energy were mainly reduced by improved supply chain integration and larger capacity turbines (ORE Catapult, 2015). A future key area for lowering costs is more cost-efficient designs for offshore wind turbines (OWTs). In particular, the support structure has high potential for cost reduction, since it contributes up to 20% of total capital costs (EWEA, 2015).|","Soil-Structure Interaction,  Offshore Engineering,  p-y curves,  Aero-Hydro-Servo-Elastic Analysis,  Pile foundation, Offshore Wind Energy",33

The numerical analyses are performed using Abaqus/Explicit finite element (FE) software adopting two soil models: (i) the elastoplastic Mohr-Coulomb (MC) model and (ii) a Modified Mohr-Coulomb (MMC) model. In the MC model, the two required geotechnical parameters are the constant angles of internal friction (<U+03D5>') and dilation (<U+03A8>). However, in the MMC, pre-peak hardening, post-peak softening and the effects of mean effective stress and relative density on stress–strain behaviour of dense sand are considered. Comparison of FE results with physical model test results shows that the MMC model can simulate better the load–displacement response than the MC model. The mechanisms involved in soil deformation are also explained using FE results.
INTRODUCTION
Plate anchors are widely used in many onshore and offshore engineering projects, such as transmission towers, utility poles, earth retaining and waterfront structures and mooring of offshore floating platforms. Anchors could be installed in a wide variety of soils at different inclinations, such as horizontal, vertical and inclined. The horizontal pullout capacity of a vertical plate anchor installed in dense sand is the focus of the present study.
A number of researchers studied the behaviour of vertical plate anchors through laboratory experiments, development of analytical methods and numerical analysis (Neely et al., 1973; Das and Seeley, 1975; Akinmusuru, 1978; Rowe and Davis, 1982; Dickin and Leung, 1983; Hoshiya and Mandal, 1984; Basudhar and Singh, 1994; Kumar and Sahoo, 2012; Kame et al., 2012; Bhattacharya and Kumar, 2013). A large number of the available studies on anchors are experimental. Most of the previous studies focused on the ultimate capacity of the anchor, which has been determined from the equilibrium condition of the soil mass above an assumed failure plane inferred from laboratory tests.|","Soil constitutive model,  Finite element analysis,  Lateral movement,  Mohr-Coulomb model,  Modified Mohr-Coulomb model, Anchors,  Dense sand",31

Two deformation mechanisms named shear dilation and tensile parting occur in this process. The linear Drucker-Prager (DP) model had been used to model the injection of the marine-facies Alberta oil sand in Canada, whose structure consists of densely packed, interpenetrative sand grains. However, for the land-facies Karamay oil sand, the grains were loosely packed and isolated by a mixed matrix of bitumen, sand and clay. Triaxial tests confirmed that the sand exhibited substantial volumetric expansion upon hydrostatic unloading that demonstrated apparent plastic behavior. In consequence, the modified DP model with cap plasticity was selected as the constitutive framework, whose yielding surface takes into account not only shear dilation (plastic softening) but also hydrostatic expansion (inelastic strain softening). Numerical analysis was carried out on a finite element platform to evaluate and compare the capacities of the isotropic elasticity, linear DP and modified DP model with cap plasticity. Surprisingly, the analysis disclosed that all of the three constitutive models gave rise to exactly identical results in terms of cumulative injection volume, pore pressure distribution and Mises stress distribution. |Introduction |Steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) has become the mainstream technology to develop the heavy and ultra-heavy oil sand reservoirs in Karamay city of Xinjiang province, northwest China. The stimulation before preheating the reservoirs in terms of water injection has been frequently adopted to save both time and cost spent in preheating. The stimulation involves controlled water injection to a SAGD wellpair such that a dilative zone is created in the inter-well domain. Here water injection instead of hydraulic fracturing is a more appropriate term due to the absence of stress shadow effects in weak rocks (Lin et al. 2015). Two mechanical mechanisms named shear dilation and tensile parting-induced dilation control this process. The former originates from the rollover motion of sand grains relative to each other upon shearing, while the latter is in fact a hydrostatic unloading of the oil sand matrix (Dusseault 1977, Dusseault and Morgenstern 1978, Agar and Morgenstern 1983, Oldakowski 1994, Samieh 1995, Yuan et al. 2011a&b, Lin et al. 2015). Both mechanisms result in a generation of flow channels in terms of microcracks and expanded pore space at regions in close proximity to the wellbores (Yuan et al. 2011b). The injection process and mechanisms are depicted in Fig.1.|",,5

Especially, the chemo-mechanical process of the pressure dissolution is explicitly taken into account in the model. By simulating the burial of high-level radioactive wastes in the deep subsurface (i.e., by applying the simulated confining pressure and temperature conditions), the long-term evolution of the rock permeability was predicted using the model. The predictions obtained a significant influence of the pressure dissolution on the change in permeability with time. The predicted permeability of the rocks close to the wastes decreased by roughly one order of magnitude in 104 years when considering the pressure dissolution, while the permeability changed little during the same period when the pressure dissolution was not considered. The reduction should delay the transportation of the radioactive materials. |Introduction |It is important to address the coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical processes when projecting a long-term underground isolation of the high-level radioactive wastes. The rocks that work as natural barriers to the migration of radionuclides should be influenced by the coupled phenomena, including the transfer of heat from the wastes, the groundwater flow, the variation in induced stresses, and the geochemical reactions, such as mineral dissolution and precipitation [1], [2]. Therefore, in order to predict the long-term evolution of the hydraulic property, a numerical model that can account for the coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical (THMC) processes is required. |In this study, a coupled THMC numerical model that includes the important process of the pressure dissolution, as well as the free-face dissolution and precipitation, is presented [3]. Then, the long-term evolution of the permeability in porous rock was predicted under the expected stress and temperature conditions where high-level radioactive wastes are disposed. In particular, the influence of the pressure dissolution on the change in the rock permeability was examined intensively.|",,4

Discrete element methods and the new continuum constitutive model (Comba model) are two approaches for numerical simulation of columnar basalt. The mixed continuum/discontinuum methodology, which takes advantage of each modeling scheme while simultaneously minimizing the requirement for computational resources, has been applied successfully to model large-scale underground excavations. Based on the mixed continuum/discrete numerical model using 3DEC, the predicted excavation response of the large chamber at the Baihetan hydropower plant has been found to be in good agreement with field observation and monitoring results. |Introduction |Baihetan Hydropower Plant Project |The Baihetan dam and hydropower plant project (see Fig. 1) includes the design and construction of a 289-m high, double curvature concrete dam, and of two underground powerhouses with a capacity of 16,000 MW in total.

The mine excavation and deep mineral production will change the stability of initial rock mass structure and the in-situ stress field. The rock fractures are fully developed and even result in a completely broken state of rock. To study the volume effect on the water-sand seepage characteristics in broken rocks, the seepage experiments were performed by a new seepage system of water-sand mixture, which was designed based on the CMT5305 electronic universal testing machine. The results showed that when the initial porosity of broken rock kept constant, the sand filterability of broken rock increased with the thickness of rock sample; the influence of the thickness of rock sample on the quantity of filtering sand increased with the initial porosity of broken rock; the filterability of broken rock increased to a constant value with the rock sample thickness; the influence of rock sample thickness on the water seepage was not obvious, and the initial porosity had a greater effect on the water-sandstone seepage characteristics than the rock sample thickness. |Introduction |With the development of deep coal mining, more complicated mechanics problems appeared. The original structure and stress state of rock mass are changed by the process of mine excavation and deep mine mineral production [1]. It causes the rock mass fully fractured and even completely broken. The study on surrounding rock stability, disaster prevention and other scientific problems are more difficult [2]. The scholars of civil, oil, mining and other industries pay attention to the rock seepage characteristics and a series of studies on the seepage characteristics of fractured rock and fluid-solid coupling have been reported [3]. |The water isolating properties of fragment rock mass depend on the seepage stability of water and sediment. Compared to the intact rock, fractured rock has the characteristics of higher porosity and permeability, and easily causes rock engineering disasters. In coal mining engineering, water inrush and flooding accidents usually occurred in water cut zones [3-5]. For example, during the water inrush disaster of Zhao Zhuang coal mine in June 2, 1984, the maximum water inrush amount is 2053m3/min [6]. The seepage characteristic of fractured rock is an important factor for the safety of coal mining. Scholars investigated the seepage characteristics from the aspects of particle diameter, porosity and stress distribution [7, 8].

We propose a methodology to assess fracturing performance and risks based on geomechanical conditions. High-level indicators include completion integrity, horsepower efficiency, reservoir exposure, fracture containment, and connectivity aspects, which are each broken down into a tree-like structure of contributing sub-factors, to the point where they can be related to geomechanics-based drivers. These drivers are derived from 3D geomechanical models and used to identify in 3D space where the conditions appear to be more or less favorable from a fracturing standpoint. The results can be used to identify where chances of success are higher. Applications range from pilot well location in a newly explored area to well positioning and landing during development, to completion design (when model resolution permits). Identified risks, if any, also inform completion design to mitigate these risks. A field case example is used for illustration purposes. |Introduction |Hydraulic fracturing treatments are not all equally successful. Whether measured by treatment data (e.g., amount of proppant placed) or by production data, fracturing often exhibits variable performance across stages along a well, or between wells within a field. For example, certain formations may prove difficult, if not impossible to breakdown; high screen-out rates may occur; and certain stages may dominate production, while others contribute very little (Miller et al., 2011). The above holds true across stages designed and executed similarly, if not identically, which clearly indicates that the subsurface has a primary control on the outcome. |Subsurface controls are generally split between Reservoir quality, or RQ, and Completion Quality, or CQ (Cipolla et al., 2011). RQ refers to the resource itself and is assessed based on indicators such as reserves and producible reserves. CQ refers to the effectiveness of reservoir stimulation by hydraulic fracturing. Importantly, the former is a given whereas CQ can, to a certain extent, be engineered. Therefore, RQ is pre-requisite to CQ. |Hydraulic fracturing treatments across zones with similar RQ often exhibit widely different production performance. Such is the case in relatively thick shale plays (many hundreds of feet), where, by experience, the wellbore landing targets have been narrowed down to 10-20 ft. Some of this variability is caused by heterogeneity in CQ. It is reasonable to assume that geomechanical conditions, including rock fabric and stresses, are key ingredients of CQ. Geomechanical conditions broadly affect the hydraulic fracturing process. In particular, they exert a primary control on fracture geometry (Economides & Nolte, 2000): the orientation of the minimum stress direction strongly influences the direction of fracture propagation, variations in stress and mechanical properties between layers control fracture height growth and fracture width and even the possible development of pinchpoints, all of which strongly influence the final hydraulic fracture geometry, the placement of the proppant, and how the newly created reservoir contact surface connects to the wellbore and delivers production performance.|",,28

R., University of Vigo| Arzua, J., University of Vigo| Escolano, F., Universidad Politecnica de Madrid","|Abstract: |Rockfalls are a relevant hazard in quarrying and open-pit mining as well as in roads with rock cuts. The Spanish Association of Aggregate Producers reported that the most common cause of fatalities in their quarries comes from rockfalls. With the aim of having available methods to quantify this phenomenon in mining, the existing rockfall hazard rating systems for roads such as the RHRS and the RHRON were reviewed to conclude that these methods could not be applied to the working conditions of an open pit mine or a quarry. This lead to develop a new technique able to assess rockfall in quarries and open pit mines, named ROFRAQ based on empirical observations and a probabilistic approach that assumes that an accident occurs as a result of a sequence of events. Different events are rated, and the product of these ratings represents an estimate of the probability of accidents due to rockfalls. In this paper will be presented two particular case studies to quantify the risk of rockfall in mining operations with this new developed method, to find out that a low risk exists, and that simple protective measures can contribute to a safer environment. |Introduction |Rockfalls are a relevant hazard in quarrying and open-pit mining, as well as in road with rock cuts, particularly in mountain areas with unprotected steep slopes. Records from the Spanish Association of Aggregate Producers reported that the most common cause of fatalities in their quarries come from rockfalls, as it is also reported in other parts of the world, especially in Australia. |Recent research studies in the field of rockfall engineering tend to focus on particular detailed modelling issues (Frayssines & Hantz, 2009; Chen et al., 2013, Thoeni et al., 2014), identification of potentially unstable blocks (Mavrouli et al., 2014) as well as calibration of parameters (Wyllie, 2014). However, not so many research studies focus in the application of rockfall control and protective measures in quarries and mining fields (Giacomini et al., 2013; Chai et al., 2015), where a large rate of accidents is recorded every year. |It is highlighted that in an active construction environment, such as quarries or open pit mines, the potential for mechanical initiation of a rockfall will probably be one or two orders of magnitude higher (Hoek, 2000), than in those natural slopes where climatic and biological initiating events take place (Alejano et al., 2013).|",,24

The Limit equilibrium method was adopted for the analysis and evaluation of Yangnangou tunnel portal slopes of Shiyan-Baihe Road in Hubei province, the comprehensive protection of overall strengthening and local reinforced was proposed and simulation analysis of slope treatment project was carried out by using Finite Element Method (FEM). The study shows that the original slope is stable under normal and abnormal working conditions, and the slope stability of the lower level of the tunnel is slightly worse, safe reserve is not high. After the excavation, the stability of tunnel portal slope is in unstable state under normal and abnormal working conditions. Sliding may occur in the adverse effects such as long-term rainfall, construction blasting and so on. The overall reinforcement measures of piles can ensure the overall slope stability, and can effectively control the slope deformation and reduce the influence of slope deformation on the bridge pier. The retaining wall can effectively control the local stability of the portal face. Finally, a comprehensive slope treatment project with overall and local reinforcement is found reasonable and effective to ensuring the long-term stability of Tunnel portal slope during and after construction process that will serve as a reference to other engineering project. |Introduction |With the development of social economy, the investment in infrastructural construction has increased; the construction of roads and railways in the mountains area is influenced by the excavation, which form a large number of slopes with large scale project and complex influencing factors, changeable geological environment(Huang, 2012). The deformation and destruction of slope not only increases the investment, but also increases time needed for construction, which is directly related to the success and safety of engineering construction(Yan, 2002). Therefore, slope stability is the key safe to construction and normal operation. |The study on slope stability has been a hot topic greatly concerned by engineers(Tang, 2008).

J., IFP Energies nouvelles","|Abstract: |No continuous stress field measures can be made inside the Earth's crust, so we developed a technique to estimate the possible stress field from surface stress data. Stress initialization is the aim of this work. The method presented here couples an inversion technique with a finite element model fed with local data coming from data such as in situ measurements of the stress tensor (leak-off tests, log data…). This method guarantees the stability of the initial stress field with the regional stresses thanks to modeling with a finite element (FE) software. The inversion technique consists in minimizing the difference between the FE model and the measured in situ stress by adjusting the elastic parameters of each geological unit of our model at each iteration of optimization. For this minimization problem we use a regular method which has been successfully tested on synthetic 2D models, and we developed the adjoint-state method by formulating the gradient of the error functional towards its parameters in a constraint optimization form, which is still being tested. The result of the minimization problem is a possible initial stress field which satisfies the in situ measurements. |Introduction |For monitoring the exploitation of sites, and more specifically for monitoring stress changes due to production, oil companies need to finely estimate the geomechanical properties and the behavior of underground formations for all their activities. To reach this goal, it is necessary to model the exploited site. Geomechanical models, as sophisticated as they might be in terms of behavior law, are useless if the stress field is not well initialized. Stress initialization is the aim of this work. |Clearly no entire stress field measurements can be made inside the Earth's crust, so we developed a technique to estimate an admissible stress field from surface stress data deduced from leak-off tests, log data etc. This technique consists in an inverse problem allowing to match a model to discrete stress measurements. |The inverse problem is a mathematical tool which allows to get indirectly scientific measurements(Ganse, 2007). A classical technique of inverse problem is determining model parameters from observed data (Tarantola, 1987).

Generally, a panel caving mine is designed for a dilution entry point (DEP) to occur at 70-90% of the recovery, but if the waste is finer than the newly caved ore, a preferential influx of waste can enter earlier into the drawpoints, resulting in a low DEP. Another source of dilution can be expected when the draw rate exceeds the caving rate, allowing waste to rill along the solid boundary of the cave and enter into the drawpoint at an early stage. |Freeport-McMoRan Inc.'s Henderson Mine, located in Colorado, is a large underground panel caving mine that uses a mixing method that assumes that dilution can only flow vertically (Laubscher, 1994). In order to study other mechanisms of dilution such as fines migration and rilling, this paper presents a case study in which drawpoints located in different locations are back-analyzed using REBOP. |The results show that REBOP, by imposing a certain cave shape, is able to model and predict rilling. Although, back-analyzed drawpoints behaved differently depending on the location with respect to the cave front and their neighbours, no apparent relationship between the best-fit cave angle and the position of the drawpoint was found. This suggests that the evolution in cave shape and angle (and hence entry of waste via rilling) could be complex and hard to know ahead of time without three-dimensional predictions (e.g., via cave-scale modeling) that consider local rock mass strength and major structures. |Introduction |One of the challenges in Panel Caving is the amount of dilution that might be expected from waste material located above economic ore or from exhausted levels located above current production levels.

Moreover, another mechanism of dilution can be expected when the draw rate exceeds the caving rate, allowing waste to rill along the solid boundary of the cave and enter the drawpoint at an early stage. |The case study described is taken from Freeport-McMoRan's Henderson Mine, an underground molybdenum mine that utilizes the panel caving method of extraction.

B., Colorado School of Mines| Wang, F., Colorado School of Mines","|Abstract: |As mine open pits become increasingly aggressive and deep (beyond 400 m) due to exhaustion of near-surface resources or implausibility of underground excavation, significant challenges emerge using standard slope stability analysis techniques. Typically during overall failure analysis, factor of safety calculations are conducted. Although quite useful and despite recent advances in characterizing insitu stresses, the factor of safety approach has its inadequacies. For example, single factor of safety values cannot characterize an entire pit sector under varying geotechnical and environmental conditions. In this paper we draw on lessons learned from large dataset techniques in engineering geology to assess landslides. The proposed approach utilizes the emerging field of deep learning using artificial neural networks. Deep learning uses data-driven tools to continually update algorithms used to conduct computations resulting in high levels of accuracy and precision. Using our results and relevant examples from the literature, we discuss the benefits and shortcoming of the proposed approach, the appropriate conditions and types of environments for application and suggested modifications and improvements. |Introduction and Background |Rock mass slope stability analysis is one of the most important undertakings during the design of surface mine open pit slopes. Typically select cross section profiles from a three dimensional geological model are created and assigned material and geotechnical properties for analytical calculations of factors of safety. In two dimensional limit equilibrium analysis using one of the methods of slices, the factor of safety is expressed as a ratio of the sum of the resistive forces to that of the destabilizing forces. A factor of safety less than 1.0 is indicative of unstable conditions, while a value greater than 1.0 represents stable conditions. For surface mine slopes, both interramp and overall slope stability analyses are undertaken under both static and pseudostatic conditions. The interramp angles are defined by bench face angles, bench heights and bench widths (Figure 1). The overall slope angle is defined by interramp sections separated by wide step-outs for haulage roads or mine infrastructure. In general, except for slopes of high failure consequence, a design factor of safety of 1.2 is adopted (Read and Stacey, 2009). Slopes of high failure consequence are those slopes that are critical to mine operations, such as hosting major haul roads, those providing ingress or egress points to the pit, or those underlying essential infrastructure. Those slopes identified as having high failure consequences tend to have relatively higher factors of safety up to 1.5 (Read and Stacey, 2009). In addition, certain adverse geologic environments do not favor high interramp angles due to rock fall and bench overbreak, and hence design angles tend to be flattened to provide wide catch benches. The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), Title 30 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Section 56.3130 requirements for open pit slopes demand that adequate benches must be in place to retain rockfall above work or travel areas.|",,13
436,437,2016-215,Directional Equivalent Permeability of Discrete Fracture Networks,"Hoeink, T., Baker Hughes| Stoddard, T., Baker Hughes| Ben, Y., Baker Hughes","|Abstract: |Naturally fractured low-matrix-permeability reservoirs exist in most hydrocarbon-producing areas of the world. In such reservoirs, the dominant fluid pathways are provided by networks of hydraulically conductive natural fractures. In order to predict hydrocarbon production, an accurate estimate of the effective permeability arising from these networks is essential. Because reservoir simulators typically use continuum approximations of permeability, and are discretized using volume elements that are much larger than the scale of the fractures, obtaining these estimates requires fast, accurate upscaling methods to convert discrete fracture connectivity and permeability to effective flow properties. Furthermore, fractures in the subsurface often exhibit a small number of prevalent orientations, which are the cause of frequently observed high degrees of permeability anisotropy. Because this anisotropy has a significant influence on reservoir simulation results, it is important to accurately compute directional fracture network permeability, which enables identification of the principal permeability directions. This paper presents a novel and efficient numerical upscaling method for the directional equivalent permeability of a discrete fracture network. In this method, the network is converted into a set of connected fracture segments. Using a modified equivalent pipe approach and appropriate boundary conditions, the directional permeability is computed for steady-state parallel-plate flow. The numerical method is compared to a published method that provides equivalent permeability estimates of discrete fracture networks. A consistent finding is that the computed equivalent fracture permeability is a consequence of the conceptual design of each method. This highlights the importance of comparing various methods for computing the equivalent fracture permeability in order to get a better understanding of how a particular discrete fracture network might contribute to reservoir simulation results. In a more general sense, it also underlines the importance of understanding, and retaining for analysis, any assumptions made in modeling efforts. Further, the equivalent permeability computed from each method is incorporated into reservoir simulations. Differences in simulation results are found to be direct consequences of the specific permeability maps computed with different methods. Because each method of computing equivalent fracture permeability elevates different aspects of a discrete fracture network, a comparison of results obtained with different methods allows one to quantify, and possibly to reduce, uncertainty in reservoir simulations. |Introduction |Rock masses are heterogeneous on many length scales. Besides variations in material properties across a continuous piece of rock, rock masses exhibit discrete features such as veins, dikes, joints and faults. Some of these have the potential to conduct fluid; here, we will use the term fracture for any such discrete feature.

The gas mix is applied at known pressure to the upstream side of the samples to induce flow through the pore spaces and/or across fracture surfaces and the gases are detected in real-time on the downstream side using a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS). |Downstream detection under vacuum is possible by precise metering of the gas mixture through a leak valve with active feedback control. Arrival times and time-variant concentrations of the applied gases downstream are collected for comparison between samples. We intend to determine transport properties of noble gases and SF6, and hypothesize that transport properties vary due to solubility and water content. The parameters derived from this work will provide valuable insight into the three-dimensional structure of damage zones, including fracture networks, the production of temporally variable signatures, and the methods to best detect underground nuclear explosion signatures. |Introduction |The detection, location, and identification of suspected nuclear explosions are United States security priorities. Currently, global nuclear explosion monitoring relies on networks of sensors to provide rapid detection, location, and discrimination of suspect events. In some cases, such as underground nuclear explosions (UNEs), prompt signals may not provide sufficiently exact locations or explosion details and the timing and amplitude of non-prompt signals may be difficult to predict algorithmically. Therefore, there is a need to conduct research into improving the post-facto identification of suspect events with emphasis on non-prompt signals. Non-prompt signal analysis can lead to an improved understanding of the detected source to aid in data-informed discrimination (e.g., explosion vs. earthquake or nuclear explosion vs. reactor). |The Underground Nuclear Explosion Signatures Experiment (UNESE) is a nonproliferation effort created to address science and research and development aspects associated with nuclear explosion verification and source analysis based on non-prompt signals. Scientific knowledge and capabilities developed via UNESE will enhance U.S. capabilities in detecting, locating, and identifying UNEs, with particular focus on non-prompt signals. UNESE R&D results will be applicable in current and future verification and nonproliferation contexts, and as a detection-based deterrent factor for potential proliferant nations or in transparency efforts.|",,21
438,439,2016-217,Density of Induced Earthquake Hypocenters as a Proxy for Pore Pressure Increase during Well Stimulation,"Dempsey, D., University of Auckland| Barton, C., Baker Hughes Inc.| Catalinac, A., University of Auckland","|Abstract: |In 2003, the Habanero#1 (H1) well in South Australia was stimulated by injection of 20,000 m3 of water into crystalline rock at a depth of 4250 m. Approximately 11,000 induced seismic events were located during the high-pressure stimulation. Two lines of evidence are presented that the density of accumulated earthquake hypocenters is directly proportional to total fluid pressure increase at a location. (1) Within 100 m of the borehole, hypocenter density increases linearly with the injection pressure. (2) At the conclusion of the stimulation, hypocenter density exhibits a two-zone characteristic shape with distance from the injection well: (i) an inner, fully stimulated region, 220 to 320 m wide, in which hypocenter density, and thus inferred pressure rise, is approximately constant, and (ii) an outer, partially stimulated region, in which density declines with the logarithm of distance, in accordance with pressure decline in a 2D infinite reservoir. We build a simple reservoir model of the H1 stimulation that incorporates injection records and two zones of differing permeability. The inferred pressure rise (from the hypocenter density) is used to calibrate the model. We find that unstimulated permeability is approximately 2.5x10-16 m2, and suggest a rough lower bound for stimulated permeability of 1.8x10-15 m2 (an increase by at least a factor of 7). There are two notable caveats in the use of hypocenter density as a proxy for pressure rise: (1) we provide evidence supporting the proxy under conditions where repeated fracture reshearing is likely – i.e., fault strength drop is large compared to earthquake stress drop – whereas it is not clear if the relationship holds under general conditions; (2) the proxy is only sensitive to the largest fluid pressure achieved at a location and will not capture any modulation of the pressure – this is a manifestation of the Kaiser effect. |Introduction |Induced seismicity is caused by fluid injection and a resulting increase in subsurface pore pressure. This reduces the effective normal stress (Hubbert and Rubey, 1959) across existing faults and fractures, lowering their resistance to frictional sliding and triggering earthquakes. Controlled experiments, such as at the KTB deep drill hole (Zoback and Harjes, 1997), Rangely Oil Field (CO) (Raleigh et al., 1976), or Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS) stimulations (Baisch et al., 2006; Dempsey et al., 2015), are an excellent opportunity to learn more about the earthquake triggering process. |Earthquake triggering can be approximately described by the Mohr-Coulomb criterion. Assuming a fracture is at initial shear stress, <U+03C4>, less than the static shear strength, <U+03C4>s, then the critical pressure rise, <U+0394>Pcrit, triggering failure is |(equation) |where fs is the static friction coefficient.|",,58

Dahi, Louisiana State University| Ahmadi, M., Louisiana State University","|Abstract: |The cement sheath around the oil wellbore casing is a potential site for the formation of annular cracks along the casing-cement and/or cement-rock interfaces. The lack of cement integrity may endanger environment, which makes important the prediction and assessment of damages at the cement interface with rock and casing. We use the theory of eigenstrains to analyze the effect of the presence of n partial interfacial cracks on the mechanical response of the casing-cement-rock system. Partial annular cracks are considered to experience leaking fluid pressure p, and rock formation is considered to be under the effect of in situ tectonic stresses. The theory of eigenstrains enables us to consider partial cracks as inclusions and cement sheath as an inhomogeneity embedded within the rock matrix. Moreover, using this methodology we can study the interacting effect of partial cracks with different central angles randomly distributed along the casing-cement and/or cement-rock interfaces. In contrast to the previous studies which are mostly restricted to one or two symmetric interfacial arc cracks in bi-material systems (a circular inclusion embedded in a matrix), the present study considers n randomly distributed partial cracks around the interfaces of an inclusion-inhomogeneity-matrix system. |Introduction |Following the exploration of new unconventional natural gas resources in the US, there has been a growing attention toward fracturing these formations as a proved methodology to augment gas production. Fracture treatments in the new discovered formations were always challenging as classic cap rocks become the target of stimulation treatments, which may endanger aquifers in case of severe height growth. Additionally, drastic changes of pressure during these treatment may damage the cement integrity and cause inevitable issues. The new advances in stimulation technology requires more sophisticated methods to model fractures behavior at the interfaces. One of the interesting problems in the mathematical theory of fracture mechanics is a partially debonded interfaces within a matrix, which may result in the formation of curved cracks due to the geometry of the interface. A practical case for the formation of these interfacial arc cracks is a cemented wellbore where debonding may happen on the casing-cement or cement-rock interfaces. Evans and Carter, 1962 and Carter and Evans, 1964 related the formation of these interfacial cracks to leakage problem around wellbores. This interfacial debonding can also occur due to pressure or temperature changes during well operations as well as cement shrinkage, Lecampion et al., 2013. The focus of the present work is the study of the induced elastic displacement filed due to the partial curved cracks under uniform internal pressure formed on the interfaces of casing-cement-rock formation systems including the effect of in situ tectonic stresses.|",,28

A., CSIRO","|Abstract: |Estimating the height of longwall mining induced strata fracturing and the height of complete groundwater drainage is a contentious issue and there seems to be some misconception and misunderstanding among the practicing engineers and groundwater modelers. With the introduction of the longwall top coal caving (LTCC) in a number of mines in Australia in recent times, this knowledge gap has significantly widened, creating extra demand for rigorous study and the development of more sophisticated and reliable assessment tools. The extent of mining induced subsurface deformation, fracturing, surface subsidence, and aquifer interference is largely controlled by local lithological conditions, mining methods and mine layouts. Thus it is imperative to develop methods/tools that, unlike empirically based strata desaturation height estimation methods, can properly consider all factors and accurately predict strata deformation and subsequent fracturing (particularly connective fracturing) in varied hydrogeologic environment to assess the impact of mining on groundwater. |The demand for more sophisticated and detailed mining impact assessment tools is ever increasing. This paper will describe the use of mine site monitoring data and a coupled Distinct Element / Finite Element (DEM/FEM) model to assess strata fracturing during longwall extractions. The approach of coupling FEM and DEM methods significantly extends the capability of DEM codes, allowing large scale simulations of practical problems such as longwall mining. |Introduction |Predicting the height of connective fracturing and complete water drainage above mined longwall panels is not well understood and still remains a strongly contested topic among the practicing hydrogeologists, mining engineers and groundwater modelling professionals.

Q., University of Lille| Shao, J.F., University of Lille| Pourpak, H., TOTAL| Su, K., TOTAL","|Abstract: |This paper is devoted to micromechanical modeling of time dependent behavior of claystones by means of a two-steps homogenization procedure. Two material scales are considered; at the mesoscopic scale, the material is described as a clay matrix reinforced by linear elastic inclusions. At the microscopic scale, the clay matrix is supposed as a porous medium composed of a solid phase which is described by the classical Drucker-Prager criterion and spherical pores. The macroscopic plastic criterion is determined by the modified secant method (Shen et al., 2013); it takes into account simultaneously the effect of pores and mineral inclusions. This criterion is then used as the yield function for the description of the viscoplastic deformation inside the clay matrix. The micro-macro model is proposed to study the elastoviscoplastic behavior of Callovo-Oxfordian argillites. Both the instantaneous and delayed behavior are considered within the unique model. Comparisons between numerical simulations and experimental data show that the proposed model is able to reproduce the main features of the mechanical behavior of this material. |Introduction |The study of short and long-term behavior of claystones is of significant interest in many engineering applications such as the geological disposal of radioactive waste, the exploitation of shale gas and acid gas sequestration. In the context of the storage of radioactive waste, the purpose to study the time-dependent behavior is to understand and ultimately be able to model what happens in time around the coating of a gallery under the effect of creep of rock. Usually, the time-dependent inelastic behavior of materials is described by the viscoplastic theory (Simo and Hughes, 1998) where the time-dependent deformation is attributed to the inherent viscous effect of material. This approach provide a mathematical description of the time-dependent behavior. For geomaterials, the overstress concept of (Perzyna, 1963) is used, in most viscoplastic models, for the definition of viscoplastic deformation such in (Huang et al., 2014). Recently, based on extensive laboratory investigations, the time-dependent deformation is associated to the progressive evolution of microstructure i.e., the time-dependent deformation is considered as the macroscopic consequence of progressive degradation of material in microscopic scale (Shao et al., 2003) and (Pietruszczak et al., 2004). For example, the physical mechanisms of this phenomena can be: subcritical propagation of microcracks in hard rocks, pore collapse in chalk rocks (Xie, 2005) or dissolution process due to chemical-mechanical coupling (Lydzba et al, 2007). In our study, the time-dependent deformation is attributed to viscous effect inside the clay matrix based on the fundamental theory of viscoplasticity (Perzyna, 1963).|",,60

Most of the studies in the literature are concerned with characterizing the process zone at the peak load. In this study, numerical three point bending tests are conducted and the failure load (peak load) is obtained. The fracture process zone is investigated at both the peak load and in the post peak regime (rock deformation following the peak load). A bonded particle discrete element system is used for three-point bending simulation of rock beams which have a notch at their mid-span. Different beam sizes are considered. The rock brittleness is allowed to vary by implementing a contact bond between the discrete particles that provides linear softening. To capture the beam post-peak behavior, a servo-controlled loading system is developed which is based on the relationship between the loading point displacement and the notch opening. It is shown that the class II rock behavior can be captured by this servo-controlled system. Furthermore, the effect of the servo-controlled parameters on the structure response and the impact of crack extension on the size and shape of process zone are investigated. |Introduction |Fracture process zone (FPZ) is a region around a crack tip in quasi-brittle materials that is made of several damaged points and micro-cracks. This nonlinear region causes deviation of the material behavior from that expected from the theory of linear elastic fracture mechanics. Several research efforts have been conducted about the fracture process zone. Otsuka and Date [1] used Acoustic Emission (AE) and X-ray techniques to show that size of the fracture process zone is affected by the specimen size. Four-point bending tests were conducted on Charcoal granite and Berea sandstone samples with different sizes by Labuz and Biolzi [2]. The 3D AE technique was employed to detect the locations of the micro-cracks in order to characterize the fracture process zone in these rocks. Li and Marasteanu [3] performed some three point semi-circular bending tests using an acoustic emission system to study the effect of aggregate size on the fracture process zone of asphalt mixture at low temperature. They concluded that the size of the fracture process zone depends on many parameters such as aggregate particles, preexisting cracks and presence of voids in the material. |Most of the researches reported in the literature have focused on the fracture process zone that is developed at the peak load. The main reason for less attention to the FPZ in the post-peak regime is perhaps the difficulty of controlling the stability of testing especially when class II (snap back) rock behavior is involved [4]. Class II behavior of a rock specimen requires an intricate loading scheme to avoid violent fracturing even when a stiff loading machine is used. Thus, a servo-controlled loading machine is needed. Okubo et al. [5] adopted a servo-machine in both uniaxial and triaxial tests in order to gather the Class II rock behavior. In their experimental work, instead of the lateral strain commonly used in experimental rock mechanics [6], a linear relationship between stress and strain was chosen as the feedback signal for the closed loop loading system. In another contribution, Okubo and Nishimatsu [7] suggested that the linear relationship between stress and strain chosen as the feedback signal can be applied in numerical simulation of rock post-peak behavior as well. Shimizu et al. [8] applied a numerical servo-controlled method in order to obtain the class II rock behavior of a brittle rock in their discrete element numerical simulation. In their approach, the lateral strain was adopted to control the applied axial loading rate.|",,5

The weakening effect of the substituting fluid can therefore be easily identified. Our results for the weakly-consolidated Sherwood sandstone show that (i) the strength and static elastic moduli decrease when water saturates the pore space; (ii) the injection of water in a critically loaded sample initially saturated either with air or inert oil induces a drastic increase in the creep rate and the development of a mechanical instability; (iii) the mechanical instability detected by ultrasonic and micro- seismic monitoring is mainly localized in the water-flooded zone; (iv) this instability corresponds to a loss of cohesion; (v) during oil substitution by water, the instability is delayed and the loss of cohesion is less pronounced. This loss of cohesion is expected to lead to sand production in weakly consolidated siliciclastic reservoirs. In addition, the injected fluids significantly affect the ultrasonic P-wave velocity which (vi) increases during oil injection and (vii) decreases during water injection. Therefore ultrasonic monitoring can be used to detect the advancement of the fluid front within the rock pore space. |Introduction |To assess water-weakening effects in reservoir rocks, previous experimental studies have focused on changes in the failure envelopes derived from mechanical tests conducted on rocks fully saturated either with water or with inert fluids. So far, little attention has been paid to the mechanical behavior of reservoir rocks during fluid substitution under conditions similar to enhanced oil recovery operations. Water-based fluids are often used during development and production operations of oil and gas fields. These operations include: (i) well drilling with water-based muds; (ii) reservoir secondary oil recovery by water flooding; (iii) chemical or thermal enhanced oil recovery; or (iv) hydraulic fracturing. |Mechanisms generally associated with fluid/rock interactions include: (i) hydro-mechanics: pressure drawdown/effective stress increase; (ii) petrophysics: change in surface tension/wettability and capillary forces; (iii) hydro-dynamics: seepage forces resulting from water pressure gradients. These mechanisms have been, and still are, extensively studied and assessed for problematic fields around the world. However, hydrochemical weakening of the rock frame specifically associated with exposure to water-based fluids has also been recognized as an important driving mechanism.|",,60

B., Shell International Exploration and Production, Inc.| Soroush, H., Dong Energy| Madyarov, A., Shell Exploration & Production Company","|Abstract: |A key technical challenge in successful hydraulic fracturing (HF) of gas and oil-rich shales is to understand fracture growth through layered systems from a horizontal wellbore. This understanding enables an improved HF design and selection of the horizontal wellbore landing depth. In the absence of the clear stress barriers for fracture height growth it is important to account for fracture toughness variations. Since fracture toughness is relatively difficult to measure routinely we attempt to establish good correlations between it and other more readily measurable physical and mechanical rock properties. This paper presents the measurements of fracture toughness for a liquid-rich shale done using the Cracked Chevron Notch Brazilian Disk (CCNBD) geometry following the International Society for Rock Mechanics Suggested Method. The data do not confirm strong correlations for fracture toughness previously reported in the literature. Only weak correlations with sample bulk density, compressional and shear velocities were observed. The contrast of measured toughness values are used to define the upscaled toughness profile. Its impact on the fracture geometry is demonstrated through numerical simulations for slick water and cross-linked gel stimulations. |Introduction |Efficient hydraulic fracturing (HF) is one of the most important technologies to the current unconventional gas/liquid rich shale plays in the oil and gas industry (see, e.g., King, 2010). A key technical challenge in successful HF treatments is to understand HF growth through layered systems from a horizontal wellbore. |A conventional target for stimulation with HF would be a sandstone reservoir bounded by the non-reservoir units, typically shales. In such cases a clear lithological characterization aids to reduce uncertainty about the fracture height growth, which is mostly controlled by the stress contrast between sand and shale layers (e.g., Smith and Shlyapobersky, 2000). Important distinctive attributes of unconventional plays are an uncertainty about the vertical extent of the target zone, the significant height of the induced hydraulic fractures as interpreted from the microseismic data, and uncertainty about the control parameters in a thick package of geological layers with subtly varying lithology.|",,35

D., Stanford University","|Abstract: |We present a finite element method for the one-way coupled poromechanical modeling of injection-induced shear re-activation in a porous medium embedded with a highly conductive pre-existing discrete fracture network (DFN). The fluid problem is formulated over an integrated matrix-fracture domain by permitting two sets of flow constitutive laws and by admitting discontinuities in normal fluid fluxes across fractures to account for matrix-fracture mass exchanges. Based on a transversal uniformity assumption, a novel hybrid-dimensional approach is proposed where factures need not be explicitly meshed along normal directions, but are modeled as linear line elements tangentially conforming to the edges of linear triangular elements representing the porous matrix. Fracture nodes holds no additional degrees of freedom. A dimensional transformation matrix is introduced during finite element interpolation, leading to three additional equi-dimensional modification terms to the mass and stiffness matrices to account for contribution of fractures to flow. The gradient of the modeled fluid pressure is then passed as an equivalent body force vector to the solid problem to solve for induced poroelastic stresses by assuming a single solid constitutive law for the medium. Finally, Coulomb stresses on fractures are calculated for determining onset of shear re-activation. |Introduction |Fluid injection into naturally fractured geological media can induce seismicity over a wide range of scales. An understanding of the physical processes of induced seismic and micro-seismic events helps to better assess potential seismic hazards associated with, e.g., CO2 sequestration and wastewater injection, as well as to assist stimulation of hydrocarbon and geothermal reservoirs with ultra-low permeability. The triggering mechanism of fluid injection induced shear re-activation on pre-existing fractures is fundamentally a coupled hydro-mechanical process. The presence of a discrete fracture network (DFN) imposes significant challenges on numerical modeling of this coupled process, due to not only the geometric complexity, but also two sets of material properties and constitutive laws for both the fluid and the solid, as well as discontinuous changes in modeling targets.|",,42

We hypothesize that at a given grain contact, the surface area of contact dictates which mechanism dominates the rate of chemical process. Based on thermodynamic equations of dissolution, diffusion and precipitation, we establish a formula for the critical contact area that marks the transition between diffusion-dominated kinetics and dissolution-precipitation-dominated kinetics. We relate the change of contact area to the change of solid volume in the Representative Elementary Volume, and we define net damage as the sum of the mechanical damage and the chemical porosity change. A continuum-based damage mechanics framework is used to deduce the change of salt stiffness with net damage. A stress path comprising a tensile loading, a compressive unloading, a creep–chemical stage and a reloading is simulated. Stiffness degradation and residual strain development are observed with the evolution of damage under tensile loading. Unilateral effects of crack closure can be predicted by the model upon compression. Our micro-macro model also allows predicting the evolution of the probability distribution of contact areas upon chemical effects, as well as the consequent change of net damage and stiffness. The proposed modeling framework is expected to shed light on coupled chemical processes that govern microstructure changes and subsequent variations of deformation rate, stiffness and permeability in salt rock, and to allow the assessment of long-term behavior of geological storage facilities in salt. |Introduction |Salt rocks, a common geo-material with low gas permeability and favorable creep properties leading to potential fracture healing, are usually regarded as a favorable host for compressed air energy storage (CAES), radioactive waste repository, and gas storage. |During creep, crystal gliding mechanisms and grain sliding induce geometric incompatibilities, which build up stresses and intra-granular crack propagation. As grains rearrange, stresses at grain contacts can trigger dissolution, salt ion transport through fluid films, and re-precipitation at low-stress grain boundaries. This phenomenon, known as pressure-solution, can occur in the same conditions of pressure and temperature as grain boundary diffusion.|",,24

P., University of Toronto| Lei, Q., Imperial College London| Latham, J.-P., Imperial College London","|Abstract: |We have quantitatively analysed the influence of boundary constraint stiffness on stress heterogeneity modelling in fractured rock mass using the two dimensional (2D) combined finite-discrete element method (FEMDEM). We generalise the boundary constraints found in the literature to a four-plate boundary with variable stiffness. For a 1.5 <U+00D7> 1.5 m rock mass model subjected to boundary loading, the stress tensors induced in the model under various boundary stiffness conditions are extracted and their scatter calculated using Euclidean dispersion – a scalar value akin to standard deviation. The results show an overall decrease in Euclidean dispersion as the boundary stiffness increases. Our findings lead us to suggest that when undertaking stress heterogeneity analyses, a boundary constraint stiffness equal to the Young's modulus of rock should be used. Although this is only a preliminary investigation of stress heterogeneity simulation, it nevertheless suggests the importance of boundary constraints when conducting such numerical modelling in rock mechanics. |Introduction |In situ stress is an important parameter for a wide range of endeavours in rock mechanics, including rock engineering design, hydraulic fracturing analysis, rock mass permeability and earthquake potential evaluation (Amadei and Stephansson, 1997; Latham et al., 2013; Matsumoto et al., 2015; Zang and Stephansson, 2010; Zoback, 2010). Because of the inherent complexity of fractured rock masses in terms of varying rock properties and the presence of discontinuities, especially in highly fractured rock masses, stress often displays significant heterogeneity (Martin, 1990; Obara and Sugawara, 2003). The in situ stress measurement results shown in Fig. 1 exemplify the dramatic variation in terms of both principal stress magnitude and orientation that may be observed in a small zone (Obara and Sugawara, 2003). |Studying stress heterogeneity is not only beneficial to understanding the complex nature of fractured rock masses, but also to supporting any rock engineering-related analysis. However, it is often not possible for stress heterogeneity to be thoroughly interpreted due to a lack of sufficient in situ stress data (Harrison et al., 2010). Due to implementation difficulties and budget limits, most rock engineering projects usually do not have the luxury to conduct a large number of in situ stress measurements, with the result that numerical simulation approaches need to be employed to investigate stress heterogeneity (Harrison et al., 2010; Hart, 2003).|",,60
448,449,2016-173,Mechanisms-Based Fracture Model for Geological Materials,"Hoeink, T., Baker Hughes| Zubelewicz, A., Alek & Research Associates","|Abstract: |Over the past decade, hydraulic fracturing has become an industry-changing technology that enables commercial production of hydrocarbons from previously non-productive low-permeability shale formations. R&D efforts focus on the development of economically efficient production protocols, where the selection of engineering solutions is guided by numerical simulations. Typically, the simulations are based on phenomenological fracture models that are adapted for the prediction of fluid-driven fracture processes at depth. These models rely on a long-term trial-and-error approach and offer reliable material response at conditions that have previously been experimentally investigated. For this reason, an extrapolation of such phenomenological models into untested regimes is not always successful. |We break with the tradition of using phenomenology and, instead, construct a mechanisms-based fracture model for geological materials. Our modified Mohr-Coulomb fracture model is developed in the framework of tensor representation theory, which allows for a direct translation of fracture mechanisms and the observed inelastic deformation into a mathematically precise description. In our description, plastic deformation is rate dependent and dilatation is determined over a three-dimensional topography of the slip plane. The contribution of asperity degradation is also included. The model monitors crack orientations and, in this manner, adds to the fracture-induced anisotropy. Fracture strength is stochastic. We also introduce an effective stress that accounts for the hydraulic pressure deposited onto crack surfaces. Friction-induced damage and tensile fractures are the sources of an enhanced hydraulic permeability. Our permeability model is also stochastic, and it describes the formation of flow-channels due to the coalescence of micro-cracks in tension and shear. To illustrate the approach we choose material properties applicable to shale. We test the material model using uniaxial tension, compression and triaxial stress conditions on a single element before advancing to relevant subsurface model geometries. |Our current study focuses on the simulation of fluid-driven fracture near a pressurized wellbore. The results demonstrate that fracture growth is often dynamic; inertial forces play a significant role. Because fracture strength is stochastic, the process often becomes dynamically unstable and produces bursts of kinetic energy that propagate away from localized regions of low fracture strength. As expected, friction-induced damages are responsible for the formation of micro-channels, which in turn are connected to the channels formed by the dominant tensile cracks. The model is implemented to Abaqus as a material user subroutine. We calibrate the properties of a shale-like material and study the material responses under axial loading and selected subsurface conditions.|",,36

We present a laboratory-scale proof of concept study for cyclic hydraulic fracturing in which an injection pressure smaller than the monotonic breakdown pressure under continuous injection is applied in a cyclic manner. A series of hydraulic fracturing tests was performed on Pocheon granite specimen having a diameter of 50 mm and a height of 100 mm containing an inner hole of 8 mm in diameter. The average breakdown pressures of granite through continuous injection tests were calculated considering inherent strength anisotropy among rift, grain and hardway planes. A preliminary investigation shows that the threshold of a number of cycles for effective cyclic fracturing is in the order of tens of cycles with injection pressure larger than 82 % of the monotonic breakdown pressure. The generated fractures were observed by means of X-ray computed tomography (CT). It is found that fractures induced by continuous injection are more like a single fracture, while there were many branch failures for cyclic injection particularly at a large number of cycles. The anecdotal evidences from this study imply that hydraulic fracturing in the field could be conducted with a smaller injection pressure when it is subjected to a reasonable number of cycles. |Introduction |Hydraulic fracturing with minimum impact on the environment, i.e. induced seismicity, is of great interest in hydraulic fracturing for shale gas as well as enhanced geothermal systems (EGS). Some concepts have been presented, like fatigue hydraulic fracturing and multistage stimulation. The key point in fatigue hydraulic fracturing is the frequent lowering of the injection pressure to allow stress relaxation at the fracture tips (Zang et al., 2013). Reducing the maximum injection pressure by cyclic injection will lower the fracture breakdown pressure and, as a consequence, induced seismicity is expected to be smaller. |For multistage stimulation, instead of massive hydraulic stimulation, injection rate and pressure are controlled and stimulated reservoir will be formed stage by stage (Zimmermann et al., 2015; Meier et al., 2015). |The multistage stimulation method has been successfully applied in commercial shale gas development (Johri and Zoback, 2013; Lee and Kim, 2016). On the other hand, the fatigue hydraulic fracturing is still at concept proof stage and its validation in field scale has yet to be achieved in EGS (Zimmermann et al., 2010; Yoon et al., 2015). As the name implies, fatigue hydraulic fracturing is to fracture rocks by cyclic injection to reach a fatigue failure. A general understanding of fatigue failure is that damages accumulate in rocks during cyclic loading, consequently leading to strength decrease. However, the mechanism of rock fatigue failure has not been fully understood yet. Both rock type (mineralogically and texturally) and loading mode influence fatigue behavior of rocks (Erarslan and Williams, 2012a). Note, however, that the fatigue cycling process during mechanical loading (Erarslan and Williams, 2012a) can be very different from the fatigue hydraulic fracturing process because of the involvement of high-pressurized fluid cycles operating at fracture tips (Zang et al., 2013).|",,26
451,452,2016-169,Evaluating the Effect of Earthquakes on Open Pit Mine Slopes,"Azhari, A., Colorado School of Mines| Ozbay, U., Colorado School of Mines","|Abstract: |There have been some earthquake induced failure instances in open pit slopes, none of those were significant to be recorded as causing operational interruptions or injuries. However, there have been a significant number of natural rock slope failures due to earthquakes. This paper addresses this dichotomy through studies of earthquakes and associated geological parameters relating to natural slopes and open pit mines. The earthquake parameters include magnitude, epi-central distance, focal depth and intensity while considered geological characteristics include failure type, water content, rock type and topography. Analyzing these parameters it was concluded that the natural slope failures are triggered by earthquakes with depth and epi-central distance of less than 40 and 150 kilometers respectively, and only nine open pit mines were subjected to such earthquakes. The studies of the earthquake intensity as a function of magnitude, epi-central distance and focal depth show that only ten mines were subjected to shaking intensities of more than 6 in last 25 years, while for natural slopes almost 90 percent are subjected to this range of intensities. Among the geological characteristics, water content, failure type and topographical effect were found to separates open pit mines from natural slopes in responding to earthquakes. Particularly, water content plays a role in 90 percent of the natural slopes while open pit mines are relatively less affected due to being dewatered naturally or mechanically. Most recorded natural slope failures are shallow, which could be not considered as reportable failures in open pit mines. Natural slope failures are commonly triggered on the hill tops and ridges as a result of topographical amplification phenomenon while the absence of this effect due to one face or valley shape pit slopes leads to increase in pit slope stability. |Introduction |The stability of natural and man-made rock slopes during earthquakes is always a great concern for rock mechanic engineers. Natural slopes are usually stable when they are not disturbed by an external force. However, there are a significant number of instances where failures accrued on natural slopes during seismic activities (Keefer, 1984; Bommer, 1999). Although most of these failures are reported to be in a small scale, there were a few cases in which a large volumes of rock and soil where involved in the failure that can be a high threat to both buildings and life (Jibson et al., 1994; Harp and Jibson, 1995; Havenith et al., 2003). Stability of man-made slopes excavated for highways, dams, open pit mines and power plants during earthquakes are also important in civil and mining engineering projects. Stability of open pit mine slopes is crucial for economic reasons and safety, due to the presence of miners, expensive equipment, and production requirements in the mining process. In contrast to natural slopes, none of the earthquake activity observations on open pit mine slopes has been reported as significant interruption to the mining operation or serious injury. However, by reaching the final stage of mining in open pit mines the slope angle gets steeper and the new mining methods like highwall mining extend the final pit slope life which increases the probability of seismic activities during their life time. These circumstances cause debates about the necessity of performing seismic analysis for open pit slope stability (Read and Stacy, 2009).|",,50

The Continuum Damage Mechanics – based Differential Stress Induced Damage (DSID) model is used to represent micro-scale crack evolution. DSID parameters were calibrated against pre-peak points of stress/strain curves obtained experimentally during triaxial compression tests performed in Bakken shale. A bilinear CZM is employed to represent macroscale fracture propagation. We calculated the effective shear modulus of a continuum that contained a distribution of parallel cracks according to the DSID model (which does not account for crack interactions) and according to Kachanov's micromechanical model (which accounts for crack interactions). Simulations confirmed that above a crack density or damage of 0.3, crack interactions could not be ignored, and we used that threshold to define the transition between continuum damage propagation and discrete fracture propagation and subsequently, to calibrate the shear cohesive strength of the CZM. The CZM cohesive energy release rate was determined by calibrating a numerical model of triaxial compression test against experimental data obtained on Bakken shale. The cylindrical sample was modeled with a CZM to pre-define an inclined cohesive fracture, and the DSID model was assigned to the surrounding elements. We used our calibrated CZM-DSID model to simulate a biaxial compression test in plane strain. Results clearly show that the proposed modeling strategy not only allows simulating the advancement of macro-fracture tips, but also captures the inception and growth of micro-cracks that form damaged zones, as well as the transition between smeared damage and discrete fracture. |Introduction |The analysis of fracture propagation in geomaterials (such as rock, concrete) still remains a challenge from the perspective of numerical modeling, which needs to capture micro crack (damage) inception and growth up to the point of macro fracture initiation and propagation, and the formation of fracture paths after the global softening in later simulation stages. State-of-the-Art finite element tools are either based on Continuum Damage Mechanics (CDM) or on Fracture Mechanics (FM). In CDM, fractures are considered as the ultimate stage of damage accumulation, at which the energy dissipated in the damage zone equals the energy that needs to be released to create new surfaces (Mazars and Pijaudier-Cabot, 1996). In FM, discontinuous displacement fields propagate through a continuum according to physics-based criteria (Xu and Needleman, 1994). FM theories are usually implemented in Cohesive Zone Models (CZM) or Extended Finite Element Methods (XFEM). Because CDM cannot be used to simulate fracture surface debonding at late crack propagation stages and since State-of-the-Art CZM and XFEM do not account for micro-crack propagation prior to fracture surface debonding, several researchers coupled CDM and XFEM (Comi et al., 2007; Jirasek and Zimmermann, 2001) or CDM and CZM (Cuvilliez et al., 2012). However, even in these coupled models, there is no rigorous calibration of the critical damage threshold that marks the transition between micro-crack propagation and macro-fracture initiation. Moreover, the fracture path depends on the location of the CZ elements or on the interpolation order chosen in the XFEs. Thus in the present study, we propose a numerical method that couples a CDM model (for the bulk) to a Cohesive Zone Model (for the fracture). We present the theoretical framework and calibration method for the CDM model and for the CZM in Sections 2 and 3, respectively. In Section 4, we present the results obtained during simulations of biaxial compression tests in which CZs are placed at the boundaries of all the Finite Elements of the mesh.|",,0

Using a non-conforming mesh approach, fractures are conveniently discretized by dividing NMM mesh covers along fracture traces resulting in a discontinuous model, which can consider discrete fracture deformation (e.g. opening and slip) and fracture fluid flow within a permeable and deformable porous rock matrix. We revised Shi`s original scheme (Shi, 1988) by adding a fracture constitutive model with fracture normal and shear stiffness for mechanically open states. For fluid flow in fractures, we developed a new model to consider along-fracture and normal-to-fracture fluid flow without introducing additional degrees of freedom. We further implemented the new model into NMM with a two-cover-mesh system and with a tree-cutting algorithm to generate the non-conforming mesh. We verified the code for hydro-mechanical coupling in deformable porous media containing single and two sets of fractures and we demonstrated the capability on a problem involving coupled hydro-mechanical behavior of a complex fracture network with multiple fracture intersections. The ultimate goal is to develop an efficient and practical model for analyzing large-scale hydraulic fracturing and fracture network stimulations in energy production. |Introduction |Coupled hydro-mechanical (HM) processes, i.e., the interaction between hydraulic and mechanical fields, are significant in geological engineering, such as oil and gas extraction, geothermal energy and nuclear waste disposal, especially when the geological media consists of fractured rock (Rutqvist and Stephansson, 2003). Fractured rock may contain arbitrarily oriented and complexly intersected, thin (millimeters to microns) fractures. In such a geological system, two types of hydro-mechanical couplings prevails, i.e., direct and indirect couplings. Direct coupling occurs directly between mechanical and hydraulic fields in forms of pore-volume interaction. Specifically, the fluid pressure changes instantaneously affect deformation and the volume change instantaneously induces changes in fluid pressure. This pore-volume interaction can be described by Biot`s equations (Biot, 1941). Indirect coupling refers to indirect interaction between mechanical and hydraulic fields through changes in their material properties. Specifically, effective stress, affected by fluid pressure, would change the stiffness of fractures, and the deformation of fractures change their hydraulic conductivities. This interaction, involving changing fracture mechanical and hydraulic properties is usually represented by constitutive functions based on laboratory data or in situ experiments (Rutqvist et al., 1998, 2000).|",,14

In this study, three-dimensional bonded-particle discrete element modeling was performed in a transversely isotropic rock using PFC3D as an extension to the previous work conducted in two dimensions (Park and Min, 2015). Rock anisotropy was taken into account by means of inserting a smooth joint model and verification conducted in terms of both elastic and strength variation with respect to anisotropy angle compared well with the analytical solutions. This study includes validation of discrete element model where the modeled strength and elastic behavior of shale closely matches with those of the laboratory observations. The DEM model was able to capture the key anisotropic characteristics observed in the laboratory test such as drastic reduction of elastic modulus and strength affected by transversely isotropic plane which is often the weakest and most deformable. Finally, the three-dimensional discrete element model with embedded smooth joints was successfully applied to simulate the laboratory hollow-cylinder testing, which provides an improved insight into the wellbore instability observed in situ. |Introduction |Anisotropy of rock is generally observed in various rock types, e.g., shale that contains a set of parallel bedding planes. These weak cohesive planes contribute to large deformation and low shear strength, thereby resulting in unpredictable borehole damage especially when drilling sub-parallel to bedding planes (Okland et al., 1998; Zhang, 2013; Meier et al., 2015). Thus, the mechanical behavior of bedding planes with respect to their orientation should be properly considered in borehole stability analyses. |Discrete element method (DEM) particulate system is a powerful approach for simulating the material dynamic behavior under a given boundary condition without the need to establish the constitutive law (Potyondy and Cundall, 2004). The main advantage of bonded-particle DEM is its outstanding ability to monitor the evolving micromechanisms that can account for rock failure process. Furthermore, applications of bonded-particle DEM have been expanded into a complex rock mass modeling in larger scale in which natural fractures in rock mass have been taken into account using the discrete fracture network (DFN) model by means of smooth joint model (Mas Ivars et al., 2011). While previous studies on the fractured rock mass behaviors focused more on the natural fractures that are normally separated from each other with very low mechanical properties, there is a need for investigation regarding the behavior of weak cohesive planes within the intact rock, such as bedding planes that manifest transverse isotropy of rocks.|",,13

D., Nazarbayev University| Bissekenova, Z., Nazarbayev University| Minh, N. H., Nazarbayev University| Kim, J. R., Nazarbayev University","|Abstract: |Due to a limited number and poor quality of the available core samples, sandstone analogues are required for a research project on sand production in Kazakhstan. A consistent sample preparation method is essential to achieve repeatable test results in terms of the deformational characteristics and the failure strength of the rock. This paper presents results of the work conducted to produce synthetic sandstone samples by firing clay and sand mixture. The samples replicate the reservoir sandstones in terms of the particle-size distribution, cement content, mineralogy and porosity. The reservoir sand was used as a material for the sandstone samples. The samples with 20% and 30% clay content were prepared. Effect of temperature and firing duration was studied by firing the samples at 200°C for 5 hours, 200°C for 8 hours and 500°C for 5 hours. Scanning Electron Microscopy analysis was conducted on the samples to study the chemical transformation during firing and its effect on clay cementation. Triaxial test behavior of the reservoir sand and sandstone samples was investigated. |Introduction |Sand production is one of the main problems associated with weak reservoir sandstones at shallow depths in Kazakhstan oilfields. The reservoir sandstones of the oilfield from the Ustuyrt-Buzachi Sedimentary Basin are confined to the Lower Cretaceous formations of Hauterivian and Barremian ages. The reservoir depth varies from 200 m to 500 m. The paleoclimate was warm and humid during Hauterivian period, sedimentation occurred at deltaic depositional environment, followed by sea transgression during Barremian period and deposition of shallow-marine sediments (Tashliyev and Tovbina, 1992). As a result of such climatic and depositional conditions, the reservoir is composed of fine-grained sandstone with weak clay cement (Worden and Morad, 2003). Clay content of the reservoir rock varies from less than 10% up to 35%, reservoir properties diminishing with higher clay contents. |Due to a limited number and poor quality of the available core samples, sandstone analogues are required for the experiments. A consistent sample preparation method is essential to achieve repeatable test results in terms of the deformational characteristics and the failure strength of the rock. Different synthetic sandstone preparation methods have been developed and reported in the literature. Usage of Portland cement and gypsum as a bonding material has been widely practiced (Coop and Atkinson, 1993, Nouri et al., 2004, Consoli et al., 2012). Another series of techniques can be grouped under the method employing silicates to bond the sand particles. Cementation by silica glass was achieved by Bernabe et al., 1992 by mixing Ottawa sand with very fine powder of pyrex borosilicate glass, compacting at 14 MPa and heating to 950°C. Holt et al., 1993 mixed sand with sodium silicate solution, and flushed the mixture with CO2 under 'in-situ' stress. Mixture of fine Fontainnebleau sand and alkaline silica gel was exposed to high pressure and temperature by Broke et al., 1997. Calcite In-situ Precipitation System (CIPS) is employed in several works (Ismail et al., 2000, Sherlock and Siggins, 2003), where calcite solution is injected into the sand sample, and as a result of chemical processes within the fluid crystalline calcite precipitates, coating the sand grains and forming calcite bridges at particle contacts. Calcite precipitation can also be initiated and mediated by biological processes. Several studies (Rong et al., 2012) made use of alkalophilic microbe and calcite ion solution to achieve particle bonding, the technique is known as Microbial Induced Calcium Carbonate precipitation (MICP).|",,63

In the curve, the maximum stress that the rock sample can sustain indicates the peak strength. The stress in the residual part indicates the residual strength. The negative slope part should describe the strength evolution from peak strength to residual strength. Mohr-Coulomb (M-C) criterion is employed and the inter-relations between post-peak behavior of the complete stress-strain curve and strength parameter evolution of rocks are studied in the paper. First, a new approach for modeling strain-softening behavior is introduced. The stress–strain curve in the strain-softening stage is approximated in a stepwise way, and the strain-softening processes is modeled by a series of stress drop and plastic flow during the increase of plastic strain. Then several sets of parameters are studied and the corresponding stress-strain curves are obtained. The relations between the post-peak strength evolution and the shape of complete stress-strain curves are discussed, and the implications in geotechnical engineering are analyzed. |Introduction |When rock (rock mass) is loaded, deformation is produced. What is the relationship between the applied force and the displacement? Tests are needed to answer the question. That is why a thorough knowledge of the complete stress–strain curve is of great significance for the researchers(Hudson et al.1971, Jaeger and Cook. 1976). In the early stage of the rock mechanics, the complete curve cannot be obtained due to the limitation of the testing techniques and methodologies. The samples are often very unstable and the tests have to be terminated after the peak strength is reached. |However, the so called post-peak behavior of rocks is more interesting than the pre-peak one because they can sustain applied load after attainment of the ultimate strength. |A typical record of rock compression test is shown in Fig. 1 where both the pre-peak and the post-peak region(strain-softening region) are included.|",,16

This study focuses on reducing the breakdown pressure while improving near-wellbore fracture geometries by a variety of perforation geometries as well as cyclic pressure ramp-ups. A total of six large scale polyaxial experiments on isotropic cement samples were conducted, in which the principal stresses were set to represent a horizontal wellbore in a normally faulted stress regime. The results show that breakdown pressures can be reduced by 25% with in-plane perforations or cyclic pressure ramping. The results further indicate that open hole and conventional plug-and-perf completions lead to more near wellbore fracture tortuosities, while transverse fractures can be initiated from the in-plane perforation geometry. |Introduction |Most operators active in unconventional resource plays base their hydraulic fracturing treatment design on their experiences gained in North America's normally faulted marine basins. In areas with more challenging tectonic settings and deeper targets, however, hydraulic fracturing treatments need to be designed for higher breakdown pressures, higher average pumping pressures, and the risks of limited fracture height growth as well as pre-mature screen-outs. |In China's Sichuan Basin, breakdown pressures exceeding the design pressure rating of available standard pumping equipment (15 kpi surface pressure limit) have caused the failure of numerous hydraulic fracturing stages, or required additional perforations or sand jetting before the formation would break down. |In addition to issues related to breakdown pressure, non-radioactive tracer logs and micro-seismic data indicated very limited fracture heights. It might be possible that at certain formation layers, the hydraulic fractures were propagating horizontally. This hypothesis is reinforced by the closure stresses of several injection tests, which yielded a theoretical minimum horizontal stress equivalent to the overburden stress [1]. This suggests a strike-slip (<U+03C3>H > <U+03C3>v > <U+03C3>h) to reversely faulted stress regime (<U+03C3>H > <U+03C3>h > <U+03C3>v). When stimulating horizontal wells drilled on <U+03C3>h azimuth in such settings, the hydraulic fractures initiate along the sides of the wellbore where the hoop-stress <U+03C3><U+03B8> governed by <U+03C3>H >> <U+03C3>v is minimum. As the fracture then propagates into the principal stress governing zone away from the wellbore, two factors inhibit its re-orientate into the vertical plane: first, the marginal stress anisotropy <U+03C3>v - <U+03C3>h accommodates either orientation and therefore does not act as the required restoring force, and second, the laminated fabric of these shale formations favours horizontal fractures parallel to its bedding plane.|",,2
458,459,2016-190,Study of Stress Shadow Effects in Eagle Ford Shale: Insight from Field Data Analysis,"Simpson, Matthew Dale, Texas A&M University| Patterson, Ross, Texas A&M University| Wu, Kan, Texas A&M University","|Abstract: |Recently, the Eagle Ford shale has become one of the most heavily targeted shale plays. Optimizing the production from wells targeting this play begins with the hydraulic fracture design. Hydraulic fracturing treatments with closely spaced fractures allows for a large area of the formation to be fractured and produced more efficiently. However, fractures spaced too close together suffer from stress shadow effects, which may cause an inefficient fracture completion. Optimal fracture spacing is a crucial aspect to maximize well production. In this paper, we analyzed pressure data recorded during the hydraulic fracturing process of multi-stage horizontal wells in the Eagle Ford field. A gradual increase in the treatment pressure recorded during each successive stage of fracturing is a strong indicator of a stress shadow induced by the fractures. The wells we studied in the Eagle Ford shale did not show the trend of increasing treatment pressure between stages, which may imply that stage spacing is not within the region of stress shadow influence. Furthermore, the extent of a stress shadow induced by opening fractures can be estimated by an analytical solution based on fracture height. Based on the complex geology of interbedded organic rich marl and limestone in the Eagle Ford shale, and stage spacing, we inferred that fracture height in these wells might be limited by the ductile rock in the formation. Since the fracture height is smaller than the stage spacing, this results in a small extent of stress shadow. Furthermore, we built a reservoir model that matches the wells' production and bottomhole pressure data to further quantify the fracture height. The conclusion we obtained is that interbedded ductile layers inhibit the growth of fracture height, resulting in weak stress shadow effects and uniform, planar fractures generated in the formation. Through this study we can provide some critical guidelines on the stage spacing and perforation cluster spacing of wells in similar geologic settings. |Introduction |The Eagle Ford has long been known as a source rock for the Austin Chalk and Budda Limestone formations, but has only been targeted as a reservoir itself since 2008. With less than a decade of production, there is still much to learn about the most efficient way to produce this shale formation, which has become one of the most targeted shale plays in North America. |The Eagle Ford Shale is a tight formation with very low permeability and the only way for a well targeting the Eagle Ford to be commercially successful is through hydraulic fracturing. Creating fractures in the formation increases the conductive path for hydrocarbons to flow into the wellbore. This process is performed in horizontal wells so that a larger area of the reservoir can be targeted per well. The fracturing process is completed in stages, with each stage producing multiple fracture clusters that propagate into individual fractures. Ideally, stages should be spaced as close to one another as possible, since more fractures would increase the contact area between the fractures and the reservoir. Unfortunately, as a consequence of spacing fractures too close together, an increase in stress shadow effects can occur.|",,63

H., Golder Associates","|Abstract: |Engineering problems in residential and other structures built during the early to mid-2000s in Dublin Ireland were discovered a few years after construction. The damage ranged from cracks in and displacement and tilting of floors to askew walls, jamming of doors and windows, exterior wall cracks, and pipe damage. The cause of the issues was initially incorrectly identified, but was ultimately attributed to the effects of heave caused by the rapid decomposition of the mineral pyrite in the crushed rock structural fill aggregate. The problem was traced to a single quarry that was mining a transitional geological formation; by the time the problems had been diagnosed, a few million cubic metres of rock had been produced at the quarry. Damages due to heave was observed in thousands of structures, primarily residences, in the Dublin area; thus the effects were significant. The problems spawned numerous litigation that occupied significant time, expenditures and resources. These cases illustrate the level of care and scientific diligence that must be applied for even mundane and low-cost construction materials such as structural fill aggregates. |Introduction |Starting in the 1990s through till about 2007, the Republic of Ireland was undergoing a significant economic boom, with rapid population growth (Figure 1) that drove a wave of construction across the country. In the Dublin area, with its population of approximately 1.25 million, this growth was more pronounced, and it fueled the demand for more housing, roads, commercial, infrastructure, and other types of construction. |Given this sustained and dramatic growth, the demand for aggregate products -- including structural fill, road base materials, asphalt aggregate and concrete aggregate -- to service these projects increased dramatically during this period. The increased consumption of these aggregates resulted in the depletion of some of the existing aggregate sources.

S., Mine Design Engineering| Ferland, P., Newmont| Davidson, A., Newmont","|Abstract: |In Carlin Style gold deposits challenging ground conditions can be correlated to the alteration type and intensity as well as ground disturbance (i.e. faulting or collapse breccias). In these conditions, there are significant limitations in the application of conventional rock mass rating systems (i.e. RMR or Q) because these systems emphasize fracture frequency and fracture condition rather than the condition of the matrix material. As matrix strength is reduced, the condition of fractures and the fracture frequency become less relevant as indicators of geotechnical ground behaviour. As part of this work, a classification scheme was developed to incorporate the intensity of rock alteration as well as the degree of ground disturbance. This scheme provides a hazard classification system for rocks that fall below the practically useful range of conventional systems. |Further to the classification system, this study uses geological data cross-referenced to geotechnical data to verify both data sets, and to increase geotechnical knowledge about a rock mass. This is achieved by the MDEng Weights of Evidence Method which uses multiple parameters from the geology log to assign indicator scores for geotechnical condition to each logged interval of a drill hole database. Indicator scores are processed by a mathematical algorithm in order to assign hazard rankings for each interval of geologically logged core. This analytical approach produces a non-subjective, repeatable and semi-automated way to evaluate expected geotechnical conditions from existing geological logs which, typically, would otherwise be overlooked by geotechnical practitioners. |Introduction |During all phases of mine design (from exploration to operations), geological logging data is generally significantly more abundant and often more detailed than geotechnical records. When geotechnical parameters are collected as part of an exploration campaign, they are often limited to RQD and occasionally a strength and/or weathering estimate. As mine design advances, geotechnical data collection generally expands to cover the necessary parameters for joint characterization and rock mass classification. Detailed geotechnical data is generally collected on far fewer drill holes than geological data, resulting in broader inference of ground conditions. |Newmont's Leeville/Turf operation, located along the Carlin trend in North East Nevada, has such a database with extensive geology logs and (comparatively) limited geotechnical data.

Stress intensity factors are computed by contour integration procedure embedded in a finite element program package. To achieve pure shear mode state, loading configuration and parameters are varied in models of rectangular beams. Beam depth is varied as 40, 50, and 60 millimeters. Initial crack length/beam depth ratio (a/W) is varied between 0.15 and 0.60. Pure shear conditions at crack are generated by changing asymmetric loading spans at upper and lower boundaries of the beam geometry. Computations showed that as beam depth was increased, mode II stress intensity factor decreased. Mathematical relations for pure shear mode stress intensity factor were proposed with varying asymmetric loading span and a/W to assure pure shear mode state at crack front. Proper loading and beam geometric conditions were identified for pure mode II fracture toughness KIIc testing. From four-point asymmetric bending tests on Ankara andesite, average mode II fracture toughness value was found as 0.61 MPavm. Results of shear mode fracture toughness tests showed that variation of beam depth had no significant effect on mode II fracture toughness of beam type rock specimens. |Introduction |Shear type (mode II) loading state is still an active subject of interest in fracture mechanics. Although, numerous test methods have been suggested (Rao et al., 2003, Awaji and Sato, 1978, Atkinson, 1982, Fowell and Xu, 1993)[1-4] to measure mode II fracture toughness KIIc of rocks, common opinion in this respect is not well-established yet. |Mode II fracture toughness tests aim to measure resistance of a crack to propagate due to in plane shear stress acting on it. Mode II fracture toughness of rocks appears in practical problems of rock mechanics such as hydraulic fracturing (Daneshy, 1974, Hubbert and Willis, 1957), rock cutting (Hood and Roxborough, 1992, Xu, 1993), and rock burst mechanism investigations (Salamon 1963, Cook 1965, Zipf and Heasley, 1990). |In geotechnical applications, rock medium is usually under the effect of compressive forces as a result of overburden stress.

Each intersection was given a roof rating and a seepage rating. Common data mining techniques, such as multivariate linear regression, multinomial logistic regression, decision trees and probabilistic neural nets, were considered and evaluated to establish correlations and associations between stability and seepage with the other variables. Two of the more successful techniques were Decision Trees and Multinomial Logistic Regression. The analyses showed that a number of mining and geological factors impacted stability and seepage, and that larger scale factors impacting multiple adjacent intersections were most important for causing instability and seepage. The study also outlines a workflow that could easily be adapted to other mines or to situations where it is not possible to use detailed physical models to study a large number of potential variables and complex interactions |Introduction |Studies have shown (Molinda et al., 1998, 2000; MSHA, 2012) that intersections have a higher incidence of roof falls than straight entries, and that approximately one-quarter of all rock fall injuries and fatalities occurred at intersections. Instability and seepage at intersections of entries and crosscuts in underground longwall coal mines impacts mining efficiency, cost and potentially safety. Gaining a better understanding of what factors impact stability and seepage can lead to proactive measures that reduce cost and increase both safety and efficiency.|",,63
463,464,2016-181,Numerical Modeling of Hydraulic Fracture Propagation from Horizontal Wells in Anisotropic Shale,"Sesetty, V., The University of Oklahoma| Ghassemi, A., The University of Oklahoma","|Abstract: |The purpose of this paper is to study the growth of hydraulic fractures in anisotropic rocks such as shale. The boundary value problems of anisotropic materials often are difficult to solve due to the mathematical complexity, therefore such problems are treated numerically under the assumption of isotropy even though such assumption rarely holds in reality. This paper uses the constant element anisotropic displacement discontinuity method (ADDM) for fracture deformation with square root elements at crack tips to calculate stress intensity factors accurately. 3D correction factor G is also developed for anisotropic DDM to include height effect in 2D problems using the analytical solution for stress distribution around a line crack in orthotropic material. The crack propagation is modeled according to the normal stress ratio criterion which accounts elliptically varying fracture toughness while calculating crack trajectory. Crack extension occurs when mode-1 stress intensity factor at tips reaches a critical value KIC (<U+03C6>). The fracture deformation is fully coupled with fluid flow inside the fracture by solving all the unknowns simultaneously using globally convergent Newton-Raphson method. The simulation results show significant difference in fracture geometries and apertures between isotropic and anisotropic materials. In anisotropic rock, the direction of plane of elastic symmetry w.r.t fracture influences the fracture geometry. Simulations of multi-stage single lateral fracturing, multi-lateral zipper fracturing in anisotropic shale are included. |Introduction |Shale is categorized as an anisotropic rock at different scales. Intrinsic anisotropy of elastic properties of shale is often attributed to the composition of the shale and preferred orientation of platy clay particles. [Josh et al., 2012] Correlated the degree of anisotropy in shales to the amount of clay and organic content present in it. At field scale all rocks exhibit anisotropy in some form. Naturally fractured rocks are softer in the direction perpendicular to the fractures. For example rock with 3 mutually perpendicular sets of fracture systems can be considered as an orthotropic material in the analysis of rock deformation [Goodman, 1976]. Also micro-cracks can lead to the evolution of stress-induced anisotropy in shales [Dewhurst and Siggins, 2006, Sone, 2012]. The degree of anisotropy in this case depends on the orientation of micro-cracks w.r.t to principal stresses. Along with elastic anisotropy, the shales also exhibit strong strength anisotropy due to the presence of bedding planes. The tensile strength of shale when load is applied perpendicular to the bedding is less compared to case when the load is applied parallel to the bedding. The bedding acts as a plane of weakness that promotes early failure when tension is applied perpendicular to it. |[Suarez-Rivera et al., 2011] Reported degree of anisotropy observed in elastic modulus, compressive and tensile strengths measured parallel and perpendicular to the bedding planes for various mudstones. The degree of anisotropy in Young's modulus for the 7 reported samples varied from 1.05 to 4.01.|",,15

A main reason for proppant embedment is the softening and weakening effects of the reservoir rocks after their exposure to the fracturing fluids which are introduced during the stimulation process. Slickwater fracturing has been extensively used in stimulating shale formation. The base polymer/ friction reducer (FR) for the slickwater fluids can be either in the form of water-in-oil emulsion or as a dry powder. In this work, three clay stabilizers including KCl, KI and 50% tetramethylammonium chloride (TMAC) and two forms of friction reducers have been studied. Six fluids with different combinations of clay stabilizers and friction reducers have been prepared. The organic rich Eagle Ford shale samples have been treated with these fluids for a certain amount of time, and then uniaxial compressive test and indirect tensile strength test were conducted to systematically investigate the impact of these fluids on various rock mechanical properties. |Experimental results show that all six fracture fluids have significant impacts on rock mechanical properties. Significant reduction in ultimate compressive strength, Young's modulus and Brazilian tensile strength have been observed after the exposure of these specimens in fracture fluids. In addition, rocks tend to become more ductile. The fluid containing 0.5 gpt FR (in an emulsion form) has the most impact on shale mechanical properties among others, resulting in 68% compressive strength reduction, 75% Young's modulus reduction and 42% of Brazilian tensile strength reduction. The mechanisms on fracturing fluids weakening rock mechanical properties are discussed in this work. The results of this research provide insights on fracture fluids selection and preventing proppant embedment for tight sand and shale reservoirs to optimize the hydrocarbon productivity. |Introduction |Proppant embedment, as shown in Figure 1, can be responsible for the decrease in hydraulic fracture's aperture and reduction of fracture conductivity in organic rich shale reservoirs. Alramahi and Sundberg (2012) have conducted experiments to draw the relationship between the fracture conductivity and closure stress (Figure 2). They found that the corresponding normalized fracture conductivity, defined as a ratio of the conductivity at a given closure pressure to the one at 3.45 MPa, decreases from 1.0 to 1.0 E-6, as shown in Figure 2. |The main reason for the proppant embedment is likely due to the softening and weakening effects of the reservoir rocks after their exposure to the fracturing fluids, which are introduced into the wellbore during the hydraulic fracturing stimulation process. This weakening effect will also influence the propagation and orientation of hydraulic fractures. The weakening effect by pure water alone on rock mechanical properties has been observed and well documented in previous studies (Han, 2003; Meng et al., 2005; Hu et al., 2014; and Lin and Lai, 2014). Uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) experiments conducted by Lin and Lai (2014) show that Young's modulus decreases significantly with the increase of water content. This conclusion was further verified by acoustic velocity measurement in shales (Lai et al., 2015). Meng et al. (2005) concluded that the increase of water content could lead to stronger molecule active ability, and thus affects rock strength and elastic properties. Hu et al. (2014) indicated that when water content changes in shale, the corresponding water menisci would be altered, which induces changes in bonding force between solid particles and therefore influences the mechanical properties.|",,3

R., Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology| Bayuk, I. O., Schmidt Institute of Physics of the Earth| Tarelko, N. F., Schlumberger Moscow Research| Abashkin, V. V., Schlumberger Moscow Research","|Abstract: |When realizing thermal enhanced oil recovery projects, it is necessary to have high quality data on thermal and geomechanical properties of reservoir rocks and/or connection between those effective properties at reservoir conditions. Recently a number of important papers were published regarding a connection of the effective properties of rock with unique parameters of rock microstructure using the effective medium theory (EMT). We demonstrate how to connect the dynamic elastic moduli of rock in different saturation states with its thermal conductivity (TC) via these parameters. An EMT-based model of physical properties of Bentheimer sandstone is successfully developed and tested. The model is based on results of microstructure analysis of the sandstone samples and experimental data on elastic wave velocities (Vp and Vs) and TC of the samples in two saturation states (dry and brine-saturated) and under axial stress up to 21 MPa. We use two approaches of EMT: f-model and well known self-consistent approach, to show special aspects of this modeling. We demonstrate how the axial stress affects the rock's microstructure and how it is reflected in the thermal and elastic properties. |Introduction |Data of rock thermal properties including thermal conductivity (TC) are commonly used in different areas of prospecting geophysics, basin modeling, storage of radioactive materials, etc. While techniques for measuring of TC on core samples in the lab at room temperature and normal atmospheric pressure are well known [1], logging tools for TC are not widely used in the industry and their accuracy is still under investigation [2]. Thus, we utilize theoretical models to connect TC with other well-known properties. |Modeling of effective rock physical properties is a challenging problem. Transport properties (TC and electrical resistivity) as well as elastic properties depend on many factors: mineral and organic composition, cementation, fluid saturation, volume ratios of minerals and voids, size of components and their spatial distribution, and surface properties of grains [3-5]. |Five groups of theoretical approaches exist to estimate rock's effective properties: empirical [6, 7], engineering [8-10], effective medium theory (EMT) [11, 12], artificial neural network [13], and numerical simulation approaches [14]. Those approaches have advantages and drawbacks. Empirical approaches use many experimental data to derive dependencies between physical parameters, and they have narrow applicability. Engineering ones use exact solutions for medium model with specific assumptions of its structure, such as two-phase layered medium. Artificial neural network approaches require huge massive of data. Numerical simulation approaches require high-resolution information about the rock structure obtained from X-ray computed tomography. However, the best resolution can be reached on very small samples approximately 8 mm in height. However, for rocks with complex structure representative elementary volume (REV) can be larger.|",,48

This in turn requires estimation of bulk and grain modulus or compressibility. Although bulk modulus estimation is a standard laboratory method for shale, no effort was made till date to directly measure grain compressibility in the laboratory. This paper presents a laboratory study to fill this gap. The experimental program described here starts with validation of the technique using aluminum sample. Following this, one Berea sandstone and one shale sample was tested. Finally, using the measured data, Biot coefficient was estimated for shale. General agreement with published literature was observed. However, since none of the reported data was obtained through laboratory measurement, further measurements need be performed for shale and other reservoir rocks. |Introduction |During deposition and diagenesis, cracks and pores are created in subsurface strata. These void spaces or porosity are in turn occupied with one or more fluid phases ranging from water to liquid or gaseous hydrocarbon depending on depositional/post-depositional environment. Intuitively, the mechanical behavior of subsurface strata filled with fully or partially saturated pore spaces differs from that of a rigid or non-porous rock. The extraction of hydrocarbon results into change in pore fluid pressure in subsurface strata. The processes of drilling and completion impact the existing in situ stress field. This is further complicated when intentional/unintentional production of hydrocarbon occurs as the resulting change in pore pressure once again affects the stress field. The effects of pore pressure change on the deformation around a borehole (Detournay and Cheng, 1988), hydraulic fracturing (Detournay et al., 1989) and slip along active faults (Rudnicki and Hsu, 1988) have been reported earlier. To fully understand this, the theory of effective stress was first proposed by Carl Terzaghi on one-dimensional consolidation of soil which was later extended to three-dimension by Biot (1941). Following this, Geertsma (1957) and Skempton (1961) separately defined the expression for effective stress for a fully saturated material, which was later mathematically derived by Nur and Byerlee (1971). In their work, effective stress is expressed as: |(equation) |(equation) |where Pe, Pt and Pp are effective, total and pore pressure, respectively, <U+03B1> is Biot coefficient and K and Ks are bulk and grain modulus. Biot coefficient was subsequently utilized in estimating insitu stress (Thiercelin and Plumb, 1994) as well as in wellbore stability analysis and hydraulic fracture design (Cheng et al, 1993). As revealed in Eq. (2), it requires estimation of both bulk and grain modulus. This in turn involves saturating the rock material with pore fluid which presents a challenge for fine-grained rock like shale. The complex pore structure and nanometer range pore diameter of shale makes the saturation a shale sample in the laboratory significantly longer, making the test protocol impractical. This paper explores an alternative laboratory technique which is simply a variant of the unjacketed compressibility test. The paper begins with a description of the experimental technique in detail. This is followed by presenting the results conducted using an aluminum cylinder, the purpose of which is entirely validation of the experimental technique. The presentation is concluded by reporting results on Berea sandstone and shale and estimating Biot's coefficient for those samples. The results presented here indicates usability of the technique in estimation of grain modulus and hence, Biot coefficient, for shale. The readers should note that as shown in Eq. (2), Biot coefficient is estimated using modulus instead of compressibility, it's reciprocal. Similarly, all laboratory measurements presented in this paper report a modulus value and one can estimate compressibility from them.|",,30
467,468,2016-131,A Coupled Nonlocal Damage Model for Hydraulic Fracture Propagation,"Huang, K., University of Oklahoma| Ghassemi, A., University of Oklahoma","|Abstract: |Successful capturing the mechanical behaviors of rock is the first and important step for hydraulic fracturing simulation. For heterogonous materials like rock, the numerical fracturing models must correctly represent the energy dissipation during the fracture propagation. However, finite element analysis using strain softening model becomes highly affected by the mesh size and alignment causing non-physical predictions of damage or softening process zone. Therefore, the energy dissipation becomes unstable since that it is highly affected by the different size of element used in the simulations, which is so called mesh size dependency. In this paper, nonlocal formulation damage mechanics is employed as the rock constitutive model in hydraulic fracturing simulation to capture the energy. Nonlocal formulation abandons the classical assumption that the strength degradation at certain point can only results from the strain-stress states at the point itself, but the states over the whole domain or at least a certain representative volume defined by a characteristic length. Also, the simulation involves a numerical algorithm that couples the fracture fluid flow with the fracture deformation in a moving boundary during the fracture propagation using lubrication theory. |Introduction |For quasi-brittle materials, the cohesive strength and fracture energy are basic parameters to describe the behaviors of fracture propagation [Park et al., 2008]. It is observed that there is an intermediate region between uncracked and cracked parts defined as the fracture process zone. The material softening localized in the fracture process zone consumes energy. The relationship between the fracture energy and size of the localization zone has been verified by the experiments. Especially, due to the micro cracks and voids, relatively larger fracture process zone is found in quasi-brittle materials, and results in the difference between the strength measured in laboratory-size sample and the strength of actual structures. This phenomenon is associated with the size effect [Bazant and Planas, 1998]. In addition, in finite element implementation, the size of localization zone is related to element size. In other words, in traditional strain softening model, the fracture energy depends on the size of element. This effect is called mesh size dependency or mesh size. To capture the fracture energy, [Klein and Gao, 1998; Gao and Ji, 2003] introduced the fracture localization zone in virtual internal bond (VIB) model to simulate the fracture process zone of materials. The fracture localization zone is consistent with fracture band model developed by [Bazant and Cedolin, 1979]. As an intrinsic length of materials, the size of fracture localization zone is calculated in conjunction with the J integral. |The constitutive relation, in traditional strain softening model, is calibrated to match the experiment data for all element size. However, the actual softening curve and fracture energy should integrally consider both the elemental strain-stress curve and the size of fracture process zone (size of element in FEM implements). The quantitative analysis will be highly effected since that the model fails to capture energy dissipation during the fracture propagation. The present work will employ the nonlocal damage model to capture the fracture energy with an intrinsic characteristic length, in which the size of element does not have to be the size of fracture localization zone that is more convenient for curved fracture propagation.|",,22

P., University of Toronto","|Abstract: |The Hoek-Brown empirical strength criterion for intact rock is widely used as the basis for estimating the strength of rock masses. Estimates of the H-B parameters, the empirical constant m and the uniaxial compressive strength <U+03C3>c are commonly obtained by fitting the criterion to triaxial strength data sets of small sample size. This paper investigates how such small sample sizes affect the uncertainty associated with the H-B parameter estimations. We use Monte Carlo (MC) simulation to generate data sets of different sizes that represent various rock types, and then investigate the uncertainty associated with parameter estimations for these synthetic data. We show that the uncertainties depend not only on the level of variability, but also on the rock type being investigated. We discuss that the minimum number of required samples depends on the rock type, and should correspond to some acceptable level of uncertainty in the estimations. Also, a comparison of the results from our analysis with actual rock strength data shows that the probability of obtaining reliable strength parameter estimations using small samples may be very low. We further discuss the impact of this on on-going implementation of reliability based design protocols, and conclude with suggestions for improvements in this respect. |Introduction |In rock engineering, the determination of rock strength is a significant step in the early stages of a project in order to develop economic and safe designs. The well-known Hoek-Brown strength criterion is commonly used to characterize the strength of both intact rock and rock masses. At its simplest, for intact rock this criterion may be written as |(equation) |where <U+03C3>1 and <U+03C3>3 are the major and minor principal stresses at peak strength, <U+03C3>c is the intact rock uniaxial compressive strength, and m is an empirical constant. |This criterion is usually calibrated, in terms of obtaining estimates of <U+03C3>c and m, by fitting it to the results of triaxial compressive tests conducted on intact rock specimens (e.g. Carter et al., 1991; Eberhardt, 2012; Hoek & Brown, 1988; Kovari et al., 1983).

A 3D numerical model is developed using a combination of displacement discontinuity method for the hydro-mechanical response of porous rocks and finite element method for the fracture fluid flow simulation. The fracture propagation is analyzed based on the linear elastic fracture mechanics approach. The reservoir rock mass is assumed homogenous and isotropic with constant poroelastic physical properties and the fracturing fluid is assumed incompressible and shows Newtonian behavior. Numerical examples of multiple fracture propagation from the horizontal wells are presented. The results show that along with reservoir rock properties and in-situ stress state, the spacing among fractures has a strong influence on the evolution of multiple fracture propagation. Finally, simulation of refracturing of un-depleted zones between closely-spaced horizontal wells is presented. The results demonstrate the change of stresses and pore pressure due to reservoir depletion mainly depends on the stress anisotropy, reservoir poroelastic properties, and the timing of infill well stimulation or production duration. |Introduction |Horizontal well stimulation usually involves creating cluster of multiple fractures in stages along the wellbore using different well completion techniques. These multiple fractures stages generate large contact surface area with the reservoir which results in increase of permeability and hence, increases the oil and gas production, and the heat energy production in case of the geothermal systems. The multistage fracturing of a single or multiple horizontal wells is usually carried out either in simultaneous or sequential manner. The multiple fracturing creation process is controlled by the mechanical interaction or “stress shadowing” among multiple fractures, in-situ stress anisotropy, and the net applied fluid pressure. The term stress shadow represents variation of stresses in the region surrounding a pressurized fracture, which is a function of applied fluid pressure. The spacing between the fractures and the horizontal wells, and the in-situ stress contrast play an important role in the mechanical interaction (Sesetty and Ghassemi, 2015 & 2016). |Several numerical models have been developed to simulate hydraulic fracturing process in the oil and gas reservoirs based on the elastic rock mass assumptions. The poroelastic effects on the hydraulic fracturing process are generally ignored. The rational is that the hydraulic fracture simulation time-scale is such that these effects have not time to develop or the magnitude of these effects are small enough to be neglected. However, in case of low permeability reservoirs (e.g., tight oil and shale gas reservoir), where hydraulic fracturing is carried out using relatively low viscosity fluids and high injection rates, the coupled poroelastic phenomenon such as changes in the rock deformation due to diffusion of the pore pressure and pressure induced by mechanical deformation of the solid rock need to be incorporated for better understanding of the fracturing mechanism which often involves rock failure and/or reactivation of natural fractures. These poroelastic effects on the hydraulic fracturing process are included using the back-stress and back-pressure concept (Cheng and Detournay, 1988; Vandamme et al., 1989; Vandamme and Roegiers, 1990; Clifton and Wang, 1991; Ghassemi and Roegiers, 1996).|",,31

W., The University of Arizona","|Abstract: |Stability studies on two tunnels, a horseshoe-shaped and an inverted arch-shaped tunnel, in a deep coal mine in China, have been performed using the 3DEC distinct element code and presented in this study. A pseudo time-dependent support installation procedure has been developed to incorporate the stress relaxation and deformation due to time gap between excavation and support installation. The utility of incorporating stress relaxation before support installation has been explored through observation of support factors of safety and grout failures. The numerical models have been analyzed for different support configurations and unsupported situations. The reinforcement provided by the supports has been demonstrated using changes in tunnel deformations and sizes of yield zones around the tunnels, in addition to observations of support factors of safety and grout failures. Results indicate that using longer supports and floor bolting would provide higher stability for the rock masses around the tunnels. A comparison between the closure strains in the two tunnels indicates that the inverted arch tunnel may be more stable under the existing geo-mining conditions at the site. Finally, parametric studies point to the importance of cohesion and friction angle estimation for intact rock, and basic friction angle estimation for the rock mass, to ensure robust numerical results. |Introduction |Since coal is one of the major sources of energy in China, mines have been forced to expand production by going deeper underground (He and Song, 2012). As extraction depths increase, associated ground control issues such as squeezing increase, due to higher in-situ stress fields. China has more coal mines at depths of 1000 m or higher (>20 mines), than any other country in the world (Huang, 2008). The high in-situ stress makes the coal workings hazardous and there have been a high number of roof collapse incidents. For instance, roof fall has been the single highest contributor for coal mine deaths in China, at nearly 1200 deaths in 2008 (The Compiling Committee of China, 2010). In addition to the dangers of roof fall, deep excavations also undergo plastic deformations, especially in soft strata such as coal-measure rocks. The plastic deformations can be reduced or controlled through supporting routines such as installation of bolts, wire meshes, cables etc. Commonly used support systems in deep metal mines have been documented in literature (eg. Peng and Tang, 1984; Hoek et al., 2000; Mark and Braczak, 2000; Aldorf and Exner, 2013). |The mine being studied in this paper is the Xiezhuang coal mine in the Xinwen mining area of the Shandong Province in China.

The tunnels are of a conventional horseshoe shape and an inverted arch shape. There is no known significant structural discontinuity crossing the tunnel or water bearing strata around the tunnels. The rock mass around the tunnels has three orthogonal joint sets out of which the horizontal set (bedding planes) is most distinct, and has an average joint spacing of 1 m. Due to the soft stratum and the horizontal joint set, the tunnels experience floor heaving.|",,43

Among the several numerical methods available to deal with this problem, the Extended Finite Element Method (XFEM) presents some advantages since it can perform arbitrary crack propagation without remeshing and elements containing a crack are not required to conform to crack edges. In this research XFEM is applied to investigate rock blasting based on the phantom node method where discontinuities in the displacement fields are introduced through new degrees of freedom in overlapping elements. Some specific aspects related to the fracturing of a rock mass subjected to a general bench blast are discussed, such as the influence of mesh refinement, the effects of the stress-loading rate and the number and distribution of preexisting cracks around the blast hole. The numerical results are compared with those obtained by other authors using different numerical approaches, which confirms the suitability of XFEM to simulate dynamic fracture propagation problems. |Introduction |Rock blasting is widely used for excavations in mining and civil engineering works. Damage to the rock structure during blasting may occur as a result of the stress waves (dynamic load) and the overpressure of the explosive gases (quasi-static load) that create new cracks and widen the already existing ones (Liu and Katsabanis, 1997). |One of the most used methods for simulation of crack propagation is the finite element method, where the evolution of cracks in time is followed through successive mesh updates in order to represent the new geometry of the fractured body. This approach, besides being computationally inefficient and lengthy, may also yield loss of numerical accuracy when variables of interest are mapped and interpolated from the old to the new finite element mesh. |On the other hand, the Extended Finite Element Method (XFEM) is able to model cracks without remeshing (Belytschko and Black, 1999; Moes et al., 1999). The representation of cracks is ensured by special enriched functions in conjunction with additional degrees of freedom, which gives numerical results of greater accuracy and lower computational times.

The degree of time dependence of rock is represented by the value of n; rock strength increases in proportion to the 1/(n+1)-th power of loading rate, and creep lifetime decreases in inverse proportion to the n-th power of creep stress. This paper discussed the factors affecting the loading rate dependence of rock strength, comparing the n values under various test conditions. In this study, water content was found to significantly affect the loading rate dependence of strength. Moreover, the data of the loading rate dependence were much fewer in tension or shear than in compression. Hence, the important subject of future investigation is to understand the effects of water under tensile or shear as well as compressive stress state. On the effects of confining pressure, there were a certain amount of date in previous studies. In this study, the failure criterion considering the loading rate dependence of strength was examined with the data. In contrast to the above factors, geometry and temperature of specimens were found to have a little influence on the loading rate dependence of strength. |Introduction |To assess the long term stability of underground structures, it is essential to understand the time dependent behaviors of rock. In laboratory tests with rock specimens, time dependent behaviors, such as loading rate dependence, creep, and relaxation, have close relation with each other (Brantut, 2013). The degree of time dependence is represented by the value of n; rock strength increases in proportion to the 1/(n+1)-th power of loading rate, and creep lifetime decreases in inverse proportion to the n-th power of creep stress. The n value depends on rock type, stress state and test conditions, and a lower n indicates larger time dependence. |The authors have investigated the time dependent behaviors of various rocks, and collected their n values. Okubo et al. (2013) collected the n values of nine Japanese rocks, and reported that the n value was independent on the loading procedures: constant loading rate, stepwise loading rate increase and alternating loading rate. Hashiba & Fukui (2015) collected the n values of 42 rocks around the world from literatures. They reported that the n value of one of the rocks was constant in compressive, tensile and shear stresses under unconfined conditions. Moreover, the n value was lower in wet than in dry conditions, and was higher under higher confining pressure. However, effects of other factors, such as size, shape, anisotropy, and temperature of specimens, were not well understood. This paper discussed the factors affecting the loading rate dependence of rock strength, comparing the n values obtained in this study and in the authors' previous studies.|",,43

D., Yokohama National University| Kikumoto, M., Yokohama National University","|Abstract: |The slaking phenomenon of geo-materials derived from weak rocks such as mudstone or shale may cause the deformation of earth structures. Thus it should be properly considered in the process of design and construction. Previous researches indicated that slaking causes variation in particle size distribution and change in mechanical properties. However, mechanism of slaking phenomena and its mechanical consequence needs to be studied carefully. Therefore, investigation of slaking and deformation behavior through several laboratory tests was performed. In order to discuss the fundamental slaking phenomena, laboratory experiments such as ordinary acceleration slaking tests, X-Ray Fluorescence tests (XR-F) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) observation have been performed. Moreover, in order to observe the slaking phenomena and its effect on compression behavior, we modified one dimensional compression slaking test in which cyclic processes of wetting and drying is given. Kobe mudstone and Kakegawa mudstone were used to perform one-dimensional compression slaking test. The experimental results of one dimensional compression slaking tests showed that particle crushing phenomenon during the compressive stress contributes to increasing compressibility. The compressive slaking revealed that slaking under reaction stress cause the large compression even the mudstone specimens compacted to medium density. The study also suggested that it is possible to describe the slaking phenomenon in a similar way as the particle-crushing phenomenon using the scaler grading index that represents particle characteristics. |Introduction |Weak rocks such as mudstone or shale are highly susceptible to the weathered. Such materials have a tendency to slake and soften when immersed or contacted to the water and as a result their strength diminishes gradually with time. Due to this natural obstacle, mudstone material has been mostly disposed as waste material. However, meanwhile dealing with economic considerations and environmental concerns, several earth constructions projects propose to utilize the crushed mudstones or shales as geomaterials. Since large embankment made of these materials is considered, long term stability problem may possibly appear from the occurrence of slaking (Wakinshaw and Santi, 1996; Botts, 1998; Yoshida et.al, 2002; Santi, 2006). One of these embankments located on the Tomei expressway in Makinohara district in Japan failed during the Surugawan earthquake in 2009, with subsequent field investigation and analysis identifying the primary cause to be slaking of the mudstone (Yasuda et.al, 2012). |The slaking behavior of weak rocks has been studied experimentally (Vallejo et.al 1993; Santi, 1998; Yoshida and Hosokawa, 2004) through slake-durability tests and other similar tests, in which a number of wetting and drying cycles are applied to evaluate the weathering resistance of weak rocks as shales, mudstones and siltstones. This has demonstrated that slaking cycles significantly affect the degradation process and evolution of particle size distribution in such rocks (Sadisun et.al, 2005; Gautam and Shakoor, 2013). Several studies have discussed the effects of various mineralogical, chemical, physical, and mechanical properties on the weathering characteristics of weak rocks, which have shown that rock-forming minerals have a dominant effect on the chemical weathering of sedimentary rocks (Chigira and Oyama, 1999; Bhattarai et.al, 2006; Schaefer and Birchmeir, 2013).|","particle size distribution,  mudstone,  particle crushing,  grading index, Slaking",12

G., Halliburton| Sperrazza, N., Halliburton| McNealy, T., Halliburton","|Abstract: |This paper presents field case studies of a coupled geomechanics and fluid flow computational algorithm for hydraulic fracture simulation in the Marcellus and Barnett formations. This computational algorithm is also coupled with tensile and shear-failure models to help describe pre-existing natural fracture evolution and its interaction with approaching hydraulically induced fractures. The numerical simulations are performed using field conditions and known parameters. The goal of the case studies presented in this work is to demonstrate the capabilities of the tightly coupled numerical algorithm for hydraulic fracturing analysis, especially for analysis of a complex fracture network. Emphasis is placed on characteristics of pre-existing natural fractures because the characteristics of pre-existing natural fractures directly result in different extents of complexity for created fracture networks. The presence of natural fractures contributes not only fracture interactions, but also well communications. The case studies presented can be used to provide insight for refining hydraulic fracturing treatment designs in similar reservoirs. |Introduction |In recent years, cost reduction has become a focal point for operators considering hydraulic fracturing treatments in horizontal wells for unconventional formations. An important aspect of reducing cost is gaining a better understanding of the fracturing process and its influence on fracturing design and production, especially in the case of complex fracture mechanisms. Pre-existing natural fractures in unconventional reservoirs contribute uncertainties during the fracturing process in terms of propagation of hydraulic fractures and the interaction between natural fractures and hydraulic fractures. The interaction between hydraulic fractures and natural fractures could arrest or divert propagation of hydraulically induced fractures and generate a complex fracture network (CFN) other than planar fracture geometries. Because of such complexity, the classic planar model is too overly simplified to be useful for CFN simulations. |Multiple numerical simulation models have been developed for the hydraulic fracturing process for planar fracture geometries and complex fracture networks. These fracture models can be divided into two main categories. One category is continuum-mechanics based models, the other is discrete fracture models. Continuum-mechanics based models, such as the Continuum Damage Model (CDM), considers the displacement field and damage of material as continuous state variables. There is no explicit description of fracture surface geometry and no displacement discontinuity across fracture surfaces. Continuum-mechanics based models are available in commercial software, such as ABAQUS, and have been used in fracturing simulations, such as the studies by Shen, 2012. These models are facing many difficulties, such as coupling with fluid flow, proppant transportation/settling, and describing the physical interaction behaviors between hydraulically induced fractures and pre-existing natural fractures. Much more effort has been put into discrete fracture models that explicitly describe fracture geometries and displacement discontinuities across fracture surfaces. These models deal with different levels of geometry complexity of fracture propagation and interactions, from bi-wing planar fractures to complex fracture networks in 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional space. To fully describe the physics of the fracturing process, these models are also coupled with rock mechanics and fluid dynamics to model complex fracture propagation, stresses induced by fractures, complex fluid rheology inside fractures, proppant transport, and proppant settling. For fracture propagation and stress analysis in rock formations, many numerical methods have been used, including the Finite Element Method (FEM) coupled with the Cohesive Zone Model (CZM) (Chen, 2009), the extended Finite element Method (XFEM) developed by Moes et al., 1999, the Distinct Element Model (DEM) (Nagel et al., 2011), and the Displacement Discontinuity Method (DDM) by Olson, 2004. Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of computational efficiency and input complexity, such as heterogeneities of rock properties and distribution of pre-existing natural fractures. FEM based models, FEM with CZM, and XFEM, inherit the benefit of traditional FEM. They are flexible to incorporate linear or nonlinear constitutive laws, and heterogeneities of rock properties can also be handled rather easily, but these models might be computationally expensive. DDM has its main advantage in meshing fracture geometry; it is only necessary to mesh the fractures themselves, not the volume around the fractures. So, DDM has high computational efficiency, but it is not easy to include rock heterogeneities in the model.|",,34

This study aims at assessing the influence of cement hardening on deformations and stresses to which the sheath is submitted. A numerical model was developed to simulate the different stages of well construction such as drilling, creep action, casing reconstruction and - the main focus herein -cement hardening. The salt creep behavior was modeled through a new methodology that combines the Double Mechanism with Norton's Power Law. Two stages were considered for the cement. First, the cement was idealized as a fluid with a hydrostatic stress field. During the first five hours after cementation, a decrease in the hydrostatic stress field was employed in order to simulate the autogenous shrinkage, loss of water and static gel strength in the hardening process. When hardened, the cement was considered to behave elastically with an increasing stiffness modulus over time. In the phase change from fluid to solid, special care was given to fitting the cement finite element mesh to the annulus, avoiding mesh overlapping. The new salt creep law showed accurate results when compared to field data. In the hardening process, the annular dimensions reduction was expected and noticed. The deformation rate decreased with the increasing cement stiffness modulus. Most importantly, this deformation was negligible when compared with the dimensions of the well. Moreover, for practical and quick simulations, the hardening step can be avoided. |Introdution |It is unanimous in the scientific community that physical properties of cement sheath are vital for the integrity of the well. Although it confers mechanical support to the casing, its principal function is to provide sealing to gases and liquids through the annular in both long and short-term situations. The integrity is extinct when the sealing property is lost. |It is important to understand what stresses and deformations the well has suffered before the production with the purpose of avoiding accidents. Amongst others, Martins et al., 1997 enunciate that short-term problems have led to financial and natural consequences and numerical analyses have played an important role in this matter. |Numerical simulations have sought to simulate every stage of the well lifespan. Authors such as Bosma et al., 1999 and Gray et al., 2007 have carried out analyses that simulate the drilling, construction and production stages. These works considered an instantaneous cement hardening effect from null to its 28-day stiffness in a single step. Macay and Fontoura, 2014 have presented a similar study considering the increasing effect of cement stiffness through time. Moreover, they present values with a remarkable increase of stresses on the cement sheath over cement hardening. Nonetheless, their results are not compatible with experimental and field data provided by Martins et al., 1997 and Cooke et al., 1982. These results show decreasing stresses on the annulus during the cement hardening due to shrinkage and loss of liquids.|",,26

G., Sandia National Laboratories","|Abstract: |The present study results are focused on laboratory testing of surrogate materials representing Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) waste. The surrogate wastes correspond to a conservative estimate of the containers and transuranic waste materials emplaced at the WIPP. Testing consists of hydrostatic, triaxial, and uniaxial tests performed on surrogate waste recipes based on those previously developed by Hansen et al. (1997). These recipes represent actual waste by weight percent of each constituent and total density. Testing was performed on full-scale and <U+00BC>-scale containers. Axial, lateral, and volumetric strain and axial and lateral stress measurements were made. Unique testing techniques were developed during the course of the experimental program. The first involves the use of a spirometer or precision flow meter to measure sample volumetric strain under the various stress conditions. Since the manner in which the waste containers deformed when compressed was not even, the volumetric and axial strains were used to determine the lateral strains. The second technique involved the development of unique coating procedures that also acted as jackets during hydrostatic, triaxial, and full-scale uniaxial testing; <U+00BC>-scale uniaxial tests were not coated but wrapped with clay to maintain an airtight seal for volumetric strain measurement. During all testing methods, the coatings allowed the use of either a spirometer or precision flow meter to estimate the amount of air driven from the container as it crushed down since the jacket adhered to the container and yet was flexible enough to remain airtight during deformation. |Introduction |The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) is a United States (US) Department of Energy (DOE) mined underground repository; certified by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); and designed for the safe management, storage, and disposal of transuranic (TRU) radioactive waste resulting from the US defense programs. The wastes are emplaced in panels excavated at a depth of 655 m (2,150 ft) in the Permian Salado Formation. Following emplacement of waste and the engineered barrier material MgO, the panels will be isolated from the operational mine using an approved closure system. The repository is linked to the surface by four shafts that ultimately will be decommissioned and sealed. |Performance Assessment (PA) modeling of WIPP performance requires full and accurate understanding of coupled mechanical, hydrological, and geochemical processes and how they evolve through time. The overarching objective of this paper focuses on room closure modeling, specifically the compaction behavior of waste and obtaining a well-designed data set to parameterize an improved waste constitutive model. Ultimately, changes in the room closure model or other elements of the underground evolution will require acceptance by the EPA typically through a peer review process.|",,19

The interdependence of these various factors is complex, and cannot be fully captured by the relatively simple state-of-practice tools employed in investigations of hydraulic fracturing. In this paper, a new approach is presented for fully coupled hydro-mechanical simulation of hydraulic fracture propagation by using three-dimensional Voronoi geometries within the context of Distinct Element formulation. The block boundaries formed by the Voronoi tessellation, provide a random flow pathway for the fluid and the contact breakage due to the increase of the fluid pressure acting on them, replicate the hydraulic fracture propagation. While, the Voronoi approach for hydraulic fracturing simulation has been implemented previously in 2D models, this work puts forward a technique for extension of its application to 3D models. A series of verification tests are performed to investigate the suitability of the proposed approach. Finally, example applications are presented for simulation of single-stage and multi-stage hydraulic fracturing of intact rock by using the 3D Voronoi models at the reservoir scale. |Introduction |The hydraulic fracturing process in Massive Multi-stage Hydraulic Fracturing (MMHF) operations is repeated multiple times in stages along horizontal wells. The hydraulic fracturing process can be simplified into three stages: |Fracture initiation |Fracture growth/mobilization |Proppant injection |A primary goal of most mechanistically-focused models for hydraulic fracturing is to capture the fracture initiation and growth/mobilization of fractures (and the associated changes in matrix stresses and overall reservoir permeability) prior to the injection of proppant. This is both due to the importance of this initial stage as well as the additional complication associated with modelling proppant transport and deposition. |Once a fracture has developed and the fluid volume pumped into this fracture continues to increase, there are several competing factors which determine where the fluid travels and how the energy which is input into the system is re-distributed. These factors include; matrix permeability, rock mass stiffness, fracture toughness and the most important, existing natural fractures.|",,61

Laboratory-scale experiments can also help determine if a numerical model can be used as a predictive tool for hydraulic fracturing analysis. This paper discusses both experimental and numerical modeling performed for a hydraulic fracturing test on a 30<U+00D7>30<U+00D7>45 cm specially designed cement block. The experiment was conducted using a true poly-axial testing system, and was designed to obtain data regarding the behavior of a hydraulically induced fracture and its interaction with a pre-existing fracture. The experimental data can provide insight to better understand the mechanisms of fracture initiation, propagation, and interaction. A computational algorithm was used to perform numerical modeling for the laboratory fracturing test. The computational algorithm tightly couples geomechanics and fluid dynamics models while providing fracture propagation criteria for hydraulically induced fractures. The numerical simulation results are compared in this work to experimental results, illustrating that the numerical model is capable of describing the interaction between pre-existing fractures. It also can help improve the understanding of complex fracture growth in reservoir conditions. |Introduction |Complex fracture geometries are often observed in naturally fractured reservoirs, such as tight gas sandstones and shales. Mineback studies can provide direct evidences of fracture geometries, such as the studies conducted by Warpinski, 1987. But mineback is costly and only viable for shallow depths. Another way to study the complex fracture geometry is through laboratory-scale experimental studies, which can improve understanding of the hydraulic fracturing process under controlled circumstances. |Laboratory-scale experiments have been used to investigate the interaction between hydraulic fractures and pre-existing fractures. Blanton, 1982 shows that the principal stress differential and the approaching angle between hydraulic fractures and natural fractures are key parameters. Beugelsdijk et al., 2000 examined the impact of pre-existing fractures, stress difference, and injection rate on fracture path complexity. These studies mainly focused on the interaction between hydraulically induced fractures and pre-existing natural fractures. The fracture interaction and propagation geometry within pre-existing fractures is still not well studied in laboratory-scale experiments.|",,10

B., Colorado School of Mines| Burkhardt, M., Colorado School of Mines| Asbury, B., Colorado School of Mines","|Abstract: |Although the behavior of chisel picks in soft rock can be understood within classical Evan's model, recent studies have brought its accuracy into question. Previously, researchers had recognized several deficiencies in the model: symmetrical geometry cutting assumptions, inverse proportionality between cutting forces and uniaxial compressive strength, and the cutting force not reducing to zero when the pick angle fell to zero. In this paper we use an artificial neural network framework to develop a model for predicting peak cutting forces in shale. Artificial neural networks are a powerful computational tool which has gained popularity in recent years. Our methodology utilizes physical rock tests and full-scale linear cutting tests conducted at Colorado School of Mines. The linear cutting machine measures full scale cutting forces while cutting actual rock, featuring a large stiff reaction frame on which the cutter is mounted. The metrics from the linear cutting machine include cutter forces, penetration, specific energy, cutting sequence, cutter speed, angle of attack and cutter tilt. The benefits of this work are more efficient designs of excavation machines such as shearers and road headers, and improved prediction of machine performance in weak to medium strength rock such as shale. |Introduction and Background |Pick cutting tools have been found to be superior to disc cutters when applied to soft to medium strength rock (Bilgin et al., 2012). The behavior of chisel picks and point attack picks (conical picks) can be understood within the framework of Evan's theory (Evans, 84), which is often represented as shown in Equation 1. |(equation) |Evan's theoretical model predicts maximum cutting forces assuming tensile failure mode based on symmetrical pick geometry, rock properties and cutting depth. The underlying assumptions are that that the penetration of the pick is smaller than the cutting width and that the resulting tensile crack is circular towards the direction of movement. However the reliability and accuracy of Evan's model for predicting peak cutting forces for conical picks have recently been brought into question (Kuidong et al., 2014). Some of the problems with Evan's model include symmetrical geometry cutting assumptions, the counterintuitive inverse relationship in the model between the cutting forces and the uniaxial compressive strength, and that the cutting force does not reduce to zero when the pick angle (cone angle) falls to zero (Figure 1). Although Roxborough (1978) suggests that Evan's model produces good results where tensile failure occurs; Nishimatsu (1972) has demonstrated instances of shear rock failure for low to medium strength rock.|",,10

A., NIOSH/Spokane Mining Research Division| Swanson, P. L., NIOSH/Spokane Mining Research Division","|Abstract: |Accurate seismic event locations are essential for analysis of mining-induced seismicity. Complexities in the seismic velocity structure around coal mines, particularly changes in velocity caused by the progression of mining, can cause systematic event mislocations. Synthetic event locations simulating the presence of a mining-induced low-velocity zone (LVZ) were compared with locations of seismicity on the second panel in a multi-panel longwall sequence for a deep, western U.S. coal mine. The locations of seismicity migrate away from the workings in a similar manner to the synthetic locations, suggesting an LVZ is influencing the locations. A parametric study using NonLinLoc was conducted to estimate the LVZ around the mine workings. The LVZ was applied in a time-varying manner to evaluate the resulting effects on the event locations. The best model according to travel-time root-mean-square errors and mining information is a model with a 30% velocity decrease extending 200 m into the roof and a 20% decrease extending 50 m into the floor. Relocating the seismic events with this model produces event locations that are more consistent with mining activities. |Introduction |Dynamic rock mass failures, also known as rockbursts or bumps, pose a significant hazard to workers in underground coal mining. Monitoring mining-induced seismicity (MIS) in coal mines may provide useful information for understanding the performance of longwall mine designs, characterizing dynamic rock mass failures, and identifying the roles of geologic structures in the rock mass response. Gaining a better understanding of these factors can aid in the determination of strategies to mitigate the effects of dynamic failures. An important requirement for interpreting MIS in the analysis of mine performance is seismic event locations that are accurate relative to mine workings and geologic structures. Locating MIS associated with underground coal mining is relatively difficult compared to locating seismicity in other environments because of the complexities in the seismic velocity structure associated with shallow depositional environments. The high extraction ratio of longwall mining can also significantly modify the velocity structure as a result of subsequent caving. |Even with dense arrays of sensors, accurately locating coal MIS is difficult without an accurate model to characterize the velocity at which seismic energy travels through the rock mass. The shallow nature of coal MIS (depths generally < 1 km) poses challenges because the first-arriving rays of seismic energy to seismic sensors travel primarily in shallow velocity structure, which is more likely to be highly heterogeneous and anisotropic. The seismic velocity of a rock mass is dependent upon its elastic properties, competence, and stress state (Shearer, 2011). These factors can vary greatly as a function of location, especially in a coal mining environment comprised of sedimentary layers with very distinct properties. The shallow event locations can also be more sensitive to the effects of topography because variations in topography may become large relative to the ray paths. Many location algorithms do not explicitly account for topography, and may determine that the fastest ray path to a station is through a volume of air (e.g., a canyon) where minimal seismic energy actually traverses.|",,23

Different techniques have been utilized in practice to optimize fracking in the last five decades. However, it has some disadvantages including a lack of control over the direction of fracture propagation, the high treatment cost along with environmental issues. Producing multiple fractures by dynamic stimulation techniques seems to be more promising in naturally fractured reservoirs, since it is an effective way for connecting a pre-existing fracture network to a wellbore. In this study, applying high rate loadings we investigate fracturing in rocks due to explosives and propellants as two common methods for dynamic stimulation of a well. An interfacial damage model implemented in a Spacetime Discontinuous Galerkin finite element framework is utilized to simulate fracturing in rocks. A powerful dynamic mesh adaptivity scheme is implemented to track arbitrary crack paths and align them with element boundaries. High explosives produce shockwaves causing extreme compressive stresses, which results in crushing and compacting the rock around the wellbore. Propellants can generate a pressure pulse producing a fracturing behavior that loads the rock in tension. The main advantage of this later approach is to create multiple fractures and consequently prepare the well for an effective hydraulic fracturing with much lower cost as a re-fracturing solution. |Introduction |Stimulation treatments to enhance hydrocarbon recovery from shale and other tight formations as unconventional resources are mainly classified into fracturing based on hydraulic, thermal and dynamic loadings. There is no alternative to fracturing itself, since it is the only way to artificially fissure the source rock to provide sufficient permeability for oil and gas extraction cost-effectively. The technology of hydraulic fracturing which is also called fracking has been widely employed since 1949. It has been very common and popular in oil industry for decades owing to technological advances in practice. Horizontal drilling was a complement to this method since the late 1980. This technique was developed further in 1997 by the use of chemicals known as slickwater fracturing in which slickwater is water mixed with friction-reducing additives. Employing these advances along with the development of multi-well pads have made gas production from shales technically and economically feasible especially in North America in the last decade.|",,40

For carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects, these coupled phenomena determine the interactions between the underground injection of CO2, the geomechanical properties of the reservoir and the stability of existing faults. As a result of the inherent uncertainty that is present in complex geological structures, assessing fault stability and the potential for induced seismicity is a fundamental challenge in any modeling effort for CCS projects. Here we present a formal framework for uncertainty analysis and data assimilation, which relies on a two-way-coupled computational modeling strategy for fluid flow and poromechanics of faults. We first quantify the sensitivity of key earthquake attributes (time of triggering, hypocenter location, and earthquake magnitude) to geologic properties such as rock permeability and coefficient of friction of the fault. We then perform a Bayesian inversion that combines Gaussian Processes with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), from which we determine the posterior distribution of the system parameters. We show that this posterior distribution correctly combines information from the synthetic earthquake observations with a priori knowledge about the unknown parameters. |Introduction |Geologic CO2 sequestration is regarded as a promising technology to prevent rising CO2 concentration in the atmosphere from industrial emissions. While various types of underground geological formations have been considered for permanent storage of supercritical CO2 (IPCC, 2005), deep saline aquifers provide the most attractive option for gigatonne-scale storage, given their capacity and ubiquitous nature (Szulczewski et al., 2012). |A principal concern expressed about the practical implementation of CO2 sequestration in deep geological formations is the difficulty in evaluating potential geomechanical risk and the possibility of generating induced or triggered seismicity through stress perturbations in the underground system (NRC, 2013; Zoback and Gorelick, 2012). Complex computational models that combine multiphase flow and fault poromechanics have been proposed to analyze this type of problems (e.g., Cappa and Rutqvist, 2011; Jha and Juanes, 2014). A fundamental challenge associated to the coupled flow-geomechanics models is the inherent uncertainty associated with model parameters, which stems from the always-difficult description of complex geological structures in the subsurface. In addition, for problems where seismicity could be potentially associated to a CO2 storage project, the problem of data assimilation (i.e., model inversion using the observed seismic data) becomes a challenging task due to the complex characteristics of the seismic waveform signals.|",,57

These include solute transport of nuclear waste repository through rock mass, geothermal energy extraction, fluid injection induced seismicity, injection stimulation of petroleum reservoirs with water that is cooler than the reservoir fluids, and so on. All of these problems involves strong coupling among pressurization and motion of the pore fluid, transport of heat, change of in-situ stresses and deformation of the fracture and the porous matrix. |Since Biot (1941) proposed the theory of poroelasticity for fluid-saturated isothermal porous media, extensive and excellent efforts have been spent to extend the theory to investigate a wide variety of mechanical phenomena. Rice and Cleary (1976) have recast Biot's theory in terms with straightforward physical concepts. A substantial literature exists to extend the well-known isothermal theory to include the thermal effects (Schiffman 1971; Booker and Savvidou 1984, 1985; Kurashige 1989; McTigue 1990).

Due to its low permeability and porosity, hydraulic fracturing has been the leading and productive tool to increase the production in the past decade. Elastic properties of the rock such as Young's Modulus, Poisson's ratio, and Shear modulus is one of the most important parameters which can influence the success of hydraulic fracturing. Thus, accurate and intensive understanding of the elastic properties is essential and compulsory for hydraulic fracturing design. In this paper, we collected samples from three different members (Upper and Lower shale and Middle member) of Bakken Formation. We used 2D XRD to analyze the mineral compositions and FESEM to capture images from the microstructures of the rock samples. Then we used nanoindenter to evaluate the Young's Modulus and Hardness values of the rock, and compared the results. The results showed that the mineral composition varies with the samples through depth. Upper and Lower Bakken shows more content of clay minerals while Middle Bakken incorporates more quartz. From the SEM images, abundant natural fractures can be seen in the Middle Bakken Formation. Finally, it was found that Young's Modulus also varies with the depth and mineralogical and microstructural compositions. |Introduction |After the commercial boom of shale gas and oil in North America, shale reservoir exploration has been widely carried out by many countries. For the unconventional reservoirs, hydraulic fracturing has been a significant development to increase the oil and gas production (Li, 2016). Fracturing not only increases the production but also adds the total reserves 9 billion bbls of oil and more than 700 TSCF of gas has been added to US reserves since 1949 (Carl and Michael, 2010). Many factors can influence the performance of hydraulic fracturing, such as the in-situ stresses, heterogeneities, fractures and pore structures (Kissinger, 2013; Lamont, 1963; Johnson, 1998). Elastic properties such as Young's Modulus is one of the most important parameters that can influence the design of hydraulic fractures (Britt, 2009). Rocks with higher modulus are always easier to be fractured. Conventionally, the industry or researchers either use cores to carry out dynamic and/or static experiments on plugs or use the sonic log to obtain Young's Modulus. (Priyavrat, 2013). Nano-indentation, which measures the applied load with the depth of penetration of an indenter shows promising application to estimate the elastic properties. In petroleum and civil engineering, many researchers have already acquired the nanoindentation method to study the elastic properties of rock particularly those including organic matter (Kumar, 2012; Mason, 2014; Bathija, 2008). We employed nanoindentation analysis to study the samples from the Upper, Middle, and Lower Bakken Formation to better understand the mechanical behavior of this rock unit. Also, this data was integrated with the XRD and SEM results to correlate the elastic parameters with the rock fabric and composition.|",,23

This paper describes the creation of a construction site support system for geological risk, in particular issues related to geological information CIM management system development, system content, and application to actual tunnel and dam excavation projects. |Introduction |In bedrock construction projects such as dams and tunnels, it is important to have a detailed grasp of the geological situation at the project site and to perform planning and construction appropriate to the situation. To that end, geological surveys and geophysical surveys are performed at the investigation and design stages to evaluate geological distribution and engineering characteristics at the planned site, and dam foundations and tunnel falsework are designed based on the results. However, at the investigative and design stages there tend to be cost limits as well as limits to the precision of the above-described geological investigations and geophysical investigations, making it difficult to obtain a detailed understanding of the geological situation over a wide area at this stage. |To address these issues, actual excavation and tunnel faces are evaluated during construction to confirm details of the geological situation directly, and to evaluate any differences from the expected situation. Depending on the results, it is important that additional engineering measures be considered and construction plans and designs reevaluated accordingly. |Against this background, there have been various investigations of a method called “construction information modeling” (CIM) in recent years (Figs. 1 and 2)1). Specifically, the geological situation as predicted from preliminary surveys is represented as a 3D model, and construction planning performed based on detailed verification of the distribution of ground defects so that appropriate measures can be employed. During construction phases, the results of geological observations of tunnel and excavation faces are added to the 3D model, thereby achieving more sophisticated and efficient construction results and aiding in reevaluations of construction plans and designs according to the situation at hand.|",,51

To cope with a range of loading configurations and account for changes in grain size distribution, the Breakage Mechanics theory is used. In addition, the model predictions are linked to a Kozeny equation to evaluate the drop of hydraulic conductivity resulting from the simultaneous loss of porosity and growth of surface area. Compression/flow experiments available in the literature for different granular media are used, with the goal to validate the selected methodology for solids mimicking poorly consolidated reservoir rocks. A good agreement between model predictions and experiments is found, thus stressing the benefits of adopting microstructure-based constitutive laws for hydro-mechanical analyses of coupled geomechanical problems. |Introduction |Fluid flow in reservoir rocks is invariably coupled with processes such as compaction and strain localization. As a result, the interplay between solid matrix and pore-scale flow controls the permeability of rocks under site-specific conditions and it is crucial for the success of any activity involving injection/extraction of fluids (Hettema et al., 2000). In the context of granular rocks, a process likely to affect the success of depletion activities is the production of fines generated by the increase in effective stresses driven by the reduction of fluid pressures. This process is indeed able to induce fracture mechanisms at the scale of the grains, possibly accompanied by cement breakage and particle rearrangement (Fortin et al., 2005). |The variation of rock permeability as a result of loading processes has been widely studied from an experimental standpoint (Zhou and Wong, 1997; Hettema et al., 2000; Ostermeier, 2001), and various efforts have been made to embed porosity-dependent hydrologic properties into flow-deformation analyses of the injection/extraction process (Rutqvist et al., 2002). Few constitutive models, however, are able to take into account the evolution of the microstructure upon inelastic deformation, as well as the impact of changes in specific surface area due to micro-fracture and grain crushing. |Despite this, evidences indicate a significant role of the microstructural attributes on the hydrologic properties of a rock. An example is the permeability of cataclastic fault zones, where the loss of porosity and the increase of surface area due to particle fragmentation promote a substantial drop of permeability compared to the parent rock (Evans et al., 1997). Similar conclusions have been obtained by Zhou and Wong, (1997) who illustrated via laboratory tests the link between decrease of hydraulic conductivity and microstructural damage.|",,58

Y., Korea Institute of Civil Engineering and Building Technology| Yeom, S., Korea Institute of Civil Engineering and Building Technology| Shin, H. S., Korea Institute of Civil Engineering and Building Technology","|Abstract: The main bedrock of Pohang Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) in Korea consists of granite and granodiorite. Anisotropy is often among the important feature of granites, which is represented by three orthogonal cleavage planes frequently called rift, grain and hardway, and they have different physical and mechanical properties. In this study, we investigate the influence of cleavage anisotropy on hydraulic fracturing behavior of granites. A series of hydraulic fracturing tests were performed on granite specimens collected from Pocheon, and cored along the three different directions of cleavages. X-ray CT technique was used to observe the fractures inside the specimens after testing. It is found that under the same conditions, the mean breakdown pressures of fractures occurring along the rift cleavage is around 2 MPa lower compared to the mean value of those happening along the grain plane. This is because the rift plane has the lowest tensile strength. Moreover, fracture roughness analysis shows a small difference between the fractures occurring along the rift and grain cleavages. |Introduction |Geothermal power generation in non-volcanic regions has been increasingly considered since Engineered Geothermal Systems (EGS) was introduced. Though a few commercial EGS power plants are reported to be successful so far, many countries are taking into consideration to include geothermal as one of the key resources for their energy supply policy. In this regard, Korean government has supported the geothermal development and Pohang EGS pilot plant project was initiated in late 2010. The main goal for this project is to demonstrate the EGS power plant in terms of technical feasibility, energy potential, economic viability, etc. |A hydraulic stimulation is a process to secure sufficient permeability for target reservoir formations and technically a key to the success of EGS. Therefore, the proper characterization and good understanding of formation mechanical properties are crucial for the success of EGS. Granites and granodiorite dominate the main bedrock of Pohang EGS project. Granitic rocks are characterized by three cleavage planes normal to each other, and they have different physical and mechanical properties (Dai and Xia, 2013). These cleavage planes are commonly named rift, grain and hardway because the rock mass breaks easily along the first two (Lee et al., 2001). |The physical and mechanical properties of these cleavages have been studied with the aid of different experimental techniques. Properties like porosity, density, permeability, wave velocities, compressive and tensile strength display distinctive values for each plane (Marciniszyn and Sieradzki, 2013; Zhang and Takeda, 2003). The mechanical anisotropy of granites has been attributed to the existence of microcracks along the cleavage planes. It has been noted that the length, preferred alignment, and density of microcracks play important roles in the strength anisotropy (Dai and Xia, 2013). The response behavior of preexisting microcracks in granite is said to be more complex under compression than it is under direct tension (Seo et al., 2002).|",,39

Based on overall Stripping Ratio (OSR) assessments, ore production is decided to proceed by open pit mining to a certain depth and continue with a cut and fill type underground mining operation. A crown pillar is to be designed in the transition region from surface to underground operations. Crown pillar dimensioning effects the overall ore recovery in such small-scale ore bodies. Proper dimensioning has to ensure the stability of open pit mine slopes and underground mine structural units as underground mining progresses to upper levels. Dimensional optimization of the crown pillar is performed by empirical, deterministic and numerical modeling approaches. First, scaled span method was employed to estimate the safe crown pillar thickness providing the required service life. Later, rigid analysis method was used to check shear type failure from the abutments. Finally, 2D finite element modeling analysis was used to ascertain the stable crown pillar thickness. Input parameters of numerical models were produced from geotechnical site investigation work and laboratory experiments. Disturbance effect of surface mine production blasting on the slopes of rock mass above the underground workings was taken into account in deciding on the rock mass properties. |Introduction |Reserve is the economically valuable ore mineralization that is host within the earth crust. Especially in low grade, low profit ores, mining cost outlines the feasibility conditions for reserve extraction. Surface mining is mostly preferred due to low mining cost, ease and speed of production. In spite of its advantages, surface mining may not be feasibly applicable for the complete orebody extraction mainly due to two reasons. |The first reason is the feasible open pit layout. Economic depth of excavation is defined by comparing the Maximum Allowable Stripping Ratio (MASR) (see Eq. (1).) and Overall Stripping Ratio (OSR) (see Eq. (2).). |(equation) |(equation) |where a is surface mining cost per ton of ore, b is overburden stripping cost per m3, c is underground mining cost per ton of ore, V is volume of overburden, and M is weight of orebody.

C., School of Mining Engineering","|Abstract: |The uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) of sedimentary rocks is one of the key parameters in petroleum related geomechanical projects from hydraulic fracturing to the estimation of in-situ stress magnitudes. Due to the scarcity of the rock samples the UCS is often correlated to the interval transient time (equivalent to P-wave velocity) for the field applications, however; the size-dependency of UCS seems to be overlooked in such applications. While the conventional understanding of UCS-size dependency is that the UCS of intact rock decreases with an increase in sample size, recent studies have shown that the UCS increases with an increase in sample size up to a characteristic diameter and then decreases afterward (ascending-descending behavior). Therefore, in this study, a set of uniaxial compressive tests were conducted on shale samples having different diameters. The obtained results were combined with those available in the literature and the Unified Size Effect Law was then fitted to the whole data set. A generalized correlation was proposed for extrapolation of the UCS of rock formations from the USC of rock sample having 25 mm diameter. The calibration of a UCS-interval transient time correlation is also given for the shale sample as a practical example. Finally, it was suggested that the procedure proposed here is adopted as a standard practice in petroleum related geomechanical projects for higher accuracy in design processes. |Introduction |Estimation of the mechanical properties of deep formations, in particular uniaxial compressive strength (UCS), is an essential aspect in petroleum geomechanics engineering from reservoir depletion and hydraulic fracturing to borehole stability and estimation of the magnitude of in-situ stress [1-3]. The direct destructive measurement or so-called static measurement [4, 5] is one of the reliable techniques to estimate the UCS of rock samples. Only a limited number of cores however are usually available for such test. As a result, indirect estimation of UCS by correlating the UCS laboratory measurement to the interval transient time is of great interest [6, 7]. |The limitations of indirect measurements and required modifications such as dispersion correction has been previously discussed to improve the UCS estimations [8]. It appears that the importance of size effects on the static measurement of UCS [9] has not been yet fully appreciated in petroleum geomechanics despite earlier attempts to raise this issue [8]. Size effects in rock engineering have been studied enormously over the last four decades with a common assumption that UCS decreases with an increase in sample size. This has led to the development of a number of descending size effect models based on statistics [9, 10], fracture energy [11] and multifractals [12]. However, it has been shown by Masoumi et al. [13] that the uniaxial compressive strength is not only descending but also ascending (Fig. 1) e.g. the sizes that are commonly used in UCS measurement of core samples in the laboratory.|",,32

These developments have the potential to make downhole photonics a reality. To reach its full potential, there are several challenges to overcome for this technology, ranging from material characterization to the accurate modeling of the underlying electromagnetic-thermal-mechanical dynamics among lasers, rocks and the downhole environment. In this paper we present the first results of our investigation, including analysis of the significant variables and their interdependence. Later we explore the advantages and disadvantages of each method, and show some preliminary results of continuous mechanics modeling of laser-rock interaction. Finally, we posit how all these physical phenomena can be coupled in a comprehensive numerical model. |Introduction |In the first femtoseconds after a laser beam impinges on the surface of a material a series of nanoscopic effects commence and give rise to the absorption, transmission and scattering of the incident rays. If the material is opaque – at the wavelength of the incident radiation – a portion of the absorbed electromagnetic energy transforms into thermal energy. In the next microseconds the material heats up, and a new chain of microscopic events takes place. The material begins to melt, then it disassociates and spalls; finally, it evaporates. Sometimes the thermal energy is large enough to sublimate the material. Through these phase changes the morphology of the material reshapes and its fundamental physical properties vary (see Fig. 1). This ensues in a complex, intense and short-lived dynamic. How to control it remains a hot topic in applied research and engineering with variegated applications; e.g., drilling, perforation, heat treatment, and nano texturing (Gahan et al., 2001; Graves et al., 2002; Batarseh et al., 2004; Lepski and Bruckner, 2009; Batarseh et al., 2012; Assuncao and Williams, 2013; Yang et al., 2015; Sharma et al., 2015; Senesi et al., 2016). |In the case of laser-rock thermodynamic interaction, Gahan et al. (2001) first proposed a direct relation between the volume of rock removed and the energy input (termed specific energy), they used it to predict the depth of a laser perforation in different rock samples. Later, Graves et al.(2002) studied the effect of laser-drilling in the porosity and permeability of rocks and observed that rocks permeability and porosity increased proportionally with thermal conductivity. Later, Batarseh et al. (2004) measured the relation between specific energy, time of laser incidence, thermodynamic phase-change and hole geometry; and showed that rocks melted under laser irradiation had larger specific energies than those that were dissociated. Thereafter, numerous studies have been conducted to observe the effects of laser irradiation on saturated and unsaturated rocks (Ahmadi et al., 2011), formation of stress waves inside the rock (Sakakura et al., 2011), and ejection of rock vapor/plasma plumes and rock dissociation (Yan et al., 2013).|",,57

W., TNO, Earth Environmental and Life Sciences| ter Heege, J. H., TNO, Earth Environmental and Life Sciences","|Abstract: |Subsurface CO2 storage has been identified as one of the key methods to reduce the emission of CO2 to the atmosphere. Remediation or mitigation of unwanted migration from potential storage sites requires novel approaches for which feasibility is yet to be demonstrated. This study focuses on a solution to mitigate CO2 migration through naturally occurring faults, using a polymer-gel to drastically reduce the permeability of the fault. The radius of influence of the polymer injection is extended by using hydraulically stimulated fractures to transport the sealant to the leaking area. Reservoirs eligible for CO2 storage generally exhibit relatively high permeability and consequentially high leak-off of frac fluids. Therefore, the extent of hydraulic fractures is expected to be limited. Faults and fractures may be surrounded by a damaged zone with a permeability that is higher than the reservoir (up to 10 times). Considering the extra permeability of the damaged zone, the surface covered by the sealant may be extended by another 20-40%. Current results shows that this technique is technically feasible (with proper choices of polymer-gel and treatment) to mitigate CO2 leakage through a leaking fault. |Introduction |In the past years, several novel approaches to reduce CO2 emissions in the atmosphere have been proposed by the scientific community. Storing CO2 in the subsurface is considered one of the most promising method to decrease the rate of increasing CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. Injecting and storing CO2 in carefully selected reservoirs has been demonstrated to be applicable and safe, but it is not possible to completely exclude the possibility of unwanted leakage and migration of the stored CO2 towards the surface. To minimize the environmental risk related to subsurface CO2 storage that is a concern to both regulators and the general public, it is necessary to be able to implement a selection of approaches that can prevent, stop or mitigate the unwelcomed flow of CO2 towards the surface. Four main CO2 leakage mechanisms have been identified (Tongwa et al., 2013): leakage via abandoned wells, via natural fractures systems, via reactivated faults or via juxtaposition of the formation where the CO2 is stored against a formation that has high permeability (and lower pore pressure). In case escaping CO2 is detected from the hosting formation, and to decide if a mitigation or remediation technique is needed, it is crucial to evaluate the environmental risks and the economic costs related to the leakage of CO2. Manceau et al., 2014, compiled a list of several mitigation and remediation technologies that can be applied in case of migration of CO2 from geological storage units. Some of these methods are already utilized for real cases of leaking CO2, while some of them are tested only at the laboratory scale.|",,56

The main objective of this study is to develop an approach to conduct triaxial tests on cuttings-size (up to 1-in.) samples, including shales. Triaxial tests were conducted on Mancos Shale and Eagle Ford Shale, after Pore Pressure Transmission (PPT) tests with nanoparticles of different sizes (10, 40 nm), concentrations (3%, 10%), and types (aluminum oxide, magnesium oxide). Because the samples were too short (0.25-in. height x 1-in. diameter) for triaxial testing, special loading cases and innovative calculation methods were developed to generate stress-strain curves. The superior combinations for increasing UCS values are 10% 40-nm Al2O3 for Eagle Ford Shale, and 3% 40-nm MgO for Mancos Shale. Compared to results with 3% KCl, the increase in UCS given by the above combinations of nanoparticles are 31.9% for Eagle Ford Shale and 54.8% for Mancos Shale. The application of appropriate nanoparticles on shales can increase their strengths and reduce the risk of wellbore collapse. |Introduction |Pore Plugging of Shales |For conventional formations, mud cake will be formed during overbalanced drilling. As discussed by Salehi et al., 2015, drilling fluid will penetrate into the formation, whose pores will be plugged by solid particles in the drilling fluids, and create a mud cake to prevent further penetration. However, a mud cake is difficult to form in shale formations because the size of conventional drilling fluid particles is larger than the pore size of shale (Li et al., 2012). This difficulty can cause wellbore stability problems, which sparks in-depth research into the sealing of pores and micro-fractures of shales. |Nanoparticles can be an alternative to seal pores and micro-fractures, considering their sizes are comparable to those of pores in shale formation. However, even though some engineers, including Zhou et al., 2013, Sensoy et al., 2009, Sharma et al., 2012, Jung et al., 2013, Cai et al., 2012, started to apply nanotechnology to drilling mud to address shale instability problems, only limited types of nanoparticles and shales have been tested.

Effects of the far-field confining stress on the elasto-plastic deformation and the potential development of the crack systems in both the loading and unloading phases during indentation are investigated. |Introduction |The stress field resulted from a rigid sphere indenting a semi-infinite domain is of great interest to material testing and mechanical excavation in rocks, for example, drilling for oil and gas exploration and tunneling for infrastructure development. The linear elastic solution for the contact pressure distribution on the surface was initially given by Hertz over a hundred years ago (Hertz, 1881; Hertz, 1882). Though both the stress and displacement fields can be expressed in elementary functions, only a handful references in the literature include the full solutions. Generally, only the contact pressure, displacements and stresses on the surface and/or along the contact axis are given (Timoshenko and Goodier, 1969; Frank and Lawn, 1967; Johnson, 1985). Surprisingly, among those that report the full solutions, they are actually not the same (Huber, 1904; Love, 1929; Zeng et al., 1992; Lawn, 1998; Fischer-Cripps, 2007). |Driven by sheer curiosity, we first reviewed the development of the analytical solution for sphere indentation based on the displacement functions. We then derived the full stress and displacement fields by following the method in Love (1929) and corroborated the derivation by applying the method of superposition directly using the Boussinesq displacement and stress fields as the integral kernels. It should be noted that evaluation of the integrals in this case is not a trial exercise. We verified, to the best of our knowledge, that the internal stress field derived by Love (1929) and reported in Fischer-Cripps (2007) is the correct version. |Next, we developed a numerical scheme that utilizes the Hertzian solution as a far-field asymptotic boundary condition and conducted numerical analysis to investigate the effect of the far-field confining stress on the elasto-plastic deformation and potential development of the crack systems in both the loading and unloading phases during indentation. In normal indentation, the plastic deformation that occurs beneath the tool is contained by the surrounding elastic domain. The nonlocal nature of elastic deformation means that the development of plastic deformation and the subsequent crack initiation and propagation in a numerical model could be sensitive to the boundary condition. Using the Hertzian solution as the asymptotic far-field boundary condition could in fact effectively account for the fact that the domain is semi-infinite.|",,4

Nevertheless, dilatancy, which is indicated as a significant factor in understanding fault mechanisms (Hirata et al., 2014), is not included in this law. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to develop a rational continuum constitutive model for sedimentary rocks based on critical state theory towards the prediction of the healing and decay effects of rock structure on both frictional and dilatancy behavior. The proposed model is validated with experimental slide-hold-slide triaxial tests on soft sedimentary rock and the potential applications of the proposed model in the numerical simulation of faulting are then discussed. The performance of this model is explained in detail through the simulation of isotropic consolidation of sedimentary rock. This research is a contribution towards the simulation of the fluctuation in rock friction while incorporating the dilatancy behavior of rock in the formulation of the model. |Introduction |The Finite Element Method (FEM) simulation of faulting has received an increasing attention in the last fifteen years (Wang, 2001, Zhao, 2004, Hu, 2004, Liu, 2006, Shoubiao, 2013). The accuracy of FEM solution depends on a lot of factors, one of which is the ability of the constitutive model to satisfactory describe the real material's behavior. Therefore, a development of an advanced material model for rock friction is crucial for the study of the faulting's mechanism. |The fluctuation of rock friction has been recognized as one of the major causes in faulting's mechanism (Burridge and Knopoff, 1967). Via extensive study of the friction of rock, (Dieterich,1979 and Ruina, 1983) proposed a famous empirical rate- and state- dependent friction (RSF) law for rock. This law could well describe the variation of rock friction as observed in the slide-hold-slide direct shear test. Since, then a large number of researches related to the earthquake's occurrences were conducted based on this friction law (Stuart, 1995, Dieterich, 1972, Marone, 1998a, Shoubiao, 2013). However, dilatancy behavior, which is believed to be a significant factor in the understanding of fault mechanics (Hirata et. al. 2014), is not considered in this friction law. In case of a negative dilation of saturated rock masses under undrained conditions, due to dilatancy behavior, the pore water pressure will increase and consequently the mean effective stress will decrease. On the other hand, positive dilation under drained condition increases the porosity which leads to the decrease in the stiffness and the peak strength even if the effective confining stress remains constant. In this regard, Rudnicki & Chen, 1988 and Sleep & Blanpied, 1992, Hirata et al.,2014 indicated that the dilation would vary the pore water pressure that can affect earthquake generation, and Samuelson et al., 2009 discussed time-dependent healing of the fault and its effect on the dilatancy behavior.|","Isotropic consolidation test,  Structural healing and decay,  Slide-hold-slide, Sedimentary rock,  Triaxial test,  Dilatancy,  Elastoplastic constitutive equation,  Rate and state dependent friction",22

M., The University of Texas at Austin","|Abstract: |This work describes the development of a fully coupled geomechanics and multiphase flow formulation to model dynamic propagation of injection-induced fractures, in a three dimensional poro-thermo-elastic reservoir domain. A dynamic filtration model for permeability reduction is employed on the fracture to incorporate effects of internal damage and external filter cake build-up due to suspended solids injection. The formulation for arbitrary fracture propagation is based on a finite volume implementation of the cohesive zone model, which is coupled with multiphase flow in the reservoir domain with multiple injection wells and fractures. This is the first instance where a finite volume formulation of multiphase flow in the reservoir has been coupled with induced fracture propagation by plugging of suspended solid particles, in a poro-thermo-elastic domain. |Introduction |Water Injection is a common oil field activity for pressure maintenance, enhanced oil recovery, and produced water reinjection or disposal. Field studies and experimental work have established that poroelastic and thermoelastic effects, coupled with injectivity decline due to plugging and filtration caused by suspended particles in injection water, lead to permeability reduction, fracture initiation and propagation in water injectors (Sharma et al., 2000). Injection induced fracture propagation and stress reorientation is a combination of several near wellbore and field scale phenomena, which are briefly discussed below. |Particle plugging and filtration in injection induced fractures |Particle plugging occurs in two stages, internal and external filtration. After the formation is plugged internally, a filter cake starts building up on the surface of the fracture. A transition time was defined by Pang & Sharma, 1997 after which the injected particles can no longer plug the formation internally and an external filter cake deposition commences. Wennberg and Sharma, 1997 proposed the concept of filtration coefficient, and their implementation improved the predictions of the rate of internal filtration and transition time to external filtration.

However, due to the large number of degrees of freedom in DEM simulations and the requirement of small times steps, the application of DEM simulations to reservoir-scale problems and long-term fluid injection problems is often computationally prohibitive. In order to reduce the computational costs associated with full-scale DEM simulations, an up-scaling method is presented in which Representative Elementary Volume (REV) DEM simulations are used to calibrate the parameters of a Continuum Damage Mechanics (CDM) constitutive model that is then used for Finite Element Analysis (FEA). The CDM model empirically captures the effect of the degradation of the rock integrity due to the yielding and sliding of natural fractures in the rock mass. Up-scaling is achieved through homogenization, in which the spatially averaged stress-strain behavior of various DEM RVE simulations is computed. Subsequently, a CDM constitutive relationship is fitted using the Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm (LMA) and the homogenized DEM simulation data. The CDM model is then used in FEA reservoir scale simulations. The CDM model is implemented in ABAQUSTM and DEM simulations were conducted using UDECTM. The up-scaling methodology is demonstrated through a case study on a naturally fractured carbonate reservoir in which the up-scaled CDM model compares well with a direct numerical simulation with the DEM model but requires an order of magnitude less computational time. |Introduction |Discrete Element Method (DEM) models are used commonly in geomechanics to explicitly model the mechanics of Naturally Fractured Rock (NFR) masses (Jing, 2003). NFR is often modeled as a multiscale material due to the vastly different length scales involved in the deformation process (Zhou et al., 2003). At the fracture scale (10-3 m), the physics is dominated by brittle fracture propagation and fracture-to-fracture contact force interaction, while one is normally interested in the reservoir scale (103 m) response as a result of the spatial extension of the fractures. Because these scales of interest span approximately six orders of magnitude, multiscale methods are required to assess the overall response as modelling with fracture scale resolution at the reservoir scale becomes computationally prohibitive. |DEM models, unlike standard continuum models, consider the fractures within the rock mass as a Discrete Fracture Network (DFN), which explicitly defines the geometry of the fracture network. The physics of block interaction is then governed by the motion, contact forces and traction-separation laws between the rock blocks and the fractures (Cundall and Strack, 1979). Because NFR behavior is complex, even sophisticated phenomenological constitutive relationships may be inadequate to describe the complete rock mass behavior. The DEM approach aims to address this continuum behavioral deficiency by only requiring constitutive relations for the block interactions. (Cundall, 2001).|",,25

The micro-macro relationships established by statistical image analysis also provide the evolution of microstructure descriptors during the test. Simulations show that permeability changes are controlled by changes in crack connectivity, which dominate changes of porosity. The proposed framework is expected to improve the fundamental understanding of coupled processes that govern microstructure changes and subsequent variations of stiffness and permeability in salt rock, which will allow the assessment of the long-term performance of geological storage facilities. |Introduction |The very low permeability of salt rock is its principal advantage for nuclear waste disposals and high-pressure gas storage. During secondary creep, dislocation glide produces isochoric deformation. Geometric incompatibilities between grains result in grain pile-ups, stress concentrations, and crack propagation. The coalescence of cracks can increase permeability by several orders of magnitude, which is very critical to the long-term performance of geological storage facilities in salt. |Many approaches have been proposed to predict the permeability in rocks. A large number of models are based on Kozeny-Carman relationship to link permeability with porosity. However, experimental results indicate that when micro-cracks propagate in salt, permeability increases significantly, whereas the change in porosity is moderate (e.g., Gloyna and Reynolds, 1961; Peach, 1990). Gueguen and Dienes (1989) first introduced the percolation concept and proposed pipe and crack models to estimate permeability in rock materials. A geometrical model based on the Bethe Lattice was then proposed to improve this crack model (Peach and Spiers, 1996). Oda et al. (2002) used a fabric tensor to deduce the variations of the anisotropic permeability tensor during damage propagation in granite. Researchers have also made efforts in incorporating microstructure parameters such as the tortuosity and the specific pore surface area into the classical Kozeny-Carman model (e.g., Chan et al., 2001). However, most of these frameworks do not take into account the evolution of mechanical properties, especially under the coupled influence of damage and healing.|",,57

Conversely, permeability is observed to increase when net stress decreases, however typically follow a different path, this discrepancy is known as hysteresis. The trend of permeability hysteresis is a signature of porous medium that depends on several physical and mechanical properties. Understanding permeability hysteresis plays a significant role in production strategies of hydrocarbon reservoirs. Hysteresis effect on production strategies can be even more important in very low permeability reservoirs such as tight sandstone, tight carbonate, and shale formations. The reason is that permeability hysteresis can affect adsorption/desorption and diffusion transport mechanisms which are among the main driving mechanisms in low or ultra-low permeability reservoirs. |In this study, permeability hysteresis of nano, micro, and milli-Darcy core samples are measured for a wide range of net stress. We also perform cyclic (repeated three times) permeability and porosity measurement during stress loading and stress unloading measurements on three milli-Darcy cores. The nano, micro, and milli-Darcy core samples are from Niobrara outcrop, and Bakken and Middle East oil bearing carbonate reservoir cores, respectively. Our results show that, (a) stress dependency and hysteresis of permeability was observed to be inversely related permeability measured at initial stress conditions; hence, these characteristics are more pronounced on nano-Darcy and micro-Darcy permeability cores; (b) generally, both permeability and porosity decrease with increase in net stress and their hysteresis values are observed to be significant in the first hysteresis cycle; (c) cyclic hysteresis experimental information can be utilized for reservoir management purposes, especially in low and ultra-low permeability reservoirs; and finally, (d) cyclic permeability hysteresis information could also be used in proper designing of multi-stage hydraulic fracture and re-fracturing design of low and ultra-low permeability reservoirs. |Introduction |In the United State, oil and gas production form tight formations are becoming increasingly significant since 2007. This is mainly due to the advancement of multi-stage hydraulic fracture stimulation in horizontal wells. Thorough study can improve the deliverability of such reservoirs. In this study, we will investigate stress dependent permeability and hysteresis of nano, micro, and milli-Darcy permeability cores from Niobrara outcrop, and Three Forks and Middle East oil bearing carbonate reservoir cores. We will also present a cyclic permeability hysteresis during stress loading and unloading cycles. |Understanding of permeability dependency on stress and their hysteresis information values could be used to optimize production of low-permeability formations. For example, the irreversible permeability loss (formation damage) seen as permeability hysteresis during stress unloading could be minimized by early fluid injection (pressure maintenance) to stimulated reservoir volume. Also, this permeability hysteresis information could be used in proper designing of multi-stage hydraulic fracture and re-fracturing design of low-permeability formations.|",,41

Nicolas, The University of Texas at Austin| Torres-Verdin, Carlos, The University of Texas at Austin| Shovkun, Igor, The University of Texas at Austin| Grover, Tarun, Statoil","|Abstract: |Simultaneous ultrasonic wave propagation and triaxial-stress testing are used to investigate the effects of fractures on the dynamic and static mechanical properties of clastic rocks under varying stress loading paths. The first case study explores the influence of pre-existing artificial fractures, while the second investigates the effects of deviatoric stress-induced microfracture development. Experimental results indicate that presence of fractures distinctly decreases wave velocities, with calculated dynamic elastic moduli decreasing by up to 7.5% in artificially fractured sandstone. Fracturing also tends to amplify the stress dependence of wave attenuation and the filtering of high-frequency wave components. Results also show a divergence of shear wave velocities polarized at 90° due to the development of microfracturing well before shear failure under deviatoric loading. This behavior occurs simultaneously with decreases in shear wave velocity and increasing stiffness nonlinearity, and is consistently aligned with the onset of rock dilatancy. Our study highlights the potential for full waveform analysis in sonic wellbore logging for in-situ fracture diagnostics, and the utilization of shear wave anisotropy to characterize rock damage. |Introduction |Oil and gas production from unconventional reservoirs provides new avenues for energy production in the US, accounting for 78.2 Bbls of crude oil, and 949.3 Tcf of natural gas. This equates to roughly 30% and 41% of the technically recoverable oil and gas in the US respectively [1]. Although unconventional formations have become increasingly important for the oil and gas industry, the need for horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing force narrow profit margins, and low oil prices further decrease their financial feasibility. |Core samples from unconventional plays exhibit minimal matrix permeability, however mudrocks are often laden with natural fractures on many scales [2]. Natural fractures not only act as planes of weakness for rock failure, facilitating the branching of hydraulic fractures, but they are also preferential conduits for the flow of hydrocarbons to the wellbore [3]. Because evidence links natural fractures in tight reservoirs to increased production during hydraulic fracturing, gaining insight into the density and spatial distribution of natural fractures prior to hydraulic fracturing is vital for optimizing hydraulic stimulation efforts and maximizing hydrocarbon recovery [4]. |Several methods have been developed for detecting, imaging, and characterizing natural fracture patterns and their relative abundance. Specifically, analysis of rock outcrops, core samples, well imaging and testing (DFIT/LOT), and microseismic data are among the most common, and most useful techniques for estimating the spatial distribution and density of natural fractures in the subsurface [5, 6]. Although each technique provides valuable information, their inherent limitations leave large technological gaps in our ability to utilize natural fractures to guide enhanced stimulation. Tool resolution, sample scale, depth of investigation, and sample disturbance are some limitations to in-situ characterization of natural fractures on micro scales and beyond the wellbore [7, 8, 9].|",,19

In this paper, we will employ a uniaxial compressive strength varying linearly with the aspect ratio of the high-stress zone to determine material failure around an evolving traction-free opening. Under the conditions of given external loads, the stresses around the opening are calculated based on an elastic boundary element method, and they are checked against the uniaxial compressive strength with regard to the occurrence of extensional spalling. Provided that the material failure occurs at test points arranged in multiple layers surrounding the borehole, the breakout front will propagate to these points. The updated opening shape is then remeshed until a stable shape without further material failure is reached. Numerical results demonstrate that the cross-sectional shapes of stable breakouts are obtained for a larger slope of the linear relation between the uniaxial compressive strength and the aspect ratio, but the slot-shaped breakouts are found to continue propagating for smaller slopes. A more complex size-dependent rock strength relationship appears to be in need to capture different stable breakout shapes. |Introduction |Stress-induced breakout, referred to as the cross-section elongation of a circular hole in the direction perpendicular to the maximum principal stress, has been observed in a variety of rocks and stress conditions (Bell & Gough 1979, Dresen et al. 2010, Haimson 2007, Ewy et al. 1990b, Santarelli et al. 1992, Schmitt et al. 2012, Gay 1973, 1976, Guenot 1989, Martini et al. 1997). Depending on rock types, breakout failure micro-mechanisms can be very different, from dilatant microcracking to non-dilatant grain debonding and repacking (Haimson 2007). In brittle solids, breakouts of a tunnel and a borehole drilled can be produced by progressive spalling controlled by the development of a process zone adjacent to the walls of tunnels and boreholes drilled into a rock subject to remote stresses (Zheng et al. 1989). The mean breakout direction of the pointed dog ear shape, which is aligned along the minimum horizontal stress direction determined by hydraulic fracturing, and the breakout depth have been used in estimating regional maximum principal stresses (Zoback et al. 1985). Although many efforts have been made to explore the breakout extension, the understanding is still elusive for stable development of breakout configurations in the presence of very high compressive stress concentration.|","numerical modeling,  borehole breakout,  uniaxial compressive strength (UCS), Size effect",3

Reservoir development often requires many wellbores consisting of several fracture stages. Wellbore and fracture stage placement and orientation are of key importance when planning full reservoir development. Fractures are often induced parallel to one another along a horizontal well oriented in the minimum principal stress direction. Laboratory investigations of fracture spacing and the interaction between two parallel hydraulic fractures were performed. Laboratory hydraulic fracture testing was performed through two parallel wellbores in single-block granite samples with dimensions of 15 <U+00D7> 15 <U+00D7> 25 cm3 while being subjected to true-triaxial stress conditions. Acoustic emissions (AE) were monitored throughout stimulation of both Wells A and B to better understand the extent of microcrack damage induced, coalesced hydraulic fracture orientation, and width of the damage zone. Wellhead pressure, pump pressure, and flow were monitored for each wellbore throughout the fracturing processes. AE density imaging showed progressive fracture growth from an openhole wellbore for each well. Longer-term monitoring of the multi-wellbore system for several weeks revealed AE events residing within the densest regions of microcracks. These events, termed relaxation events, provided a clear map of the hydraulic fracture network and helped shed light on the continuously changing induced fracture networks. Typically, AE monitoring in the field for hydraulic fracture development is used to create a map of induced hydraulic fractures. This map is held constant for future analysis. Results from these laboratory tests show the necessity for continuous monitoring and treatment of the induced hydraulic fracture networks as an evolving system of fractures, particularly when pore fluids are being extracted. |Introduction |Reservoir rock permeability enhancement through hydraulic fracturing is a common practice in oil- and gas-bearing formations, as well as enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) reservoirs. Reservoirs requiring hydraulic fracture stimulation typically have very low permeability and many are naturally fractured and heterogeneous in composition and stress. Introducing hydraulic fractures in a dense naturally fractured reservoir serves to connect the natural network to the wellbore and expose new reservoir material to allow flow from micro and nano pores. With the past implementation of horizontal drilling, many hydraulic fractures are now able to be performed along a single wellbore. The spacing between these fracture stages varies wildly in industry, from the order of tens of meters to hundreds of meters. In many cases, iso-spacing of fracture stages irrespective of material properties or well log measurements is performed. |Performing multiple fracture stages along a horizontal wellbore in a naturally fractured network introduces multiple complexities in terms of understanding the wellbore connected network. These include the effects of fracture dimension alteration and stress shadowing effects on induced fracture directions, and the opening/closure of existing natural fractures.

Optimizing the hydraulic fracture design and completion strategy requires an optimized reservoir characterization based on specific petrophysical and geomechanical evaluation. The reservoir characterization integrates reservoir quality (RQ) and completion quality (CQ) logs to derive a completion quality index (CQI). The CQI is used to define the best cluster position and stimulation strategy. This design is then simulated in unconventional hydraulic stimulation software to evaluate the fracture behavior. A 1D anisotropic geomechanical model was performed based on well logs, updated with a suite of mechanical core tests, and finally, calibrated with the pressure interpretation of a mini fall off test on the first fracture stage. The results demonstrate the impact of a proper characterization of the CQI based on an integrated anisotropic geomechanical model calibrated with core data of the Vaca Muerta formation improves the development of a completion strategy, which ultimately optimizes economic performance of the well. |Introduction |The Vaca Muerta formation is the most prolific source rock of the Neuquen basin (Legarreta and Villar, 2011). Due to its characteristics (Leanza et al., 2011), it is also the main shale oil and gas reservoir of Argentina (Lanusse et al., 2012; Askenazi et al., 2013; Garcia et al., 2013). The hosted hydrocarbon producible from this source rock is only achievable via hydraulic stimulation to generate fracture conductivity connecting to the wellbore (Ejofodomi et al., 2013). To optimize the hydraulic fracture design, a complete centric well reservoir characterization is needed. Due to the lack of core data, 1D isotropic geomechanical models are normally poorly calibrated using the drilling reports and image logs based on a widely used Mohr-Coulomb failure analysis. These kinds of models still have considerable uncertainty for fracture design requirements. The elastic and rock strength parameters of these models could be directly calibrated with laboratory tests. A complete set of mechanical rock tests was performed to better characterize the anisotropic mechanical properties of this well and improve the completion quality. The second aspect to characterize is the reservoir quality. This comes from the integration of petrophysical data from log and core measurements.|",,12

L., University of Pretoria","|Abstract: |The paper describes a method to determine the extent of the fracture zone near the edges of tabular excavation layouts. The problem is expressed as the solution to a non-linear eikonal equation which is solved using a fast marching method applied to the vertices of square displacement discontinuity elements which are used to represent the mining layout and the crush zone region. An outline is given of the sensitivity of the method to the choice of key strength parameters. The extension of the algorithm to simulate time-dependent deformation effects is described. The numerical scheme is illustrated by considering the extraction of a hypothetical deep-level longwall layout comprising four advancing panels. The sensitivity of the results to changes in the mining rate schedule is considered and extensions of the method are noted. |Introduction |The planning of tabular mining extraction sequences requires an efficient strategy to assess the effect of mining rate changes and to evaluate the impact of the mining layout geometry on the evolving excavation stability. The incremental mining of the excavation edges is sensitive to both the regional configuration of previously mined areas and the local stress distribution in the vicinity of currently active mining faces. A useful numerical technique that has been employed for many years to analyze tabular mining problems is the displacement discontinuity boundary element method (DDM) which allows the representation of complicated layout configurations in planar reef or seam deposits, [1]. One significant difficulty that is encountered in the application of this technique is the problem of representing local failure processes that arise near excavation edges. Recent investigations [2] suggest that a simple limit equilibrium model can be used to represent time-dependent failure in the rock fracture zone near the excavation edges. In this model the rock failure potential ahead of the excavation edge is dependent on the buildup of the confining stress from the edge to the point of interest. Previous investigations [2] have examined the implications of the model in plane strain. The present paper extends this approach to consider a general planar mining layout embedded in three-dimensional space. The confining stress solution parallel to the excavation plane is defined by a non-linear eikonal equation and the approximate solution is found using the so-called “fast marching” method [3]. Some parameter sensitivities of the model are discussed and the technique is illustrated using simple representative tabular layouts.|",,0

An implication of this observation is that kerogen can have non-negligible or very significant effects on initiation, opening or propagation of fractures and sustainability of fracture opening in kerogen-rich unconventional reservoir formations. In this paper, the nanoindentation testing of a micro-cantilever beam milled from kerogen-rich shale (KRS) and subsequent extraction of kerogen's tensile mechanical behavior through numerical modeling is briefly reviewed. A simple well injection model is formulated, verified in a continuum mechanics model then built to simulate the opening of a fracture in a kerogen-rich formation. The extra fluid volume and energy due to the presence of kerogen that are required to open a micro-fracture are calculated in the simulation. |Introduction |Determination and understanding of the mechanical properties and behavior of rocks are crucial for subsurface engineering design and operations. In the oil/gas industry, for example, rock stiffness properties are required parameters in reservoir compaction analysis; cohesive strength and internal frictional angle need to be known in the design of drilling mud; the tensile strength of rock is a necessary parameter in the design of hydraulic fracturing schemes. |Shales are the most common sedimentary rocks, i.e., around half of sedimentary rocks on earth are shales. For conventional reservoirs, most overburden and seal rocks are shales. For unconventional reservoirs, shales are also the source rocks in addition to serving as overburden and seal layers. So understanding the mechanical properties and behavior of shales are important in drilling, completion, production or stimulation for almost all oil and gas wells. |Conventionally, cohesive strength and frictional angle of geological materials are indirectly measured by performing confined compression tests on cylindrical core samples in a rock mechanics lab. The tensile strength can be measured directly in a direct tensile test, but more often using the Brazilian test in which the tensile strength is determined through crushing a rock disk (Goodman, 1989). However, both compression and tensile tests require inch-sized cylindrical cores or discs, but these types of cores are usually not available, especially for the overburden and seal rocks.|",,47

A., Missouri University of Science and Technology| Nygaard, R., Missouri University of Science and Technology","|Abstract: |Wellbore instability problems are the cause for the majority of nonproductive time in the southern Iraqi field developments. These drilling difficulties pose potential problems such as mud losses in weak or vugular formations, stuck pipe in shales or unconsolidated formations. This paper focuses on the most severe problem in terms of effort and disbursement which is referred to pipe sticking in Tanuma shale formation. Examining the drilling data revealed that this phenomenon was mostly related to shear failure of the wellbore, which caused an immediate increase in the stand pipe pressure with no drilling fluid returns when circulating. In this regard, a geomechanical analysis for southern Iraqi field was performed on field data from 45 deviated. The analysis identified the following areas of improvement. First, the mud weight being used was not changed properly with respect to variation in wells azimuth and inclination. Secondly, anisotropic effects of this shale formation caused by the bedding planes should be considered in wells trajectory design. Due to the lack of published studies regarding wellbore problems in southern Iraqi fields, this paper could serve as case history for similar fields in that region. |Introduction |Numerous borehole instabilities were observed in the drilling operations of deviated wells through shaly formations in southern Iraqi oil and gas fields. These problems usually escalate during increased inclination of the wells, resulting in significant nonproductive time. Drilling data from various deviated wells designed to drill the productive interval of limestone (Mishrif formation) in different inclinations and azimuths from different slots is shown in Figure 1. Various problems have been occurred; varying from, stuck pipe, mud losses, sulfurous water flowing, hole tightening, and extensive caving. The stuck pipe problems caused wells to be drilled with more than one side tracks or loss of the hole in worst case. Whereas other problems could considerably increase the nonproductive time or well control issues for severe mud losses. Therefore, the diagnosis of the root cause of borehole failure is a necessary procedure in the well constructing and planning phase. Another possible type of problem is the collapse failure of the borehole which happens when the formation around the vicinity of the wellbore wall fails due to either shear or tensile failure (Fjaer, 2008). Consequently, the wellbore will be tightened or packed off if the drilling cuttings are inadequately transported out of the hole (due to insufficient mud properties, flow rate or string rotation). Additionally, the stuck pipe may occur when the plastic region around the borehole is unexpectedly yielded in the case of insufficiently supported by the borehole pressure (Tare et al., 2002). However, if the drilling fluid density is greater than the weakest formation fracture gradient then the drilling fluid will be lost, and fracture treatments should be performed. Besides, the high difference between wellbore pressure and formation pressure could lead to differential sticking incidents. Pipe sticking is the most severe problem with the majority of the nonproductive time. Borehole shear failure could be one of the potential reasons for this drilling instability. |This paper will focus on the geomechanical analysis of wellbore instabilities of the Tanuma shale in southern Iraqi fields. The study aims to address the minimum required mud weight in order to prevent the onset of shear failure wellbore for different well paths.|",,7

In some districts, these lower grade ores remain around historic underground workings. Mining through historic underground workings, which often occur as voids, is a challenging and comprehensive process. Historic underground mines can be mapped using old survey data and recent prove drilling data to verify the actual location and condition of the voids. Void zones, and other hazardous areas, need to be clearly designated both on mining equipment digital displays and visually in the field for ground personnel and as a redundancy for equipment operators. Working plans need to be documented and communicated to ensure that operations personnel can safely and effectively complete tasks in and around void zones. Open voids can be mapped using borehole cameras and scanning equipment to determine their conditions, spatial location, and size for safe, efficient mining and effective designation of void zones and other hazardous areas. Voids are then remediated by either being backfilled with sand/gravel through prove drilling bore holes or collapse-blasted to allow mining to progress safely through the void areas. Un-manned equipment can be used to make working in and around void areas safe. All of these tasks must be completed in a safe and economical manner. |Background Newmont's Phoenix mine located in northern Nevada, USA is currently being mined as an open pit mine in the Fortitude and Bonanza Pits. A portion of the ore bodies targeted by these pits was mined previously by underground mining methods, dating back to the mid to late 1800's. Most of the underground workings (voids) are located in the west central area of the Bonanza Pit.

In order to revise the method of stress determination, a thermo-poroelastic model was set up which took into consideration wellbore temperature variation because of drilling fluid circulation, the maximum principle stress magnitude had an upper and lower bound according to wellbore failure, meanwhile DIFs occurrence time was also a factor for stress calculation, so a series of charts including minimum effective tangential stress and damage coefficient were built to determine in-situ stress. It is stated that thermo-poroelastic model can explain wellbore failure and determine in-situ stress states comparing to elastic theory more properly. The research provides a theoretical method for determining in-situ stress by FMI plot especially for high temperature and low permeability wells. |Introduction |In-situ stresses are primary parameters for analyzing wellbore stability, sand controlling and hydraulic fracture, but it is not easy to determine in-situ stresses underground until now. Mini-frac and leak off tests can measure field stress directly, but this measurement has to be conducted at a specific depth and only the minimum horizontal principal stress (<U+03C3>h) can be determined by this way. The continuous stress magnitude along the well has to be accessed by means of wireline logging and Formation MicroScanner Imager (FMI) logging. Wellbore breakouts and drilling induced tensile fractures (DIFs) are two kinds of typical wall failure which can be identified by FMI, wellbore breakouts direction is aligned with <U+03C3>h direction while DIFs direction is aligned with <U+03C3>H for vertical well, these two kinds of failure have been used widely to estimate in-situ stress orientation and magnitude. Zoback built a polygon model to estimate stress states base on Coulomb faulting theory and Anderson's stress and faulting classification system (Zoback et al. 2003). Analytical solutions(Zoback et al. 1985) were set up to calculate maximum horizontal stress magnitude depending on wellbore breakout depth and opening angel. In order to increase stress calculation accuracy, rock anisotropy was taken into consideration further(Lee et al. 2013), Walton set up a two-dimensional numerical stress model for hard rock (Walton et al. 2015), on the other hand, drilling induced tensile wall fractures were used to be implication to determine the lower bound of <U+03C3>H (Brudy and Zoback 1999; Berard and Cornet 2003). These models are nearly base on pure elastic theory while determining stress upper and lower bounds. |Low-permeability sand rock is porous material and formation temperature variety can change pore pressure and near wellbore stresses distribution which are important for analyzing wellbore stability. Pore pressure, temperature and stresses couple each other, so several control equations are set up to solve the thermo-poroelastic problem, then in-situ stresses can be back calculated on the basis of wellbore instability condition by comparing effective stresses to strength and tensile failure criteria.|",,36

In an attempt to understand hydraulic fracture in the field, and provide laboratory flow results for model verification, an effort to duplicate the typical fracture pattern for long horizontal wells has been made. The typical “disks on a string” fracture formation is caused by properly orienting the long horizontal well such that it is parallel to the minimum principal stress direction, then fracturing the rock. In order to replicate this feature in the laboratory with a traditional cylindrical specimen the test must be performed under extensile stress conditions and the specimen must have been cored parallel to bedding in order to avoid failure along a bedding plane, and replicate bedding orientation in the field. Testing has shown that it is possible to form failure features of this type in the laboratory. A novel method for jacketing is employed to allow fluid to flow out of the fracture and leave the specimen without risking the integrity of the jacket; this allows proppant to be injected into the fracture, simulating loss of fracturing fluids to the formation, and allowing a solid proppant pack to be developed. |Introduction |The decrease in the price of oil increases the need for more efficient extraction of oil and gas from source rocks exploited by hydraulic fracturing.

This means that research into efficient extraction of oil and gas is more important than ever. |To this end, Sandia has endeavored to replicate aspects of in situ hydrofracturing in the lab, and prop said fractures.

This data is then used to inform flow simulations, which will then be used to understand relationships between injection parameters, proppant placement and fracture conductivity; thereby more effectively predicting proppant location in a fracture. This paper focuses on the methodology for generating and propping properly oriented fractures which are clearly visible using micro computed tomography (<U+03BC>CT). The modeling efforts will be presented separately in a future publication. |Background |Generation of hydraulic fractures is not a new concept; the mechanics of hydraulic fracturing were described by Hubbert and Willis in 1957. Since then hydraulic fracturing has been used in determining in-situ stress conditions from borehole fracturing (ex. Kehle 1964, Haimson and Fairhurst 1969). Laboratory scale hydraulic fracture experiments have been taking place since the 1960s or earlier (ex. Pegler 1967, Zoback et al. 1977, Warpinski et al. 1982). These early studies focused on measuring the minimum principal stress magnitude and direction in the earth using hydraulic fracturing (ex. Kehle 1964, Haimson and Fairhurst 1969). Subsequently the interest shifted to transmission of fluids in the subsurface, and the interaction of hydraulic and natural fractures (ex. Zoback et al. 1977). Since then the focus has been on interaction with natural fractures, generation of fluid flow paths, and recently propping of hydraulic fractures (Wen et al. 2006, Fredd et al. 2000, Alramahi and Sundberg 2012). However, recent work has moved away from laboratory testing under in situ conditions towards validation of numerical simulations, which have so far focused on simplified geometry like flow between parallel plates (e.g. Morris and Chugunov, 2014, Lane and Thompson, 2010). This is because it has been shown that fractures can be generated, and proppant can be pumped into the fracture, but fracture geometry is usually simplified.|",,57

H., Ben Gurion University of the Negev| Feinstein, S., Ben Gurion University of the Negev| Vinegar, H. J., Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Israel Energy Initiatives (IEI Ltd.)","|Abstract: |We investigated the rock physics of immature organic-rich chalk from the Late Cretaceous Ghareb and Mishash formations in the Shefela basin, central Israel, and its variation upon pyrolysis-induced maturation. The study was carried out on core samples from a ~280 meters sequence of immature organic-rich chalk in the Zoharim well. We measured acoustic velocities using water-saturated core plugs in the bedding-normal direction, under simulated field pressures. Porosity and density data were obtained for oven-dried core plugs using nitrogen gas. Results measured for the immature chalk were compared with properties obtained at two different induced maturity levels: early-mature and over-mature. In the early-mature stage, where bitumen filled the newly generated and some of the pre-existing pore space, we observed an increase in S wave velocity by ~11%, and a slight decrease of P wave velocity, which was identical to the decrease in porosity and density. In the over-mature stage, where the pore space increased by ~29%, and the solid skeleton included kerogen residue and unaltered minerals, S wave velocity increased by ~19% and P wave velocity decreased by ~16%. We concluded that the kerogen experiences stiffening upon thermal maturation that results in faster shear waves. P wave velocity decreased upon maturation due to significant porosity enhancement. P wave - S wave velocities ratio (Vp/Vs) starts at ~2.2 in the immature stage, then reduces to ~2 in the early-mature stage, and further down to ~1.6 in the over-mature stage. |Introduction |Organic-rich sediments are widely known as source rocks due to their high potential within the organic matter to produce oil and gas. These rocks are typically fine-grained sediments that include organic matter in solid and fluid states. Kerogen is solid, and is the most abundant organic phase in thermally immature source rocks. The physical properties of source rocks are strongly influenced by kerogen properties such as density, chemical composition, elastic moduli and acoustic velocities. Thermal maturation causes significant changes in kerogen properties and thus in the entire rock properties. The dynamics of source rocks during thermal maturation is complex due to interaction of processes within the organic matter and field conditions (e.g. stress field, pore pressure, host rock properties, temperature). In addition to the importance for conventional oil systems, advanced technologies allows now to produce oil and gas from immature source rocks via in situ methods for inducing maturation. These aspects, among others, motivate the study of rock physics of organic-rich rocks and its variation upon maturation.|",,23

The movement and deformation of those embedded carbonate or anhydrite bodies is a process which is not fully understand yet. We presented numerical models of the deformation of salt body with embedded stringers using a case study from the South Oman Salt Basin. We investigated by Abaqus package (finite element models) how differential displacement of the top salt surface induces salt flow and the associated deformation of brittle stringers (including both brittle and viscous material properties) in a compressive environment. The simplified model offers a practical method to investigate complex stringer motion and deformation. Models suggest that brittle stringers can break very soon after the onset of salt tectonics. The compression can make brittle stringer bending and thrusting. Models suggest that viscous stringers have folding and extension deformation. Results also show the internal structure of salt body and stringer fracturing or deformation is strongly dominated by the geometry or material properties of models. |Introduction |Large rock inclusions are embedded in many salt bodies and these inclusions have different ways of deformation and displacement. The process of salt tectonics has a strong impact on the deformations of the inclusions and there are different typical deformation styles such as displacement, folding, fracture and thrusting. It is of great importance to understand the deformation and displacement of inclusions because of some critical reasons (Li et al., 2012). In the past 30 years, a large number of numerical studies about the deformation of salt structures have been performed (Woidt and Neugebauer, 1980; Last, 1988; Schultz-Ela et al., 1993; Podladchikov, 1993; Poliakov et al., 1993; Van Keken et al., 1993; Daudre and Cloetingh, 1994; Koyi, 1996; Koyi, 1998; Kaus and Podladchikov, 2001; Ismail-Zadeh et al., 2001; Schultz-Ela and Walsh, 2002; Gemmer et al., 2004; Ings and Beaumont, 2010; Fuchs et al., 2011; Abe and Urai, 2012). A few numerical studies have been done regarding the deformation and displacement of inclusions embedded in salt as relatively homogeneous material. Koyi, (2001) and Chemia et al. (2008, 2009) modeled the whole range of the process. Koyi (2001) used physical models and Chemia et al. (2008, 2009) used numerical models to study the whole process of entrainment of anhydrite blocks by a salt structure and their later descent within the structure. Koyi (2001) also used numerical models to quantify the descent rate of entrained anhydrite blocks within a salt diapir. Chemia et al. (2008), Chemia and Koyi (2008) and Chemia et al. (2009) systematically studied the effects of viscosity (Newtonian and non-linear), position of the anhydrite layer, and different rising rate of salt diapirs in connection to entrainment and descent of anhydrite layers/blocks within a salt structure.

Limited availability of core material severely restricts design of a comprehensive geomechanics test program. Sidewall core plugs, although easier to obtain than conventional cores, suffer from being short relative to the length to diameter ratio specified by ASTM. This paper presents a solution to overcome size issues related via measuring ultrasonic velocity on sidewall core plugs at various stress paths. A unique experimental setup allows measurement of ultrasonic velocity both parallel and perpendicular to bedding. The results were then compared with velocity measurements obtained from sonic logs. It was observed that velocity measured within an isostatic stress path provides the closest match to log velocities, thus increasing confidence in dynamic geomechanics measurements on sidewall plugs and allowing geoscientists and engineers with low budgets to conduct more comprehensive geomechanics analyses. |Introduction |The value of laboratory testing to enhance our understanding of subsurface geomechanical properties to better explore and exploit a hydrocarbon reservoir is well known (Plumb et al., 2000; Cook et al., 2007). Important parameters that provide baseline information for constructing a geomechanical model of the subsurface include the in situ stress state, strength properties, and stress-strain behavior (Zoback, 2007). Among these parameters, strength and stress-strain behavior can be measured in the laboratory whereas in situ stress can be estimated via a combination of well logs, laboratory and field measurement (Thomsen, 1986; Thiercelin and Plumb, 1994). Thus it is imperative to have good quality laboratory data since that would in turn improve estimation of in situ stress state (Higgins, 2006) and help geoscientists solve wellbore stability issues and hydraulic fracture design. In this direction, ASTM and ISRM provided enormous assistance via creating standard protocols on how to conduct a test in the laboratory. |According to ASTM, core plugs used to estimate stress-strain behavior of rock should have a length to diameter ratio of 2 to 1. The process of acquiring and storing cores is a costly operation and lack of core material constrains laboratory testing and generation of geomechanical parameters. Sidewall cores, acquired by attachments to wireline logging tools provide a cost effective alternative as they can be (a) acquired relatively quickly and (b) can be acquired when there is a failure to collect core by conventional coring techniques (Agarwal et al, 2014). However, samples with a length to diameter ratio of less than 2 to 1 are less suitable for laboratory testing. We report a solution to issues related to shorter core plugs during geomechanics testing. In this paper, ultrasonic velocity was measured on sidewall core plugs through various stress paths. A unique experimental setup allows measurement of ultrasonic velocity both parallel and perpendicular to bedding. The results are then compared with velocity measurements obtained from sonic logs. It is observed that velocity measured within an isostatic stress path provides the closest match to log velocities in most of the samples. The velocities obtained throughout various stress paths were compared and efforts were made to address the discrepancies between them.|",,35

515,516,2016-061,Theoretical Development on Morphology of Wellbore Toroidal Breakout,"Oyedokun, Oluwafemi, Texas A&M University| Schubert, Jerome, Texas A&M University","|Abstract: |Few researchers have conducted experimental investigations on the occurrence of wellbore toroidal breakout; also this breakout mode has been observed in the field. Unfortunately, there is no published theoretical study that adequately describes the occurrence of this unique feature. Thus, we have developed a theory that answers some of the questions related to the occurrence of wellbore toroidal breakout: (a). is the failure mode toroidal? (b). is the deepest depth for a homogeneous and isotropic formation at the center? (c). location of the deepest depth for a heterogeneous formation? To consider the impacts of support pressure on the breakout pattern, the two failure modes were considered, namely: shear fracture and extensile-splitting induced breakouts. Minimum strain energy criterion was used in determining the direction of the propagating extensile cracks; and the trajectories of the cracks were tracked with Fourier series of piece-wise linear functions. In the numerical experiments conducted, it was observed that the extensile cracks propagated in the r-z plane through mode II (shear) predominantly, and by mode I in the r - <U+03B8> plane. By rotating the cracks profile in the r-z plane through the vertical axis by the breakout width, the breakout volume can be approximately determined; the volume generated by this rotation is usually greater than the actual volume. |Introduction |Extensive studies have been conducted on type- A breakout (Figs.1a and 1b); the breakout mode is primarily controlled by the tangential stress around the wellbore. Bell and Gough (1982) predicted that breakouts are spalled regions around the wellbore and the deepest depth align with the direction of the minimum horizontal in-situ stress; they envisioned a dog-eared breakout shape. Ewy and Cook (1990), Martin et al. (1994), Ewy et al. (1988) conducted laboratory experiments to confirm Bell and Gough's hypothesis. The triangular breakout section is often observed in some brittle geomaterials, like granite. |But generally, the breakout shapes are flat-bottomed and broad (Zoback et al. 1985); these authors assumed that the breakout shape follows the potential shear failure lines and confirmed their theory with some field observations. Similarly, Kulandar and Dean (1985) and Pollard and Aydin (1988) also supported the curvy nature of the failure surface around the borehole through some observed experiments. Other notable laboratory experiments and field observations that support the curved failure surfaces include the works of Cuss et al. 2003, Stacey and Jongh (1978), and Ortlepp (1978); there are other references that support this hypothesis, which we have not mentioned.|",,54

Cold water is injected into hot rocks to enhance reservoir permeability. During injection, pore pressure, temperature and the stress field in the reservoir change significantly. Most geothermal reservoirs are to some extent naturally fractured at various scales. Fractures could dilate and slip in shear possibly and propagate as a result of stress changes, increasing reservoir permeability. The objective of this work is to analyze the response of naturally fractured reservoirs to water injection. A fully-coupled thermo-poromechanical finite element model is developed and used to describe the interaction between fluid flow, rock deformation, and heat transfer within the reservoir. A fracture network model is generated based on field data and introduced to the coupled model. The model is used to simulate and analyze reservoir stimulation in the Newberry EGS Demonstration. In particular, the Phase 2.2 stimulation is modeled using field data on the fracture network, in-situ stress and lab data on rock and fracture properties. The simulated injection profile, evolution of permeability and induced micro-seismic events agree with field observations. Simulation results show that injection induced stress state change occur around the injection well which plays a critical role in many aspects of field development. |Introduction |Geothermal energy production from enhanced geothermal system (EGS) requires successfully stimulated a reservoir by cold water injection. During stimulation, large volumes of water are injected into low permeable hot formations to enhance reservoir permeability and to create fluid pathways for water circulation. Most geothermal reservoirs have some natural fractures, with discontinuities such as faults and joints occurring at various scales. A stimulation job usually intends to connect natural fractures to create a permeable zone. Natural fractures are usually stress sensitive, and they deform and slip/open due to injection induced stress changes. As fluid injection reduces the effective normal stress acting on the fracture, fracture aperture increases and reservoir permeability is increased. When the shear strength is exceeded, fractures could slip in shear. Shear slippage induces dilated aperture and can cause fracture extension, and the hydraulic conductivities of the reservoir will be further enhanced. |To simulate the response of an EGS to injection, two models are required: a 3D coupled thermal-poromechanical model describing the coupling between rock deformation, fluid flow and heat flow, and a fracture network model describing the fracture geometry and fluid transport within the fractures. One could use a boundary element method (BEM) (e.g., Safari and Ghassemi, 2015) or a finite element method (FEM) (e.g., Wang and Ghassemi, 2011, 2012 and 2013). A finite element approach is used in this work. The fracture network is generated based on field data and is introduced to a coupled THM model. The equivalent permeability concept used in Wan and Ghassemi (2011, 2013) approach is used to estimate the overall permeability of the fractured medium. The simulation outcome, spatial distribution of pressure changes, permeability evolution and injection induced microseismicity can be used to evaluate the stimulation process and to calibrate the simulation model.|",,32

Previously, mechanical properties of anisotropic rocks were obtained by numerous tests on specimens sampled to different orientations but it was rather costly and time consuming. Thus, it is necessary to obtain the constitutive parameters of anisotropic rocks by fewer tests. In addition, stresses and strains of anisotropic materials often non-coaxial, then, the specimens often do not deform axisymmetrically during triaxial compression. The boundary condition appropriate for the deformation properties should be needed to determine true constitutive responses because stresses and strains in the specimen may be non-uniformly distributed due to non-axisymmetric deformations. In this study, a new triaxial test with simple improvement of caps which provide uniform deformations of non-axisymmetrical specimens was developed. Then, a method of determining transversely isotropic elasticity by the triaxial test with single specimen was proposed based on the test results calculated by the constitutive low. |Introduction |It is important to identify mechanical properties of anisotropic rocks. Sedimentary rocks sampled in Utsunomiya region show approximately 2 times difference of Young's moduli due to sampling orientations (Oka et al., 2002). Sand stones also show 2.1 times difference of the moduli (Amadei, 1995). Previously, mechanical properties of anisotropic rocks were obtained by numerous tests on specimens sampled to different orientations as shown in Fig. 1, but it was rather costly and time consuming. Thus, it is strongly needed to obtain the constitutive parameters of anisotropic rocks by fewer tests. In addition, stresses and strains of anisotropic materials often not-coaxial, then, the specimen often deform not-axisymmetrically during triaxial compression as shown in Fig. 2. This figure shows both the stress conditions and deformations during triaxial test in different boundary conditions. Fig. 2 (a) shows the condition, in which the top and bottom of the specimen form smooth boundaries with no friction, and the axial loading direction coincides with the principal stress axis. Fig. 2 (b) shows another condition in which the top and bottom of the specimen are perfectly fixed and the direction of principal strain coincides with the axial loading direction at the top and bottom boundaries. The figure compares isotropic and transversely isotropic rocks. The isotropic rock is axisymmetrically deformed in both conditions (a) and (b). On the other hand, while the stresses and strains in a transversely isotropic rock are uniform, non-axisymmetric deformations are exhibited because the directions of principal strains are inclined with respect to the shear direction in case (a). In case (b), the stresses and strains become non-uniform because the directions of principal strains coincide with the axial loading direction at both the top and bottom of the specimen, whereas those of the principal stresses coincide with the cell pressure direction on the side of specimen. Thus, in a triaxial test for anisotropic rocks, shear stresses are mobilized on the top and bottom, and the specimen does not deform axisymmetrically. As comparing the condition (a) and (b), (a) is suitable for determining constitutive parameters of anisotropic material strictly, and the devices that implement the condition (a) should be installed on both the top and bottom of cylindrical specimen.|",,20

Many studies have been undertaken using frozen rocks to understand the mechanical and physical properties as well as their degradation mechanisms. However, the existing researches on the real-time dynamic damage process of frozen rocks are very limited, so that the damage mechanisms of frozen rock under compressive loading condition remain unknown. In this study, acoustic emission (AE) method and digital microscope were adopted to study the mechanical properties and microstructure of sandstone samples taken from Meilin Temple Mines at depth of 700 m in Ordos, China. The uniaxial compression tests were performed at four different sub-zero temperatures. The AE signals (e.g., energy) were recorded during freezing and loading processes at negative temperatures. The results showed that AE activities mainly occurred in the initial freezing phase and reduced afterwards. In the uniaxial compression test, AE signals were also observed in the initial loading stage, while no obvious results was observed from rock samples in room temperature.

With time and increases in engineering knowledge and computational capabilities, the use of more complicated geomechanical models integrated into a general workflow process for design and optimization of hydraulic fracturing is becoming well established. We examine geomechanical workflows available to show that ongoing research is more systematically applied to achieve a better coupling of static Mechanical Earth Models (MEMs), HF simulation models, geophysical earth models, dynamic reservoir models, etc. We introduce the Environmental Block concept in the HF workflow, and explore how the Environmental Block might be designed to interact with the other blocks to achieve a better understanding of environmental outcomes in geomechanics problems such as HF design. If successfully implemented, a well-designed Environmental Block can integrate into a design workflow to promote sustainability and social acceptance. |Introduction |Companies and academic centers in the rock mechanics field know the importance of geomechanical modeling. Such models may be used to predict the mechanical behavior of a reservoir, and they can be calibrated and verified with monitoring data for improved or advanced studies leading to better outcomes. |Temporally, the geological model precedes the geomechanical model. It specifies the geometrical arrangement of different rock layers (lithostratigraphy), physical properties such as density, grain size, porosity and mineralogy, sedimentary environment and lithotype distribution, and also incorporates structural geology information for folds, faults, and joint systems. Populating the model with mechanical properties, stresses, temperatures and pore pressures leads to the general geomechanical model, the basis of engineering design. Although there is no sharp line delineation between the geological and geomechanical models, a general (Geo)Mechanical Earth Model - MEM – is developed by following a series of steps (a “workflow”). The workflow steps may be well-defined, but the data populating the MEM are invariably characterized by differing degrees of uncertainty and granularity (data scale, varying from broad averages to small-scale pore structure information). |By definition (e.g. Schlumberger 2015b), a MEM is a numerical representation of the geomechanical state of the well, reservoir, or basin. In addition to intrinsic petrophysical and rock mechanics properties (e.g., density, porosity, acoustic impedance structure, elastic parameters, UCS, drilling D index…) and structural information (joints & faults…), the MEM incorporates the distribution of extrinsic parameters such as the pore pressures (po), stress state (<U+03C3>ij), temperature (To), and perhaps data related to pore fluid composition and chemistry. Stresses and pressures are extrinsic parameters because their values are imposed from outside of the rock itself, such as the relationship between total stress and the overburden weight, combined with the effects of tectonism and diagenesis. It is now deemed necessary to construct a MEM for all but the most trivial reservoir geomechanical studies, for drilling campaigns, for hydraulic fracturing programs, and so on. The numerical results and information that are in these MEMs and generated by simulations based on these MEMs are required for engineers in casing point selection, wellbore stability, borehole placement, essentially all subsurface engineering activity.|",,36

Y., The University of Hong Kong| Kang, Duan, The University of Hong Kong","|Abstract: |By using the three-dimensional discrete element method (DEM), the effect of micro parameters of smooth joint on macro properties of a jointed rock sample is investigated. A series of triaxial compression tests are simulated to obtain its pre-peak properties, which are influenced by the parameters of smooth joint including friction coefficient, normal stiffness, and shear stiffness. The friction coefficient is found to have the most significant impact on the macro properties including yield strength, Young's modulus, and Poisson's ratio. A reduction in friction coefficient significantly decreases the strength and changes the pattern of stress-strain curve. The stiffness of smooth joint has a relative small influence on the macro properties. The variation of stiffness does not change the pattern of stress-strain curve, and the normal stiffness has a more obvious influence on the macro properties than shear stiffness. Further analyses from the micro perspective are conducted by looking at the contact force, the distribution of different types of micro cracks, and the particle displacement to show the failure modes due to the variation of friction coefficient. The reduction of friction coefficient results in the change of failure mode from splitting to sliding. |Introduction |The mechanical and geometric properties of joints are recognized as the key factors controlling the strength, deformability and stability of a rock mass, since typical joints are much softer and weaker than their surrounding intact rock material. The presence of joints, which is inherent and one of the most challenging problems to be solved, makes the design and construction of engineering structures complex and difficult. Therefore, many attempts have been made to characterize the properties of joints and evaluate their influence on the mechanical behavior of rock masses. |Numerous studies using artificial material for a rock mass with limited joint sets have been carried out by Hayashi [1], Brown [2], Einstein et al.

[11] on schists, which generally revealed the variation of failure strength versus anisotropic angle characterized by a U-shaped curve [12]. Although these studies achieved a large number of valuable results, knowledge about the influence of mechanical properties of joints including joint stiffness, and joint friction on rock mass remains lacking.|",,43

A realistic representation of the joint network within the rock mass is therefore an essential component of stability analysis of rock structures (e.g. rock slopes, tunnels etc.). Discontinuity persistence and connectivity are significant parameters which control the stability of rock slopes. A small percentage of rock bridges on the discontinuity surface can significantly increase its strength and prevent slope failure. Discontinuities within the rock mass are rarely fully connected. In practice, however, discontinuities are often assumed fully persistent due to the difficulties both in mapping and simulation of non-persistence. Discrete fracture networks (DFN) provide a rigorous and convenient tool for the simulation of joint systems within a rock mass. Utilizing statistical methods, DFNs consider the stochastic nature of some key parameters (e.g. persistence and orientation) within numerical models. Discrete fracture network engineering is increasingly used due to recent developments in discontinuity data acquisition techniques (e.g. ground-based digital photogrammetry and laser scanning). Recent development in geomechanical modelling codes and increased computing power have also allowed to either import DFN's into models or to generate DFN's within the numerical modelling code itself (e.g. 3DEC). |This paper describes the use of photogrammetry at the Delabole slate quarry in Cornwall, UK for remotely acquiring key discontinuity parameter data (orientation, intensity and length) and its subsequent use in developing statistically validated discrete fracture network parameters. The 3D distinct element code, 3DEC, is used for the DFN generation and subsequent stability analysis. Several realizations of the 3DEC-DFN models are run to investigate the stochastic nature of discontinuities within the quarry and their potential influence on the stability of the pit. Finally the simulation results are used to determine the slope instability mechanisms and determine the most likely areas of potential instability.|",,41
522,523,2016-045,High-Resolution Numeric Simulation of a Standard Rockfall Test Setup,"Leibundgut, F. P., L&G Software| Wolinski, C., Geobrugg AG","|Abstract: |A standard test setup in high-resolution detailing was numerically simulated with SONAR software. The multibody dynamic-simulation software SONAR offers a new, universal approach in terms of the modeling, connection and interaction between objects in a complex mechanical system. The certified “Falling Rock Protection Barrier RXE-1000”, which has been intensively tested, experimentally measured and analyzed, formed the basis for investigating this approach. The core hardware equipment consists of several elastic ring-nets which, together with the dissipating device, can absorb energy of up to 1000 kJ. For the corresponding practical tests, there are detailed results for the deformation behavior of the overall system and of various specific parts. Further, comprehensive measurements at various key positions were also taken during the practical tests. Slow motion recordings of the impact from various perspectives complete the base material. This entire rockfall test setup was then modelled three-dimensionally at a very high level of detail (down to the bolts and cables) and simulated dynamically. A comparison of the results shows that in the future, we will be able to make precise predictions about the dynamic movement behavior of complex systems in full detail as well as associated exact predictions of the physical loads. The match between experiment and theory will be documented in the next steps in a series of video clips that show comparative movement behavior as a function of time of various parts of the system. The success of this dynamic analysis prompted us to develop a special SONAR module that's industry-specific in terms of simulation for the rockfall and security-system fields. This will allow for the creation and simulation of a model of a complete system within a reasonably short time. |Introduction |Geobrugg Switzerland is the developer and manufacturer of the modular rockfall security system known as RXE-1000 as shown in Fig. 1. Its modularity means that the system can be widely adapted to local conditions in terms of both geographic conditions as well as in terms of the objects to be protected. Generally, it serves to protect streets, rail lines and local fixed infrastructure from falling rocks. The system has been extensively tested and certified. Films, photos and measurement data were generated for the full scale tests. A certification test consists of the interception of a polyhedron-shaped weight of 3200 kg from a freefall height of around 32 meters, corresponding to a mass impact velocity of about 25 m/s and energy of 1000 kJ.|",,30
523,524,2016-044,Consideration of Breakdown Conditions of Directional Wells,"Barree, R. D., Barree & Associates LLC| Miskimins, J. L., Barree & Associates LLC","|Abstract: |In 1898, Kirsch published equations describing the elastic stresses around a circular hole that are still used today in wellbore pressure breakdown calculations. These equations are standard instruments used in multiple areas of petroleum engineering, however, the original equations were developed strictly for vertical well settings. In today's common directional or horizontal well situations, the equations need adjusted for both deviation from the vertical plane and orientation to the maximum and minimum horizontal in-situ stress anisotropy. This paper provides the mathematical development of these modified breakdown equations, along with examples of the implications in varying strike-slip and pore pressure settings. These examples show conditions where it is not unusual for breakdown pressure gradients to exceed 1.0 psi/ft and describes why certain stages in “porpoising” horizontal wells experience extreme breakdown issues during hydraulic fracturing treatments. The paper also discusses how, in most directional situations, the wellbore will almost always fail initially in a longitudinal direction at the borehole wall, after which the far-field stresses will take over and transverse components can be developed. Tortuosity and near wellbore friction pressure can actually add to forcing the initiation of such longitudinal fractures, which can then have cascading effects on other growth parameters such as cluster-to-cluster and stage-to-stage stress shadowing. Special considerations for highly laminated anisotropic formations, where shear failure of the wellbore may precede or preclude tensile failure, are also introduced. Such failure behaviors have significant implications on near wellbore conductivity requirements and can also greatly impact well production and recovery efforts. |Introduction |In vertical wells it is relatively easy to accept that a tensile fracture will initiate along the axis of the well and propagate in the direction of maximum horizontal stress, opening perpendicular to the minimum stress. As the industry has increasingly moved to horizontal well completion and stimulation, the paradigm that fractures will orient in the plane of the maximum and intermediate stress of the earth tensor, and continue to open against the minimum horizontal stress, has been retained. Fieldscale development plans are based on the expectation of nearly parallel vertical fractures that are orthogonal to the planned borehole (transverse), or set at a predictable angle to the well axis. Azimuth or strike of the fracture is expected to be given by the azimuth of maximum horizontal stress. When the horizontal stress anisotropy is low, a more complex system of possibly orthogonal fractures, or some complex joint network, is expected.|",,12

B., The University of Texas at Austin","|Abstract: |We present a new pore-pressure prediction workflow that couples seismic velocities with geomechanical modeling. Pore pressure is predicted using mean and shear stresses derived from a geomechanical model. This approach incorporates nonuniaxial loading, as well as the response of the geologic environment, and accounts for shear-induced pore pressures. We demonstrate this new workflow using data from the Mad Dog field, in the Gulf of Mexico. We use a static geomechanical model to obtain total mean stress and shear stress values around the Mad Dog salt. We use measured data along a well in front of the salt to establish a velocity – equivalent-effective-stress relationship. We use this relationship together with the shear predicted from the geomechanical model to calculate the mean effective stress across the target field. And we calculate pore pressures as the difference between the total and effective mean stresses. Overall, our new workflow incorporates the geologic history, yields the full stress tensor for the target field and can predict pore pressures ahead of the drill bit. |Introduction |Prediction of pore pressure ahead of drilling is crucial for borehole stability, planning of safe and economic well trajectories and design of casing plans (Dodson, 2004, Dutta, 2002, Zhang, 2013). It is also a key input in the exploration stage to determine the integrity of reservoir seals. Pressure prediction has become particularly important in complex geologic settings: for example, a significant percentage of deepwater well costs near salt are attributed to abnormal pore pressures (Harrison et al, 2004, York et al, 2009). |In basins, pore pressure can be greater than hydrostatic pressure because of sediment under-compaction (Bowers, 1995, Osbourne and Swarbrick, 1997). Rapid deposition of sediments may result in fluid being trapped in the sediment pores; this increases the pore fluid pressure and prevents normal compression of sediments. Because deformation in sedimentary basins is mainly uniaxial, volume changes are directly related to the vertical strain. The horizontal effective stress changes as a function of the vertical, thus the vertical effective stress is a good representation of the overall stress state. As a result, vertical-effective-stress methods have been established to calculate overpressure (Zhang, 2013). In these methods, overpressure is calculated as the difference between total and effective vertical stress, where the former is assumed as the overburden stress and the latter is obtained from the sediment compressional wave velocity (Dutta, 2002, Sayers et al, 2002).|",,7

These experiments include (i) abrupt stress contrasts between layers; (ii) weak interfaces; and (iii) contrast of material properties between the reservoir and bounding layers. Different geometries, including the propensity for height growth and/or “T-shaped” growth have been observed. There are four observed cases: containment, height growth, T-shape growth and the combination of height growth and T-shape. The results indicate that these cases fall within distinct regions when plotted in a two-dimensional parametric space defined by: 1) horizontal confining stress difference between the reservoir and barriers (“stress jump”) normalized by the difference between the measured fluid pressure and the horizontal stress in the reservoir (“net pressure”); and 2) difference between horizontal barrier stress and vertical stress normalized by the net pressure. Besides providing data for benchmarking numerical models, these experiments show that the observed height growth for the zero-toughness cases with no T-shaped growth is substantially less than the prediction from the conventional equilibrium height growth models. |Introduction |Hydraulic fracturing treatments have been widely employed to enhance oil and gas recovery. The fluid-driven fractures are typically designed to be restricted in the pay zone to achieve high productivity of hydrocarbons and to avoid stimulation of unproductive or water-bearing layers [1]. Classical hydraulic fracturing models (e.g., [2]) usually consider that height growth is controlled mainly by the stress contrasts between the reservoir and the bounding layers. These simplified models may describe the leading behavior of the fracture height growth, but ignore other important parameters, such as the presence of weak interfaces (bedding planes) between the layers above and/or below the reservoir which can substantially limit height growth. The effect of these interfaces on height growth has been long recognized through model predictions [3] and field observations [4], and it has also been observed in laboratory experiments [5], albeit in the absence of the sharp stress jumps typically expected at lithological boundaries. Moreover, [3] and [5] don't deal with the fracture growth inside the weak interfaces. Additionally, [6] presents height growth tests with sharp stress jumps but without the effects of weak interfaces. |This paper presents an experimental study of hydraulic fracture height growth. Its main objective is to demonstrate the influence of stress contrasts, material property differences and weak interfaces between the reservoir and adjacent layers. In order to enable direct observation, experiments were carried out in a transparent multi-layered medium. The results are classified into four cases: containment, height growth, T-shape growth and the combination of height growth and T-shape.

D., Stanford University","|Abstract: |The effective stress coefficient (<U+03B1>) is important to the analysis of poroelastic stress changes and deformations in the reservoirs. A Middle Bakken core was tested to study its effective stress in scenarios of depletion and injection. We designed an innovative experiment configuration to expedite the pore pressure equilibration within the tight specimen, and an exhaustive loading path to characterize the dependencies of <U+03B1> (with respect to static deformation) on confining pressure and pore pressure. Our test results reveal that the specimen's <U+03B1> is less than unity, and varies between 0.3 and 0.8. It suggests the effective stress is simply not equivalent to pressure difference between confining pressure and pore pressure. The effective stress coefficient <U+03B1> generally increases with pore pressure for constant confining pressure but decreases with confining pressure for constant pore pressure. The variation of <U+03B1> during depletion is more significant than during injection. These observations are also indicative of the microstructures of the specimen in terms of its responses to pore pressure and confining pressure variation. |Introduction |The production of hydrocarbons typically causes the reservoir to dwindle. Significant deformation can cause well failure, surface subsidence and production loss. What accompanies the deformation is the stress changes around and inside the reservoir (Segall and Fitzgerald, 1998; Zoback and Zinke, 2002), which may enhance or inhibit the rate of deformation. On the other hand, activities of hydraulic fracturing stimulation and enhanced oil recovery in unconventional plays inject large volume of fluid into the tight reservoirs. Like depletion, injection also induces significant deformation and stress changes, and potentially, triggers faulting and earthquakes (Zoback, 2012; Ellsworth, 2013). Thus, it is imperative to fundamentally understand the change in stress and strain as the reservoir depletes or undergoes injection. |Commonly, the stress changes associated with depletion and injection are considered as poroelastic and treated as such. How total stress (S) and pore pressure (Pp) interact and affect rock deformation is dealt by poroelasticity. The concept of effective stress (<U+03C3>) is important to evaluate the net effects of S and Pp on the deformation of rocks (Terzaghi, 1923; Biot, 1962). The Biot coefficient, or the effective stress coefficient, <U+03B1>, is used to couple S and Pp. For reservoir stress change and accompanying deformation, the effective stress is dictated by the particular <U+03B1> with respect to rock stiffness.|",,50

We propose to test on the mineral framework a tool that is already employed in the simulation of mercury injection capillary pressure experiments (MICP) (see [1-2] for implementations and [3] for background on MICP) and, in particular, we investigate the existence of a characteristic grain contact radius. As a starting point, results from hydrostatic loading of two porous sandstones of similar porosities, the Castlegate sandstone (?~26%) and the Boise sandstone (?~29%), are presented. The mechanical data reveals a factor of almost 4 between the values measured for the critical grain crushing pressure P*. As a way to connect microstructural parameters to the observed strength contrast, we test the use of the morphological analysis on high resolution X-ray CT images of both rocks. In comparing our findings with the already existing model of Zhang and Wong [4-5], we propose that the intergranular contact radius information extracted from the image analysis be explicitly incorporated into the modeling of the strength of porous sandstones. |Introduction |Mechanical response to depletion, which comprises irrecoverable volumetric strain as well as elastic deformation, strongly depends on in situ conditions and on the nature of the corresponding perturbation in terms of stress path, strain rate, fluid substitution, etc. The ability to forecast this behavior, whether for pressure support or subsidence risk assessment, hinges on our understanding of deformation mechanisms at the scale of the aggregate, their interplay with preexisting heterogeneities and their manifestation at the scale of the reservoir. |Modeling of mechanical properties traditionally relies on microstructural parameters such as porosity, mineralogy, coordination number, cemented contact area, grain size and shape, which are combined to account for trends obtained in laboratory measurements. The now widespread availability of 3D pore scale imaging techniques allows one to access the intimate make-up of a rock, offering in principle a means to fully quantify and validate the parameters used for pore-scale modeling. It also provides an opportunity to identify which of these parameters control resulting behavior, whether redundancies exist from a physical point of view, and whether they can even be measured in a meaningful way. The option of performing direct numerical simulations based on pore scale images is being increasingly utilized to complement costly laboratory measurements [6].

Also, static and dynamic measurements are carried out on a whole core to measure the coefficients of elastic anisotropy. The core used is from Utica Shale, a Middle Ordovician formation in the Appalachian Basin, underlying much of the northeastern United States and adjacent parts of Canada. The geomechanical properties of this shale are determined using multiple methods at multiple scales. The measurements are first made on a 4” diameter core using three strain rosettes to completely characterize a 3D hydrostatic strain tensor, which then is used to identify the type of anisotropy (transversely isotropic vs orthotropic), as well as the strike and the dip of the core bedding planes with respect to the locations of the strain rosettes. Dynamic measurements on the whole core are also made using multiple transducers placed on the sample surface. The sample is then sub-cored and plugs are extracted for deviatoric compression tests, which allow for complete determination of all the anisotropic elastic constants. The results from static and dynamic measurements are presented and compared, for whole core as well as the sub-cored plugs. Scale effects are observed to play a role in the measurement of mechanical properties. |Introduction |Geomechanical anisotropy of reservoir rocks plays an important role in wellbore stability analysis (Cui and Abousleiman, 1998) as well as the design of hydraulic fracture treatments (Sesetty and Ghassemi, 2016). Laboratory characterization of anisotropy is typically performed, by extracting core plugs from at least three orientations with respect to the bedding planes (Aoki et al 1993) – this can be done only if the orientation of the bedding planes in the core sample is completely known. Gonzaga et al. (2008) proposed a technique to determine the elastic coefficients for transversely isotropic rock from a single core sample. However, the technique requires a sample with obliquely dipping bedding planes with respect to the cylindrical sample axis (i.e., a standard parallel or perpendicular plug cannot be used since only one material axis is loaded under a deviatoric compression test for either of these orientations).|",,34

A., The University of Texas at Austin| Hudec, M., The University of Texas at Austin| Flemings, P., The University of Texas at Austin","|Abstract: |We use an evolutionary finite-element model to determine changes in stress and geomechanical features of sediments near a welding source layer of a salt wall. We show that a significant stress concentration develops at the weld tip, which is experienced by all sediments along the weld as the weld tip propagates along the weld. When the source layer welds, salt flow from diapir pedestal into diapir stops, resulting in a hydrostatic salt pressure. This pressure is less than the overburden stress in sediments over the pedestal. In fact, the salt in the pedestal supports only part of the weight of overlying sediments; the rest is transferred laterally to over-weld sediments through shear stresses above the weld tip. This transfer causes the stress concentration at the weld tip. We show that this concentration results in compression of sediments along the weld and hence enhancement of the weld sealing capacity. The resulting compaction can also explain the tightness of reservoirs near welds and the false pullup of their depths in seismic migration models. Our study is the first quantitative analysis of stress evolution near a welding salt layer and may help characterize and explore reservoirs near welds more accurately. |Introduction |Many petroleum prospects lie near salt diapirs that have a welded source layer, developed by complete or almost complete withdrawal of salt from the source layer (Jackson and Talbot, 1991) (Fig. 1). Several studies have addressed the important structural features of such welds for the exploration of these prospects, such as the permeability of adjacent sediments and presence of faults in them (Jackson et al., 2014; Peel, 2014; Rowan et al., 2012; Wagner, 2010). Previous studies, however, do not address the role of welding on the development of such features. |Field data indicate features that could be caused only by the welding process. For example, Hoetz et al. 2011 studied the data from 23 wells drilled through welds in the Zechstein salt basin, northern Netherlands, and found a consistent local decrease in the porosity and hence the permeability of reservoirs near the welds. They concluded that the salt layer welding is the cause of the decrease. Furthermore, Maione 2001 detected steeply dipping faults above welded source-layers of salt domes in the East Texas Basin. They also attributed the faults to the welding of the salt layers. Understanding and predicting the effects of welding on sediments is critical because these effects are often not detected in routine exploration (Hoetz et al. 2011; Maione 2001).|",,46

Predicting and mitigating out-of-zone fluid migration includes but goes beyond maintaining well integrity: it relies on technical understanding of top and fault seals, reservoir and overburden deformation, production/injection-induced stress changes, reservoir management, completions design and engineering, hydraulic fracturing/height containment, wastewater disposal, induced seismicity/fracture reactivation, and reservoir monitoring (e.g., geodetic and downhole measurement and interpretation). Subsurface integrity excludes surface facilities and spill response but includes regulations regarding subsurface activities. |In this paper we present and synthesize examples of subsurface containment loss from oil and gas fields that are documented in the open literature. We then discuss common risk areas or themes in subsurface containment geomechanics that are important to subsurface integrity and illustrate with some general examples how some of these could be investigated by using geomechanical models. |Introduction |Containment of produced or injected fluids within their intended wellbores or geologic subsurface zones in oil and gas fields is widely recognized as a critical part of exploration and production (E&P) activities in conventional and unconventional plays and reservoirs. For example, it is a primary objective while drilling exploration, appraisal, development, and production wells. Maintaining the integrity of wellbores and subsurface geologic elements can potentially minimize drilling and operational risk. Effectively managing injection pressures, volumes, and rates of fluids in producing fields depends critically on adequately defining the geomechanical limits set by geologic elements such as overburden, caprock, top seals, faults, and evolving in situ stress states (including reservoir pressures). Characterization of the mechanical integrity of the subsurface relies upon obtaining baseline measurements including lithology, petrophysical and mechanical properties, pore pressure, and stress state that are best obtained during field appraisal and development, before production begins. Because the consequences of subsurface containment loss to an operator or partner can be significant, including both direct and indirect costs (e.g., clean-up cost, loss of production, and damage to reputation), even for small events, containment-related activities have assumed a larger share of enterprise risk as technologically more challenging fields are evaluated and placed into production [1].|",,14

However, there are accepted evidence that fractures in each perforation cluster generally cannot be uniformly developed due to uneven flow volume distribution. To increase the effective fracture number and improve the effectiveness of stimulation treatments, the key is to promote uniform flow volume distribution and fracture growth. In this paper, a series of case studies were investigated to analyze the effects of fluid viscosity, injection rate, fracture spacing, differential stress (SHmax - Shmin), and Young's modulus on simultaneous three-fracture propagation by employing an in-house developed fracture propagation model (XFRAC). The results demonstrated that increasing flow viscosity increases the difference of flow rate between fractures, resulting in less fluid received by the interior fracture. Large injection rate can promote more uniform fracture development. Small fracture spacing implies strong stress shadow effects, which results in large variation of flow volume into each fracture. Differential stress can alter the partitioning of flow volume between fractures. Large differential stress restricts a fracture growing along a straight line. Young's modulus has significant impacts on hydraulic fracture propagation. Numerical results shown that the rock formations with small Young's modulus favor uniform fracture geometry. This work analyzed how parameters affect multiple fracture propagation and provided critical guidelines for engineers to improve the effectiveness of multi-stage fracturing treatments. |Introduction |Hydraulic fractures coupled with horizontal wells have become a standard technology to effectively develop unconventional reservoirs. Plug and perf. limited entry completion technology is being widely used to generate massive hydraulic fractures along horizontal wellbore. Generally, 2-6 perforation clusters in one stage are created with the purpose of simultaneously generating 2-6 similar fractures. However, it is now well established that multiple fractures cannot be uniformly generated along the lateral (Wheaton et al. 2014; Ugueto et al. 2016). Some clusters receive a small proportion of the intended treatment fluid and proppant, resulting in immaturely developed fractures, while some clusters receive more than intended and generate “overdeveloped” fractures. Consequently, production from horizontal wells with plug and perf. completions is highly variable along horizontal wellbore. |Miller et al. (2011) analyzed the data of production logs from multiple basins and indicated that one third of all perforation clusters contribute to two thirds of gas production and about one third of the clusters are ineffective and do not contribute to production. According to the data of distributed temperature sensing (DTS) and distributed acoustic sensing (DAS), Sookprasong et al. (2014) concluded that the dominant perforation clusters are often identified during simultaneous stimulation of multiple fractures. Wheaton et al. (2014, 2016) also utilized the data of DAS and DTS to analyze the flow and proppant distribution of multi-cluster fractures and shown the percentages of fluid/proppant existing each cluster through treatment time. The results indicate that multiple perforation clusters cannot receive equal fluid volume, resulting in non-uniform development of fractures. Spain et al. (2015) also pointed out that hydraulic fracturing efficiency in unconventional reservoirs is poor that 40%-60% of perforation clusters contribute little or no production. Ugueto et al. (2016) utilized fiber optic diagnostic to estimate perforation cluster efficiency in cemented plug and perf. limited entry completions. The paper stated that generally only half or two-thirds of the perforation clusters are properly stimulated or produced at significant rates.|",,61

When the fractures are relatively close, the outer fractures in a stage exert a strong confining stress on the inner fractures, inhibiting their development and the desired uniform growth of fractures in the stage. There is thus a need to develop computational tools to analyze this mutual interaction between propagating HF to seek designs that can mitigate this inhibition phenomenon which is known as stress shadowing. In this paper, we report the development of an axisymmetric extended finite element method (XFEM) that can model multiple simultaneously propagating HF that are able to curve (forming bowl-shaped fractures) and which is able to autonomously partition the flux of fluid among the HF in the stage. To test the flux partitioning algorithm, we compare the XFEM code to a parallel planar displacement discontinuity (DD) code. To test the HF curving due to mutual interaction, we compare the XFEM to an axisymmetric DD code, which can model two symmetric fractures that can curve due to mutual interaction. Finally, we describe an experiment in which five mutually interacting HF with flux partitioning are allowed to curve, and we compare the results to the case in which the five HF are constrained to develop in distinct parallel planes. |Introduction |Horizontal wells frequently have a significant number of nonproducing perforation clusters in a given stage due to variations in the reservoir properties and the phenomenon of stress shadowing, in which the confining stress induced by the outer fractures in a stage serves to inhibit the growth of the inner fractures. It is thus desirable to develop computational tools that can analyze such situations to determine the optimal choice of engineering parameters to mitigate the effect of stress shadowing and reservoir heterogeneity. A complete model of this situation requires a fully coupled 3D simulator that can model curving HF that simultaneously propagate in a heterogeneous solid medium. Thus far, models of this situation have been restricted to homogeneous media involving pseudo-3D approximations that can admit curving cracks (Kresse et al., 2013), 2D-axisymmetric HF that are assumed to grow in parallel planes (Lecampion and Desroches, 2015) or arbitrarily shaped HF that are assumed to grow in parallel planes (Bunger and Peirce, 2014; Peirce and Bunger, 2015).|",,9

E., The University of Texas at Austin","|Abstract: |Extended leak-off tests are important in petroleum engineering for obtaining underground stress information, which is critical for issues such as wellbore stability, lost circulation, casing design, hydraulic fracturing, sand production, and reservoir compaction and subsidence. The signatures of extended leak-off tests are very different between permeable formations (e.g. sandstones) and impermeable formations (e.g. shales). A proper understanding of this difference is important for test interpretation, particularly for the determination of minimum horizontal stress. Based on numerical simulation analyses, this paper contains a detailed comparison of extended leak-off tests in permeable and impermeable formations. The comparison results show that permeability and its related phenomenon such as fluid leak-off can significantly influence pressure versus time response of an extended leak-off test and lead to interpretation difficulties. Traditional interpretation methods using time development of bottom hole pressure cannot provide accurate estimate of minimum horizontal stress in impermeable formations due to the negligibly small leak-off through fracture faces to the surrounding formation. The numerical model developed in this paper provides a method for aiding interpretation and design of extended leak-off tests |Introduction |Knowledge of minimum horizontal stress (Shmin) is important in many aspects during the life of oilfield development. It impacts all the development phases from well design to well abandonment. Shmin is a key factor for design of well trajectory and casing programs, and prediction of wellbore stability and lost circulation in the drilling and completion phases (Feng et al., 2015; Feng and Gray, 2016a, 2016b; Raaen and Brudy, 2001). It is also one of the most critical elements for hydraulic fracturing design to maximize the recovery of unconventional reservoirs. In the production phase, Shmin is a required parameter for evaluation of sand production, reservoir compaction, and surface subsidence. For the well abandonment phase, knowledge of Shmin is needed to determine the abandonment plug setting depths to ensure the long-term integrity of the abandoned well. In addition, fluid injection operations, such as produced water injection, waterflooding, steam injection, cuttings reinjection and carbon dioxide injection, have become essential elements of field development worldwide. The long-term integrity of reservoir caprock has become a major safety concern surrounding these operations. Shmin is a key input for developing reliable, full-scale mechanical earth models and other analytical or empirical models for addressing this safety concern (Chan et al., 2015).|",,30

However, lacking of or insufficient knowledge of Bakken rock Biot's coefficient makes the successful drilling of horizontal well with multistage fracturing stimulation difficult. Biot's coefficient is not only critical to the wellbore stability during horizontal drilling, but also important to multistage fracturing design. Only a limited amount of Bakken rock Biot's coefficient data are available because the experimental measurement is cost expensive and time consuming. The uncertainty of the existing data is also unknown since no comparison study has been conducted. In this study, Biot's coefficient was measured by three different methods using the same equipment. This approach ensures uncertainties due to the system error are similar to different methods. As such, the comparability of results from different methods increases. Furthermore, differences among the results are investigated and the causes are discussed. The significance of this investigation is that these approaches have solid theoretical base. With that the core analysis can be reliable and accurate, and it will be much easier to obtain the rock Biot's coefficient when the other methods are infeasible. These different methods can be used to validate each other, thus reduce the uncertainty related to the complex nature in Biot's coefficient determination. |Introduction |The Williston Basin, which centered at Williston, North Dakota and extended to eastern Montana, northeastern South Dakota, southeastern Saskatchewan and a small section of southwestern Manitoba, is performed as an oval-shaped structure with a surface area between 120,000 and 240,000 square miles [1]. The Bakken Formation is located in the deep part of Williston Basin, which contains the excellent petroleum source-rock. The Bakken Formation is a thin, naturally fractured Upper Devonian-Lower Mississippian sedimentary unit. It can be divided into three intervals: the upper shale, the lithologically variable middle member, and the lower shale [2]. The upper and lower shales have rich organic content, and are the source rocks for oil and gas in the Bakken and other formations in the basin. The Bakken Formation was estimated to contain an enormous amount of oil, estimated from 200 to 400 billion barrels. Although the Bakken Formation is very thin compared to other oil producing horizons, it has recently attracted much attention because it is extremely high carbon content places it among the richest hydrocarbon source rocks in the world. Oil production from the Bakken Formation in Williston Basin exceeded one million barrels per day in 2014. While for this formation, recovery factor of oil is less than ten percent due to the low porosity and extremely low permeability. Thus knowing the geomechanical properties of the Bakken Formation is important for well design, hydraulic fracturing treatment production optimization and reservoir evaluation. However, so far the Bakken Formation has not been investigated very much in comparing to the rapidly increasing development activities.|",,56
535,536,2016-017,Performance Analysis of Multiple Rock Caverns for Thermal Energy Storage,"Park, D., Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources| Park, E. S., Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources","|Abstract: |In this paper, we present a performance evaluation process for the use of multiple thermal energy storage (TES) caverns for hot water storage. Two separate numerical simulations are employed to evaluate the structural and thermal performance of multiple TES caverns: a probabilistic stability analysis to assess the reliability (i.e., structural performance) of the caverns and a computational fluid dynamics analysis to assess the time-dependent heat loss (i.e., thermal performance) to the surroundings. Cavern stability and heat loss are investigated for different pillar widths. The results of the two different numerical analyses show that as the pillar width decreases, the structural stability of the caverns decreases because of the cavern-to-cavern interaction during ground movements, whereas the thermal performance of the caverns increases because of the thermal interaction from heat transfer between the caverns. This result suggests that the pillar width between the multiple TES caverns should be carefully chosen to ensure cavern stability and to provide acceptable thermal performance. The results of the present investigation also demonstrate that the numerical approach in our work can be used for assessing the performance of multiple TES caverns. |Introduction |Thermal energy storage (TES) systems have the potential to increase the effective use of thermal energy equipment and to facilitate large-scale energy utilization. TES is defined as the temporary storage of thermal energy at high or low temperatures. TES systems are useful for correcting the mismatch between the supply and demand of energy. Therefore, they can play an important role in both energy conservation and the use of intermittent resources, such as wind and solar energy. One of the most important performance factors for TES systems is the thermal stratification in the heat storage containers, which refers to the separation of the fluid in a container into multiple layers with different temperatures. Fig. 1 illustrates two types of heat storage containers with different levels of thermal stratification but containing equivalent energy. The left container in Fig. 1 has the two fluid layers separated evenly at temperatures of 30°C and 50°C. The fluid within the right container in Fig. 1 is fully mixed at a temperature of 40°C, the average temperature of the two fluid layers in the left container. If the minimum temperature required for the heat supply is 45°C, the 50°C fluid within the left container can be directly used. However, all the fluid within the right container is useless, which indicates that the energy available to be used (i.e., the exergy) is zero, and if it becomes necessary to use it, the fluid temperature must be increased by auxiliary heater input.|",,35

Installation of a tiltmeter on the top of a very unstable rock block, correction of thermoelastic deformation of either sensors and attachments or rock mass, and long-term monitoring at a rock cliff along an abandoned road are shown as solutions to the problems. The solutions may not appear to be particularly novel, sophisticated or attractive, but the authors are convinced that they will contribute to breakthroughs in solving the listed problems. The techniques are inexpensive and worth trying. |Introduction |Numerous rock slope-monitoring studies have been conducted, and mechanisms of joint opening leading to the formation of unstable rock blocks, such as thermal deformation, water mineral reaction, pore pressure, freeze-thaw cycle, intrusion of wood roots etc. have been more or less clarified; however, the triggering mechanisms of rock falls remain to be elucidated. |Problems preventing the advancement of understanding of the mechanisms effecting unstable rock block fall are as follows. |Problem 1: Usually, sensors are connected to rock blocks by anchors and bolts; as such, it has up to date been impossible to install sensors in rock blocks because they are so unstable that they would easily fall during drilling. The monitored rock blocks will never fall because they are stable enough that they can be drilled without falling. Data describing rock fall processes cannot be obtained from such monitoring, and so the mechanisms of rock fall will never be clarified, even if the monitoring is carried out using the latest sensors, which are packed with a range of high-cost technologies.|",,19

The Mayo B hydro power project is located in the Yukon, Canada. An unstable, 25 m (80 foot) high rock slope, comprised of relatively weak, low-grade metamorphic bedrock, was remediated to mitigate risks to the intake structure below. The Pointe du Bois hydro power project is located in Manitoba, Canada. Extensive drill and blast bedrock excavation was necessary to construct new spillway approach and discharge channels, in granite to granodiorite bedrock. Trial drill and blast programs were conducted to optimize the methods for excavation, while adhering to strict roughness criteria required to satisfy the finished channel hydraulic design. The results and benefits of constructing these projects are briefly presented. Rock excavation and rock slope stabilization measures employed are described and illustrated by a series of figures and photographs. |Introduction |An existing intake, tunnel and powerhouse generating 5 megawatts (MW) of hydroelectric power, was constructed near Mayo, Yukon, in the 1950s. In 2010, the Owner, Yukon Energy Corporation, decided to proceed with the construction of the Mayo B project, involving construction of a new two-unit 10 MW powerhouse, a 300-m (985 foot) long intake tunnel, and 3.6 km (11,810 feet) of steel penstock. Completed in 2011, the project increased hydroelectric power generation capacity at this site from approximately 5 megawatts to 15 megawatts. The main benefits of the project include assisting with the saving of approximately $10 million (CDN) in annual diesel power generation, subsequently resulting in a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of approximately 25,000 tonnes per year. |Manitoba Hydro undertook the construction of the new spillway at the Pointe du Bois project, involving deep excavations in hard granitic bedrock. The new spillway replaces approximately 100-year old facilities that consisted of 97 smaller sluiceway bays, all of which were manually operated. The new spillway structure includes a discharge channel that has a curved shape, with vertical bedrock walls. The walls measure 690 m (2265 feet) in length on the outer curve, and 430 m (1410 feet) on the inner curve. The maximum depth of spillway channel bedrock excavation is approximately 24 m (79 feet). The average width of the spillway channel is 120 m (395 feet). The bedrock excavation works were completed in 2014.|","excavation,  blasting,  stability,  rock support, rock",41

C., Imperial College London","|Abstract: |This paper presents a numerical approach for simulating fluid-solid coupled processes during hydraulic fracturing in rock masses. The solid behavior is modeled by the Discrete Finite-Element Method (FEMDEM) that can capture the deformability of matrix blocks, the interaction of pre-existing fractures, and the propagation of new cracks driven by mode I, mode II or mixed mode brittle failure. A joint constitutive model (JCM) is implemented in the FEMDEM solver to calculate the realistic response of rough fractures including opening, closing, shearing and dilatancy. The JCM model also accounts for the scale effect of natural fracture properties (e.g. roughness) as well as the consequence on the shear strength as observed in laboratory experiments. The combined JCM-FEMDEM formulation is coupled with the Darcy flow simulation tool Imperial College Finite Element Reservoir Simulator ‘IC-FERST’ which is based on a control-volume finite-element method (CV-FEM). The results show that the evolution of hydraulic fracturing (e.g. branching, hierarchy, and orientation) can be significantly affected by the fluid injection condition and the in-situ stresses. This research therefore has important implications for the hydraulic fracturing problems in reservoir engineering and geothermal projects. |Introduction |Deformation, fragmentation, and fracturing is a common cause of weakness in rocks due to natural geological processes such as fault slips, and engineering driven activities such as drilling, blasting and hydraulic fracturing. Industries that exploit these geomechanical processes, such as the oil and gas sector which employ processes as drilling, fluid-driven fracturing and CO2 sequestration, alongside other major industrial ventures as underground waste disposal and mining, have to regularly be able to predict and respond to these inherent geomechanical processes. In order to effectively design systems or increase efficiencies, the ability to reliably understand these complexities of the rock behavior with respect to the changes in the stress and fluid flow dynamics is a major concern. The large numbers of these processes arise in areas of weakness in the rock mass, the fractures and joints as opposed to the stiffer rock matrix. Mechanical aperture changes in rock normally occurs due to normal or shear deformation, leading to variations in the hydraulic properties in both the matrix and fractures/joints of the rock mass. The main governing properties of flow in fractured rocks can be summarized as [Olsson & Barton, 2001, Rutqvist & Stephansson, 2003] (a) hydraulic properties, (b) fluid pressure at the boundaries and (c) the ‘void’ geometry (fractures, porosity). The fluid flow properties of porous rocks can be described using the widely used fluid flow model for porous media, Darcy's Law. However, the subject of the void properties of the rocks has been one of many investigations. The fluid flow properties of fractured rocks can be largely dependent on [Olsson & Barton, 2001] |Fracture/joint aperture |Roughness of the joint walls |Stiffness of the rock Fracture/joint shape |",,57

The fluid pressure on main hydraulic fracture surface can increase mean confining stress of rock around the main fracture. Natural fracture tends to stabilize when confining stress increasing. Fracturing fluid leaks from main hydraulic fracture into natural fracture causing the elevation of pore pressure in natural fracture. Shear slip may occur when pore pressure of natural fracture elevated. If the fluid pressure within the main fracture suddenly decreases, the mean confining stress of the rock around main fracture decreases quickly, while the pore fluid pressure in the natural fracture do not decrease simultaneously due to the relatively low permeability, which causes the Mohr's stress circle move to the left and natural fractures shear failure easier. In this paper, we present a cyclic treatment to enhance the degree of natural fracture activation. A numerical model is established to investigate the effect of cyclic pressure drop on natural fracture activation. The results show that cyclic treatment can significantly improve the length and permeability of activated natural fracture. |Introduction |Recent years, multiple-hydraulic-fracturing has been a commonly technology for stimulating tightsand gas and shale gas formations in order to produce commercial quantities of natural gas (Cipolla et al., 2008, Cleveland and Cote, 2014, Daneshy, 2011). Economic production from these reservoirs depends greatly on the effectiveness of hydraulic fracturing stimulation treatment (Dahi Taleghani and Olson, 2014). The classical conceptual model of hydraulic fracturing is that injection forms a symmetrical, bi-wings and planar hydraulic fractures. However, micro-seismic measurements and other in-situ observation suggest that fracturing can creates a complex fracture network in most unconventional reservoirs (Cipolla et al., 2008, Warpinski et al., 2012). This complex fracture networks increases the total contact surface area and plays a key role in the success development of unconventional reservoirs. The created of complex fracture networks strongly influenced by the pre-existing natural fractures (or weak planes) and in-situ stress in the reservoir (McClure and Horne, 2014, Sharma and Manchanda, 2015, Weng et al., 2015). |Core analysis has revealed the presence of abundant natural fractures in different kinds of rocks at different scales (Gale et al., 2014, Olson et al., 2009). As our experience with fracturing large number of well in unconventional formation has grown, it is becoming apparent that one of the most challenges in horizontal-well stimulation is activating natural fractures as many as possible. The matrix permeability is too low to contribute to flow significantly. Flow rates in ultra-low permeability reservoirs mainly depend on the total area of permeable fractures that are hydraulically connected to the well. Much, but not all, activated natural fractures are conducive to the production of the well. These permeable fractures include the main hydraulic fractures and the activated natural fractures which hydraulically connected to the well. Thus, the number of the activated natural fracture is the key to success in tight-sand and shale gas reservoirs stimulation.|",,28

We present here the methodology for the second phase of the project, where we will develop and demonstrate emerging seismic and electrical geophysical imaging technologies that characterize 1) the 3D extent and distribution of fractures stimulated from the explosive source, 2) 3D fluid transport within the stimulated fracture network through use of a contrasting tracer, and 3) fracture attributes through advanced data analysis. Focus will be placed upon advancing these technologies toward near real-time acquisition and processing in order to help provide the feedback mechanism necessary to understand and control fracture stimulation and fluid flow. |Introduction |Imaging fractures with geophysical techniques is a central focus for reservoir development, especially in tight shale gas formations and Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS), and for material storage applications such as CO2 sequestration and deep nuclear repositories. An outstanding problem, however, is that imaging fractures and their evolution during production and/or storage is inherently complex, regardless of logistical and/or economic monitoring constraints. This difficulty arises primarily from two characteristics: 1) the tortuous and multi-scaled geometries of fracture networks (e.g. extrinsic anisotropy), which at the smallest levels is unresolvable with far-field geophysical observations, and 2) the intrinsic anisotropy of the natural rock systems where targets are typically located (e.g. volcanics, tight shales). It has been shown, however, that imaging resolution can be improved by increasing two geophysical survey design parameters: 1) azimuthal and offset coverage (i.e. surrounding the target at closer offsets) and 2) independent data measurements (i.e. multi-physics large N approaches) (e.g. Neal and Krohn 2012, Bergmann et al. 2016).|",,50

Fluids are typically injected at high pressures and at rates up to tens of barrels per minute. As a result, the process of deep fluid injection can cause profound changes to the effective stress. This alters the rock mass effective permeability and storativity due to the creation of hydraulic fractures, inflated (hydro-jacked) natural fractures, and critically stressed (hydro-sheared) natural fractures. |This paper presents a Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) approach to deep fluid injection into fractured rock. The approach presented combines continuum and discontinuum geomechanics, considering the effect of discrete fracture shear and normal deformation on rock modulus and in situ stress. Stress and pressure redistribution during DFI is simulated to understand changes in fracture aperture, fracture transmissivity, and fracture storativity. This includes local volumetric strain, concentrating stress and increasing rock mass stiffness. This coupling can have significant implications for injection strategies, as stress redistribution potentially changes injectivity and modifies fluid flow pathways. The paper also addresses the risk of induced seismicity, and the risk for aquifer contamination from deep injected fluids through stimulated fracture pathways. The DFN approach provides insights to the use of deep fluid injection as a long-term waste disposal strategy. |Introduction |Deep Fluid Injection (DFI), sometimes referred to as Deep Strata Injection Technology (DSIT), is applied extensively by petroleum and manufacturing industries to dispose of significant quantities of contaminated water. DFI can decrease the cost of fluid disposal, particularly where existing wells can be repurposed. DFI can also provide environmental benefits by isolating injected fluids beneath low permeability flow barriers that have been proven effective over geologic time. However, DFI also presents potential environmental risks, including ground and surface water contamination, heave, and induced seismicity (Apps & Tsang, 1996 and Hyne, 2001).|","deep fluid injection,  fractures,  hydraulic fracturing,  hydro-shearing,  injectivity,  and fracture porosity,  hydromechanical coupling,  storativity,  DFN,  induced seismicity,  coupled processes",30

With an excavated depth of close to 1000 m, maintenance of the pit slopes becomes increasingly challenging. One of the major controls on slope stability is the potential for large scale instabilities associated with major structures that can extend over hundreds of metres. Some of these major structures are mapped and included in mine planning models as wireframe surfaces. However there are a high number of structures that are large enough to cause significant instability, whilst being too small and numerous to explicitly model. With various options being considered for the end of life of the pit in terms of slope push back, slope steepening and ramp trimming, how could the impact of these major and intermediate structures be considered upon the outcome of the various design options? |Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) modelling was identified as the most practical way to assess the potential for major kinematic instabilities as a consequence of movement upon major structures. Analysis of mapping, borehole and scanline geotechnical data, allows the spatial and geometrical properties of the fault network to be derived. Thus the large scale wireframed structures can be supplemented by intermediate scale stochastically generated faults that honour the same spatial and geometric patterns and properties. Of particular note was the fact that borehole fracture intensity data showed that fault intensity was strongly correlated to the distance to the nearest mapped major structures which enabled the distribution of stochastic intermediate faults to be controlled by a distance to fault property. |In addition to using the DFN model to probabilistically evaluate the volume of unstable material as a consequence of the three different closure options, a novel technique was developed for mapping areas of the slope that were prone to block formation and therefore potential instability. This involved stacking the kinematic results of multiple realisations of where blocks had been found within the DFN at the slope level and computing the probability of occurrence of these blocks within a 3D grid of the pit slope.

The findings from these experiments help to understand proppant embedment and fracture diagenesis in shales. Experiments were conducted on 1inch diameter, 2inch long split cylindrical samples sandwiched with proppant at a constant confining stress of 20 MPa and with varied pore pressure — increases in pore pressure represent concomitant decreases in effective stress. Permeability and sorption characteristics are measured by pulse transient methods. To explore the effect of swelling and embedment on fracture surface geometry, we measure the evolution of transport characteristics for different proppant geometries (single layer vs. multi-layer), gas saturation, and sample variance. In order to simulate both production and enhanced gas recovery processes, both injection and depletion cases are investigated. For both strongly- (CO2, CH4) and slightly-adsorptive gases (N2) the permeability first decreases when gas pressure increases because of swelling. It then increases beyond the Langmuir threshold due to the over-riding influence of effective stresses. Due to its highest adsorptive affinity, CO2 returns the lowest permeability among these three gas permeants. Compared to the case of a mono-layer propped sample, the sample with four layers exhibits less swelling as implied by its elevated k/k0 ratio. Interestingly the duration of gas exposure and saturation tested here which is up to ~20hrs does not have a significant influence on permeability for either adsorptive or non-adsorptive gases. Permeabilities recovered from both injection and depletion cycles generally overlap each other and are repeatable with little hysteresis. This suggests the dominant role of reversible swelling over irreversible embedment. Permeability variance between different samples is of the order of ~1.5 - 2 times but with repeatable trends and order of magnitude parity. Gas permeant composition and related swelling effects exert important influences on the permeability evolution of shales under nominally in situ conditions.|",,14

In this study, the results from an existing thermal and multi-phase fluid flow simulator are imported into a geomechanical module to solve for the vertical displacement and the stress variation around a propagating cavity induced by a coal gasification process. A Controlled Retracting Injection Point (CRIP) well configuration is applied in the thermal reservoir simulator to model chemical reactions and geochemistry. The high temperature nature of the UCG process as well as creation of void space within the rock mass continuum require the use of efficient rock constitutive models. Three different constitutive models are investigated in this study: linear elastic, hyperbolic, and elasto-plastic. We have then applied these constitutive models on a case study to compare the results. The displacement of a coal layer and the surrounding blocks as well as stress arching in regions away from the cavity can efficiently be captured by the use of all the above constitutive models; however, a stress analysis around the induced cavity necessitates implementation of a constitutive model which can efficiently capture the shear softening after the rock failure. |Introduction |Coal accounts for almost 30% of global primary energy consumption, which makes it the second largest primary energy source in the world after oil. Coal is also the largest provider of electricity. Over 40% of global power production derives from coal [1]. Coal's significant position in the global energy mix is mainly because it is abundant, low-cost, and the most wide-spread fossil fuel in the world [2]. Despite a decline in the coal demand growth in 2014, International Energy Agency's forecast shows the growth of almost 1% per year through 2020 [1]. Moreover, based on the 2013 survey of World Energy Council, coal consumption is forecast to increase over 50% to 2030. This rise will be mainly due to the escalating electricity rates in the developing countries [2]. Therefore, more coal extraction is necessary to meet the global future energy demand.|",,19

M., Statoil","|Abstract: |Over the last few years Statoil has performed more than 200 high quality extended leak-off tests. This data has been used for determination of minimum stress and quantification of “formation integrity” parameters wrt well barriers and injection control. However the database includes many other parameters related to the initiation and propagation of a fracture with drilling mud. This represents a unique opportunity to investigate various claims in the industry relating to fracture gradient (FG) and formation integrity. For example, it is possible to compare fracture propagation pressures and determine whether there are any differences between water based and oil based muds. Actual formation breakdown pressure can be compared to theoretical models to determine the statistical validity of such models when used for FG generation. Statistical analysis on fracture propagation pressure permits another type of analysis which can be useful in a risk based approach for the estimation of FG during drilling. The data is also interesting in that it suggests that the subsurface on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS) is not in fact in equilibrium state with frictional strength of faults. For the regions covered by the database, there appears to be other mechanisms that result in higher values of minimum stress than that which would be the case for frictional equilibrium. Finally, and in contrast to many other works, the work shows that NCS sediment packages are primarily characterized by a normal faulting regime. |Introduction |Statoil has put significant effort in performing high quality stress determination tests during the last decade or so [1-4].

S., Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory| Friedrich, M., Pioneer Natural Resources| Leonard, P., Pioneer Natural Resources","|Abstract: |Source rock reservoirs are heterogeneous at very fine scales as a consequence of depositional sequence and subsequent compaction. The resultant heterogeneity can potentially induce large variations in lateral stress from one narrow vertical interval to the next within a pay zone. Consequently, hydraulic fracture height growth in source rocks can be strongly influenced by very narrow bands of closure stress contrast induced by this heterogeneity. In addition, many source rock reservoirs contain dense networks of natural fractures which can influence hydraulic fracture development. We present our recent studies of the influence of strong variations in closure stress interacting with natural fractures upon hydraulic fracture propagation. We observe that natural fractures can act both to aid and arrest fracture propagation depending upon their location relative to the hydraulic fracture and the stress barrier. |Introduction |Source rock reservoirs are heterogeneous at very fine scales as a consequence of depositional sequence and subsequent compaction. The resultant heterogeneity in elastic properties can potentially induce large variations in lateral stress from one narrow vertical interval to the next within a pay zone because the same tectonic strains will induce significantly different stress states within each layer (Eaton, 1969). When a hydraulic fracture reaches a horizon where the stress contrast is greater than the net pressure in the hydraulic fracture at that point, it will arrest (Simonson et al., 1978). For normal and strike-slip stress environments, the hydraulic fracture opens against the minimum horizontal stress and propagation is largely vertical with the minimum horizontal stress controlling vertical propagation. This phenomenon has been confirmed both through modeling and laboratory experiment (Jeffrey and Bunger, 2009). Consequently, hydraulic fracturing in source rocks can be strongly influenced by very narrow bands of closure stress contrast induced by heterogeneity. |Many source rock plays have been observed to contain significant natural fractures that are believed to influence the propagation of hydraulic fractures. Numerous studies have investigated the effect of vertical fractures upon hydraulic fracture growth. However, the bulk of these studies have considered the scenario where the vertical extents of the hydraulic fracture, pay zone and natural fractures are identical (For example, Gu and Weng, 2010; Renshaw and Pollard, 1995; Zhang and Jeffrey, 2008). In doing so, the dimensionality of the problem is reduced to 2D, making both experiment and modeling simpler. Such studies have demonstrated that provided the hydraulic and natural fractures have the same vertical extent, it is possible to observe conditions where a hydraulic fracture is expected to arrest at natural fractures of specific orientations during its lateral propagation. However, by assuming the same height for the hydraulic fracture, pay zone and natural fractures, the impact of the natural fractures upon hydraulic fracture evolution is potentially exaggerated.|",,43
547,548,2016-889,Stability Analysis of Toppling Slope Using the Extended NMM,"Chen, Chen, Kyushu University| Fan, Fan, Kyushu University","|Abstract: |The original numerical manifold method (NMM) is extended for stability analysis of a toppling slope with complex sliding surface and cohesion and tensile strengths existing in discontinuities. The extended NMM is shown effective by reproducing a centrifuge test. With NMM simulation, the commonly used Goodman and Bray's analytical method is shown adaptable to a toppling slope model with a simple sliding surface without cohesion and tensile strengths in the discontinuities. It is shown that the deformation of the sliding body has no significant effect on the result. The relationship between dip angle and critical friction angle is investigated. A real toppling slope is simulated and the necessary cohesion and friction angle are verified. |Introduction |Landslide is one of the most serious natural hazards worldwide because it occurs frequently and causes various catastrophic damages and casualties. Slope stability analysis is one of the widely used methods for clarifying the landslide-prone slopes in order to mitigate the potential disaster. High accurate slope stability analysis depends on a good knowledge of the mechanism of the corresponding slope failure type. |Slope toppling failure is one of the typical rock slope failure types of landslides. Characteristics of a toppling slope are (1) individual blocks are formed by a set of discontinuous joints dipping into the sliding face, and a second set of cross joints, (2) the short blocks in the toe are pushed forward by the upper blocks due to rotation moments, resulting in the further toppling of the upper blocks. Because of these characteristics, the critical friction angle is generally larger than the incline angle of the potential sliding surface for a toppling slope, which is quite different from ordinary slopes where the critical friction angle is almost equal to the potential sliding surfacing cline angle. Therefore, in case of no cohesion, the stability analysis of a toppling slope is to estimate the critical friction angle along the sliding surface to determine the failure possibility.|",,3
548,549,2016-890,Strength Degradation Approach (SDA) for Estimation of Confined Strength of Micro-Defected Rocks,"Bahrani, N., University of Toronto| Kaiser, P. K., Bharti School of Engineering, Laurentian University","|Abstract: |It is known that heterogeneity at the grain scale, such as grain geometry and mineral stiffness, as well as grain and grain boundary micro-cracks (called micro-defects) reduces the unconfined compressive strength of rocks. However, how the confined strength of a rock specimen is influenced by the presence of such features is not well understood. In this study, PFC2D and its embedded grain-based model (GBM) is used to investigate the influence of micro-defects on rock strength under unconfined and confined conditions. Previously calibrated GBMs with respect to laboratory properties of intact and heat-treated Wombeyan marble are used to simulate rock specimens with varying micro-defect densities. Micro-defects are simulated in the form of grain boundary frictional cracks. The results of numerical simulations are then used to develop semi-empirical equations that relate the confined peak strength difference of intact and micro-defected specimens. The applicability of the proposed approach, called the Strength Degradation Approach (SDA) for estimating the confined peak strength of micro-defected rocks is demonstrated. |Introduction |Heterogeneity plays an important role in the failure process of rocks especially at low confinement. The presence of heterogeneities results in the generation of internal tensile stresses even in an overall compressive stress field. The tensile stresses result in the generation of tensile cracks before the peak stress is reached. Figure 1 schematically shows various types of heterogeneity at different scales; from block forming joints in a jointed rockmass, to defects in rock blocks and laboratory scale rock specimens, to grain boundaries and to inter- and intra-grain micro-cracks. |As discussed by Lan et al. (2010) and Valley et al. (2010), grain scale heterogeneity in a non-defected, intact piece of rock can be divided into the following three forms: |grain geometric heterogeneity resulting from different shapes and sizes of grains; |grain property heterogeneity resulting from stiffness and strength contrast between different grains; and |grain contact heterogeneity due to varying grain boundary lengths, orientations and properties. |",,22
549,550,2016-810,Improved Signature Hole Analysis for Blast Vibration Control in Open Pit Mines,"Silva, Jhon, University of Kentucky| Jenks, Patrick, Barrick| Sharon, Robert, Barrick","|Abstract: |Ground vibration is an undesired effect of blasting in mining. In some situations where geotechnical slope performance is of concern, blast design gains an increased relevance as a variable to consider in slope stability. Several methods are available to assess the vibration levels produced by blasting in a mine operation (surface and underground). The scaled distance approach is the most widely used methodology to control vibration, however it has several limitations including the need for a complete set of data to find the ground coefficients used in the governing equation. This paper proposes a new methodology using a case study to predict and control ground vibrations produced by mine blasts based on the concept of the traditional signature hole technique. In the new methodology, a Monte Carlo scheme is used to produce a histogram of the predicted peak particle velocity and acceleration in locations of interest of the slope, according to the geometry, the timing, and the sequence of the blast design. This methodology has been used in surface coal mines to protect important infrastructure (power structures, gas lines, etc.) and in metal mines to control vibration levels to minimize the impact of blasting on the performance of large open pit slopes. |Introduction |In the mining production cycle, blasting is the most economical and efficient method to fracture and move the ground (rock material). It is commonly accepted that blasting has less influence on slope stability than geology and ground water. However, in some situations of sensitive slope behavior or where needed to protect important infrastructure, blast design takes increased relevance as a variable to consider. |Due to the nature of blasting, it is inevitable to damage, to some degree, the rock mass behind the slope face in an open pit operation. Along with rock mass damage, ground vibrations are another undesirable consequence of blasting. However, there are practical procedures based on experience and trial and error that may be implemented to minimize both rock mass damage and potentially damaging ground vibrations. The use of presplit blastholes and control of the amount of explosive detonated per delay are typical techniques used to help mitigate such unwanted effects. Recently, through the use of electronic initiation systems for mine blasting, timing and initiation sequence have become additional variables which allow for improvements in blast performance that warrant further study. Several methodologies are currently available to assess the vibration levels generated by a production shot. The most commonly used approach by the mining industry to assess ground vibration levels is scaled distance. However, in this approach, timing between holes or explosives charges is not a variable that can be assessed by that method. Moreover, there is no clear guideline as to what exactly constitutes a delay. This paper presents the application of a novel approach to predict and control ground vibration levels using improved signature hole technique or waveform superposition. The novel approach is semi-empirical, accounting for the vibration characteristics of the ground through the measurement of the signature waveform, including a Monte Carlo scheme, rendering a stochastic approach more preferable than a deterministic one.|",,43

P., School of Mineral Resources Engineering, Technical University of Crete","|Abstract: |In this study three series of indirect tensile tests, the Brazilian test, the flattened Brazilian (FB) test and the ring test, were performed in order to determine the indirect maximum tensile stress of Dionysos marble. A number of circular disc specimens (D = 54 mm) was prepared by coring Dionysos marble cubes normal to the plane of transverse isotropy. Different sets of circular discs were prepared by varying the loading angle 2<U+03B1> and the internal diameter for the FB test and ring test respectively. All specimens were prepared by following the ISRM suggested methods and the load was applied using a stiff 1600 kN MTS hydraulic testing machine and a 500 kN load cell. This paper focuses on the comparison of the indirect maximum tensile stress resulting from the three different tests and the calculation of the theoretical and experimental coefficient k for the FB test and ring test. The coefficient k is a function of the loading angle 2<U+03B1> and the ratio q (internal to external diameter) for the FB test and the ring test respectively. |Introduction |It is well known that tensile failure is an important phenomenon in the mechanical winning of minerals, drilling and blasting of rocks, rock failure of underground and surface works, as well as in structural engineering practice. Therefore, the reliable experimental determination of the tensile strength of rocks is essential to the design of such systems. |Conventionally, the tensile strength of rock should be determined using the direct tension test; however, this test presents experimental difficulties and is not commonly conducted in rock mechanics laboratories. These difficulties arise due to both the bending stresses or torsion moment (caused by the eccentricity of machine axial loads) and the localized concentrated stresses (caused by improper gripping of specimens) (Barla and Goffi, 1974, Nova and Zaninetti, 1990).|",,4
551,552,2016-814,Predicting Fracture Intensity and Measuring Uncertainty from Borehole Data,"Hekmatnejad, A., University of Chile| Emery, X., University of Chile","|Abstract: |This paper presents a methodology to predict the fracture intensity and to measure the uncertainty associated with it, which could be expressed in terms of variance or probability intervals conditioned to the information of the fractures observed on boreholes. The methodology relies on the assumption that the fracture centers are distributed according to a Poisson process and is applicable in case of lineic data (scanline) as well as cylindrical well data. The principle is to produce a set of realizations of a Poisson-Boolean model that honors the available data (conditional simulation) and to assess the fracture intensity on each realization. The conditioning to observed fractures can be made for the Poisson-Boolean model because the fractures and their locations are independent of each other, which agrees with many models that have been considered in recent researches. The numerical values obtained through the realizations can be combined to predict the fracture intensity and to measure the uncertainty in the actual values. |Introduction |A comprehensive understanding of fracture systems is critical to the economic development of underground mining, open pit mining, tailing dam, oil and gas reservoirs, geothermal reservoirs, groundwater resources and underground nuclear wastes disposal. As a rock mass property, fractures must be characterized in the three-dimensional space, whereas observations are limited to 1D (boreholes) and 2D (outcrops, drift walls), moreover very often to rather short stations, so that the available data are subject to geometric, truncation and censoring biases. Fracture characteristics include the number of fracture sets and, for each set, the number, orientation, spacing, location, shape and size of the fractures must be inferred from data sampling. Some important parameters that are considered nearly in all models are the fracture intensity and fracture size. |Many authors have shown how to estimate the fracture size distribution from outcrops, drifts and tunnel walls (Baecher, 1980; Laslett, 1982, Lantuejoul et al., 2005) and microseismic data (Tafti et al., 2011, 2012; Aminzadeh et al., 2013). In this study, we will focus on the fracture intensity, which is defined as the mean area of fractures per unit volume of rock masses and denoted as P32 (Dershowitz and Herda, 1992; Chiles and de Marsily, 1993). Fracture intensity is one of the preferred ways for describing the fracturing of a rock mass as, unlike other intensity descriptors, it is non-directional and gives an indication of the amount of fracturing of a rock mass. However, its value is derived from directionally biased methods, so, while it is a good indicator of overall fracturing, its estimation still depends on being able to compensate for known biases.|",,34

This study builds on previous work where multicluster cased & perforated completion designs were optimized using 3D frac and reservoir simulation (Sebastian et al., 2015). |This paper presents the results of an integrated completion optimization approach that combines the benefits and flexibility of using new completion hardware (coiled tubing activated sliding sleeves) and state-of-the-art 3D non-planar fracturing and reservoir modeling to optimize performance in a horizontal Eagle Ford Shale well. The overall goals of this work were to determine the production potential related to 100% cluster efficiency through single point injection, to optimize completion/frac design via changes in design parameters (sleeve spacing, injection rate, and injection volume), and to further validate modeling capability. |This document focuses on the fracture and reservoir modelling prediction and validation efforts to optimize execution of the trial. The results shown here were generated with a coupled 3D non-planar hydraulic fracturing simulator that uses the discrete element method to simulate the hydromechanical processes governing hydraulic fracturing propagation. Once the fracture geometry and associated conductivity were generated, they were exported to a 3D reservoir flow simulator, which in turn, generated curves for expected well productivity.

The behavior of the system is modeled by coupling a thermo-poroelastic displacement discontinuity (DD) method (for fracture opening and shear, fluid and heat diffusion in the reservoir matrix) with a finite element method (for fluid flow and heat transport inside the fractures). The nonlinear characteristics of fracture opening and shear deformation are taken into account. The resulting method is then used to simulate an injection/production processes into/from a synthetic fracture network consisting of a major fracture intersected by a set of smaller natural fractures. Injection/production into/from the fracture network results in gradual shearing of the fractures that impacts the thermo-hydro-mechanical characteristics of the fracture system. It is also shown that the early micro-seismic events can be associated with fracture slip on smaller connected fractures due to thermal perturbation. Continued injection leads to stress intensity conditions favorable for fracture propagation in shear and tensile modes, which could increase the reservoir surface area and further contribute to seismicity. |Introduction |Design and management of enhanced geothermal system (EGS) and hydrothermal reservoirs can benefit from simulation of coupled fracture deformation and fluid flow - since interactions among fluid and heat flow, and the mechanical response of the fracture and matrix impact reservoir permeability variations and occurrence of seismicity. The coupling between these processes during injection/extraction can be taken into account using linear theory of thermo-poroelasticity. Often, heat transport in a reservoir is dominated by advection. However, when the rock matrix permeability is low (Delaney, 1982) and fluid flows mainly within deformable fractures or a fault, conductive transport in the rock matrix leads to important phenomena related to coupling between temperature, pore pressure, and stress that may result in delayed rock matrix and/or natural fracture failure, potentially producing delayed seismicity. Although the thermo-poroelastic constitutive equations are linear, analytical solutions can be found only for relatively simple geometries and processes (e.g., Tao and Ghassemi, 2010; Ghassemi et al. 2008; Li et al. 1998; Kurashige, 1989) and the solution of problems such as injection /extraction into a deformable fracture network requires numerical modeling even in two dimensions.|",,54

In the absence of proppants, dilatancy of the natural fractures during shear reactivation is required to provide sufficient aperture and hydraulic conductivity. If a hydraulic fracture intersects a natural fracture, the fracturing fluid enters the natural fractures, increasing pore pressure and decreasing the effective normal stress on the fracture plane. If the effective normal stress becomes low enough, the natural fracture may slip and dilate, resulting in increased aperture and hydraulic conductivity. To understand these processes, we conducted direct shear tests on rock fractures with constant normal load and examined the effect of slip and dilatancy of asperities on mechanical aperture. Using 3D coordinates of the surface asperities and measuring shear displacement and dilation during shear testing, the evolution of the mechanical aperture was calculated as a function of slip and normal stress. The calculation suggested that when effective normal stress is low, small slip events along a rough surface can induce dilatancy along the fracture surface that will cause considerable increases in the hydraulic aperture of the fracture. |Introduction |Proppants are introduced during hydraulic fracturing to increase fracture transmissivity during well production (Cipolla et al. 2009). But can fracture conductivity also be increased without proppant, for example, by water fracing? (Mayerhofer et al 1997). In contrast to conventional propped hydraulic fracture treatments, water fracs rely on reactivation of natural fractures to induce permanent shear induced dilation, which enhances reservoir permeability (Chen et al 2000, Weng et al 2015). Although the conductivity of un-propped shear-induced fractures is relatively low compared to that of the propped fractures, such conductivity can still play an important role in enhancing the productivity of ultra-low-permeability rocks like shale (Zhang et al. 2013, Weng et al 2015, Jansen et al. 2015).|",,19

M., BOS Technologies LLC","|Abstract: |This study seeks to better understand geothermal energy development risk in Washington State. In this region, crustal stress is dominated by the complex tectonics of the Cascade volcanic arc, and active faulting promotes and sustains geothermal reservoir permeability and provides connection to the postulated heat source. Three prospect-scale sites were selected for Phase 1 of a geothermal play-fairway analysis (PFA); Mount St. Helens seismic zone (MSHSZ), Wind River valley (WRV), and Mount Baker (MB). In Phase 1 of the PFA, heat and permeability potential was modeled from existing and publicly available data which are integrated into a map for each site of geothermal development potential using weighting derived from a multiple experts-opinion approach using an analytical hierarchy process. A heat potential model was created based on the locations of Quaternary volcanic vents, hot springs, Quaternary intrusive rocks, geothermometry, and temperature gradient data. Permeability potential was estimated using three dimensional modeled fault geometries in an elastic half space that slips in response to tectonic crustal stresses estimated from regional strain rates modeled from publicly available Global Positioning System (GPS) velocities. Volcanic deformation at MSHSZ and MB are modeled as Mogi sources of deformation. The resulting permeability potential analysis reveals 1) if faults are acting as fluid conduits or barriers, 2) the portions of faults likely to host fluid flow where slip is promoted and large slip gradients imply damage, and 3) the geometry of adjacent rock volumes that have dense fracture networks due to locally concentrated stresses that provide the porosity and permeability to host a commercially viable reservoir. Geometric fault location uncertainty is explored to determine where improved constraints would significantly alter predicted geothermal potential and thus target new data acquisition planned in Phase 2 of the project. |Introduction |Geothermal resources require heat, fluid, and permeability.

B., University of Minnesota","|Abstract: |The objective of this study is to deploy ultrasonic waves toward better understanding of preexisting and evolving fractures in rock, with the dual focus on i) reconstructing the curvilinear fracture geometry, and ii) mapping the distribution of its heterogeneous specific (shear and normal) stiffness. This is accomplished via the 3D Scanning Laser Doppler Vibrometer (SLDV) that is capable of monitoring the triaxial particle velocity at every scan point on the sample's surface. Experiments are performed on slab-like granite specimens featuring either stationary or evolving fractures where the fracturing, in the latter case, occurs in 3- point bending configuration. The rock specimens are then excited, under the plane stress condition, by a piezoelectric transducer at 20-30kHz, while the in-plane velocity response of the sample is monitored over a rectangular region covering the fracture. Thus obtained full-field data are next used to recover both the fracture geometry, and to expose its nonlinear contact behavior. The latter is then approximated point-wise in terms of the linearized contact properties i.e. specific (shear and normal) stiffness, whose recovered spatial variations for stationary and advancing fractures are found to conform with expected trends. |Introduction |Geometric and interfacial properties of fractures and related features (e.g. faults) in rock and other like materials are the subject of critical importance to a wide spectrum of scientific and technological facets of our society including energy production from natural gas and geothermal resources (Baird et al. 2013, Verdon and Wustefeld 2013, Taron and Elsworth 2010), seismology (McLaskey et al. 2012), hydrogeology (Cook 1992), environmental protection (Place et al. 2014), and mining (Gu et al. 1993). Unfortunately, a direct access to fracture surfaces in rock is, in most field situations, either non-existent or extremely limited (e.g. via isolated boreholes, shafts, or adits), which necessitate the use of remote sensing techniques where the contact law at the boundary of rock discontinuities is often assumed to be linear and represented in a parametric fashion via e.g. the so-called (shear and normal) specific stiffness, relating the contact traction to the jump in displacements across the interface (Schoenberg 1980). Despite its heuristic and simplistic nature, the fracture's interfacial stiffness matrix not only is proven to be immediately relevant to the stress and thus stability analyses in rock masses (Eberhardt et al. 2004), but also bears an intimate connection to the fracture's hydraulic properties (Pyrak-Nolte and Nolte 2016, Pyrak-Nolte and Morris 2000), and may serve as a precursor of progressive shear failure along rock discontinuities (Hedayat et al 2014).|",,10

F., University of Minnesota","|Abstract: |Brittleness, as a description of post-failure response, has a crucial role in understanding the behavior of rock under different structural conditions, including geometry and size. Despite the importance of this concept, there is no standard testing method for measuring brittleness and many different definitions have been reported. It is known that in fracture of rock, brittleness depends on the rock type, geometry, and size of the structure, as well as loading conditions, as the ratio of stored elastic energy to dissipated fracture energy depends on rock, geometry, and size. To investigate brittleness, two different types of laboratory experiments are suggested. The surface instability test is used to study brittleness in compression and it is shown that the ratio of uniaxial compression strength to surface instability peak strength could be used as a brittleness index. In addition, three-point bending tests are advocated to evaluate brittleness in tension. Since size effect is present because of the competition between stored energy per volume and dissipated energy per area, experiments performed in mode I fracture clearly demonstrate brittleness. As a consequence, as the size increases, the structural response becomes more brittle. |Introduction |Post-peak response, a common measure of structural failure and sometimes referred to as brittleness, is crucial in many rock engineering applications, such as identifying placement of fractures for stimulation of low permeability formations [1], predicting the stability of a borehole during drilling [2], and hydraulic fracturing [3]. |In a traditional sense, “brittle” means the inability of a material to undergo inelastic deformation without loss of load-bearing capacity [4]. Thus, ductile behavior is characterized by the ability of the material to support an increasing load as it nonlinearly deforms. The term brittle is also used in the context of fracture, to describe the absence of inelastic energy dissipation in the creation of a new surface [5]. Finally, brittle is often applied to the instability of a structure once peak load is reached [6].|",,61

Especially, prior to the final failure of zigzag, the dominant spectrum of vibration signal will gradually move from multi-peak high frequency to single-peak low frequency band. Maybe, the work can interpret the shear-slip mechanism of earthquakes and even provide warnings of failure and instability of zigzag gouge fault. |Introduction |Dynamic slip on a stressed fault - the severe consequences of large earthquakes and the desire to reduce this risk have led, rightly, to major research programs around the world. It is well known that geological faults slip at a wide range of velocities and with significant amounts of gouge. Experimental studies have verified that during the recurrent cycles, fault strength has an extended memory of prior slip history that may be expected from rate- and state-dependent friction [1]. The recurrence varies approximately inversely with loading rate of shear stress and very short recurrences correspond to the higher shear velocity [2-4]. Therefore, faults will strengthen with the decreased slip (slip strengthening) or decreased shear velocity (velocity strengthening). One of the topics of special interest for earthquakes is the search for a better understanding of seismic energy releases and possible precursory changes as slip propagates along the fault plane. For laboratory-scale research, acoustic emissions (AEs) measurements may prove useful as probes of fabric development when slip occurrence, because the variations in AE intensity and number of events can be linked to the growth and propagation of specific fabric elements, accompanied with elastic energy release. Although AE seems to be quite common, little attention has been given to characterizing AE signals with shearing and slipping of simulated faults.|",,10

Our results confirm that detonations may be used to stimulate the rock more uniformly in the near field of the explosion. In addition, we observe synergistic interactions among multiple charges. However, these same results indicate that such mechanisms alone cannot stimulate the rock at the ranges away from the wellbore achievable via hydraulic fracturing. We also investigate the influence of bedding planes and natural fractures upon the energetic simulation process and determine that favorably oriented discontinuities can enhance the range of the stimulated zone. |Introduction |Dynamic fracture stimulation methods based on the detonation/deflagration of energetic materials may provide an alternative stimulation technology for geothermal and petroleum-bearing formations (Reeves and Weida, 1995). Hydraulic fracturing involves slow fracture propagation and fracture orientation is largely controlled by principal stress magnitudes and orientation (Eaton, 1969; Simonson et al., 1978). With increasing rate of injection, such as achievable with explosives or propellants, it is possible to create fractures at arbitrary orientations and potentially stimulate the near wellbore region more uniformly (Reeves and Weida, 1995). Such an approach relies on the ability of stress waves from an explosive charge to overcome the in situ stresses and create fractures in various directions, in contrast to one preferentially aligned fracture formed during hydraulic fracturing. However, it is also well known that shock waves emanating from a detonation can compact the rock and reduce the permeability (Reeves and Weida, 1995). In this study, we investigate the influence of detonations upon the permeability of the host rock for a range of explosive and formation scenarios. Additionally, dynamic stimulation may also require less water than current hydraulic stimulation technologies, extending reservoir stimulation to resources in waterstressed regions.|",,26

Improved performance is achieved by removing model features which are of little significance to the results and yet cause a significant computational overhead. To properly account for the effective proppant conductivity, we introduce a new technique for the measurement of proppant conductivity using a resistivity core holder. The conductivity of petroleum coke—a potential candidate to be used in the field—is tested in the laboratory. Resulting measurements are used to forward simulate the tool's response to multiple fracture geometries and sizes. Distinct results are obtained for fractures with different spatial distributions of proppant, indicating the possibility of distinguishing between them using a future inverse solver. |Introduction |Hydraulic fracturing continues to play a crucial role in unlocking oil and gas production in unconventional reservoirs. To better design hydraulic fracturing treatments, it is important to predict how fluid-driven cracks will propagate under various conditions; several models, including fully coupled porous flows and geomechanical models [1-4], have been proposed for this purpose. Validation of these models’ ability to predict complex fracture networks, however, requires the capability to measure fracture dimensions with diagnostic methods. From another perspective, prior knowledge of the Stimulated Reservoir Volume (SRV) provided by fracture diagnostics can greatly improve the reliability of reservoir simulations. |The need for and efforts on fracture diagnostic methods have been growing with the improvement of hydraulic fracturing techniques. One common technique is to use proppant tracers, which can be detected by radiation sensors, for near-wellbore proppant detection [5, 6]. One shortcoming of such methods, aside from the obvious radioactive material safety concerns, is that the radiation from proppant located far from the wellbore is harder to detect, thus reducing the sensitivity to the size of the propped fracture. Near-wellbore temperature and water hammer measurements can record the signature of fracture spacing, length and formation inhomogeneity. However, these measurements suffer from non-uniqueness, which makes the extraction of fracture properties very challenging [7, 8].|",,30

The field consists of four production and four injection wells drilled into Precambrian metamorphic rocks. The purpose of this project is to stimulate a sub-commercial well, RRG-9 ST1, using a combination of hydraulic and thermal techniques. These stimulations have led to a significant improvement in the performance of the well. Over time, injection rates have increased from near zero in June 2013 to the current flow rates of 3546 Lpm (937 gpm) (February, 2016), at constant or decreasing wellhead pressures. This injectivity improvement was achieved through a combination of three hydraulic stimulations accompanied by thermal contraction of the surrounding rocks from continuous injection of sub reservoir temperature water from the geothermal plant. Geological studies, borehole imaging, and temperature surveys indicate that the water injected into RRG-9 ST1 flows into a fracture zone at 1722 m MD (5650 ft.). It is suggested this fracture zone connects with a larger northeast-trending shear zone within the Elba Quartzite referred to as the Narrows Zone. This zone acts as both a barrier and a conduit to fluid movement within the field. Both thermal and hydraulic stimulation effects contribute to the increase in permeability and injectivity of the well. |Introduction |The Raft River geothermal field located roughly 160 km (100 miles) northwest of Salt Lake City on the Utah-Idaho border is the site of a Department of Energy (DOE) Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS) demonstration project. Four production wells (RRG-1, 2, 4, and 7) and four injection wells (RRG-3, 6, 9 ST1, and 11), drilled into Precambrian rocks, produce roughly18,925 Lpm (5000 gpm) generating between 10.5 and 11.5 MW of electrical power, Figure 1. |Geologic analysis, geochemical data, microseismic monitoring, and borehole imaging provide a conceptual model of the geothermal system surrounding RRG-9 ST1. Both production and injection wells encountered nearly 1524 m (5000 ft.) of discontinuous Quaternary and Tertiary volcanic and volcanoclastic rocks before reaching the metamorphic Precambrian basement. Further treatment of the geologic setting of Raft River is given by Konstantinou et al. (2012) and Nash and Moore (2012). Geochemical analysis of water collected from the wells indicate that the geothermal reservoir is split into northwest and southeast compartments with little or no fluid communication between them. Ayling and Moore (2013) suggest the field is separated by a low permeability northeast striking, steeply dipping fault located in the Precambrian basement, referred to as the Narrows Zone, Fig. 1. Microseismic events attributed to the stimulation program occur in a linear trend moving to the northeast, consistent with the location of the Narrows Zone. The open hole section of the RRG-9 ST1 was imaged in 2012 and a permeable fracture was identified intersecting the well at 1719 to 1725 m MD (5640 to 5660 ft.) striking to the northeast in the direction of the Narrows Zone. It is suggested that projecting this fracture to the northeast will lead it to intersect with the Narrows Zone.|",,36

Various methods have been proposed to alleviate detrimental effect from the compressional stress shadow for maximizing hydraulic fracture length. However, price usually is paid to alleviate this effect, which requires additional energy or fluid injection. In this paper, we present a new perspective to optimize multistage stimulation of multiple horizontal wells completed from pads. The new methodology utilizes the tensile stress bulb that is formed beyond the fracture tip during hydraulic fracturing treatment. The size of tensile stress bulb is dependent on several factors, such as fracture size, rock properties, poroelastic effect. Unlike the compressional stress shadow, this tensile stress bulb can be effectively used to reduce fracture propagation resistance for fractures originated from adjacent wells. Fracture propagation can become relatively easier or accelerated once the tensile stress bulbs from adjacent wells overlap and result in a strong tensile stress superposition, which may also drive the generated fractures from neighboring wells propagating further. If this additional fracture growth is not taken into account in the planning of well spacing and pump schedule, fractures from neighboring wells can communicate, which leads to asymmetric fracture geometry and unanticipated fracture length. Symmetric fractures with similar SRV (stimulated rock volume) among multiple wells are desirable in efficient field development and management. To achieve this purpose, an optimal fracturing sequence combined with optimal pump schedule is proposed for generating symmetric fractures. Simulation results demonstrate the potential business impact on well completion result and cost reduction. |Introduction |Technology development of horizontal drilling and multistage hydraulic fracturing has played an important role in unconventional resource development. Drilling multiple horizontal wells from a single pad has increasingly become a common approach, which can reduce drilling cost, shorten drilling time, and reduce surface footprint.

564,565,2016-864,A Parametric Study on Gas Outbursts Induced by Gas Desorption,"Zhi, Sheng, Pennsylvania State University| Elsworth, Derek, Pennsylvania State University","|Abstract: |Violent gas outbursts are one of the most severe hazards in underground mining. When outbursts occur, a large amount of coal and gas is suddenly and violently ejected into the roadway and working area with the possibility of serious hazard and injury. Recent studies have shown that the physical behavior responsible for the energetic failure of coal is entirely consistent with coal viewed as a dual porosity-dual permeability-dual stiffness continuum where strength is proportional to effective stresses, and where effective stresses are controlled by both the pore pressure and varying stress field. Gas desorption driven by overstress is highlighted in this study as the key factor responsible for the increase in pore pressure close to the working face, and implicated together with elevated stress level, permeability evolution and drainage conditions in the triggering of outbursts. In this work, we incorporate the likely mass rates of desorption driven by an increase in abutment stress and mediated by permeability evolution to define the rates and distributions of gas pressure changes. The changing pattern of pressure redistribution is identified, and parametric studies are then performed to investigate all the key factors that influence the redistribution of pore pressure with respect to the deformation of the coal seam. Permeability evolution in the overstressed zone is determined by the evolution of porosity, which is attributed to both the change in effective stresses in the abutment and sorption-induced strain. This model is capable of predicting the potential risk ahead of the working face during mining and can be adapted to different conditions in terms of varying mechanical factors, coal properties and mining methods. |Introduction |Gas outbursts in coal mining are defined as the instantaneous and violent ejection of brittle coal, rock and a massive volume of gas, potentially damaging mining machinery, underground support and causing physical injury to personnel. It has been recognized as one of the most severe hazards in underground mining since its early reporting in the 1850s. More than 30,000 outbursts have occurred historically, of which reportedly the most disastrous accident caused 187 deaths in the Piast area of Poland in the Nowa Ruda Colliery, in 1941 (Lama and Bodziony, 1998). Nineteen outbursts driven by both of methane and carbon dioxide have been recorded in the Collinsville area, Australia since the first case killing seven men in 1954 (Harvey, 2002). Although the frequency of occurrence of outbursts has reduced in recent years with the development of technology and improved mining methods, outbursts remain a dangerous phenomenon in the global underground mining industry.|",,44

Comparison study between drilling in shale and synthetic rock-like materials (RLM) of similar strength is included. The samples of shale and RLM were prepared to be characterized and drilled in different orientations (i.e. 0°, 45° and 90°) with respect to bedding for shale-samples and to the corresponding selected axis for RLM-samples. Physical measurements and mechanical tests were conducted to characterize the rocks and determine their anisotropy. Laboratory drilling experiments were performed using a 35mm dual-cutter PDC bit. Various weights on bit (WOB) were applied with constant water flow rate under atmospheric pressure. Drilling cuttings were collected and analyzed. Relationships between WOB, drilling rate of penetration (ROP), depth of cut (DOC), and drilling cutting size were determined. Results show increase of ROP and DOC with increasing WOB. Results also show that cutting sizes increase with the increase of WOB and they can exhibit the material anisotropy.

Y., School of Civil Engineering, Wuhan University| Liu, Q. S., School of Civil Engineering, Wuhan University","|Abstract: |Successfully creating multiple hydraulic fractures in horizontal wells is critical for unconventional gas production economically. When multiple hydraulic fractures propagate simultaneously, each open fracture exerts additional stresses on the adjacent fractures, which is often named as stress-shadow effect. Stress-shadow effect has significant influence on the local stress field in the surrounding rock, which will influence the geometry of hydraulic fractures. With the framework of partition of unity for discontinuity modelling, this paper developed a high-order Generalized Finite Element Method (high-order GFEM) to investigate the propagation of three dimensional (3D) non-planar fractures including hydraulic fractures without re-meshing. In this paper, this high-order GFEM is developed to investigate the behavior of hydraulic fractures. The present method can be regarded as a development of the FE-Shepard-based GEEM and mesh-free method for discontinuity modelling. Compared to the FE-Shepardbased GFEM, the salient feature of this method is to construct high-order global approximation without generation of extra unknowns. In the first numerical test, this high-order GFEM is validated by an existing experiment. In the second numerical tests, this high-order GFEM is used to investigate the influence of stress-shadow effects and confirming stress. |Introduction |Shale gas/oil production has played a critical role in meeting US energy demands. Handling the development of hydraulic fractures is critical for enhancing gas/oil production and reducing the risk of reservoir treatment. It is already known that in-situ stress has significant impact on the geometry of fracture development. Therefore, realistic three dimensional (3D) non-planar fracturing simulation is critical to the design and optimization of reservoir treatment. With the development of computer science, numerical methods have become one of the most effective approaches to understand the evolution of fractures, because it offers a physically consistent and numerically accurate way to model the underground large-scale geometric discontinuities. |Finite Element Method (FEM) (Zienkiewicz and Taylor, 2000; Tang et al., 2013, Paluszny et al., 2013) is the most widely used numerical approach in engineering and have been utilized for 3D fracture propagation last several decades. However, finite element meshes and fracture surfaces are required to be coincident which will significantly increase the difficulty of simulation. If fracture propagation is taken into account, the mesh sizes are required to be updated in each step and the difficulty associated to mesh generation is furtherly increased. In addition, the meshes are required to be more refined in the vicinity of fracture tips than in the remainder of the model, in order to obtain sufficiently accurate solution for the fracture analysis (Moes et al., 2014).|",,42

The codes used by the two teams are based on different numerical principles, and the assumptions made were also different, due to intrinsic limitations in the codes and the modelers’ personal interpretations of the field observations. Both sets of models were able to produce the most important field observations and both found that it was the combination of the vertical gradient of the fracture opening pressure, injection volume, and the use/absence of proppant that yielded the different outcomes of the five experiments. |Introduction |Two decades after the conclusion of the Fenton Hill Hot Dry Rock (HDR) project, disagreements still exist among experts regarding the reservoir creation and stimulation mechanisms in the two phases of the field experiments.

A., Idaho National Laboratory| Xia, Y., Idaho National Laboratory| Podgorney, R., Idaho National Laboratory| Mattson, E., Idaho National Laboratory| Huang, H., Idaho National Laboratory| Ghassemi, A., University of Oklahoma","|Abstract: |In this study, we use a combination of modeling techniques to describe the relationship between fracture radius that might be accomplished in a hypothetical enhanced geothermal system (EGS) and drilling distance required to create and access those fractures. We use a combination of commonly applied analytical solutions for heat transport in parallel fractures and 3D finite-element method models of more realistic heat extraction geometries. For a conceptual model involving multiple parallel fractures developed perpendicular to an inclined or horizontal borehole, calculations demonstrate that EGS will likely require very large fractures, of greater than 300 m radius, to keep interfracture drilling distances to ~10 km or less. As drilling distances are generally inversely proportional to the square of fracture radius, drilling costs quickly escalate as the fracture radius decreases. It is important to know, however, whether fracture spacing will be dictated by thermal or mechanical considerations, as the relationship between drilling distance and number of fractures is quite different in each case. Information about the likelihood of hydraulically creating very large fractures comes primarily from petroleum recovery industry data describing hydraulic fractures in shale. Those data suggest that fractures with radii on the order of several hundred meters may, indeed, be possible. The results of this study demonstrate that relatively simple calculations can be used to estimate primary design constraints on a system, particularly regarding the relationship between generated fracture radius and the total length of drilling needed in the fracture creation zone. Comparison of the numerical simulations of more realistic geometries than addressed in the analytical solutions suggest that simple proportionalities can readily be derived to relate a particular flow field. |Introduction |Development of enhanced geothermal energy recovery systems (EGS) with low electricity costs could revolutionize energy use in the U.S., as over 200 zetajoules of energy is estimated as extractable in the upper 3-10 km of the Earth's crust.

While this is generally understood, the magnitude of the fracturing needed, and the attendant length of wells needed to create and access the fractured volume is only infrequently discussed.

Though researches have been done on this issue, it is still necessary to investigate further the mechanical behavior of underground structure during an earthquake and corresponding efficient seismic enhancement. In this paper, in order to find an optimum ground-improvement pattern for rectangular-shaped box culvert constructed in soft ground that does not meet the present seismic requirement, numerical tests with nonlinear 3D dynamic FEM are conducted. Different patterns of the ground improvement for the rectangular-shaped box culvert constructed with cut-and-cover method are investigated to find out an optimum pattern that can reduce the impact of earthquake in the most effective way.

Fracture mechanics studies show that the propagation of mechanically closed fractures often involves both mode I and II propagation. Wing cracks are triggered by shear deformation at the tip of the natural fractures. These wing cracks tend to reorient and extend in the direction of maximum compressive stress. In addition to mode I propagation (i.e., wing cracks), natural fractures may also propagate in mode II in a plane approximately parallel to the pre-existing natural fracture. A displacement discontinuity method with Mohr-Coulomb elements is used in this paper to study the response of natural fractures to water injection. Modeling results indicate that the onset of fracture slip occurs when the initial shear stress exceeds the shear strength of the Mohr-Coulomb contact elements. The results show that injection into a single natural fracture may lead to the coalescence of multiple natural fracture which can be regarded as an important advantage of this stimulation technique. However, it was found that network connectivity and fracture coalescence is less likely achievable through simultaneous injection into multiple natural fractures mainly due to the compressive stress shadow in the vicinity of the neighboring fractures caused by the shear slip. |Introduction |EGS design concept in a number of field projects (Soultz, Desert Peak, Newberry) relied on the conceptual model of permeability increase by slip on natural fractures due to water injection. The conceptual model envisions injection pressures below the minimum in-situ stress to cause slip on the critically-stressed fractures and or induce shear failure of the rock mass. However, Jung (2013) presented a review of the results and observations from a number of EGS experiments and suggested that the hitherto adherence to stimulation by shear or “hydro-shearing” is the main reason for the poor progress in the EGS success. Based on interesting interpretations of a number of phenomena, Jung argued that tensile fracturing and not shear slip or propagation is the main mechanism of stimulation, recommending a return to the conventional stimulation concept. In this paper, we review the concept of wing-crack propagation and show this mechanism is in fact, an integral part of the shear slip stimulation mechanism and that a shear propagation mode is also plausible and can contribute to permeability and MEQ. The process is similar to the shear failure in laboratory triaxial compression tests on rock whereby tensile and shear cracks coalesce to form a macroscopic shear crack or fault across the sample. And although individual tensile cracks do form in the process, the failure is referred to as shear failure.|",,3

Until this study, very little data existed regarding hydraulic loads on 3D blocks or regarding the mechanics of erodibility of 3D blocks beyond simple cubes or prisms. Proper understanding of the block scour processes is necessary to ensure the safe and reliable operation of key civil infrastructure, such as dams, bridges and water conveyance tunnels. This paper covers the experimental results and observations from physical hydraulic model experiments to determine 3D block erodibility. The results of the hydraulic modeling are used to develop a block theory framework for analysis of block erodibility. |Introduction |Scour processes play an important role in the evolution of natural rock landscapes as well as present a potential hazard to civil infrastructure such as dams, spillways, bridges and water conveyance tunnels (Fig. 1). Removal of individual blocks of rock is a primary mechanism by which scour can occur and, accordingly, proper understanding of block scour processes is necessary to ensure the safe and reliable operation of such structures. Evaluation of 3D block erodibility requires detailed knowledge regarding hydraulic loads applied to the block in both a spatial and temporal sense.

572,573,2016-843,A Novel Approach to Mapping Hydraulic Fractures Using Poromechanic Principles,"Kampfer, Gunther, Statoil ASA| Dawson, Matthew, Reveal Energy Services","|Abstract: |Hydraulic fracturing has been instrumental in commercializing ultra-tight unconventional resources. Although hydraulic fracturing has been used for nearly half a century in more than a million wells, understanding and mapping hydraulic fracture growth remains a challenge for ultra-tight reservoirs. A number of approaches have been taken to better understand and characterize hydraulic fractures in the subsurface, but a technology which can accurately map hydraulic fractures with minimal operational interference and negligible cost remains elusive. This paper discusses the technical foundation for a novel hydraulic fracture and proppant mapping technology (IMAGE Frac), which is technically robust, easy to use, and low cost. The technology is founded upon basic linear poromechanics theory, utilizing measurements from surface pressure gauges during the stimulation process to determine the geometry, orientation, and spatial location of hydraulic fractures with what is believed to be higher precision than other traditional techniques. An overview of the technical foundation of this technology is provided with an illustrative example showing how this technology can be applied. In addition, key sensitivity studies, examining the impact of fracture geometries, mesh size, formation properties, number and size of fractures per stage, and fracture symmetry are provided. These sensitivity studies illustrate the potential for a robust fracture mapping technique to be developed using the fundamental principles discussed herein. |Introduction |Recent advances in hydraulic fracturing, including multi-stage fracturing, novel completion tools, and use of slickwater & hybrid fluid systems (King 2010), have enabled economic production from North American shale reservoirs. Well productivity in these ultra-low-permeability reservoirs is largely controlled by the stimulation effectiveness (i.e., the ability to create a large matrix-fracture contact area with optimal conductivity distribution). During field development, multiple horizontal wells are drilled on a pad, so identifying the optimum well spacing or pumped fluid/proppant volumes to maximize the value of a pad is critical. Currently, well spacing is often optimized based on numerous well spacing field trials, which is a costly and inefficient approach. An improved understanding of hydraulic fracture geometry using systematic methods, therefore, has potential to significantly improve the value extracted from ultra-low-permeability plays.|",,0

In this paper, the impact of creep (time-dependent deformation) on coal permeability has been experimentally studied using a triaxial rig. The bituminous coal sample used for the triaxial creep test was excavated from Bowen Basin, Australia. Methane gas was used in the triaxial test to investigate the effect of creep triggered by pore pressure depletion on permeability during desorption under constant hydrostatic and axial stresses. The results show that the creep induced to coal results in a significant drop in coal permeability when approximately zero creep rate is reached. Permeability measurements show that drop of pore pressure in a step manner from 2.5 MPa to 1.5 MPa, 1 MPa, and 0.5 MPa leads to decrease in permeability loss ratio of 16.8%, 6% and 5.4% for each step change. Permeability rebound was not obtained in our experiments for this range of pressures. The experimental results of this study can shed light on complexity of interaction of gas transport and timedependent deformation of coal during gas drainage. |Introduction |Coal as a soft rock experiences compaction when pore pressure depletes and effective stress increases during Coal Seam Gas (CSG) drainage. The increase in effective stress during gas drainage causes the reservoir to undergo compaction (Schatz and Carroll, 1981). This mechanical induced compaction causes permanent deformation of coal microstructure and loss of porosity. As a result, a reduction in permeability and weaker response to gas drainage is predicted in the coal influenced by compaction creep. Also, deeper coal seams undergo less deformation owing to restriction on stress relaxation in and around the working face during mining. The impact of creep on permeability is more important for lower rank coals located at shallow depth as they are softer than higher rank coals and therefore they experience more creep. Creep compaction of rocks, as a long-term process, occurs very slowly at the equilibrium state that has been reached in millions of years. However, creep process and shrinkage of rocks are accelerated when subsurface fluids are drained from the rocks via drainage boreholes. Deformation in coal can occur much faster due to being much softer than adjacent rocks (roof and floor rocks) (Brantut et al., 2013; Kaiser and Morgenstein, 1981). Negligence of the impact of compaction creep on coal permeability may result in misestimating the level of drained gas. This may lead to a delay in mining operations due to the need for addressing residual hazards associated with methane gas such as coal and gas outburst and asphyxiation.|",,35

In this article, experiments on acoustic emission characteristics of the Pulse Hydraulic Fracturing (PHF) process under different pulse frequencies, are carried out by the large-size true tri-axial hydraulic fracturing test system and the PAC AE instrument. The acoustic emission behavior evolution characteristics, the damage evolutionary rule, the AE location distribution and the dynamic feature of b-value are analyzed. The results show that the evolution of acoustic emission behavior stimulated by PHF in coal bed can be divided into four phases with time: gentle period, acceleration period, boosting period and steady period. The damage evolution process can be divided into three phases: initial damage period, damage development period and damage accelerating development period. Our results show that AE information can reasonably reflect the damage evolution character of coal. Besides, a lower frequency corresponded to a stronger AE energy release and a higher intensity of fracture extension inside the samples during the PHF process. Also in this case, a number of AE events were produced at early stage, where AE location distribution was more homogenous. For the b-value, during the whole PHF process, its variation was similar under different frequencies. |Introduction |In China, most of the coalbed methane reservoirs have a very low permeability with a permeability coefficient of approximately (0.001-0.1)<U+00D7>10-3 mD (Karacan et al., 2011). Also, coalbed methane has different occurrence states, which brings great difficulties for the exploitation of coalbed methane (Huang et al., 2009). Pulse hydraulic fracturing (PHF) is a new stimulation method to enhance the effective permeability of coal seams, improving the production of coalbed methane. The fundamental mechanism of pulse hydraulic fracturing is that fracturing fluids with a certain frequency are injected into coal, resulting in the rupture of coal and forming a well-distributed fracture network due to the pulse loading (Li et al., 2014). At present, the PHF technology has only been applied in industrial tests in some domestic mines and just a few scholars have studied it. Lin et al. (2011), Li (2013), and Zhai et al. (2011) studied the mechanism of PHF from the point of view of energy, fatigue damages and pulse pressure wave. Li (2014) conducted experiments of PHF to investigate the effect of pulse frequency on the fracture propagation. Zhao et al. (2008) conducted field tests and found that the pulsed high-pressure water injection technology could effectively improve the permeability of coal seams and increase the yield of gas. However, there have been few attempts to study the acoustic emission (AE) characteristics in the hydraulic fracturing process. Acoustic emission (AE), which is produced by microcrack occurrence or growth, is a ubiquitous phenomenon associated with brittle fracture in many materials such as rock and concrete (Zhou et al., 2007). AE techniques can continuously monitor the real-time micro-fractures developed in the coal pulse hydraulic fracturing (Polito et al., 2013), which can help to determine the morphology changes occurring inside the rock and determine the fracturing mechanism and the level of crack propagation.|",,38

M., Advantek Waste Management Services","|Abstract: |Geo-mechanical parameters are very important in petroleum industry. In order to obtain the geomechanical parameters, the sonic log (compressional and shear velocities) should be available. In many cases, the sonic log is not available or missing from the log data, for that cases the existing correlations are used to predict sonic time, most of the existing correlations use the compressional velocity to predict the shear velocity. |The objective of this paper is to develop simple and accurate mathematical model to determine the compressional and shear sonic times using log data (gamma ray, bulk density, and neutron porosity). These three logs are commonly conducted at every well and they are always available. Three artificial intelligence techniques namely; ANNs (Artificial Neural Networks), ANFIS (Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System), and SVM (Support Vector Machines) are used. Finally, an attempt has also been made to converge the results into one simple empirical correlation using the weights of ANN model in order to make a generalized model that can be used for field applications. |The results obtained showed that ANNs model successfully predict the compressional and shear sonic times from log data with 99% accuracy giving correlation coefficient of 0.99 when compared to actual field data. |Introduction |Accurate prediction of rock mechanical parameters is critical for alleviating the risk associated with the drilling and maximizing the well productivity. Rock Mechanical parameters are used in optimizing the well placement, wellbore instability evaluation Moos et al., 2003 [1], completion design, draw-down limits to avoid sand production Santarelli et al. 1989 [2], hydraulic fracturing, and many other applications. Inaccurate determination of rock mechanical parameters leads to heavy investment on decisions and field development, Abdulraheem et al. 2009 [3]. |Generally elastic parameters can be estimated from the sonic logs (compressional and shear velocities) using regression dependent correlations, Potter and Foltinek 1997 [4] and Pickett 1963 [5]. Log derived, dynamic rock parameters should be calibrated to core derived static (laboratory) parameters, because the static measurements more accurately represent the in-situ reservoir mechanical properties, Edlmann et al. 1997 [6]. Many of the correlations for elastic parameters determination were been reviewed by Chang et al. 2006 [7]. They concluded that calibration of the empirical correlations between physical parameters and strength is necessary for any correlation to be used with degree of confidence.

The presence of higher stress conditions are more likely to lead to design challenges with respect to mitigating unexpected pillar failures during mining production. Preventing failure means properly assessing the depth of stress-induced brittle fracture damage, together with the corresponding deformations (rock mass dilation/bulking) and loading of the rock support system. Our understanding of these processes and means to assess them are relatively limited as most empirical design systems and failure criteria have been developed for shallower mines and tunnels. Spalling is one of the more frequent pillar damage responses observed at greater depths. Loss of cohesion under low-confinement due to spalling leads to reductions in the effective width of pillars, which results in reduction of their load carrying capacity. This study describes a 3-D extensional strain criterion for assessing spalling potential, and examines its application to the evaluation of a network of extraction-level pillars for a block caving operation. A 3-D numerical stress analysis is performed and the role of the intermediate principal stress on the extent and spatial distribution of spalling is also investigated. The influence of sequencing is illustrated using spalling potential hazard maps for a typical sequencing scenario. |Introduction |Woo et al. (2013) and Eberhardt et al. (2015) report that over the last 20 years, block caving operations have increasingly moved towards larger footprint areas and greater mining depths, with the latter now exceeding 1200 m depth, double the historic trend. This move towards deeper caving operations will require that the higher stresses that will be encountered be accounted for in extraction level pillar design, both in terms of pillar dimensions and support. By mining deeper, not only can more energy be stored in the pillar in the form of elastic strain energy, but also there is more energy available for release through brittle fracture and failure. In the case of a block caving extraction level, failure of individual pillars can lead to closed drawpoints, or worse, might lead to failure of adjacent pillars and the loss of a large number of drawpoints resulting in lost production, sterilized ore, and ultimately hazards that may threaten the safety of personnel.|",,21
577,578,2016-760,A Simplified Dilation Model for Modeling the Inelastic Behavior of Rock,"Rahjoo, M., Geological Engineering/EOAS, University of British Columbia| Eberhardt, E., Geological Engineering/EOAS, University of British Columbia","|Abstract: |Strength degradation and brittle fracture processes in rock result in inelastic deformations that can be measured during triaxial compression tests. Post-peak behavior is accompanied by lateral dilation which is observed as bulking of the sample, or of the failing rock mass in the case of a highly stressed underground opening. Dilation models describe the evolution of these bulking characteristics as a function of confinement and loading history. Comparing existing dilation models used in practice, these either assume a constant dilation value that oversimplifies the post-peak behavior of rocks, or they require the determination of numerous parameters that make them difficult to apply. In this paper, a new empirical dilation model is proposed that not only captures the dilation characteristics of rock but also requires a minimum number of parameters as inputs. The model facilitates determination of the required parameters from conventional triaxial compression tests as well as implementation of the model in numerical codes. |Introduction |Stress-induced failure of a rock mass around an underground opening is accompanied by large inelastic deformations that have the effects of adversely loading the support system and creating other operational hazards. Of special concern is the post-peak behavior of rock, which is accompanied by lateral dilation and bulking of the failing rock. A small amount of dilation is also observed in the pre-peak behavior of rock. Dilation models describe the evolution of dilation characteristics of rock as a function of loading history and confinement. |Using continuum mechanics and the theory of plasticity, dilation models establish a relation between plastic deformation increments (dep1, dep2, dep3) during the course of inelastic straining of the rock. dep1, dep2 and dep3 are components of the plastic deformation increments in the direction of maximum, intermediate and minimum principal stresses, respectively. Dilation models with dep2 = 0 dilation models are expressed as a function of dep1/dep3 or by using a parameter called the dilation angle <U+03C8>. <U+03C8> is related to dep1/dep3 and is defined as a function of loading history and confinement. |Conventional triaxial test data can be used for characterizing rock dilation as a function of loading history and applied lateral confinement (<U+03C3>3). Loading history is usually measured by accumulative plastic shear strain <U+03B3>p = epaxial <U+2212> eplateral, where epaxial and eplateral are accumulative axial and lateral plastic strains, respectively. The underlying assumption here is that the incremental plastic deformations, depaxial <U+2265> 0 and deplateral < 0, do not change sign during the course of inelastic straining. From triaxial tests, <U+03C8> can be evaluated from plastic (inelastic) deformation increments as: |(equation) |The evolution of the dilation angle obtained from triaxial tests can be demonstrated using 2D plots in <U+03A8> - <U+03A8>p coordinates (Fig. 1), or using 3D plots in <U+03A8> - <U+03A8>p - <U+03A8>3 coordinates. The obvious pattern in dilation data is that under a constant applied confinement, dilation angle increases at the onset of inelastic deformation of the rock and reaches its peak value, followed by a gradual decrease. The peak dilation angle value occurs under unconfined tests, <U+03A8>peak(<U+03C3>3 = 0), and reduces with increase in confinement.|",,30

E., The University of Texas at Austin| Schultz, R. A., The University of Texas at Austin","|Abstract: |Veins generate mechanical discontinuities in shale formations due to their strength and stiffness contrast with the rock matrix. These heterogeneities in naturally fractured reservoirs can exert control on hydraulic fracture propagation path as demonstrated in experimental studies [1]. To investigate micromechanical fracture interaction behavior and to perform sensitivity analyses of vein properties on fracture diversion, we numerically modeled Semi-Circular Bend (SCB) tests of Marcellus shale core samples containing calcite-filled veins using the Particle Flow Code in three-dimensions (PFC3D). The numerical results correlated with experimental fracture propagation and interaction results over a range of approach angles and vein thicknesses. Further sensitivity analyses on vein properties indicated that veins with lower strength and higher stiffness contribute to more fracture diversion than veins with higher strength and lower stiffness. The vein thickness controlled the fracture travel distance inside the vein where thicker veins produced longer distance before kinking back into the rock matrix than thinner veins showing a weaker vein response. Additionally, the model showed that intergranular bond failure created microcracks within the vein as the induced fracture approached (prior to intersection), and this effect was stronger for the veins with higher stiffness relative to the rock matrix. The bond failure mode inside the vein and for the induced fracture was predominantly tensile rather than shear. |Introduction |Natural fractures are ubiquitous structures in the Earth's crust generated by geologic processes [2, 3]. Based on structural characterization from subsurface oil and gas reservoirs, natural fractures can range from uncemented frictional interfaces or open fractures to fully or partially cemented cohesive fractures [2, 4, 5]. |Cemented natural fractures (veins) not only have resistance against shear stress but also have tensile strength [6]. These filled natural fractures can have different mechanical properties than those of the host rock [7].

Authors ascertained that the hypotheses are verisimilar but not one of them was proved. They are introduced in empirical approach in order to compensate insufficient statistics data. Approach for estimation rock mass mechanical characteristics and Theoretical-Experimental method for estimation rock pressure manifestation in underground openings are proposed. |Introduction |In spite of rapid development of the comprehensive geomechanical theoretical models and powerful computer programs, empirical methods are predominantly used in the design practice. The main reason for this is the simplicity of these methods, certainty of baseline data and relative proximity of the predicted results to the data of field measurements. |Modern analytical and numerical solutions for 2D/3D nonlinear problems helped engineers to better understand the mechanism interaction between support structure and rock mass. However, imperfection of the theoretical models and lack of reliable initial characteristics of the rock mass have shown that the results of calculation are not reliable. |The rock mass classifications and support selection provided engineers with a standardized approach for the characterization of rock quality (Proceedings of the International workshop, 2007). The most widely used in current design practice are the following Rock Mass Classifications (RMC): RMR - Rock Mass Rating system (Bieniawski, 1973); Q - Tunneling Quality Method (Barton et al., 1974); U - Quantitative Ground Classification, based on contour displacement criterion (Regulation Guide, 1983). In order to compensate the limited statistical data gathered in field observations, engineers introduced plausible hypotheses and assumptions in these classifications. The ideal method for the design of underground constructions shall take into account not only Geological and Geomechanical conditions (in situ stress state and mechanical properties of the rock mass; dip angle of seams and discontinues; opening direction with respect to strike direction), but also Technological parameters of the system “support – rock mass interaction” (dimensions of the opening cross section; rate of opening driving; distance and time of support installation from the face; type of construction: drill-and-blast (D&B) or tunnel boring machine (TBM); type of support: concrete, shotcrete, anchors or yielding support; contact conditions: full contact or backfilling between opening contour and support or grouting of backfilling; type of opening: separate opening, chamber, parallel or intersection of the openings).|",,23

Subsequently, the influence of in-situ stress, azimuth, cleats and proppant on the non-planar hydraulic fracture propagation rule in natural coal was studied. The results show that the propagation mode of non-planar hydraulic fracture is controlled by the combined effects of different factors: the coal cleats and well deviation determine the local fracture geometry, in-situ stress state dominates the main direction of fracture zone and bedding planes impede fracture height growth. As hydraulic fracture initiated along a direction skewed with wellbore, the extension path of hydraulic fracture near the wellbore would affected by cleats, and more complicated fracture geometry with many fracture branches would formed. Moreover, adding proppant will increase propagation pressure significantly, and the increase of proppant diameter will result in a higher degree of complexity for the proppant migration in flexural fracture and higher fracture propagation pressure. Therefore, the main factor, causing the difficulty of hydraulic fracture propagation, is the complex fracture geometry characterized by the twisting main fracture and the generation of secondary fractures near the wellbore. |Introduction |Unlike conventional gas reservoirs, the coal matrix permeability is extremely low. Hydraulic fracturing treatments have become an indispensable part of stimulating in coal reservoirs. Moreover, directional well fracturing technology is commonly utilized to enhance the drainage volume of single CBM well and economic yield. |During the process of directional well fracturing in coal seams, the double effects of disturbed stress field and cleats around the borehole were believed to have significant impact on both initiation pressure and fracture geometry. Previous experimental studies [1-3] based on homogeneous concrete specimen neglected the influence of cleats. Some authors [4-12] who conducted experimental researches of vertical well fracturing did not consider the effect of disturbed stress field on fracture geometry caused by the deviation of wellbore.

This paper provides a review of SRM modelling practices, with the objective to reaffirm important aspects of modelling rock mass behavior. |Introduction |The last decade has witnessed an increase use of numerical modelling for simulating the mechanical behaviour of naturally fractured rock masses. In this context, the synthetic rock mass (SRM) is a numerically based approach that can be used to address one of the main challenges in rock mechanics, that is establishing representative rock mass properties, and fully account for anisotropic effects and rock mass scale effects. Rock mass classification systems such as the RMR (Bieniawski 1989), Q-index (Barton et al. 1974) and the GSI (Hoek et al. 1995) are traditionally used to derive properties for numerical analysis of rock engineering problems.

Interactions between natural fractures and the approaching hydraulic fracture are impacted by stress state and formation geomechanical properties, stress shadow due to local in situ stress alteration, and fluid and proppant transport. The created combined natural fracture-hydraulic fracture network is very complex and will represent more realistically the production forecasting through reservoir simulation in shale reservoirs. |In this research study, a new approach using the integrated 3D complex discrete fracture network (DFN) and hydraulic fracturing flow model has been applied as a case study to accurately evaluate hydraulic fracturing in naturally fractured shale reservoirs. Production forecast as a result of the fluid flow simulation has been handled utilizing unstructured grid blocks exclusively created for the specific 3D DFN. A case study elaborating these processes has been conducted based on the data from the Eagle Ford shale. The complex DFN model, the integrated DFN, fluid flow model, and the input dataset have been validated against microseismic fracture mapping and commingled production data obtained from a well pad located in the Eagle Ford oil window.

Historically, the traditional approaches used to evaluate the fracturing techniques were typically based on a fracture network model which was pre-established at a fixed location.

For such high Reynolds numbers, turbulent flow is likely to occur. In this paper, we investigate the effect of turbulence on the propagation of hight contained hydraulic fractures, commonly referred to as PKN fractures. We discuss different scalings for the fracture width, length and pressure under limiting laminar, turbulent smooth and turbulent rough flow regimes. We implement an explicit, central numerical scheme to solve the continuity and friction factor based momentum conservation equations, taking into account the full variation of friction factor with Reynolds number and relative fracture roughness. The scheme is validated against the analytical solution of the PKN model. The results show that the local Reynolds number evolves from a maximum value at the inlet to zero at the tip, with a transition from turbulent to laminar at some point along the fracture length, depending on the value of inlet Reynolds number. Results showing the effect of smooth and rough turbulence on the fracture length and fracture width depending on the Reynolds number are finaly presented. |Introduction |The usual approximation of laminar flow in a propagating hydraulic fracture sometimes breakdown. This is the case of fluid-driven fracture propagation at glacier beds where Reynolds numbers above 105 are expected (Tsai and Rice (2010)). At such large Reynolds numbers, the flow is well within the turbulent rough regime. Recently, Ames and Bunger (2015) have investigated the effect of a fully rough turbulent flow on the propagation of height contained hydraulic fracture (Nordgren (1972)) and derived scaling relationship for that flow regime. However, in practice for a hydraulic fracture treatment in an oil and gas reservoir using a low viscosity fluid injected at very large injection rate, the Reynolds number for a height contained fracture are expected to be in the range 103 – 104 at most (see Table 1 and 2), right in the transition between the laminar to the fully turbulent regime. We focus solely here on a height contained fracture as depicted in Fig. 1 (i.e. the so-called PKN geometry). In parallel to the problem formulation, we also review the available experimental data and models covering the complete flow conditions spanning the complete spectrum of Reynolds numbers from laminar to fully turbulent. We notably discuss the use of an equivalent Reynolds number proposed by Jones (1976) to use the available data and models developed for flow in pipes to the case of elliptical cross-section encountered in the PKN geometry.|",,40

Intact specimens of Opalinus shale exhibit highly heterogeneous microstructures with significant concentrations of micron-scale, foraminifera fossils, pyrite crystals and well-defined bedding planes, all of which are absent in the reconstituted specimens. Porosimetry shows that the natural specimens contain a single dominant pore size ~18 nm, while the reconstituted specimens have a bi-modal pore distribution, with inter-aggregate pores O[102] nm that decrease in size with the applied consolidation stress. There is no directional dependence in P-wave velocity for the reconstituted specimens, while P-wave measurements parallel to the bedding planes of intact specimens are characteristically 2.5x larger than those normal to the bedding planes. |Introduction |The understanding of geomechanical behavior of shales is critical for their wide range of applications. Shales are used as caprocks in geological systems for carbon sequestration (Rutqvist, 2012). They are also under consideration as host rock in geological repositories for disposal of radioactive wastes (Marschall et al., 2005). To evaluate the sealing capacity of shales for such applications, the porosity and mass transport process need to be well investigated. Shales can be also the rich sources of ‘unconventional’ shale gas and the evaluation of their hydrocarbon deliverability requires a comprehensive understanding of the porosity and permeability (Sondergeld et al., 2010). |Insight into the microstructural features of shales is of primary importance to fully understand and interpret their macroscopic response particularly the mass transport properties (Keller et al., 2011; Keller et al., 2013; Sondergeld et al., 2010). Most of the available data on macroscopic behavior of shales are based on the characterization of a limited number of natural materials that feature significant variability related to the heterogeneity of diagenetic bonding and cracks, while bedding features result in strongly anisotropic mechanical properties. The evolution of porosity and microfabric during sedimentation, the effects of diagenetic bonding and the bedding planes are important for analyzing the mass transport process in shales. A more reliable basis for predicting the geomechanical behavior of these sedimentary rocks may be through preparation of reconstituted samples based on resedimentation of the natural material. In the resedimentation technique, the sediment slurry is mixed and then incrementally consolidated to a target axial effective stress. This procedure results in production of uniform, repeatable and saturated specimens (Abdulhadi et al., 2010; Adams et al., 2013; Schneider et al., 2011). The proposed technique enables us to fundamentally understand the shale behavior by comparing the characteristics of natural and reconstituted materials.|",,19

D., Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of California","|Abstract: |A better understanding of the strength distributions and the seismic response of asperities failing within a cohesive (or breakdown) region of the growing shear rupture is important in many engineering disciplines, such as, hydraulic fracture and induced seismicity. In the laboratory, a fault is experimentally modeled by a 400 mm x 80 mm x 12 mm PMMA slider sheared across a large PMMA base plate. A pressure-sensitive film was employed to localize and size, and measure normal stress upon contact junctions. Moments prior to rapid sliding, multiple discrete and localized dynamic events (or foreshocks) were observed at a section of the fault that exhibited a sparse to dense transition in asperity distribution. Experiments showed that foreshocks occurred as the crack (rupture front) moved into the resistive patch of densely distributed asperities. We use the results of pressure sensitive film asperity measurements to develop a heterogeneous finite element (FE) model that studies the effect of asperities within the cohesive region have on the expanding shear crack. Slip accumulated heterogeneously during the loading cycle due to the non-uniform distribution of asperities. We study the constitutive behavior of a frictional interface where local slip is determined by the asperities and their ability to communicate elastically. A foreshock (Mw ~ -7.4) was simulated in a quasi-static manner by instantaneoulsy removing an asperity contact during the loading cycle. The foreshock increased shear stress perturbations to neighboring regions up to distances of ~ 10 to 15 source radii. |Introduction |Our understanding of earthquakes is that they are produced when either intact rock fractures rapidly or fractured rock interfaces experience rapid slip. Energy released from these processes is conveyed to frictional heating, wear of the faulting surfaces and seismic radiation. While seismic radiation is considered to be a small portion of the energy released during an earthquake (Aki, 2002), these waves are what we feel and can cause tremendous damage to infrastructure and loss of human life.

Current exploration workflows commonly involve analysis of the problem at the lithospheric scale where it is important to consider factors such as the flexural isostatic response of the lithosphere and thermal subsidence. This paper presents a methodology for addressing these issues in a combined mechanical-thermal analysis of passive continental margins. Particular emphasis is accorded to the procedure for incorporating the flexural isostatic response. The model domain is assumed to overly a dense, inviscid fluid representing the upper portions of the mantle that, whilst not explicitly modelled, contributes to overall isostatic balance. Simple test cases that validate the approach are demonstrated and the influence of the crustal rigidity in distributing loading via flexure is shown. The methodology is then used to address the evolution of realistic margin geometries. |Introduction |As exploration moves to target deeper, more complex environments there is an increasing demand for tools that can provide a more complete description of the structural and thermal evolution of sedimentary basins. This is most obvious in regions where the structural style is predominantly controlled by halokinesis, or salt tectonics. Notable examples include the Gulf of Mexico [1], offshore Brazil [2] and Angola [3], and the North Sea [4]. Hydrocarbon accumulations in these regions often benefit from the traps formed by movement of mobile and impermeable salt. |As the unique mechanical and thermal properties of salt facilitate the development of these convenient traps e.g. four-way dipping structures above salt domes, understanding factors governing salt behavior over geological time is of paramount importance. Controls on salt movement often focus on the inclination of the margin and the delivery of prograding sediment packages – both of which serve to drive salt towards deeper areas of the margin [5]. The control on both of these factors owes much to crustal scale processes such as flexural isostasy. The incorporation of such processes into a commercially available forward modeling package is the focus of this paper. Some space is accorded to a description of isostatic processes and the underlying computational framework. Benchmarks are presented that serve to validate the applicability and robustness of the implementation before it is used to address the two-dimensional development of a passive margin.|",,37

E., Kinross Gold Corporation","|Abstract: |A precise delineation of geometallurgical domains in an orebody can lead to improved production planning and comminution efficiency. This requires an accurate characterization of the variability of ore response to comminution and breakage force. Experimental analyses have shown that simple inexpensive rock strength tests can be correlated with ore breakage characteristics, and could therefore reflect intrinsic comminution behaviour. Establishing these correlations can reduce the number of expensive comminution tests required for orebody characterization. This study investigates the correlation between the point load strength test and comminution work indices at the Kinross Tasiast mine. The influence of rock microproperties and data measuring factors on this correlation is analyzed. Composites with corresponding point load strength and comminution work index data were determined for correlation. Point load data was averaged, and classified based on the failure types observed with respect to rock foliation. Sampling program, location and type of point load failure were used as filters for the correlation. The results show that the procedure for testing across different programs and sampling location can affect the correlation between point load strength and comminution behaviour. Sampling bias of mineralized units, and orientation bias of drill hole plunge were important for the correlation at Tasiast. Rock foliation is a microproperty found to significantly influence the point load strength behaviour. Stronger correlation was observed for rock samples that were point loaded perpendicular to foliation, than the samples tested parallel to foliation. |Introduction |Accurate characterization of ore response to breakage and comminution (crushing and grinding) is essential for optimizing a mine operation. This requires the capturing of the different forms of rock heterogeneity, i.e., material, structural and geometrical, at various scales (micro and macro) throughout an ore deposit. Geometallurgical models are commonly used to quantify the heterogeneity of an orebody by delineating spatial domains of integrated geological, mineralogical, geotechnical, and mineral processing data [1]. The precise delineation of geometallurgical domains can lead to significant improvement in mine planning, comminution circuit efficiency, and overall energy consumption [2].|",,46

L., Rockfield Global Technologies| Dutko, M., Rockfield Global Technologies| Yu, J., Rockfield Global Technologies| Armstrong, J., Rockfield Global Technologies| Parfitt, D., Rockfield Global Technologies| Mutlu, U., Rockfield Global Technologies America LLC","|Abstract: |This paper presents a number of emerging applications of hydraulic fracture initiation, propagation and interaction models. In the oil industry fracture design engineers often model hydraulic fracturing using 2D approximations but the physical process is inherently 3D and some very important aspects are lost during the model simplification, such as the means to impose a full 3D initial stress state and the capability of the fracture to propagate and potentially curve in an evolving complex stress state. A mode-1 3D hydraulic fracturing methodology is developed within an adaptive Finite Element Method (FEM) and Discrete Element Method (DEM) framework for generic fracture shapes. The fracture insertion process is based on a geometry update procedure rather than the more traditional DE approach of splitting elements along their edges or through the element itself. This leads to better control of the mesh quality and an improved performance of the numerical scheme. The applications include curving fracture paths and potentially connecting fractures from a multi-well stimulation stage. |Introduction |Hydraulic fracturing is a complex engineering process (Economides and Nolte, 2000) and understanding its key aspects are essential to a fracking design engineer whose main goal is to obtain a designed fracture complexity in the target reservoir (Cipolla et al, 2010; Economides and Nolte, 2000). A number of the complexities are inherent to hydraulic fracturing; such as material heterogeneity, local variations in stress and inadequacies in knowing the precise location of potentially several pre-existing fracture sets (King, 2010). Within a numerical framework (such as adaptive Finite Element (FE) (Zienkiewicz et al, 2005; Belytschko et al, 2000) and Discrete Element (DE) (Munjiza, 2004) methods) each of these knowledge gaps can be explored and their role in hydraulic fracturing better understood. In this paper enhanced production refers to the increase in fracture complexity. |The first attempts at quantifying hydraulic fracture almost exclusively centered on analytical schemes which provide a way of understanding some simple relationships between key variables such as fluid pressures and fracture widths (Yew and Weng, 2015). This simplicity comes at the cost of ignoring some of the major complexities which are observed in many hydraulic fracture jobs.|",,54

B., University of Waterloo","|Abstract: |“Simul-frac” and “Zipper-frac” are hydraulic fracturing (HF) techniques for stimulation treatments that offer simultaneous and sequential fracturing at proximal wells with the intention of maximizing fracture zone complexity. The idea of these techniques is to deliberately redistribute stresses during active injection around the wells to create inter-well linkages, and extend the stimulated volume to create a far-reaching fracture network. |Consider a two-well injection-production field case: if the rock mass natural fracture system is closely spaced and homogeneous at a large sampling volume, empirical homogenization functions could be developed to allow some modicum of consistent large-scale predictability of HF behavior. However, in a multi-well system in an anisotropic stress field, it seems more difficult to achieve this consistently because of the added complexity introduced by the deviatoric stress field and its orientation with respect to the existing rock mass fabric, as well as the induced changes in stresses caused by the injection/production activity (THM coupled). At the scale where the inter-well distance is perhaps only one order of magnitude larger, there is no chance that a homogenization approach can succeed: the system must be simulated with a discrete, stress-dependent block model. The Universal Distinct Element Code (UDECTM), a distinct element stress-displacement method, appears to be the most realistic commercial tool at this time for this class of problems, and it allows the study of the effects of fracture geometries and properties in a naturally fractured rock at different stress field anisotropy values. |Effects of Simul-frac and Zipper-frac along with effects of in-situ stresses on deformation and fluid flow are investigated in the context of hydraulic fracturing. Coupled hydro-mechanical modeling was performed in two dimensional simulations using UDECTM. Three scenarios of modified Simul-frac were studied to see how offset between the stages affect inter-well connectivity, mechanical deformation and fluid distribution. These 2D simulations suggest that in-situ stresses have a significant impact on the re-initiation direction of fractures. Zipper-frac offers a better inter-well connectivity than Simul-frac. Having an injection stages with offset leads to more deformation both in the inter-well and outer-well spaces.|",,57

West Caicos provides an ideal location to evaluate the factors that affect the porosity and unconfined compressive strength (UCS) of carbonate rocks that have undergone little (<10m) to no burial since deposition and because of the well-documented stratigraphic framework and constrained eustatic signal for the Pleistocene epoch. Schmidt hammer measurements taken on West Caicos were used to evaluate the variability in rock strength while hand samples were used to make thin sections and plugs to measure porosity, permeability, density, and UCS of collected samples. Field observations, in-situ measurements, and laboratory testing reveal there are three significant factors that control carbonate grainstone rock strength: (1) porosity and degree of cementation; (2) age and degree of exposure to meteoric fluids, and (3) degree of vadose zone weathering. Collected UCS data shows a strong relationship between degree of cementation associated with proximity to weathered horizons. There is an expected relationship between increased cementation, loss of porosity, and higher rock strength (UCS), but the new finding in this study is that these factors occur in the absence of burial or presence of overburden. |Introduction |Within the rock mechanics literature, there is a notable lack of studies that characterize the physical and mechanical properties of carbonates by facies at the time of or soon after deposition. Without this knowledge our understanding of how the rock properties affect deformation of carbonates during the time when changes may be most dramatic is limited. Several studies document the acoustic and petrophysical properties of Pleistocene carbonates facies which address rocks that have undergone some degree of burial, but do not include information on rock strength. (e.g., Anselmetti and Eberli, 1993; Eberli et al., 2003; Incze, 1998; Longman, 1980; Lucia, 1968; Schmoker and Halley, 1982; Steinen, 1974).

High injection pressure can be applied to help improve fracture initiation and maximize stimulated volumes. However, if the injection pressure is too high, the risk of compromising casing integrity during the injection process is also high. This case study presents a numerical estimation of the upper bound, or allowable maximum value, of the injection pressure window (IPW) with casing integrity. Also analyzed is the relative importance of factors that impact casing integrity in a horizontal well section under injection pressure. Various factors impacting the upper bound of the IPW are numerically simulated, including the (1) value of injection pressure, (2) distribution of natural fractures in formations, (3) cementing quality, (4) strength and geometrical properties of casing, and (5) values of initial geostress. Also presented are numerical results of stress distribution, displacement field, and plastic deformation within the model for a specific set of injection pressures. The discussed model consists of formations, cement rings, and casing. Numerical calculations of the mechanical behavior of the model are derived using the porous elastoplastic model for formation and the elastoplastic model for casing. Anisotropy of formations caused by non-uniform distribution of natural fractures within the formations is also mechanically modeled. |Introduction |In the oil and gas industry, a well that is not producing as expected may need stimulation to increase the production of subsurface hydrocarbon deposits, such as oil and natural gas. Hydraulic fracturing has long been used as a major technique for well stimulation. The rapid development of unconventional resources in recent years has led to a renewed interest in hydraulic fracturing, and multistage hydraulic fracturing in particular. Examples of such unconventional resources include, but are not limited to, oil and/or natural gas trapped within tight sand, shale, or other type of impermeable rock formation.

Various ground control design issues in weak rock masses are faced by most underground mines operating in Nevada. Numerical models complement field observations, instrumentation techniques, and testing by providing a better insight into the fundamental behavior and response of weak rock mass and its interaction with support systems. It facilitates development of a better design methodology and guidelines for excavation span and support design. MPBX arrays were installed in underground excavation and the displacements at MPBX nodes were observed for previous numerical model calibration. Time dependent numerical models were designed to take into consideration the effect of jointing using discrete fracture network (DFN) and rock bolts in 3DEC. Sensitivity studies were performed to understand the effect of various rock support design parameters on different excavation sizes. Rock bolt length and spacing was varied for numerical models to understand the effect of each parameter to stability of the underground excavations. |Introduction |Commonly, gold deposits in Nevada are found in highly fractured and faulted ground. Ground containing a large number of faults and fractures tends to be more susceptible to squeezing and moving. As ground squeezes and moves, safety begins to become a concern. In order to monitor this squeezing and movement of ground, Multi Point Borehole Extensometer (MPBX) arrays are commonly placed in areas of particular concern. |Multi Point Borehole Extensometers are composed of six anchor points and an integrated electronic readout head. The relative displacement between these anchor points is measured and recorded to determine displacements within the drift.

A., Energy Resources Engineering, Stanford University","|Abstract: |We present a Thermo-Hydro-Mechanical (THM) numerical simulation framework for thermal maturation of source rock. The framework allows for both fully-coupled and sequentially-coupled formulations. We employ a constitutive model based on ‘critical state plasticity’. The model accounts for both mechanical hardening and thermal softening due to kerogen conversion. The multi-component, multiphase flow and transport processes of both mass and heat are modeled at the macroscopic (e.g., Darcy) scale. The phase compositions and properties are described by a cubic equation of state; Arrhenius-type chemical reactions are used to represent kerogen conversion. The system of partial differential equations and associated constitutive relations is solved using finite-volume discretization schemes for the ow and transport of heat and mass, and a Galerkin finite-element method is used for the geomechanics. The THM simulation framework is demonstrated for an in-situ retorting problem with a single well. These THM capabilities have been integrated into the Automatic Differentiation based General Purpose Research Simulator (AD-GPRS) being developed at Stanford University. |Introduction |Oil shale is an organic-rich immature source rock. It consists of heterogeneous mixtures of organic matter (kerogen) and minerals. The mineral-kerogen mixture may appear in finely dispersed form, or in thin laminae (Eseme et al., 2007). The minerals and the organic matter can vary in composition with complex spatial arrangement of the constituents at all scales. Oil shale deposits often take the form of large numbers of thin layers (laminations) that can extend over long (areal) distances. Oil shale rocks are typically hard and brittle at room temperature with pressure dependent mechanical properties. The tensile strength and mechanical moduli of oil shale tend to decrease with increasing organic content. In shallow oil shale deposits, the difference between the in-situ vertical and horizontal stresses can be relatively small. The laminated nature of the deposit usually leads to (macroscopic) anisotropy in the tensile strength, which can be used to induce long fractures oriented nearly horizontally.|",,57

A simulation with its boundary improperly applied will result in significantly different results. Conventionally, a rigid or membrane-based boundary is applied for the discrete element method (DEM) simulation. This paper describes a 2D fast and flexible boundary detection algorithm for DEM simulation. This algorithm is localized so the speed is fast. Once the first element on boundary is searched and found globally, all the other elements on the boundary are searched locally. This algorithm is flexible, suitable for closed boundary (where the beginning element and the ending element share the same element, such as the inner boundary of a tunnel), or open boundary (where the beginning element and the ending element are not the same element) provided that the criteria for the beginning element and ending element are given. It is also powerful because it has the capability of handling any boundary shape, whether it is a regular circular or rectangular boundary or an irregular shape boundary. |With this algorithm, the boundary elements could be easily identified and updated periodically. Because of the fast performance of this algorithm, the boundary actually could be updated in each iteration. Once the boundary elements are identified, the forces applied on the boundary in a DEM simulation can realistically act on each real boundary element, rather than a rigid “wall” boundary or membrane-based boundary. |Numerical experiments further demonstrate the power of this algorithm. Even in a transient simulation where the boundary shape is changing dynamically in various irregular shapes, the boundary could still be captured easily to apply the realistic boundary forces. The algorithm discussed in this paper is for 2D simulation; however, it is expandable to 3D, which will be reported later. |Introduction |The role of the boundary condition is critical to a simulation.

A rigid boundary is valid and proper in a simulation if the actual boundary is a rigid boundary where the relative locations of the elements on the boundary and the shape of the boundary do not change during the simulation, so as to simulate a uniaxial compression testing experiment in two parallel plates where these two plates are the boundary, as illustrated in Fig. 1 (Tannant and Wang, 2007).

The results are analyzed in terms of Young's Modulus. A quadratic fit has been applied to the static data. This allows us to separate the mechanisms present into a linear elastic term, M1, which we believe to be dominated by the contact modulus. M1 is shown to be a constant throughout the entire unload and reload cycles. M2 is the nonlinear elastic term. The magnitude of M2 is due to the opening and closing of compliant pores. These interpretations result from the correlation we find between the linear term and the measured velocity and the nonlinear term with the measured irrecoverable strains. To our knowledge this is the first time the physical mechanisms behind the non-linear elastic response have been isolated. |Introduction |Static to dynamic correlations are locally dependent on mineralogy and texture. They are typically obtained in the laboratory by measuring velocity while performing tri-axial tests. These measurements are then up-scaled for use with logging tool data.

In this paper, a model of the wellbore under three-stage fracturing operations is designed and a cement block with the size of 400mm*400mm*400mm is selected to conduct the fracturing experiment under tri-axial stresses. It is observed from the experimental results that the first-stage fractures are planar fractures and the second-stage fractures are deviated single-slot fractures, while the third-stage fractures are concave fractures (bowl-shaped fractures). The secondary fractures are also found to grow in the area of stress interference between the firststage and second-stage fractures. It is also verified from the experiment that the stress interference between the fractures of different stages is the key factor that affects the fracture geometry during multi-stage fracturing. The induced stress on the planes of former stage fractures would cause the diversion of latter stage fractures. Therefore, during the multi-stage fracturing operations of horizontal wells in field, the stress interference can be adequately utilized to optimize the fracture operation so as to create complex fractures and connect natural fractures in the reservoir, which would improve the fracturing results. |Introduction |Multi-stage fracturing operations in horizontal wells would create multi-stage hydraulic fractures, the complex interactions would have a significant impact on the geometry of fractures inside the rock. That's the stress shadow. So far, many scholars have finished many researches on this theory, and put forward a large number of theoretical models to simulate the fracture geometry and stress interference under multi-stage fracturing. In 1987, US Department of Energy conducted hydraulic experiments in field. During construction work on two adjacent wells, they clearly tested out the phenomenon of neighboring well interference that the stress field was altered by induced stress caused by hydraulic fracture in adjacent well [1]. After comprehensive numerical simulation and field tests, Dowell Company (1995) believed that hydraulic fracture in formation can make stress distribution near wellbore change [2, 3]. Sneddon (1946) developed a mathematical model which derives the calculation formula for stress field around the crack in infinite elastic body [4]. Warpinski (1985) and Teufel (1982) gave an analytical solution that calculating stress field around a fixed-height crack [5, 6]. Liu et al. (2004) used the theory of elasticity and fluid-solid coupling to set up the mathematical model of induced stress of re-fracturing gas well, proving that the induced stress resulting from the initial hydraulic fracture can change the distribution of stress field of the gas well and lead to the reorientation of stress field [7, 8, 9]. With the theory of elasticity, Deng (2005) established a model of induced stress field for primary fracture and achieved the analytic solution by semi-retro-solution method [10].|",,31

The storage formations must have sufficient capacity and could avoid migration of CO2 to the surface. When the highly pressurized CO2 is injected into the geological repository the fluid pressure increases in the formation, which results in changes in stresses and deformation of the medium. From geomechanics point of view, the pressure caused by CO2o injection, should not exceed the formation strength and should not cause activation of existing faults. Therefore, finding a realistic estimation of alteration of stresses during the CO2 injection job, has been subject of several studies in the literature. Most of the analytical methods available in the literature to calculate the stress distribution are well established for single-phase flows, but it requires extension when a second fluid, in this case CO2, is also flowing. In the current work, an approximate analytical model is developed for calculating different stresses caused by injection of CO2 in a saline formation, assuming two phase flow pressure regime. Here, we investigated the stress regime under induced fluid pressure and temperature alterations during the injection time. |Introduction |Carbon dioxide storage or carbon dioxide sequestration refers to the processes by which captured CO2 is securely stored in deep geologic formations.

S., Queen's University","|Abstract: |Although it is recognized that the peak strength of the rock is a unique function of confining stress minus pore pressure (<U+03C3>3 – P), examples of laboratory or numerical studies that focused on investigating the effects of pore pressure on weakening or strengthening the crack damage (CD) stress has received less attention. The objective of this study is to examine, and gain a better insight into the capability of the Grain-based Discrete Element Method (GDEM) approach in mimicking the effect of pore pressure in weakening the peak strength, crack damage threshold (CD) threshold of material. A cohesive crack-based UDEC-Voronoi code is generated considering the real mineral heterogeneity of a crystalline rock. The hydraulic and mechanical properties of the micro-constituents of the model is calibrated. The compressibility and Biot coefficient of the material is determined by applying hydrostatic stress on a square sample. The simulation results demonstrate that like the peak strength, crack damage threshold also follows the “Terzaghi's effective stress law”. The modeling approach is able to evaluate the Biot coefficient of the crystalline rock based on its derived drained and solid matrix bulk moduli. |Introduction |There is a considerable body of experimental evidence which shows that the failure strength of a wide variety of rocks is a unique function of <U+03C3>3 – P, in which <U+03C3>3 is the total confining stress and P is the pore-fluid pressure. As a result, to a fairly good approximation Terzaghi's effective stress law (<U+03C3>3 = <U+03C3>3 – P) governs the failure strength of porous rocks (Serdengecti and Boozer, 1961, Handin et al., 1963; Murrell, 1965; Robinson and Holland, 1969, Dunn et al., 1973; Byerlee, 1975; Gowd and Rummel, 1977; Paterson and Wong, 2005). An example is given in Fig. 1. That is, in general, the differential stress for fracture strength of a particular rock is approximately the same at the same “effective confining pressure” when the latter is taken to be the total confining pressure minus the pore pressure. In addition to that, according to a series of triaxial compression tests, Brace and Martin (1968) concluded that the law of effective stress holds for fracture strength of crystalline rocks of low porosity (0.1-3 %) such as Westerly granite as long as loading rates are kept below certain critical values in order to maintain the drained loading condition during the test. It should be noted that most experiments support the conclusion that the Biot's coefficient (<U+03B1>) for failure of rocks is unity. And that, the Biot's coefficient for failure processes has no particular connection to the effective stress coefficient (Biot's coefficient) that appears in the theory of linear poroelasticity (Jaeger et al., 2009). As a result, the concept of effective stress coefficient in which the effective stress is equal to difference between the total stress (<U+03C3>3) and effective pore pressure (<U+03C3>.P) only applies for linear elastic deformation of the porous material, not to the non-linear part of the axial stress-axial strain curve. However, the peak strength of materials are governed by Terzaghi's effective stress law in which the Biot's coefficient is considered to be unity.|",,23

Modification of fracture apertures by reactive flows is strongly affected by non-reactive, non-wetting fluids that limit the fracture surface area and void volume that is accessible to the reactive fluids. An experimental investigation was performed to examine the controls on mineral precipitation within a fracture when mineral precipitation occurs with and without the generation of gas. Several differences were observed in the results from the experiments using the two chemical approaches for generating precipitates. The pore-filling precipitates (particles formed in solution) were more uniform in size and were thicker than the surface adhering precipitates (particles formed on fracture surfaces). The acoustic response for fractures with pore-filling precipitates reached a steady-state after 2 hours while fractures with surface adhering precipitates took longer to equilibrate because of the presence of CO2 that was generated during the chemical reaction at liquid– surface interfaces. In surface adhering precipitation case, the generation of CO2 limited accessibility of calcium carbonate prenucleation polymers to the entire void volume of the fractures. On the other hand, fractures with pore-filling precipitates exhibited a more uniform acoustic response across the fracture plane than fractures with surface adhering precipitates. Understanding the effect of mineral precipitation on acoustic wave attenuation provides a path forward for long-term monitoring of seal integrity. |Introduction |Geologic sequestration of CO2 in subsurface reservoirs relies on different mechanisms to contain the CO2 such as stratigraphic trapping, capillary/solution based trapping and mineralogical trapping. Stratigraphic trapping relies on “seals” that are low permeability rock, such as shale, that prevents the migration of CO2 to shallower depths or other regions in the subsurface. However, the integrity of seals depends on the presence of pre-existing fractures, the generation or reactivation of cracks/fractures/faults and the potential of sealing flow paths along such discontinuities through mineralization/precipitation. Sealed or partially sealed mineralized faults are observed in nature. For example, both the Refugio-Carneos fault in the Santa Barbara Basin of Southern California [1] and the Moab fault around Courthouse Rock and Mill Canyon in Utah [2] contain calcite cements. In both cases, the migration of methane-rich fluids mixed with meteoric water has resulted in the precipitation of calcium carbonate along segments of the faults.|",,10

Matrix stimulation process creates a zone of higher density fracture around the wellbore. A novel method called freezfrac was proposed earlier which relies on imposing thermal stresses around the wellbore to increase crack density around wellbore. Predictive simulation technology allows to investigate the high impact parameters more effectively prior to conducting expensive field tests. We are presenting an approach to capture the fracture initiation and propagation using cohesive zone model (CZM) embedded within the finite elements. We show that this approach can account for the multisite fracture pattern effectively. Moreover, we utilized our robust finite element model to perform uncertainty quantification on the permeability of the system. We assume that the uncertain formation physical properties are varying spatially around the wellbore and therefore we incorporated both parameter and field uncertainty in the system to estimate how the uncertainty will propagate to the response. The two es studied here are permeability and conductivity. We have shown that the effectiveness of the methodology in terms of fracture pattern prediction as well as the uncertainty on the enhanced permeability and conductivity in the system is due to the high degree of variability in the field parameters, measurement, and formation properties. This methodology can be effectively utilized to perform risk assessment on the hydraulic fracturing procedure prior to actual field operation. |Introduction |Rock Fracturing Phenomenon |For the past seven decades, hydraulic fracturing also known as “fracking” in the oil and gas industry, has been used as a means of rock matrix stimulation to improve hydrocarbon recovery from reservoir rock [1–3]. Besides, extensive research focused on methods of improving the fracturing technique has been conducted over the past two decades. In spite of all these recent advances, the knowledge of fracking currently used in oil and gas industry in many cases, is still based on empirical relations. The successful hydrocarbon recovery is closely related to rock properties, the most important of which is permeability. In tight formations such as shale, creating fractures is a beneficial effort that must be made if in-situ conditions of rock is devoid of proper connectivity of natural fractures. The intent of this paper is (1) to briefly discuss hydraulic fracturing and explain the importance of induced fractures, (2) to introduce thermal fracturing as one of the novel methods of rock stimulation, and (3) go over the idea and physical details of the Cohesive Zone Method (CZM) used in the context of Finite Element Method (FEM) to study the pattern and efficiency of thermal fractures. We will also present our findings with CZM parameters and their importance related to fracturing simulation. A complete study of flow of hydrocarbon in shale requires advanced geomechanical simulations such as thermal poroelastic analysis, i.e., stress deformation coupled with thermal analysis and flow in porous media. In addition to these simulation complexities, the time dependent creep behavior of shale and nonlinear rock properties must be included in the simulation. The software package and the methodology we present here is capable of incorporating all of these advanced simulation features; however our focus remain on the performance of CZM for rock fracturing process.|",,51

Long-term methane leakage usually relates to wellbore integrity issues and only recently has it been suggested that it can occur through the formation near the wellbore from damage while drilling or pressure cycling, and that conventional cementing may not prevent it. The severity of long-term methane leakage from wells is currently unknown. Thus, this research is investigating long-term leakage with special attention paid to the effect of pressure cycling from hydraulic fracturing on cement and near wellbore rock integrity. An apparatus has been designed that is capable of testing cement under various cyclic pressure conditions: the numerous hydraulic fracturing stages and the inevitable shutdowns and start-ups during production. It is capable of measuring permeability changes along the length of the cement in order to determine when and where damage occurs during pressure cycling. Cement and microannular degradation will be assessed through observed changes in permeability, computerized tomographic (CT) evaluation and visual inspection. Knowing the main cause of leakage allows for specific remediation and/or solutions to prevent leakage without guesswork. |Introduction |During the last thirty years, methane leakage from hydrocarbon wells has received significant attention from industry, government and the public. Recent studies (Boothroyd et al. 2015; Caulton et al. 2014; Karion et al. 2013; Miller et al. 2013; Rivard et al. 2014; Osborn et al. 2011) have increased not only public awareness but also concern because methane is a powerful greenhouse gas (Myhre et al. 2013). In a typical well steel casing is installed and the annular space between this casing and the drilled rock is filled with cement (Figure 1). Ideally, this cement provides a hydraulic seal in the casing- rock annulus. If this cement becomes damaged it can allow fugitive methane emissions (King and King 2013). Current emission estimates from surface facilities, cemented annuli and the surrounding rock are thought to be somewhere between 1 and 9% of the actually produced gas (Howarth et al. 2011; Kirchgessner et al. 1997; Petron et al. 2012; Ritter et al. 2013; Tollefson 2013). Methane leakage can be viewed as short-, medium- and long-term. Proper cement system design and good operational practices can easily mitigate short-term leakage that is often the result of wrong cement weights.|",,59

In theory, this variability can have implications for variability in nearwellbore stress conditions and for the behavior of hydraulic fractures during the early stages of pumping a hydraulic fracture treatment. This awareness has led to efforts to engineer completions designs to better suit the observed formation heterogeneity along the well. When data is available, a geomechanical well profile can be used to increase the likelihood that fractures will be initiated in locations where fracture initiation and growth will be easiest. These profiles require a sufficiently high-resolution characterization of reservoir quality and of geomechanical properties along the well. In this paper we investigate the utility of drill cuttings as a source of this data by using instrumented indentation measurements. We show data from a multi-well project in the Eagleford Shale that in layered heterogeneous formations cuttings can provide the necessary constraints on the degree to which near wellbore stresses may be partitioned by the rock. This in turn can help to address some aspects of the engineered completions objective. |Introduction |Many lines of evidence suggest that despite the significant advances made in recent decades to improve the effectiveness of multi-stage horizontal well completions, many wells produce at rates that are well below their potential. Production logging (fibre optic temperature logging, production logging, chemical tracers, etc) has confirmed this and demonstrated that even the best wells in a field contain stages, sometimes many stages, which are contributing little or nothing to the production of the well (eg. Cadwallader et al, 2015). Attempts to improve this situation require reliable data that can tell us something that we don't already know and that can allow meaningful optimization decisions to be made without significantly increasing costs or risks.|",,13

The reactivation of natural fractures can generally provide additional flow paths from formation to wellbore which play a crucial role in improving the hydrocarbon recovery in these ultra-low permeability reservoir. Thus, accurate description of the geometry of discrete fractures and bedding is highly desired for accurate flow and production predictions. Compared to conventional continuum models that implicitly represent the discrete feature, Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) models could realistically model the connectivity of discontinuities at both reservoir scale and well scale. In this work, a new hybrid numerical model that couples Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) and Dual-Lattice Discrete Element Method (DL-DEM) is proposed to investigate the interaction between hydraulic fracture and natural fractures. Based on the proposed model, the effects of natural fracture orientation, density and injection properties on hydraulic-natural fractures interaction are investigated. |Introduction |It has been widely inferred from numerical modelling[1], [2], laboratory experiments[3], [4] and microseismic monitoring [5], [6] that hydraulically-induced fractures in shale reservoirs often deviate from a simplistic biwinged fracture geometry. Complex fracture networks generically occur. Some complexity may be caused by stress shadowing resulting from multiple hydraulic fractures interfering during propagation or by interaction with pre-existing natural fractures. It has been widely accepted that in reservoir with ultra-low permeability such as Barnett, the natural fractures which are widely distributed [7]–[9] may result in hydraulic fractures branching and merging at the Hydraulic Fracture (HF) – Natural Fractures (NF) interface and consequently lead to the creation of the complex fracture network. Therefore, understanding the interaction between hydraulic fracture and natural fracture is important for quantifying the extent of the conductive fracture network and optimizing well completion strategies. |The fracture interactions depend on a variety of parameters including the in-situ stress magnitude and orientation, formation mechanical properties and degree of anisotropy, the existence of so-called dry zone or process zone, the natural fracture's mechanical and fluid transport properties and orientations, as well as treatment characteristics such as fracturing fluid viscosity, local injection rate, and proppant concentration. A number of methods have been used and attempted to understand the combined effects of these parameters on the morphology of the generated fracture network [10]–[13].|",,40

A combination of triaxial and injection experiments were performed on the cores to characterize their goemechanical properties and to better understand their response to stimulation treatment. Fluid flow was maintained across the samples throughout the experiments while stress, strain and acoustic emissions were recorded. Rock deformation and acoustic emissions data were analyzed, and the locations of events were shown to correlate with the fracture location in the samples. Some experiments were conducted at elevated temperatures to investigate the rock response to thermal stimulation. Data clearly shows increased AE activity and deformation with cold fluid injection into heated samples compared to isothermal injection. |Introduction |Enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) are expected to be a significant source of energy generation in the years to come. EGS development relies on creation of conductive pathways for fluid flow and heat exchange. Optimization of the reservoir development process such as drilling and stimulation can benefit from core testing. This paper describes a rock characterization and core testing program for a portion of the core from well GEO- N2, drilled at Newberry geothermal field. This well is located about 2.8 km from the western rim of the Newberry volcano caldera in Oregon, U.S.A.

605,606,2016-691,Determination of Maximum Horizontal Field Stress from Microseismic Focal Mechanisms - A Deterministic Approach,"Agharazi, A., MicroSeismic Inc.","|Abstract: |The state of field stresses is an important factor in the design and execution of hydraulic fracturing treatments. The absolute and relative magnitudes of horizontal stresses directly affect the minimum treatment horsepower requirement and the final stimulation pattern. While the minimum horizontal stress (<U+03C3>hmin) can be directly measured by a mini-frac or a leakoff test, there is no direct means to measure the magnitude of maximum horizontal stress (<U+03C3>Hmax). In this paper, we introduce a new method for determination of <U+03C3>Hmax direction and magnitude from microseismic focal mechanisms induced by hydraulic fracturing treatments. The focal mechanisms that meet a certain criterion are used to first determine the <U+03C3>Hmax direction. Knowing the direction of horizontal stresses, the reference coordinate system of principal stresses is formed by assuming the vertical stress as a principal stress. The normalized magnitude of <U+03C3>Hmax is then calculated for each qualifying focal mechanism as a function of normalized <U+03C3>Hmin magnitude. The undisturbed <U+03C3>Hmax magnitude is estimated by interpretation of calculated <U+03C3>Hamx magnitudes for all focal mechanisms. The method was used to estimate direction and magnitude of <U+03C3>Hmax for two projects in the Marcellus Shale, located approximately 30 miles away from one another. |Introduction |The state of stress in a formation can be characterized by direction and magnitude of the three principal stresses. For close-to-surface projects, where undisturbed rock is accessible, techniques such as over-coring, flat jack test, hydraulic fracturing, and borehole slotter (Jaeger et al., 2008, Amadei and Stephansson, 1997) can be used to measure the stress magnitudes at the study region. In the case of unconventional reservoirs, however, access to the undisturbed rock is very limited, and most conventional stress measurement techniques cannot be applied. A common assumption in these cases is that the vertical stress is a principal stress whose magnitude is determined by calculating the weight of overburden rock from density logs. This assumption holds true in most cases, considering the high depth of unconventional reservoirs, except for cases where a geological feature such as a fault or fold changes the state of stress locally. Given the orthogonality of principal stresses, this assumption requires that the other two principal stresses be horizontal. Thus, the problem of determining the field stresses is reduced to finding the direction and magnitude of horizontal stresses.|",,10

However, the simulation of such a hydraulically driven fracture remains a computationally expensive and difficult task. This paper presents a hydraulic fracture simulator based on the eXtended Finite Element Method (XFEM), which is a flexible means for simulating evolving discontinuities without having to assume a fracture path a priori. The simulator is a coupled dynamic model capable of simulating the propagation of two-dimensional non-planar hydraulic fractures in heterogeneous reservoirs. It is demonstrated that the presence heterogeneities with different stiffness leads to deviated fracture paths. |Introduction |Simulation of Hydraulic Fractures in its simplest form contains coupling of at least three physical processes: deformation of the solid matrix, fluid flow within the fracture network/porous media, and propagation of fractures (including both reopening of existing fractures and initiation of new fractures) (Shlyapobersky, 1985 and Adachi et al., 2007). At small scales, rock blocks in unconventional reservoirs are considered to have negligible permeability, and therefore, fracture network is the only pathway for fluid flow (Lange et al., 2013). Linear elasticity is the most prevalent constitutive model for the rock mass in small scale studies (Carter et al., 2000); however, application of linear elasticity results in an unrealistic solution as infinite stresses arise at the fracture tip. A very common solution for such a problem is application of cohesive models. Using a cohesive model ensures that stress at the fracture tip does not exceed the material strength, and that the fracture opens smoothly behind the fracture tip. |Cohesive elements are very common in Finite Element (FE) models of hydraulic fractures (Chen et al., 2009); nevertheless, such an approach requires the location of cohesive elements to be pre-assumed. As a result the model is unable to predict fracture trajectories under complex conditions.|",,3

Several injection cycles were carried out on each rock sample to measure the Fracture Initiation Pressure (FIP) and the stable Fracture Propagation Pressure (FPP) at various confining pressures. The measured FIPs were compared – and found to be in good agreement – with Rummel's model for FIP. The stable FPPs were measured using base SBM and SBM with Lost Circulation Material (LCM), and compared with the large-scale fracturing experiments conducted at the Drilling Engineering Association (DEA) 13 investigation. Our study shows that the stable FPP changes linearly with the minimum horizontal stress (Sh), and does not depend on the maximum horizontal stress (SH). In addition, for borehole diameter equal to or greater than 0.5 inch, the stable FPP is not affected by the borehole size. We propose an experimental approach to predict the stable FPP for arbitrary in-situ stresses, borehole size, and fluid formulation. |Introduction |Drilling Induced Fractures (DIF) grow as the borehole pressure exceeds the fracture pressure. In an intact rock, the DIF growth occurs in two phases: fracture initiation and fracture propagation (Morita et al., 1996). Fracture initiation occurs when the borehole pressure exceeds the FIP and results in formation of small DIFs near the borehole. Fracture propagation occurs when the borehole pressure is maintained above the FPP. During the fracture propagation phase, the formed DIF grows significantly in size (van Oort and Vargo, 2008). Enlargement of the DIFs result in formation of large fracture networks, which can create lost circulation problems. Lost circulation – the uncontrolled flow of drilling fluid into the geological formation – results in significant loss of drilling fluid. Severe lost circulation problems can complicate well delivery and increase the non-productive time. In extreme cases, they may lead to losing the well or necessitate drilling costly sidetracks (see e.g., Gradishar et al., 2013).|",,43

T., University of Houston| Hathon, L. A., University of Houston","|Abstract: |Triaxial testing is commonly used to determine the failure envelope for mudrocks. The most common application of this technique requires multiple identical samples. In heterogeneous formations identical samples are often difficult to obtain. Performing ‘multistage’ triaxial tests allows the friction angle and cohesion to be measured on a single sample. Multistage tests were performed on reconsolidated mudrocks to determine their strength properties as a function of cation exchange capacity (CEC), brine salinity, and sand content. The reconsolidation experiments were performed to an ultimate stress of 4000 Psi. Friction angle and cohesion were observed to increase as CEC decreased. This may be caused by either double layer or grain size effects. For samples with high CEC, changing salinity did not change rock strength, however. This may be due to incomplete hydraulic compaction at high stress during the reconslidation process. Friction angle increases with increasing sand content, while cohesion decreases. Future work includes investigating the role of total porosity and porosity type, grain size distributions, and percolating mineralogy on acoustic properties. |Introduction |The goal of this research is to further the understanding of the principal controls on mudrock geomechanical properties. The factors investigated for this study include: CEC (mineralogy), salinity, and sand content.

Due to this low permeability, they are difficult to characterize in terms of physical properties. The use of the reconsolidation technique allows us to determine mudrock properties while controlling mineralogy, brine salinity, and stress. Cation exchange capacity (CEC) makes these rocks water sensitive to double layer effects. Three properties were varied for this study: the cation exchange capacity, salinity, and silt content. To characterize the CEC we have performed conductometric titration and methylene blue colorimetry measurements. Our results are consistent with an external laboratory measured CEC using the cobalt hexamine technique. The methylene blue technique CEC measurements were ~25% higher for two of the three samples. The titratated CEC also correlates well with permeability and grain size. Salinity was observed to have a minimal effect on mudrock porosity. Double layer effects play a dominant role in determining permeability, based on the measured salinity effects as a function of CEC. Grain size however also has an influence. The effect of increasing silt content was to increase both porosity and permeability. |Introduction |This paper is to further improved understanding of mudrock rock properties.

Conventional analytical and semi-analytical fracture models are not enough to simulate the complex fracture propagation in these highly heterogeneous formations. Without considering the intrinsic heterogeneity, predicted morphology of hydraulic fracture may be biased and misleading in optimizing the completion strategy. In this paper, a fully coupling fluid flow and geomechanics hydraulic fracture simulator based on dual-lattice Discrete Element Method (DEM) is used to predict the hydraulic fracture propagation in heterogeneous reservoir. The heterogeneity of rock is simulated by assigning different material force constant and critical strain to different particles and is adjusted by conditioning to the measured data and observed geological features. Based on proposed model, the effects of heterogeneity at different scale on micromechanical behavior and induced macroscopic fractures are examined. From the numerical results, the microcrack will be more inclined to form at the grain weaker interface. The conventional simulator with homogeneous assumption is not applicable for highly heterogeneous shale formation. |Introduction |Hydraulic fracturing is a well-stimulation technique, which creates fractures in rock formations through the injection of hydraulically pressurized fluid. Since the 1950s, about 70% of gas wells and 50% of oil wells have been hydraulically fractured [1]. Wide and successful applications of horizontal wells and hydraulic fracturing are the key reasons leading to the exponentially growing of tight oil and shale gas production. Therefore, understanding the hydraulic fracture propagation in complex unconventional reservoir plays a crucial role in optimizing the stimulation strategy and maximizing the created contacting surface. |However, there are several challenges in precisely predicting and controlling the induced fracture geometry [2]. One significant difficulty is that rock is a heterogeneous material containing many natural weaknesses, including pores, grain boundaries, and preexisting fractures [3]. Microseismic monitoring, production data, log, and seismic data confirm that the reservoir formation has strong lateral heterogeneity, which is a key impact factor of rock's mechanical behaviors. During the hydraulic fracturing process, these pre-existing weaknesses can induce microcracks or microfractures, which can in turn change the flow capability of the rock [4], [5]. For example, the Bakken formation is a layered heterogeneous reservoir, which is separated into upper, middle, lower and three forks. And even in one layer, the rock mineralogy varies with depth and location. Thus, without considering the intrinsic heterogeneity, the predicted morphology of hydraulic fracture may be biased and misleading in guiding the horizontal well completion strategy.|",,12

E., SINTEF Petroleum Research","|Abstract: |This paper presents a numerical modelling study on borehole failure in weak sandstones using a discrete element method. A particular constitutive contact law has been used in the models in order to mimic the complex but realistic stress dependent deformation and failure behaviours of the sandstones. The mechanical input parameters in the models were determined by calibration on triaxial compressive tests of natural sandstones. Using such mechanical input parameters, we made models and simulated the polyaxial tests on a sandstone block with a borehole. We applied isotropic and anisotropic stress loading on the block and studied how the stress conditions cause the hole failure. The modelling results show good agreements with laboratory experiments, both qualitatively by showing the anisotropic stress conditions inducing more breakout-like failure pattern, and quantitatively in the failure onset stresses. Both the modelling results and the experiment results show that the failure onset stress can be much higher than the estimates made from the assumption of linear elasticity. |Introduction |When hydrocarbons are produced through holes in sandstone reservoirs the sandstone under stress may fail and rock cavings may also be produced together with the fluids. The cavings may damage the production facilities. The processing and disposal of the produced sands can also be very costly on the surface. Therefore, it is important to correctly predict whether there will be sand production or not, and how much sands may be produced, so that appropriate management and remediation measures can be planned in right time. Triaxial tests and hollow cylinder tests are typical laboratory methods used to characterize sandstones towards predicting the probability of sand production (Papamichos et al., 2001; Nouri et al., 2006). The triaxial tests study the deformation and the failure mechanisms of the sandstones and measure the relevant parameters. The hollow cylinder tests simulate the cavity in the rocks which are under stress and with fluid flowing through. In a conventional hollow cylinder test, one of the principal stress directions is along the axis of the hole. The confining pressure is applied on the outer boundary, normal to the hole axis, so that the other two principal stresses which are in any of two perpendicular radial directions are equal. This is, however, often not the real conditions in the fields.|",,19

Analytical solutions have been derived in the case where far field pressure boundary conditions are applied (Barker et al., 1994, Liu et al., 2011). Using a power law creep model, we study the effect of applying additional shear stresses at infinity. |We start by deriving an analytical solution for the case of far field isotropic stresses to define a characteristic viscosity and velocity. We show that the solution reproduces Liu et al., 2011 without referring to Perzyna viscoplasticity. Compared to Barker et al., 1994 the closing velocities of our solution are substantially slower, which we attribute to their solution not fulfilling the incompressibility condition. |Using a finite element code, we investigate how far field shear stresses affect the viscosities and velocities in the vicinity of the hole. New characteristic viscosities and velocities are proposed based on the ones derived for pressure loads. These characteristic values reduce the problem to study the effects of <U+03B2>, the ratio of deviatoric to hydrostatic stress at infinity, and n, the stress exponent of the constitutive law. A numerically verified proxy shows that the effect of shear can be modelled as increasing the closure velocity by a factor equal to (1+n<U+03B2>)n. The bigger the stress exponent the bigger the shear enhancement. This result can be used in the industry to quickly estimate the amount of creep due to general stress conditions. |Introduction |Wellbores going through creeping formations experience time dependent closure which might translate into drilling problems (Dusseault et al., 2004). In the oil industry, a commonly encountered rock that exhibits creep is salt. From the Gulf of Mexico to Iran or offshore Brazil, massive salt bodies have to be safely drilled through to reach reservoirs. To address this challenge, a number of guidelines have been developed to efficiently deal with stuck pipes related with time dependent borehole closure. These guidelines are based both on field experience (e.g. Yearwood et al., 1988 or Holt and Johnson, 1986) and on numerical simulations (e.g. Moghadam, 2013, Xie and Tao, 2013 or Poiate et al., 2006). Both field and numerical studies show the influence of the wellbore pressure on formation creep and the goal is then to determine which mud weight to use to prevent borehole closure.|",,19

P., University of Toronto","|Abstract: |The existence of variability in rock mass properties is ubiquitous in rock engineering. As such, probabilistic analysis is required for accurate evaluation of the safety of designs, rather than the use of working-stress design with factors of safety. The fundamental problem in reliability-based design of structures is the evaluation of the probability of the resistance of the structure being less than the effect of applied loads. Customary approaches to this assume the resistance and effect of load to be independent (i.e. one is not a function of the other). However, in rock engineering this elementary characteristic of independence may not be valid, as both the load and the strength of rock may be functions of the minor principal stress. In this paper, and using the example of a tunnel in rock, we show how this problem may be resolved through a novel interpretation of the elementary structural problem. We develop and present a non-iterative technique that allows calculation of the probability of attaining rock peak strength and the evaluation of the design point (i.e. the conditions giving the greatest probability of failure). Using scenarios of differing rock strength and variability, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method by comparing it to the recognised techniques of Monte Carlo simulation and the first-order reliability method. |Introduction |Rock engineering design is characterized by great variability in rock mass conditions and properties. Customarily, rock engineering has relied on deterministic design methods with an applied “factor of safety”, with such factors being used to account for variability and hence ensure a sufficiently safe design. However, without characterising the variability, this approach cannot ensure that the design is safe. Instead, the reliability of the design should be determined, and this approach is referred to as reliability-based design (RBD). Well-known forms of this are the essentially synonymous Load and Resistance Factor Design, LRFD (particularly in North America) and Limit State(s) Design (LSD) (elsewhere in the world). The reliability calculation requires definition of a critical state function, known as a limit state, for the structure under consideration, and calculation of the probability of a design attaining that critical state.|",,3

616,617,2016-670,Comparison of Fracture Mechanics and Damage Mechanics Approaches to Simulate Three-Point Bending and Double-Notch Shear Experiments on Rock Samples,"Defoort, T., Imperial College| Paluszny, A., Imperial College| Zimmerman, R. W., Imperial College","|Abstract: |Three-point-bending and double-notch shear experiments are modeled using a continuum damage mechanics approach, and an explicit fracture mechanics approach, for both homogeneous and heterogeneous rocks. The local damage approach uses the Mazars isotropic damage model. In the explicit fracture simulations, fractures are represented as explicit surfaces within a threedimensional unstructured mesh comprised of isoparametric quadratic tetrahedra and quarter point tetrahedra. Heterogeneities in strength, stiffness and toughness are introduced in a random manner within ±50% of the average values. A characteristic length is used to define the size of element clusters having uniform properties. Both approaches are used to evaluate the influence of material heterogeneity on crack propagation and interaction. Both models reproduce well the experimental results for homogeneous rocks. While in the damage model the mesh is fixed and refined globally, the discrete approach only requires refinement around the fracture tips. In the three-point-bending and double-notch shear simulations, the damage mechanics approach is more realistic in that it leads to rougher crack surfaces. However, the fracture mechanics model predicts lower curvature of the fracture, which better corresponds to experimental observations. Both approaches predict that the presence of heterogeneities seems to diminish fracture interaction. |Introduction |Various continuous and discrete numerical models have been proposed to model crack growth in homogeneous materials. However, many materials, such as concrete, rocks, and other quasi-brittle materials, contain heterogeneities, which may affect the growth of fractures (Figure 1). |Damage models, derived within the general framework of continuum damage mechanics, are often used to reproduce the effects of stiffness degradation, without explicitly representing discrete fractures. Models for quasi-brittle damage include micromechanical models, as well as isotropic and anisotropic empirical models. Micromechanical damage models are the most advanced, in that they model microscopic phenomena responsible for the evolution of damage through first-order principles (Krajcinovic, 1986). They are therefore very useful for understanding rock failure. However, they are computationally demanding to implement.|",,4

In this regard, a large number of numerical models were made using FLAC 2D software, because of the plane strain condition. So shallow, semi-deep and deep individual stopes has been defined. Since all stopes in this paper are considered as individual excavation, there is not any conventional pillar, although arching effect on this post pillar areas have been investigated as one of the main objectives. In order to determine the stress state in the backfill and its surrounding area, volumetric strain energy released within the fillings has been used as an indicator. This parameter can explain the backfill state (active or passive form) and indicates the efficiency of the backfill. Finally, volumetric strain energy released and stress state within the backfill has been plotted versus variable geotechnical parameters. So this paper presents a design procedure and locating approach of the backfill stope according to the geomechanical issues. |Introduction |Backfilling has become a standard practice in mining operations. One of the main reasons behind the extensive use of backfill in mines is that it can lead to a significant reduction of the amount of wastes disposed on the surface. Backfilling thus protects the landscape and reduces the potential for environmental impacts such as acid mining drainage (when sulphide minerals are present). Despite this advantage, it must be kept in mind that the main role of mine backfill is to provide ground support to ensure stope stability and improve ore recovery by reducing dilution [1]. It is thus important for ground control engineers to have well adapted tools that allow a relatively fast and reliable estimate of the stress state in and around backfilled stopes. In this regard, it must be recalled that most backfill materials, even those that include a significant portion of binder, are relatively soft and show a low yielding strength compared to the surrounding rock mass [2]. As a consequence, the backfill placed in a stope tends to settle significantly, often producing fairly large strains (of 5% or more) [3]. The deformation of the backfill may then induce some load transfer along the interfaces due to the frictional forces that develop along the contact with the rock mass [4]. This type of phenomenon, often encountered with confined backfills, is known as arching [5].|",,29

Determining a safe operating range for temperature and assessment of thermal stresses during CO2 injection is essential to ensure wellbore integrity. Although failure of well barrier materials, such as steel and cement, has been reported in the contemporary literature, most of these studies applied purely mechanical loads to replicate thermally induced stresses. Thus, a systematic investigation of thermally induced casing expansion and contraction affecting the cracking and debonding of the well barrier materials is yet to be performed. |In this work, we have applied a combination of experiments and simulations to analyze the thermo-mechanical behavior of the well barrier materials undergoing repeated thermal cycling. The objectives of these studies are to determine when fracturing or debonding occurs as a function of applied thermal cycles and time, where these defects appear, and how prevalent or extensive they are. The experiments were performed in the SINTEF Petroleum Research laboratory using downscaled wellbore samples, consisting of a steel pipe cemented inside a hollow sandstone cylinder. The effects of thermal cycling were visualized using X-ray computed tomography to determine the extent of fracture. The simulations were conducted at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory using a highly parallel, multiscale, multiphysics code named GEOS. The experimental results did not show any detectable change in the existing pore volume of the sample for a temperature range between –50°C to 80°C. However, the simulation results suggest that large thermal stresses can develop inside the materials, which may create radial fractures/debonding during the heating/cooling stage. The data gathered from these experiments and simulations can be used to assess the temperature range for minimal impact on well integrity. |Introduction |Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a critical necessity to reduce the amount of atmospheric CO2 (Haszeldine, 2009; Herzog and Golomb, 2004). An effective way for longterm storage of CO2 is to inject it into underground reservoirs through petroleum wells. However, without proper care and risk assessment, the injected CO2 may find leakage pathways out of the wells, affecting the surrounding environments and ultimately re-emerging into the atmosphere. Thus, preventing leakages from petroleum wells is crucial to establish safe storage of CO2.|",,41

620,621,2016-657,Implications of Stress Re-distribution and Rock Failure with Continued Gas Depletion in Unconventional Reservoirs,"Saurabh, S., Southern Illinois University| Harpalani, S., Southern Illinois University| Singh, V. K., Southern Illinois University","|Abstract: |Significant increases in permeability of coal with continued production of coalbed methane is a well-accepted phenomenon, particularly in the San Juan basin in the US and Surat basin in Australia. Modeling this increase is either based on the resulting increase in fracture porosity of coal or, the associated changes in stresses as a result of the sorption-induced strain. This paper combines the experimental results of a study that measured sorption-induced coal matrix volumetric strain with depletion and a model proposed to estimate the associated changes in stress. The overall changes in stress, resulting from the combined effects of poro-mechanical behavior and sorption-induced strain, were estimated by introducing a Biot-like coefficient relating the volume of sorbed gas and the associated stress. Plotting the stress path followed during depletion along with the failure envelope for the coal-type clearly showed that shear failure of coal is possible due to the anisotropic loading of coal as a result of reduction in the horizontal stresses. This, in turn, results in a large increase in permeability. |Introduction |US coalbed methane (CBM) production was 1.4 trillion cubic feet (TCF) in 2014 and, as of December 31, 2014, proven reserves were estimated to be 15.7 TCF (EIA, 2015). Leading in production in the US were the states of Wyoming, Virginia, Utah, Oklahoma, New Mexico and Colorado. Although production has dipped from the high of 1.9 TCF in 2010, CBM continues to be an important source of energy in the US. |The controlling mechanism when producing CBM is the coal permeability. Although, typically believed to decrease with continued production (Unconventional Oil & Gas Production, 2010), coal exhibits a unique behavior, termed “matrix shrinkage”, associated with desorption of gas, resulting in increased permeability (Harpalani and Chen, 1997; Levine, 1996; Mitra et al., 2012). The result is a negative declining trend when producing CBM.|",,25

A FLAC3D model of a fault intersecting a producing gas reservoir was developed which incorporates the fully dynamic behavior of the fault and surrounding rock mass, and a fault frictional behavior based on a slip-weakening law. The simplified reservoir and fault geometry of the model are representative for the Dutch gas fields. Simulated fault slip displacements and fault slip lengths were used to calculate moment magnitudes of induced seismic events. In addition, results of the fully dynamic model with slip-weakening frictional behavior were compared to results of a static geomechanical model with slip-weakening. Comparison of model results shows that, for a first-order assessment of induced seismicity, the static models can be used as a simplified and computationally less expensive alternative to the fully dynamic fault rupture models. |Introduction |The operation of a gas field causes dynamic changes of the pore pressure and therefore changes in the stress state of the reservoir and surrounding rocks. Production-induced stress changes can destabilize faults which transect or bound the reservoir, or are located in the vicinity of the reservoir, causing associated seismicity. Whether or not faults are (seismically) reactivated during reservoir depletion depends on a complex interplay of many factors, such as the combination of initial stress state of the reservoir and faults, the magnitude of pore pressure changes, the geometry of the reservoir and faults, such as orientation, dip and fault offset, and the geomechanical properties of the rocks and faults. |In many onshore producing gas fields in the Netherlands seismicity has been observed during the depletion of the gas reservoirs. Induced seismicity has been recorded in 26 out of 150 producing gas fields, with maximum magnitudes of the seismic events up to Mw 3.6. In all of the gas fields pressure depletion was significant prior to the onset of recorded seismicity (Van Wees et al., 2014). The marked delay between the start of reservoir depletion and the onset of seismicity has been interpreted as an indication that the in-situ stress conditions in the northern part of the Netherlands are non-critical.|",,25

This fundamental analysis seeks to better understand dynamics of particle interactions in a dense phase slurry on a small particle size scale, representing proppant settling in narrow hydraulic fractures. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is used for analysis of velocities of individual particle and group particles and their relative paths, collisions and agglomerating in viscous Newtonian fluid. The displacement vectors show the movements of group of particles and global velocity trends of the observed area. The results from this experimental study indicate dependency of settling velocity on particle size and shape, as well as the dependency of different size of particle or agglomerate particles. The slurry settling velocity depends on the relationship between settlement, particle concentration and occurrence of particle agglomeration. The measured results, including vertical velocities and displacement vectors of singular particle and agglomerated particles, were compared with previously published theoretical and empirical relationships. It can be seen that forming of particle agglomerates during settling, caused by frequent particle-particle and particle-wall collisions and interactions, changes the overall settling velocities predicted by the previous experiments in larger slots. |Introduction |Proppant flow and transport plays a significant role in hydraulic fracturing of georeservoirs. Proppant is small granular material which is placed into hydraulic fracture. Proppant keeps the fracture under high in-situ reservoir stress open for fluid circulation. In geothermal reservoirs, water is continuously cycled through propped fractures, while in oil and gas reservoirs permeable fractures permit production. Experimental, numerical and theoretical research has been conducted for better understanding proppant placement in hydraulic fractures. Trykozko (2016) applied a computational approach to model proppant packs in fractures and confirmed that it causes reduction in the productivity of a hydraulically fractured reservoir. Hammond (1995) did numerical analysis on the gravity-driven vertical motion of proppant in a hydraulic fracture. As a conclusion, while the ratio of facture width to diameter of sand particle is small, the effect of the wall cannot be neglected. Joseph (1994) focused on the different effects of particle-wall interaction and particle-particle interaction both in Newtonian and viscoelastic fluids. He concluded that while particles are close to a vertical wall, the wall will attract particles in a viscoelastic fluid and will dissociate particles in Newtonian fluid. Feng et al. (1994) also investigated the effects of channel wall. The author focused on sedimentation of a single particle with wall effects and concluded that the particles were separated from the wall in a constant distance in Newtonian fluid and the drag reduction can be found on the particles. Gadde et al. (2004) established models for proppant settling in hydraulic fractures and found an empirical correlation which takes particle concentration into account based on Stokes’ law. Liu (2005) developed an experimental correlation between proppant settling velocity and dimensionless fracture width. Malhotra and Sharma (2012) performed an experimental study on the settling velocity of spherical particles in both unbounded and confined walls in shear thinning viscoelastic fluids. The authors found that the walls affected particle settling in viscoelastic fluid, with increasing significance as the ratio of particle diameter to spacing between the walls increases. Additionally, some particle agglomerations were observed during proppant settling between parallel walls. Joseph (1994) studied particle-particle interactions and observed correlations between viscoelastic fluid normal stress and particle agglomeration. Tomac and Gutierrez (2014) studied numerically proppant agglomeration in viscous fluid and the aggregation wasrelated to fracture width and fluid viscosity. It has also been found that particle concentration affects the particle settling velocity. Eskin and Miller (2008) observed that the slurry flow in a fracture is characterized by nonuniform solids concentration across the fracture width. Roy et al. (2015) conducted both experimental and numerical analysis on proppant transport and concluded that the lowest concentration experiment ultimately had the lowest settling velocity.|",,55

A laser profilometer, with a data collection spacing of 0.05 mm, was used to obtain four profiles from each specimen. The profiles were then down-sampled to produce profiles of decreasing resolution. Seven common roughness algorithms were used analyze the profiles. Mean absolute angle, root mean square, and energy roughness values were not affected by down-sampling. Sinuosity roughness values decreased linearly for rough profiles but smooth profiles were unaffected. Number of turning points decreased linearly for both rough and smooth profiles with the rough profiles being more influenced by down-sampling. Z2 roughness values decreased logarithmically for rough profiles and very slightly decreased linearly for smooth profiles. The visual roughness classifications compared favorably with roughness values, most notably for the smooth and rough specimens. Rough specimens were less homogeneous then smooth specimens which indicates the whole specimens, not just portions of the specimen, should be used for roughness assessment. |Introduction |The roughness of rock has long been of interest to both practitioners and researchers in the fields of geomechanics.

If the generated gas is not able to transfer, after a long period of accumulation, the increasing gas pressure may create micro-cracks and fracture the compacted clay rock. Meanwhile, during the accumulation process, if the gas pressure can overcome the capillary resistance, hydrogen gas will leak from the structure.

The project discussed is the Xiang'an subsea tunnel project, the first subsea tunnel project in the mainland of China. The Xiang'an subsea tunnels were excavated using conventional drilling-and-blasting method and passed through four major weakness zones, which are composed of heavily to completely weathered rock mass. To prevent the water infiltration and to protect the excavation stability, a full face curtain grouting with both cementitious and chemical grouts was conducted before excavation. This paper discusses the mechanism of the grouting, the selection of grout materials, the determination of the grouting parameters, and the evaluation of the grouting results. The case study shows that the water infiltration rate was reduced by 95% and the strength of the rock mass was improved by more than 50% after pre-grouting. The Pre-grouting significantly reduced the risk of groundwater ingress and excavation instability during subsea tunneling through weakness zones. |Introduction |Compared with mountainous tunnels, the construction of subsea tunnels involves in more uncertainties due to the difficulty in deep water site investigation, and is more technically challenging under the impacts high pore water pressures and seepage gradients (Eisenstein, 1994). Subsea tunnels are either immersed in soils at the seabed, or, more often, excavated in bedrock by drilling-and-blasting or tunnel boring machines (TBMs).The bedrock, if in good quality, can create a strong self-support and virtually impervious barrier for water infiltration. It is, however, a discontinuous medium which often includes a variety of weakness zones created during the long geological history (Kim, et al. 2012). The materials in weakness zones are not strong enough to provide a self-support or tight enough to provide a barrier for water infiltration during excavation. Tunneling through weakness zones involves in high risk for water ingress and excavation instability, which in turn may cause severe causalities and long construction schedule delay. |To protect the construction safety, ground improvement is typically required before excavation.

L., Chevron","|Abstract: |Exploration drilling in carbonate reservoirs has encountered a variety of drilling challenges due to high stresses, overpressure and risk of significant losses due to fractured rocks. In this study, borehole instability is assessed in several wells in a fractured carbonate play. A comprehensive formation evaluation program in two initial wells included borehole image data, highdefinition spectroscopy data and core from multiple sections. In-situ stresses were constrained using borehole image data with special attention paid to presence and absence of drilling-induced tensile fractures, as well as compressive failure and rock strength test results. The spectroscopy data were used to help explain and constrain borehole stability differences observed in different wellbores which was not as readily detected in standard log suites. A subsequent third wellbore was drilled in which the mud weight program attempted to account for possible over pressure and weaker clay-rich zones while at the same time avoiding high losses. The new mud weight program allowed for significant borehole breakouts to occur in order to decrease mud losses; losses were half the amount compared to the previous well over the same challenging formations. |Introduction |Chevron has recently undertaken exploration drilling for tight carbonate reservoirs. A number of drilling challenges exist in the field including overpressure, high horizontal stresses, weaker shale zones and significant losses due to the fracture natured of the rock. Multiple formations are targeted and good hole condition is required for optimal formation evaluation and cementing operations. |Two previous wells in the field used different static mud weight (MW) and equivalent circulating density (ECD) and as a result had different hole conditions and amount of losses. Well 1 had higher MW and ECD, breakouts and some washouts but significant losses while Well 2 had lower MW and ECD, severe enlargements but minimal losses (Fig. 1). In particular in Well 2, the caliper data across the weaker shale zones were extended to the maximum tool capacity over a large extent of the 17-<U+00BD>” section. The challenge for the upcoming wells is determining a MW which will reduce the breakouts and associated non-productive time (NPT) from borehole instability without causing severe losses and the associated NPT with curing the losses. In this high stress environment, it may be that inclined wells will provide higher drilling margins (i.e., greater difference between collapse and losses pressure) than vertical wells.|",,14

The reduction of internal support pressure results in the development of a plastic (broken) zone around the tunnel. Due to the self-weight of the broken material, crown of the tunnel experiences the highest radial convergence. In this study, considering the weight of broken material at the tunnel crown, a new analytical method for determining the ground response curve of tunnels excavated in the generalized Hoek-Brown rock mass is developed. The effects of gravitational loading on the ground response curve are investigated for several tunnel cases. The results show that in poor quality rock masses, gravity has significant effect on the ground response curve of the tunnel and the tunnel stability and higher support pressure is required to limit the convergence at the tunnel crown than the tunnel sidewalls. |Introduction |Determination of the stresses and displacements around circular openings has been one of the most fundamental problems in geotechnical, petroleum, and mining engineering. Design of tunnel liners and the validation of numerical models are among the practical applications of displacement analysis around circular openings. Several analytical and numerical solutions for this axisymmetric opening problem have been developed and various rock mass behaviors including the elastic-perfectly plastic, elastic-brittle-plastic and elastic-strain-softening models with different yield criteria have been assumed for the rock (Brown et al., 1983; Wang, 1996; Carranza-Torres and Fairhurst, 1999; Alonso et al., 2003; Park and Kim, 2006; Sharan, 2008; Lee and Pietruszczak, 2008; Park et al., 2008; Gonzalez-Caoa et al., 2013). Although Mohr-Coulomb yield criterion has been widely used in analysis of rock mass due to its simplicity, many studies and experimental observations show that the strength envelope for rock is non-linear.

N., University of Oklahoma","|Abstract: |In this paper, an exact analytical solution for the wellbore boundary value problem is derived, in an elastoplastic porous rock formation. The rock is modelled as Drucker-Prager material with the incorporation of hardening behaviour depending on the evolving of the plastic deviatoric strain. By adopting the small strain deformation in the elastic region while large strain deformation in the plastic region, the wellbore stability problem under undrained condition is formulated as solving a system of first order ordinary differential equations in the plastic zone. The illustration numerical example shows the distributions of stress components and the pore pressure around the borehole, in addition to the evolving stress path for a rock point at the borehole surface due to the wellbore drilling. The major advantage of the calculated wellbore drilling curve lies in the fact that it can track the deformation responses of the borehole surface from elastic to elastoplastic states and down to the ultimate strength condition if needed, thus providing much more flexibility and more appropriate mud pressure design over the conventional elastic-brittle models. |Introduction |The minimum (critical) mud pressure required to maintain the wellbore stable is often predicted using elastic or poroelastic brittle models, which assume the borehole collapse occurs whenever the calculated elastic/poroelastic stress state at a point surrounding the wellbore attains certain failure criteria of the rock formation (Cui et al., 1997; Al-Ajmi and Zimmerman, 2006; Zare-Reisabadi et al., 2012; Kanfar et al., 2015). The elastic/poroelastic model is simple yet well known to be overly conservative (Veeken et al., 1989; Charlez, 1997). To overcome this disadvantage usually a more advanced elastoplastic constitutive model needs to be considered, to incorporate realistically the nonlinear behaviour of the rocks (Charlez, 1997; Potts and Zdravkovic, 1999), so as to predict the wellbore deformation more accurately and therefore a more reasonable estimation of the critical mud weight (Graziani and Ribacchi, 1993; Bradford and Cook, 1994; Papanastasiou and Durban, 1997; Charlez and Roatesi, 1999; Muller et al., 2009).|",,35

Previous mechanisms of coal and gas outburst have a problem in describing the failure process of coal. Static-dynamic coupling loading is required to fully understand the development process of coal and gas outburst. The effective stress theory is also introduced to analyze the coal and gas outburst due to its similarity with that of sand vibrating liquefaction. Our results show that coal experiences deformation of shear compression instead of dilatancy in the development process of coal and gas outburst. Furthermore, coal not only absorbs in-situ stress, but also endures dynamic loading. In particular, the measured data suggests that when approaching the dangerous region of coal and gas outburst, coal seam gas pressure significantly rises with increasing compressive deformation of coal seam. These results validate our proposal. Additionally, a physical-mechanics model is established to realize quantitative analysis of the mechanism of coal and gas outburst. |Introduction |Nowadays, a comprehensive action hypothesis (Xo?ot, 1966, and Bufan, 1985) has been widely used in the study of mechanisms of coal and gas outbursts, which is regarded as comprehensive action results of in-situ stress, physical and mechanics properties of coal, and coal seam gas pressure. Under the guidance of comprehensive action hypothesis, great attention has been paid to describe the mechanics failure mechanisms of coal and gas outbursts from different aspects (Zhemin, 1982. Zhongcheng, 1987. Shinin, 1990. Mengtao, 1991. Chenglin and Bin, 1995. Shaolin, 1999. Deyong, 2003. Qianting, 2008). Mechanics basis of these mechanisms is mainly derived from traditional rock mechanics. These mechanisms have provided a powerful theoretical guideline for the prediction and prevention in coal and gas outbursts. However, based on traditional rock mechanics, dilatancy cannot explain the rise of coal seam gas pressure during coal and gas outburst which has been observed at site. Actually, coal not only absorbs in-situ stress, but also endures dynamic loading which is not taken into consideration in the traditional rock mechanics. Coal and gas outburst always occurs in the region which contains tectonic coal. However, mechanics properties of tectonic coal under static-dynamic coupling loading have not been investigated yet. Additionally, we find that coal and gas outburst has a similarity with sand vibrating liquefaction, as they are both about granular element under staticdynamic coupling loading. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel mechanism of coal and gas outbursts based on effective stress theory and static-dynamic coupling loading theory.

Von Gonten Laboratories LLC","|Abstract: |This paper identifies formation interfaces that would appear to be “weak interfaces”, in the Jurassic, Early-Cretaceous Vaca Muerta formation, in the Neuquen Basin, Argentina. Significant distribution of the weak interfaces was observed including contacts between volcanic ash layers of varying thicknesses, calcite-filled veins, and contacts between lithology changes, such as between argillaceous mudstone and mottled carbonates. The paper shows mineral and organic matter constituents of selected interfaces and suggests that interface weakness depends on certain composition and morphology of mineral and organic constituents associated with the interfaces. The understanding presented in this paper of the composition of interfaces is a first step toward both identifying the location and frequency of the weak interfaces throughout the formation and ultimately of determining the shear strength of these interfaces. These interfaces have a significant effect on hydraulic fractures used for completion stimulation. |Introduction |Hydraulic fracturing is required to create large surface area to allow oil or gas to be extracted from unconventional formations, and particularly mudstone reservoirs. Recent work has shown the importance of rock fabric and particularly weak interfaces on hydraulic fracture propagation and geometry (Detournay, 2004; Dargaud et al., 2005; Jeffrey et al., 2009; Suarez-Rivera et al. 2006; Lecampion et al., 2013; Green, 2013). Early analysis and observations suggested that hydraulic fracture growth is affected by weak interfaces and other localized heterogeneities in the formation. They promote the development of complex fracture networks, may restrict the propped fracture surface area in contact with the reservoir, and thus influence the production potential of the play (Warpinski, 1987; Suarez-Rivera, 2011 & 2013; Green, 2013 & 2014). |The weak interfaces as discussed here tend to have low shear strength, and are thus more susceptible to local shear deformation as the fracture intersects the interface during the fracture propagation (Suarez-Rivera, 2013). The propagating fracture can either be arrested at the interface or can reorient and propagate in a different direction along the weak interface or may branch into two fractures (Thiercelin, 2005, Suarez-Rivera et al., 2006 & 2013; Green, 2014).|",,25

Caverns shrink over time due to salt creep and the cavern roof subsides potentially threatening well integrity. Cavern deformation, deformation of salt surrounding the cavern and impacts on well integrity were quantified using a generic geomechanical finite element model that resembles gas storage operations in solution-mined caverns in the Netherlands. The analysis results show that the largest deformation occurs at the floor and the lowest section of the side wall of a cavern, while the roof deformation is typically one order of magnitude smaller than those of the floor and the wall. The predicted vertical tensile strains that can cause tensile fracturing of well cement develop in the lowest 40-100m-long section of the well. The last cemented casing, typically set at a few tens of meters above the cavern roof, can therefore be affected by the vertical tensile strains that could damage cement sheath and threaten well integrity. The actual borehole construction need to be included in numerical models to investigate in more detail the impact of salt creep on wells in site- and configuration-specific underground gas storage projects. |Introduction |Underground natural gas storage projects have operated successfully since the early 1940's in many parts of the world (Thoms and Gehle, 2000). Nowadays, thousands of salt caverns are being used to store hydrocarbons (Berest and Brouard, 2003). Underground storage is regarded as the safest way to store large quantities of hydrocarbons because salt formations are almost impermeable and hydrocarbons are protected from fire, intentional damage, aircraft impact, etc. However, a small number of accidents have occurred in the past; most of these incidents (blow out, leakage of hydrocarbons) were due to well failure (Berest and Brouard, 2003). Generally, the well integrity problems are the main cause of most gas leakage incidents in underground natural gas storage operations in depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs, aquifers and salt caverns. Only 10 of the approximately 600 storage reservoirs operated in the United States, Canada, and Europe have been identified to have experienced leakage due to geological factors and well integrity issues, typically poor cement jobs, casing corrosion, and improperly plugged wells (Perry, 2005). |Well failure was also the cause of the recent leak in the southern California's Aliso Canyon gas storage facility, the second largest storage facility in the U.S., built in a depleted hydrocarbon field (CalIEPA, 2016; CalOES, 2016). A well was leaking methane for nearly four months, from October 2015 to February 2016. One hundred thousand tons of methane was released into atmosphere, which is the largest gas leak in the U.S. history in terms of its environmental impact. Another recent example of a leaking well occurred at the Epe gas storage facility in Germany in 2014, where gas oil is stored in salt caverns (Economic Affairs, 2016). The leakage incident at Epe caused concerns related to the safety of other underground storage facilities not only in Germany but also in the Netherlands, as Epe is located close to the Dutch border and solution mined caverns are leached on either side of the border.|",,46

S., Norwegian University of Science and Technology| Li, L., SINTEF Petroleum Research","|Abstract: |For wells to be permanently plugged and abandoned, rigid requirements for sealing barriers apply. Cement filling the annulus outside the casing may provide proper sealing, however in shale sections where the annulus is not filled with cement, the shale may creep towards the casing and eventually form an equally efficient sealing barrier. This paper discusses some geomechanical aspects of the shale barrier forming process, and describes an effort to study the process by a numerical simulation. Creep is implemented as time dependent plastic deformation. The annulus gap is rapidly reduced in the beginning, but the closure rate soon drops significantly, probably due to arching effects. For some shales, this effect may possibly terminate the process before the gap is closed. When contact between formation and casing is established, the closure rate is further reduced. Ovaling or collapse of the casing are possible consequences, due to high and uneven load on the casing. The simulations indicated that elevated temperature may speed up the gap closure process, however no substantial long term effect of temperature was seen. |Introduction |Wells constitute efficient flow channels between hydrocarbon reservoirs and the surface. The flow of hydrocarbons through the wells is controlled by the operators; however the annulus between the casing and the rock may become undesired channels for leakage and thus need to be properly sealed, at least in certain sections of the well. Traditionally, this is done by injection of cement at the casing shoe. This procedure may leave long sections of the annulus un-cemented, which may be acceptable while the well is in operation and hence under surveillance. For wells to be permanently plugged and abandoned, more rigid requirements for sealing barriers apply, as outlined for instance by Norwegian authorities (NORSOK 2013), and will require substantial additional work. With standard technology, this is a costly process: it has been estimated that 15 rigs will need full time operation for 40 years to complete this job, on the Norwegian Continental Shelf alone (Straume, 2013). |However, in shale sections where the annulus is not filled with cement, it has been observed in a number of cases that the shale may creep towards the casing and eventually form an equally efficient sealing barrier (Williams et al., 2009). This process – if it occurs – may imply huge cost savings for plug and abandonment (P&A) operations. Moreover, it is possible that such shale barriers are even more efficient than cement barriers in a long term perspective, as cement tends to deteriorate and possibly cause older wells to leak (Dusseault et al., 2014). |The process of forming a shale barrier, and what prevents the process from occurring in some cases, is not yet fully understood. In this paper, we shall discuss the geomechanical aspects of this problem, and describe an effort to study the process by a numerical simulation.|",,30

Also collapse volume is studied based on the Mohr-Coulomb criterion. Define a critical collapse condition: the stress state of northern adjacent rock on the wellbore satisfies Mohr-Coulomb criterion. While the collapse of a gas reservoir in Darcy flow, Darcy-Forchheimer flow or accelerating flow will continue to develop in the near-well formation after the stress of adjacent rock reaches certain conditions. The collapse of a gas reservoir in accelerating flow is more liable to develop in near-well formation and the adjacent rock in this kind of flow is the first to reach its critical collapse condition. However, under the dual effect of non-uniform stress field and accelerating flow, collapse may exist in the maximum horizontal stress direction when the stress of adjacent rock reaches its critical collapse condition. Besides, the critical collapse radius corresponding to maximum horizontal stress is likely to be the largest. And computational formula of collapse volume is given in this paper. |Introduction |When reservoir fluid flows into the wellbore, the pore pressure decreases all the way from the outer boundary to borehole wall [1]. Due to the interaction between fluid and fluid-saturated porous rock, changes in pore pressure will lead to changes in the formation wall stress and the effective stress, which may lead to the borehole instability [2]. Pore pressure gradient of near-wellbore formation corresponding to different flow models in gas reservoir development and testing is various, especially for overpressed gas reservoir. Accelerating effect should be considered in the flow model when flow velocity is large enough. While pore pressure gradient of near wellbore formation in accelerating model is nonlinear and may even be infinite. And the mass flow rate of the fluid has a maximum value [3-5], which will change the effective stress state of near-wellbore formation rock. |During the process of gas reservoir development and testing, adjacent rock is influenced by Darcy flow and non-Darcy flow, the phenomenon of formation sanding has been studied using plastic Coulomb yield criterion and tensile failure criteria, but accelerating effect and collapse volume calculation have not been considered yet [6-9]. Research of compressible fluid showed that there exist blocking flow and infinite pore pressure gradient in the flow model with accelerating effect, however, borehole collapse is not involved [10-13].

The medium is modeled by a discrete element method able to reproduce the progressive failure mechanisms. A finite volume scheme is used to simulate the fluid flow and its interaction with the host rock. Laboratory hydrofracturation test results and analytical solutions of a pressurized penny-shaped crack are first used to validate the model. A series of single treatment stages involving several perforation clusters located along a predefined wellbore segment was simulated in order to study the effect of the distance between the clusters on the development of multiple hydraulic fractures. The resulting fracture volume (P33) and the intensity of fracture (P32) was measured to assess how the fracture geometry depends on the distance between the clusters due to stress redistributions taking place in the vicinity of the hydraulic fractures during their propagation. |Introduction |The design of hydraulic fracturing operations requires a sufficient understanding of how the fracture propagation behaves depending on several parameters, like heterogeneities, anisotropic properties of the rock or in-situ stress field (Zoback, 2010; Neuzil, 2003). With the use of directional drilling techniques, horizontal wells have drastically improved the treatment efficiency with the possibility to multiply the injection sources and thus increase the stimulated reservoir volume (SRV). If there is a combination between multistage fracture completions and multiple wells, higher levels of recovery can be reached (Nagel et al., 2013; Lecampion and Desroches, 2015), it also makes the configuration even more complex to control. For instance, decreasing the spacing between the different perforation clusters can potentially increase the level of interaction between hydraulic fractures and thus improve the size of the SRV, as long as stress shadow effects remain negligible (Mayerhofer et al., 2010). |The concept of SRV has been proposed to provide a quantitative assessment of stimulation effectiveness based on the spatial distribution of micro-seismic events. However, such assessment provides little insight into critical parameters such as, the hydraulic fracture conductivity which can vary significantly depending on the rock properties, the stress regime, fracture-to-fracture interactions and the fracture treatment design. Hydraulic conductivity appears nonetheless as a critical property which has to be considered in the treatment strategy. In order to quantify the HF propagation, rather than basing our analysis on a rough definition of the stimulated reservoir volume, the fracture volume P33 and the fracture intensity P32 measures were used.|",,54

They seriously affect project progress and shape control of the cavern construction. Preliminary theoretical and experimental researches on the dynamic characteristics of leaching strings were carried out. It is shown that the main reason why the overbending or breakage of leaching strings occurs is self-excited fluid-structure coupling vibration of leaching strings in confined space, well. The critical flow velocity expression of leaching strings is obtained under idealized condition, revealing that leaching bending stiffness of leaching strings, overhang length and overflowing area are the main influence factors of tubing dynamic stability. The phenomena of water hammer, static buckling and chaotic motion were observed in the model experiment, accounting for the main influence factors. Finally, some research advices on the overall analysis of dynamic characteristics of the leaching string are proposed. |Introduction |Deep salt rocks formation is an ideal place of underground storage for oil, natural gas and high-level radioactive nuclear waste [1]. The salt rock storage is usually built by the method of solution mining through fresh water injection and brine removal [2]. Fig. 1 shows the process of dissolving salt rock: fresh water or weak brine is introduced into salt cavern through the inner leaching tubing (or the annulus between the inner leaching tubing and the outer leaching tubing), and brine in the cavern is discharged to the surface through the annulus (or the inner leaching tubing). The volume of the cavern gradually expands due to dissolution and removal of salt rock. The annulus between the outer leaching tubing and the production casing is full of diesel oil or other liquid forming an oil cushion at the top of the cavern. The salt rock at the top of the cavern and weak brine are separated by the oil cushion to suppress upward leaching of the cavern and promote lateral leaching. Conversely, if the oil cushion is removed, salt rock of the top of the cavern will be contacted byweak brine, resulting salt cavern developing upward. Reasonable adjustment of the oil cushion depth can achieve the controlling of the shape of salt cavern. |During salt cavern leaching, some engineering accidents of leaching strings may occur, such as wear and corrosion of leaching strings, bending deformation, fracture of tubing and damage of casing coupling. These accidents affect the project schedule, and increase the construction cost. Fig. 2 shows that the bending deformation of inner leaching tubing is serious. When the inner leaching tubing is lifted to the surface for repair or replacement during well workover, the outer leaching tubing may be damaged if the excessively bendy inner tubing is lifted forcibly in confined cylindrical space. Sometimes the inner tubing with serious bending deformation has to be cut off, abandoned in the cavern permanently.|",,50

M., NTNU| Gheibi, S., NTNU| Lavrov, A., SINTEF Petroleum Research","|Abstract: |Reservoir stress changes caused by pore pressure depletion have impacts on hydrocarbon recovery, on safety and stability margins during drilling, and on possible seismicity. Stress path prediction is a challenge, in particular when pore pressure is increased by injection after depletion, either for improved recovery or for storage of e.g. CO2. Three different perspectives of stress path reversal are considered here: i) The mechanical behavior of rock that undergoes unloading and reloading, starting from a virgin state, has been addressed through controlled laboratory experiments, ii) An analytical approach has been developed to sketch the interplay of tensile and shear fractures with the stress path itself, and iii) Numerical modeling has been performed to account for stress heterogeneities and plastic deformation of the reservoir rock. The results show that all these mechanisms may contribute to the resulting stress path, in addition to the role of thermal stresses associated with injection of cold fluids into reservoirs. |Introduction |The concept of reservoir stress path is becoming a more and more relevant tool for describing and understanding the dynamic behavior of hydrocarbon or storage reservoirs. Reservoir stress path coefficients are defined (Hettema et al, 2000) as the change in the total stress <U+0394><U+03C3> per unit change in the pore pressure <U+0394>Pp (subscripts “v” and “h” denote vertical and horizontal directions): |(equation) |<U+03B3>v and <U+03B3>h are often called “arching coefficient” and “depletion coefficient”, respectively. In case of a laterally infinite reservoir in a linearly elastic and homogeneous subsurface, no stress is transferred to the overburden, <U+03B3>v = 0, and the reservoir is deforming uniaxially (no horizontal strain). The depletion coefficient is then directed by the Poisson's ratio v of the drained reservoir rock, and by the Biot coefficient <U+03B1>: |(equation) |Stress arching, associated with <U+03B3>v > 0, is enhanced by increasing aspect ratio (= thickness divided by diameter of the depleting zone), by increasing stiffness of the surrounding rock relative to the reservoir rock, and by reservoir tilt (see Fj<U+00E6>r et al., 2008, Ch. 12).|",,11

However, the possible impact of induced seismicity on sustainable CO2 containment from geological CO2 sequestration remains unclear because the earthquakes play a significant but mysterious role in influencing the integrity of the caprocks by hypothesized interrelated friction-permeability interaction processes: (1) the earthquakes may occur seismically (i.e., frictionally unstable), enhancing the permeability of faults instantly and leading to potential breaching and loss of inventory; or (2) the earthquakes may occur aseismically (i.e., frictionally stable), closing the aperture of faults and reducing permeability through creep. In this study, we explore these processes through experiments in which we measure the frictional parameters and hydraulic properties using Green River shale sample as an analogue caprock candidate. We observe that fracture permeability declines during shearing while the increased sliding velocity reduces the rate of decline. The physics of these observed behaviors are explored via parametric study and surface measurement of fractures, showing that both permeability and frictional strength are correlated to the fracture asperity evolution that is controlled by the sliding velocity and fracture material. Through the velocity step, the velocity strengthening behavior is observed for Green River shale, suggesting that for Green River shale, only aseismic slip would occur at a low sliding velocity during which the permeability would decrease. |Introduction |Geological storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) is considered a viable method to significantly reduce CO2 emissions from energy production and to reduce global impacts on climate (Falkowski et al., 2000). Injection of CO2 into deep saline aquifers or depleted oil and gas reservoirs has the potential to sequester significant mass of CO2 in a sustainable manner (Holt et al., 1995; Bachu and Adams, 2003; Orr, 2009; Szulczewski et al., 2012). One key to the success of long-term CO2 storage is the integrity of the resulting seal of impermeable caprocks that contain the charge to deep saline aquifers and prevents leakage into the atmosphere or potable aquifers (Shukla et al., 2010). However, the presence of preexisting faults and fractures distributed throughout the upper crust may influence the longevity of this storage (Anderson and Zoback, 1982; Curtis, 2002). Fluid injection activities (e.g., hydraulic fracturing, deep disposal of wastewater, enhanced geothermal stimulation, etc.) can reactivate pre-existing faults and induce seismicity (Healy et al., 1968; Raleigh et al., 1976; Kanamori and Hauksson, 1992; McGarr et al., 2002; Shapiro et al., 2006; Majer et al., 2007; Suckale, 2009; Ellsworth, 2013; Walsh and Zoback, 2015; Guglielmi et al., 2015; Im et al., 2016). Likewise, large-scale injection of CO2 that generates overpressures and decreases effective normal stresses may reactivate preexisting faults in caprocks (Fig. 1). As a result, CO2-injection induced seismicity may raise the potential that the rupture of caprocks could jeopardize the seal integrity and ultimately result in loss of charge of CO2 (Chiaramonte et al., 2008; Rutqvist, 2012; Zoback and Gorelick, 2012). Hence, it is of particular interest to understand the evolution of permeability of caprocks as a result of seismic and aseismic deformation in caprocks.|",,23

A two-dimensional plane-strain model is adopted. The rock deformation solver is implemented using the extended finite element method (XFEM). The model for the fluid flow in hydraulic fractures is based on the Reynolds lubrication equation. The fluid pressure and the fracture opening are obtained from the solution of a system of nonlinear equations resulting from the coupling of the rock deformation solver with the fluid flow model. To model fracture reorientation, the direction of fracture propagation is determined based on the maximum tensile stress criterion. We present the results of modeling of the near-wellbore fracture reorientation in the viscosity-dominated regime with this algorithm and study the effect of the wellbore casing on the fracture opening and the fluid pressure required to initiate and propagate the fracture. |Introduction |During the hydraulic fracturing process, a hydraulic fracture initiates from an initial flaw at a wellbore and ultimately propagates in the preferred fracture plane orthogonal to the minimum compressive far-field stress direction. If the initial flaw is not orthogonal to the minimum compressive far-field stress, reorientation of the hydraulic fracture takes place, leading to one form of near-wellbore fracture tortuosity. In this case, the fracture opening near the wellbore is reduced, which generates a near-wellbore pressure loss and creates a risk of wellbore screenout due to proppant bridging (Mack and Warpinski, 2000). |Previous studies (Romero et al., 1995; Zhang et al., 2011), as well as observed field data and experiments (Aud et al., 1994; Van de Ketterij and de Pater, 1999), have shown that using a fluid of a higher viscosity and a higher injection rate reduces the negative effects of this form of near-wellbore fracture tortuosity. However, the increased viscosity and rate require higher pressure to initiate and propagate the fracture. |Other factors that can influence reduced fracture width and the near-wellbore pressure loss due to the near-wellbore fracture reorientation include completion type and the geometry of the initial defect of the rock formation exposed to the fluid pressure. For example, if perforations in a cased wellbore are misaligned with the in-situ principal stress directions, a lower misalignment angle results in a lower viscous pressure drop near the wellbore and a lower pressure required to propagate the fracture (Abass et al., 1994; Zhang et al., 2011).|",,26

The tests were conducted at a confining pressure of 5.0 MPa, a pore water pressure of 4.5 MPa, and a temperature of 125°C. The specimens were rapidly loaded to a constant stress ranging from 57 to 100% of their estimated fracture strength. Strain was measured parallel and normal to the core axis. Samples loaded to stresses of 80 to 100% of the estimated fracture stress failed in times of 2 to 3.6 <U+00D7> 105 sec. Samples stressed to less than 80% of their estimated fracture strength did not fail. All of the specimens tested showed primary and secondary stages of creep; those that failed exhibited tertiary creep. The time to failure decreased with increasing stress, although there is considerable scatter in the results. Samples that did not fail exhibited very low secondary radial creep and no dilatancy. The radial strain decreased with time suggesting that the cracks parallel to the loading axis are closing. The cracks may well reach the equilibrium state proposed by Costin (1983). He argues that at low strain rates, stress corrosion at crack tips is so low that the tensile stresses that drive the crack are relaxed. |Introduction |One of the most striking characteristics of brittle rocks, when subjected to a constant load at temperatures well below the melting point, is a continuous inelastic increase in strain with time. This time-dependent deformation is termed creep. Typically, creep is reported in terms of three distinct phases: primary or transient creep, secondary, and tertiary or accelerating creep. Transient creep has been reported for a variety of rock types over a wide range of environmental conditions (Wawersik, 1972; Kranz and Scholz, 1977; Kranz, 1979; Kranz, 1980; Lajtai et al., 1987; Lockner, 1993; Martin et al., 1997). The strain rate immediately after loading decreases rapidly. The transient creep strain is often reported as the logarithm of time, because both the axial and lateral strains exhibit a logarithmic time dependence. At low stresses, transient creep may account for most of the total observed creep strain. However, at stresses greater than 60% of the fracture stress, secondary creep is often observed. For secondary creep, the strain is proportional to time. If secondary creep continues, the strain rate increases and the rock fails (tertiary creep). The onset of tertiary creep has been attributed to crack coalescence (Scholz, 1968; Kranz, 1979). All three stages of creep have been observed in granite, quartzite, and tuff (Martin, 1972b; Wawersik, 1972: Kranz and Scholz, 1977; Kranz, 1979; Lockner, 1993; Martin et al., 1997).|",,46

Because of this, anisotropy may have an additive or subtractive effect on stress ratios, pore-pressure, tectonic stress and anisotropy gradient predictions for seismic based geomechanical characterization of conventional and unconventional reservoirs. Therefore, the objective of this study is to demonstrate the effect of Thomsen's <U+03B4> on stress anisotropy in complex hydrocarbon reservoirs. We provided the relations between vertical and horizontal stress as a function of <U+03B4> for orthorhombic media. Furthermore, we derived a mechanical definition of Thomsen's <U+03B4> to reveal when <U+03B4> is positive and when <U+03B4> is negative. Finally, we established a link between <U+03B4>, tectonic stress and anisotropy gradient. For conventional depleted reservoirs, we demonstrated how <U+03B4> can be negative because of small horizontal stress. We described that <U+03B4> is a potential parameter to monitor a dynamic reservoir where stress changes are related with production, injection, and compaction. For unconventional reservoirs, we established a link between Thomsen's delta and tectonic strains. We showed that in the absence of a layer anisotropy parameter, tectonic stress and the anisotropy gradient can be calculated from the upper bound and lower bound of Thomsen's <U+03B4>. We used the anisotropy gradient to describe fracture density and tectonic stress to define whether fractures are open or closed. Hence, combining the anisotropy gradient with tectonic stress can be used to define the optimal conditions for hydraulic fracturing for unconventional reservoir characterization. |Introduction |The objective of this study is to demonstrate the effect of Thomsen's delta (<U+03B4>) on stress anisotropy in complex hydrocarbon reservoirs. Based on Thomsen's <U+03B4>, we provided the relationship between vertical and horizontal stress for orthorhombic media: |(equation) |where, <U+03C3>h is the minimum horizontal stress, <U+03C3>H is the maximum horizontal stress, <U+03B4>h minimum value of Thomsen's delta and <U+03B4>H maximum value of Thomsen delta, v is the Poisson's ratio, and <U+03C3>v is the vertical stress. |For transversely isotropic (TI) media, <U+03B4>H=<U+03B4>h, equation (1) becomes (Thomsen, 1986): |(equation) |As indicated by Thomsen's landmark paper on seismic anisotropy (Thomsen, 1986), <U+03B4> can be positive or negative. Because of this, anisotropy may have an additive or subtractive effect on stress ratios and porepressure predictions (Thomsen, 1986) as shown in equations (1) and (2). Therefore, the use of isotropic models may lead to overestimates or underestimates of stress ratios for reservoirs that exhibit substantial anisotropy. The commonly used equation for maximum and minimum horizontal stress calculations is: |(equation) |where, <U+03B5>h is the minimum shear strain and?<U+03B5>H is the maximum shear strain, E is the Young's modulus.|",,19

The experiment relies on generating a shear failure plane, re-loading the sample to the near-failure axial stress that closes/narrows the fracture zone, and finally reopening the fracture with a pore pressure increase. The entire process is controlled based on the acoustic emission response, which determines the reopening early enough to prevent the sliding. A change of the emission event energy distribution exponent is observed during fracture generation/activation and fracture sliding, combined with an increase of acoustic emission activity upon the dislocation. The results indicate that even small pore pressure increases, up to 2 MPa and in extreme cases as low as 0.4 MPa, are sufficient to activate a pre-existing fracture and finally to fail the outcrop and field sandstone sample. This lab observation supports the field findings of micro-seismicity even for low pore pressure increments due to fluid injection below the frac gradient. The field response may arise from geologically created critically stressed planes, which are not sliding at the current stresses, but are suddenly activated with minimal pressure increase. |Introduction |Reopening or reactivation of an existing fracture/fault in an underground reservoir has important consequences on the field operations during CO2 injection and storage phases [1, 2, 3]. Sometimes a fracture/fault reopening can help the CO2 absorption process inside porous rocks by creating larger surface areas for CO2-fluid interactions. On the other hand, it can trigger a CO2 leakage path by activating existing fracture networks in the cap-rock. This fracture/fault reopening scenario is equally important to petroleum production phase, where permeability increases once an isolated conducting fracture becomes connected to the main flow path – as a result the productivity is enhanced. Therefore, a close monitoring of fracture/fault reopening processes is a necessity. It can help the operators to select injection pressure, mud-weight window and other related parameters for a definite goal, either to stop fracture reopening or to allow it. A good control on the in-situ processes during fracture reopening should lead towards better planning of the well treatment, improve productivity and avoid risk. |The CO2 geological storage pilot projects [4, 5] have identified some important scientific aspects for advanced research: How will the injected CO2 be distributed within the storage reservoir?

P., Los Alamos National Laboratory| Carey, J. W., Los Alamos National Laboratory| Viswanathan, H. S., Los Alamos National Laboratory","|Abstract: |Accurately understanding the mechanisms of hydraulic fracture stimulation at reservoir conditions is fundamental to its effective and sustainable use. Uncertainty regarding hydraulic fracture fluid-flow remains significant, especially in complex geologies, such as oil and gas shale plays or geothermal systems. Improved understanding of fluid-flow through fractures is also applicable to carbon sequestration, groundwater flow, and deep waste injection technologies. Laboratory triaxial-coreflood systems allow for fluid-flow and permeability testing through intact and fractured rock core, but are not conventionally used for hydraulic fracture studies. In this paper, we describe a laboratory method for hydraulic fracturing inside triaxial-coreflood systems using notched rock specimens. The method can be performed along with simultaneous application of axial pressure, confining stress, pore pressure, and temperature controls. Tensile hydraulic fractures are initiated from the notch tip and propagate axially through the specimen giving the ability to measure fracture permeability in addition to mechanical properties. Experimental evaluations of the notched-specimen hydraulic fracturing method were performed. A simple analysis to estimate the notch stresses is presented as a first step towards design of mechanical testing using this method. The method presented was simple to execute and compatible with conventional triaxial coreflood equipment. |Introduction |Hydraulic fracturing is a well stimulation method where fluid is injected into open or perforated well intervals at pressures sufficient to create new fractures in the adjacent reservoir rock. The method can be implemented in oil, gas, geothermal, carbon sequestration, and deep waste injection wells as a means to increase productivity or injectivity. Hydraulic fracturing has been studied extensively using models, laboratory experiments, and field studies but critical fluid-flow parameters (e.g. permeability, hydraulic surface area, and stimulated rock volume) through hydraulically stimulated fractures remain uncertain, in particular for complex rock facies such as oil and gas shale plays or geothermal systems. Improved understanding of this topic can lead to more accurate fracture fluid-flow models, more effective design of stimulation treatments, and more insightful diagnosis of poorly performing wells. |Current laboratory studies of fluid-flow through hydraulic fractures created at in situ conditions within rock specimens are limited [1-3], largely due to challenges with reproducing reservoir conditions and controlling the fracturing process. This study presents a simple method for hydraulic fracturing rock-cores within conventional triaxial-coreflood systems. The fractures created using this method propagate axially through the length of the specimen at controlled azimuthal fracture-orientations, giving geometries suitable for geomechanical and/or fracture fluid-flow experiments.|",,54

We have collectively performed an extensive series of laboratory fracture permeability experiments using unconfined, triaxially confined, and true-triaxially confined specimens and various flow control methods. Tested materials have included shale, granite, cement, and acrylic with fluid flow occurring through both the rock matrix and stimulated fractures. Darcy and cubic law approximations anticipate unique steady-state flow and pressure correlations while our experiments observed method-dependent permeability measurements. Generally, constant flow rate control was found to produce greater variation and increased stabilization times relative to constant pressure control. Constant pressure control typically produced a lower bound permeability measurement. Repeatability of measurements through a given specimen was found to improve when using constant pressure control. Stepped constant pressure and stepped constant flow rate schedules were used to evaluate time-dependence of flow and hysteresis. Most recently, a sinusoidal flow experiment was performed to investigate dynamic flow behavior. Results from these experiments suggest that constant pressure control should be used, when possible, for evaluation of low permeability specimens. The results also indicate that flow history can significantly affect permeability measurements but this effect is not necessarily permanent. |Introduction |Accurately measuring the permeability of fractured rock is challenging, yet also crucial for predictively modeling fluid flow through the subsurface. Such predictions are used to optimize hydraulic fracturing jobs for oil, gas, and geothermal well-production, design dewatering systems for tunnels and excavation pits, estimate leakage potential from underground fluid storage sites, and to explore the suitability subsurface waste storage facilities. |It can be hypothesized that fractures and porous media (i.e. rocks) possess many complex traits that can affect permeability at any given time. Perhaps most importantly, fracture geometry can greatly affect hydraulic connectivity through and between other fractures and pores, therefore exhibiting a likely strong effect on permeability. However, even highly localized blockages in these fractures (e.g. grout, cement, fines, or contact-seals) can result in a significant permeability reduction in some cases (e.g. filter clogging and shear fracture compaction) or significant permeability gains in others (e.g. hydraulic fracture proppant and shear fracture dilation). In addition, other potentially relevant issues include chemical dissolution/ precipitation, mechanical creep, mineral swelling/compaction, thermomechanical alteration, and solid-fluid compressibility (i.e. Biot's constant). To make matters ever more complex, scale effects and discontinuity are not simple to account for when comparing measurements. While the specific mechanisms influencing permeability are not to be the focus of this study, it is important to acknowledge them as they offer some better understanding in regard to the importance of fluid flow and boundary condition control methods, for which many options are available.|",,19

A., South Dakota School of Mines & Technology","|Abstract: |The time-dependent deformation of shale is a phenomenon that impacts several industries but remains rather poorly understood. The Pierre Shale, a poorly indurated geological unit (unconfined compressive strength of less than 5 MPa), is an important formation that can be used to better understand the behavior of intermediate geomaterials and, specifically, time-dependent deformation, or creep. A series of long-duration (weeks to months) triaxial constant-stress-difference tests were performed on recently obtained core samples from the Pierre Shale. Samples were hydrostatically consolidated and then subjected to variable constant-stress differences. The stress differences in the samples were increased in stages until sample rupture occurred. The apparent steady-state creep rate was observed to generally increase with increasing stress differences for each test and spanned a range of approximately two orders of magnitude. There appears to be no creep threshold in the Pierre Shale, as measureable steady-state creep was recorded at stress differences as low as 1 MPa. Additionally, time-dependent deformation appears to include a component of damage accumulation. Although creep rupture was observed to occur at stress differences similar to the peak strength of the shale as determined by constant strain rate triaxial tests in some samples, other samples ruptured at stress differences of only 25 to 50 percent of the expected peak strength. |Introduction |Fine-grained geological units are abundant and occupy over 50 percent of all sedimentary rocks in the preserved geological record (Boggs, 1995). These widespread geological units present unique engineering problems that include the consideration of time-dependent deformation and strength loss. Nuclear repository science is often the state of the art when describing phenomena and processes, and the current understanding of the behavior of fine-grained geological units, such as shale, has advanced over the years through laboratory testing, numerical modeling, and experiments in underground research laboratories. However, several recent authors, both domestic and international (Argonne National Laboratory, 2011; Nuclear Energy Agency, 2010; Hansen et al., 2010; Mazurek et al., 2008), have indicated topics where important knowledge gaps still exist. For example, understanding the time-dependent behavior of shale and the sealing of fractures that develop within the Excavation Damage Zone of the formation are current knowledge gaps that are often cited as having high importance. |The time-dependent deformation of shale has applications in several other industries outside of nuclear repository science. Underground mining of sedimentary units, such as coal, aggregates, and evaporites, often encounters shale near the mined seam, and a better understanding of time-dependent behavior can aid in hazard recognition and control. The oil and gas industry also encounters challenges dealing with time-dependent deformation of shale, both in terms of wellbore stability and hydraulic fracture propagation.

Development of data collection methods utilizing hyperspectral imagery and terrestrial laser scanning enables engineers to obtain more sophisticated and accurate information about rock mass conditions, without human bias. This paper shows that rock mass parameters can be investigated from those two imagery systems. Hyperspectral imagery identifies weathering and alteration zone, and terrestrial laser scanning indicates orientation, roughness, and joint spacing of a given rock slope. The supervised learning procedure with a small training image is used to understand site-specific or area-specific discontinuity and weathering trends. The final result shows quantified values for rock mass parameters with a 3D digital geology model fused with a hyperspectral thematic image. The site-specific rock mass representation by the proposed method can be advisable to reduce the time required for the survey in a hazardous environment, and provide consistent classification results regardless of the surveyor. |Introduction |In mining and civil operations, such as pit design, tunneling, and road construction, it is essential to determine rock mass classification in order to develop plans for the safety and the efficient operation. Surveys of rock mass classification has previously depended on the subjective opinion given by cell mapping, which provides average measures of orientation, spacing, and length. However, this conventional method is vulnerable to inconsistent results varying between surveyors or situations and to safety aspect in terms of accessibility. Alternative approaches based on remote sensing and image processing that provide visual assessment of rock mass conditions without human bias and direct access have been suggested as a remedy to this inconsistency and safety problem, with the added benefit of producing reliable historical records for long term studies (Kemeny and Post, 2003). |A duplication of the abilities of human decision and vision by scanner and camera has been developed to enable the computer algorithm to classify rock mass conditions. We used the Visible and Near-InfraRed (VNIR, 400 – 1000 nm) range of hyperspectral imager to simulate how human eyes would classify alterations and weathering zones (Nieto et. al, 2010; Murphy and Monteiro, 2013). By using ground based LiDAR, geometric rock mass characteristics such as orientation and spacing of joint sets and surface roughness are measured to provide guidelines for determining the hazard and reinforcement of the slope (Gigli and Casagli, 2011; Lato et. al, 2013; Riquelme, 2016).

Nintcheu, Schlumberger-Doll Research","|Abstract: |The elasticity-fluid coupling inherent in a hydraulic fracturing (HF) model is a highly nonlinear mathematical problem. To effectively tackle such situation in the context of a full 3D HF simulator, i.e. involving arbitrary-shaped, nonplanar fracture surfaces in a three-dimensional elastic formation, an accurate and reliable 3D HF solver which combines a displacement discontinuity technique and a cell-centered finite volume method is proposed. This 3D HF solver revolves around a previously developed exact integration technique and a robust diffusion algorithm. Moreover, it is constructed for unstructured triangular meshes since surface discretization via triangles can conform to solids of any shape. A detailed description of the proposed 3D HF scheme as well as some aspects of the coupling process are presented. In addition, the proposed 3D HF solver is validated using an existing axisymmetric HF code on a test problem involving a nonplanar fracture. |Introduction |Based on an effective exact integration approach for three-dimensional boundary integrals in linear elasticity (Nintcheu Fata, 2011), an accurate and efficient displacement discontinuity method (DDM) to study arbitrary-shaped crack surfaces and their interactions in a 3D linearly elastic isotropic medium has been developed. This DDM scheme employs constant displacement discontinuities (crack aperture and rides) over a flat triangular area instead of the usual quadrilateral counterparts since surface discretization using triangles can conform to solids of any shape. In addition, it utilizes a local coordinate system associated with each crack element (flat triangle) to better represent various loads imposed on the fracture faces. Moreover, all surface integrals defined over crack elements appearing in the DDM formulation (Kuriyama and Mizuta, 1993) are accurately and efficiently evaluated with the aid of the formulae explicitly provided in Nintcheu Fata, 2011. The proposed DDM algorithm can be used as an effective tool for the mechanical deformation of a reservoir rock modeled as an infinite 3D elastic solid. |Based on a cell-centered finite volume method (FVM) for the classical diffusion equation in planar domains (Breil and Maire, 2007), an accurate and reliable diffusion scheme has been developed to successfully deal with fluid flow models such as the Reynolds lubrication equation (Adachi et al., 2007; Peirce and Siebrits, 2005) involving arbitrary-shaped, nonplanar surfaces that are partitioned using unstructured triangular grids. To ensure a proper coupling with the foregoing DDM used to discretize the fracture model, this FVM procedure employs local stencils and local coordinate systems associated with each crack cell (flat triangle). In addition, it yields a system with only cell-centered unknowns and a global diffusion matrix that is symmetric positive semi-definite and sparse. The proposed FVM scheme can be used as an effective tool for the fluid flow inside a fracture in a 3D elastic formation.|",,19

It has a macroscopically visible plane-parallel structure (foliation). The foliation was caused mainly by biotite grain arrangement. Four cylindrical specimens of migmatite with sub-horizontal, sub-vertical and oblique foliation were uniaxially loaded up to failure. A network of 8 broadband sensors was employed for acoustic emission monitoring and ultrasonic sounding. A grid search method with an anisotropic velocity model was used for AE hypocenter localization. The source types of successfully localized events were determined from the average first arrival amplitude. Structural anisotropy of the tested rock material caused the anisotropy of its mechanical properties (peak strength, Young's modulus) as well as a different fracturing in dependence on the angle between the axial stress and the foliation plane. The combination of tension and shear microcracking together with sliding in biotite basal planes was found to control the failure of specimens with sub-horizontal foliation. Shearing and sliding were dominant in the failure of specimens with oblique foliation. With greater dip of foliation, the role of sliding increased at the expense of shearing. Due to the favorably oriented system of microcracks already present, the shearing and splitting was at the same level during fracturing of specimens with sub-vertical foliation before nucleation began. |Introduction |The process of failure of low-porosity rocks depends on their mechanical properties and actual stress and temperature conditions. At low pressure and low temperature, brittle failure is most common. This is a progressive process requiring the initiation, growth and coalescence of cracks (Lockner, 1993). Stress strain behavior of low-porosity crystalline rocks during laboratory compression experiments is divided into four characteristic stages: crack closure, elastic region, stable crack growth and unstable crack growth which leads to brittle failure, (Brace et al., 1966; Bieniawski, 1967; Lajtai, 1974). |The fracturing process of stressed rock begins with crack initiation (<U+03C3>ci), which for low-porosity rocks occurs approximately at 40-50% of peak strength (<U+03C3>p) (Cai et al., 2004; Nicksiar and Martin, 2013). After <U+03C3>ci, dilatancy begins and stable crack growth follows up to the crack damage threshold (<U+03C3>cd), which is approximately at 80% of <U+03C3>p (Cai et al., 2004). After crossing the crack damage level, there is unstable crack growth accompanied with nucleation of the fault plane (<U+03C3>n) at 97-100% of <U+03C3>p (Rao et al., 2011). The stress drop accompanied with the formation of a macro-scale shear failure plane follows after peak stress is crossed.|",,25

The temperature and stress field variation together with possible microcracking also influence the mechanical and physical properties of rock itself. From these reasons, the thermo-mechanical response of rocks has been investigated in numerous in situ and laboratory experiments. |Various in-situ heater tests were published from the KAERI Underground Research Tunnel (e.g. Kwon et al., 2013), the Stripa mine and Aspo in Sweden (e.g. Chan et al., 1981; Andersson and Martin, 2009) or the Grimsel Test Site (e.g. Schneefu<U+03B2> et al., 1989). |The microcracking process and its influence on mechanical and physical properties have been characterized by means of laboratory experiments.

The primary mining method used in this study is overhand cut and fill mining, with variations of long-hole stoping in areas that permit such a mining method. Overhand cut and fill mining depends primarily on backfill so that the next lift in the orebody is made. The backfill has to be able to sustain the stresses from the heavy machinery and the induced stresses from mining operations in order to provide stability and safety in the mining environment among its other uses. Efficient backfill systems could save costs for the mine and enhance the mining operation. This study investigated the effects of backfill composition on backfill optimisation at a massive mine. A study on different materials that could have potential to be used in the mine was conducted. Laboratory test results were collected from previous studies as well as from outsourced companies hired by the mine to evaluate the composition of the backfill. An economic benefit assessment of the study indicated that cement consumption could be reduced from 14% to a standard of 10% and yield better backfill strength without the use of a super- plasticiser. |Introduction |It is of utmost importance to optimize backfill composition to achieve stability in a massive mine utilizing backfill as support mechanism. This paper presents a study on backfill composition effects on backfill optimisation based on a practical investigation done at a massive mine. The mine is a poly-metalliferous base metal underground mine. It produces zinc, lead and silver as the by-product. The primary mining method used is mechanised overhand cut and fill due to the characteristics of the orebody and its host rock. As a result, backfill is an important component in the productivity of the mine as it provides a working platform for the machinery for the next lift to be made as well as for stability of the mine amongst others. Kinver [4] found out that backfill enables maximum extraction of ore to take place. The composition of the backfill is essential to the increase in its strength to withstand the weight of the machinery and to overcome stresses in the stope. It is then important to investigate and monitor factors that influence the strength of the backfill in its composition. The economic benefit of the study is also highlighted in this paper. |Problem statement |The mine has a challenge of its backfill content not reaching the desired strength of 1MPa. Without this strength of the backfill, production is delayed as well as compromising the overall stability of the mine. The 1MPa backfill strength is also needed in providing a stable working platform for the machinery. The strength of the backfill has been weakened due to other contributing factors in the backfill department. In the past, backfilling was done by the use of an unconsolidated river sand which is in close proximity to the backfill plant and within the mine's property. Later, unconsolidated dune sand which is also in the mine's property was used. This meant a great saving on costs of backfilling on the mine; however the two fill materials did not reach the required UCS of 1MPa and also posed a threat of dilution of ore from the next lift. The dune sand transportation using hydraulics also meant a lot of water consumption. The mine is situated in a semi-arid desert so water is not abundant. The use of ‘pure’ mill tailings was considered, but as time went by, factors such as liquid limits, pore pressures, percolation rates, viscosity and strength of the backfill materials investigated made ‘pure’ mill tailings unsuitable to be used in cut and fill stopes.|","massive mining,  optimisation,  backfill properties, backfill composition,  monitoring,  cut and fill",23

A new methodology based on the Rough Set (RS) theory and the Rock Engineering Systems (RES) is proposed to quantitatively identify the tunnel surrounding rock conditions, and to provide the corresponding hazard level. Rock collapse hazards from recent tunnel construction projects in Fujian province, China, were investigated. On the basis of 164 compiled datasets, the ground index (GI) was defined. RS theory was implemented to identify reduct sets associated with the attributes while rock engineering systems (RES) approach was employed to quantify the interactions between the factors affecting the ground conditions. 24 independent cases were selected to validate the proposed GI by comparing predictions given by the GI with the field observations. The final results showed excellent agreement between predictions and observations which suggested that the GI could be used for a quantitative rock collapse hazard assessment of the tunnel surrounding rock. Both methods indicated that the rock quality design, intactness coefficient, groundwater and discontinuity condition, are among the most important parameters controlling the conditions of the surrounding rocks. |Introduction |The quantitative identification of the tunnel working face and the surrounding rock conditions in tunneling is very important since it can help in evaluating geo-engineering hazards associated with the tunnel construction and minimizing the related risks by adopting appropriate design and construction methods. In areas with complicated geological setting and prone to adverse geological hazards, unfavorable ground conditions are often encountered. This can considerably affect underground construction works. Hazardous situations such as tunnel boring machine jamming, rock squeezing phenomena, water or mud inrush, rockburst, rock spalling, tunnel collapse, rockfall threaten the achievement of cost and schedule milestones. |Recently, methods that could be used to quantify hazard occurrences in tunnel have been investigated, including: using a vulnerability index to assess geotechnical hazards (Benardos and Kaliampakos, 2004), laboratory simulations for rock burst and slabbing failure occurrence (Gong et al., 2012), the interaction matrix of the rock engineering system to quantify rock behavior (Kim et al., 2008;Shin et al., 2009), geological drillings to assess the stability of ancient landslide crossed by tunnels (Jiao et al., 2013), as well as a qualitative approach for rock mass classification to determine ground behavior and rock mass composition in underground excavations (Stille and Palmstrom, 2008). Irrespective of the adopted methodology, it is noted that the rock mass classification plays a key role in quantifying a hazard occurrence. Meanwhile, a prime requirement to achieve this depends on the establishment of an objective rating system in which the weight of the system parameters are determined in a quantitative manner. As matter of fact, one of the problems with classification systems in rock engineering or in other related fields is the subjectivities they involve which lead to difficulties in determining unequivocally the rating system of a particular rock mass since the qualitative attributes that are often used, propagate a variety of uncertainties into the system.|",,12
653,654,2016-576,Numerical Investigation of the Effect of Frictionally Weak Minerals on Shear Strength of Faults,"Wang, Chaoyi, The Pennsylvania State University| Elsworth, Derek, The Pennsylvania State University","|Abstract: |Recent observations suggest that the presence of frictionally weak minerals in a majority frictionally strong matrix may explain the reduced strength and instability in faults. Experimental results on synthetic fault gouges using a mixture of a frictionally strong phase and a frictionally weak phase indicate that the fault can be weakened by even a small amount of frictionally weak minerals. These frictionally weak minerals weaken the fault by either acting as weak spots/clusters or as a through-going weak layer in the bulk gouge. A two-dimensional Distinct Element Method (DEM) numerical model using the Particle Flow Code 2D (PFC 2D) is developed to investigate the effect of frictionally weak minerals on the bulk shear strength of fault gouge. Mechanical response of particles is modeled using a linear-elastic contact model and Coulomb's friction law. Numerical direct shear experiments were performed on homogeneous mixtures of weak and strong mineral particles and also on heterogeneous mixtures consisting of a frictionally weak layer sandwiched in frictionally strong minerals. The weight percentage (wt%) of the frictionally weak mineral in the homogeneous mixtures and the relative thickness of the frictionally weak mineral layer in the heterogeneous mixtures are adjusted schematically to obtain the weakening regime of the bulk shear strength. A transition from high to low residual coefficient of friction is observed. Specifically, for homogenous mixtures a sharp drop of bulk shear strength is observed with 25% of frictionally weak mineral presented in the mixture, and a dominant influence occurs at 50%; for heterogeneous mixtures, noticeable weakening is shown at a relative weak layer thickness of 0.05, and a dominant influence quickly follows at a relative thickness of 0.10. The observed weakening regime matches well with previous lab results using talc/quartz mixtures. |Introduction |In nature, tectonic faults tend to slip at much lower resolved shear stress than the stresses inferred from rock mechanics experiments (Engelder et al., 1975; Dieterich, 1978; Marone et al., 1990). Explanations to this difference between lab observations and natural phenomenon include low effective stress, elevated pore pressures (Rice, 1992; Faulkner and Rutter, 2001) and dynamic weakening in which friction decreases above a threshold slip rate (Melosh, 1996; Di Toro et al., 2006; Ampuero and Ben-Zion, 2008). Recent field observations of the San Andreas fault (Moore and Rymer, 2007) and an exhumed low angle normal fault in Italy (Collettini et al., 2009a, 2009b) show that the weakness of natural faults can be explained by the presence of talc; a frictionally weak mineral. Earlier experiments using synthetic mixtures of salts and muscovite/kaolinite (Bos and Spiers, 2002; Niemeijer and Spiers, 2005, 2006) showed that weakening can occur with as low as 10% of frictional weak minerals. The shear strength of a fault greatly depends on its mineralogical composition (Ikari et al., 2011; Fang et al., 2015). Shear experiments using mixtures of talc and quartz sand (Carpenter et al., 2009) suggested that in order to weaken the composite gouge, 30%-50% frictional weak mineral is needed. However, there were only 2-3 wt% of talc presented in these weak faults which is surprisingly less than the previous suggestions. The difference can be explained by the generation of a through-going localization zone during dynamic shearing, which greatly weakens the fault. This strong weakening effect of frictionally weak mineral in a majority frictionally strong matrix derives a question of how much the frictionally weak mineral in weight percentage (wt%) is needed; and in terms of localized weakening effect, how thick the weak localization zone is enough to weaken the fault. Experiments have been conducted on synthetic gouge consisting of quartz sand as a strong phase and a through-going talc layer as a weak phase (Niemeijer et al., 2009; Moore and Lockner, 2011). The findings suggest that the frictional strength of the sample gouge decreases systematically with the increase in thickness of the talc layer, two critical values were proposed for a starting point of weakening relative to pure quartz sand and weakening domination point relative to pure talc, Additionally, findings suggest that the permeability evolution of fractures is likely linked to such mineralogical properties (Ishibashi et al., 2015).|",,57

M., MIRARCO – Mining Innovation| Yong, S., MIRARCO","|Abstract: |At ARMA's 2006 symposium, Maloney et al. (2006) presented a “Reassessment of in situ stresses in the Canadian Shield” to assist in establishing representative in-situ stress conditions appropriate for sub-regional modeling activities. A recent updated is available from Yong and Maloney (2015). In this article, it is demonstrated (a) how earth crust straining may affect the in-situ stress profile, (b) how the in-situ stress magnitudes vary in heterogeneous rock masses, and (c) what the consequences are for excavation stability in such variable stress fields. The first two points are discussed by presenting a reinterpretation of the data set published by Corthesy et al. (1998). For a hypothetical circular shaft with a defined rock mass profile, it is illustrated how large-scale heterogeneities modify the induced stresses at the excavation boundary and thus affect longitudinal variations in the depth of failure. It is concluded that the combination of stress and strength heterogeneities leads to a highly variable excavation behavior with localization of various failure modes. Finally, it is demonstrated that the common assumption of far-field stress boundary conditions may lead to non-conservative model predictions when compared to far-field strain boundary conditions. |Introduction |Natural rock masses are heterogeneous in terms of modulus and strength. This paper was submitted in response to a call for contributions to the subject of “rock heterogeneity across all length scales” and to draw attention to the impact of rock mass heterogeneity on the in situ and excavation-induced stress field. In rock engineering, it is common practice to assume that the stress field is uniform and can be described by a single stress tensor. As a consequence, variations in excavation instability would have to be attributed to variations in rock mass strength alone. Experience by the lead author during a recent litigation case, which unfortunately cannot be published, has shown that the stress field was highly modified by rock mass strength and modulus heterogeneities and that the excavation behavior changed drastically as a result of this variability in strength and stress. Without reference to this particular case, simplified numerical (Voronoi) models, calibrated on published data (Corthesy et al., 1998), are used in the following to illustrate that: |variations in field measurements can be attributed to rock mass stiffness variations; |mining-induced stresses along an underground project can be highly varied; and the |variability in excavation behavior has to be attributed to variations in both strength and stress. |",,9

J., Lyles School of Civil Engineering, Purdue University","|Abstract: |Laboratory experiments were conducted on prismatic Indiana limestone specimens with a flaw, to examine the effect of uniaxial cyclic loading on crack growth and, most importantly, the effect of opening/closing of the crack on transmitted and reflected elastic waves. All specimens were initially subjected to a load that produced a kink at the flaw tips, and then were subjected to 20 loading-unloading cycles. The maximum applied load at each cycle was the load of kink initiation and the minimum load was such that no detachment between the specimen and loading platens occurred. After cyclic loading, the compressive load was increased until failure. Digital image correlation (DIC) was used to observe the damage evolution around the flaw tips and to monitor the opening/closing of the kink. At the same time, transmission and reflection of compressional and shear waves across the specimen were monitored. The DIC results showed that the kinks that initiated from the flaw tips completely closed during unloading. The normalized amplitude of the transmitted waves showed a progressive decrease with additional cycles of loading until reaching a steady-state. Such decrease in amplitude is thought to be related to additional damage induced to the kink due to the loading-unloading cycles. |Introduction |The mechanical behavior of geomaterials is strongly affected by the presence of micro-cracks. A large number of experiments have been done on crack initiation, propagation, and coalescence in pre-cracked brittle materials and show that a number of cracks initiate from the tips of pre-existing cracks [2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 19-21, 24-26]. There are however two types of cracks that are most common: tensile and shear cracks (Fig. 1). The tensile cracks initiate prior to the shear cracks and are stable, which means that an increase in load is required for propagation. The shear cracks are initially stable and may become unstable as crack coalescence and failure are approached. Two types of shear cracks have been identified, based on their angle of initiation with respect to the flaw: coplanar or quasicoplanar and oblique. Coplanar shear cracks make an angle smaller than 450 with the flaw, while oblique shear cracks make an angle larger than 450 [15]. Prior experimental work was performed almost exclusively using monotonic loading. In addition, most of the observations in the experiments were made based on visual inspection using optical magnification or highspeed cameras. All of these studies have successfully identified the mechanical behavior of rock and cracking phenomena at the laboratory scale. Microscopic characterization of new cracks inside the material and monitoring microcrack development under low amplitude cyclic loading is a very important topic that affects the response of fractured rock mass subjected to repetitive loading such as vibrations, cyclic thermal loading, seismic loading from remote earthquakes, traffic loading, and other ambient noise.|",,48

W., Los Alamos National Laboratory| Frash, L. P., Los Alamos National Laboratory| Viswanathan, H. S., Los Alamos National Laboratory","|Abstract: |Precipitation and dissolution processes can modify fracture permeability in applications such as CO2 sequestration, geothermal energy, oil and gas production, and nuclear waste disposal. In this study, we conduct a triaxial coreflood experiment while imaging with in situ x-ray radiography. The carbonate-rich Utica specimen was fractured using direct shear methods at 20 °C and confining pressure of 3.4 MPa. Permeability was measured continuously using a dilute BaCl2 solution. The specimen's permeability increased significantly to 0.43 mD immediately after fracturing at 60 MPa shear stress then decreased with continued fluid flow due to precipitate infilling of the fracture. Precipitation was observed in real-time using x-ray radiographs. Subsequent analysis showed that calcite in the shale had reacted with BaCl2 to produce BaCO3, resulting in a 67% reduction in permeability. The precipitate was distributed throughout the fracture network but concentrated in regions with relatively narrow fracture apertures. While BaCO3 is an unlikely precipitate in a natural environment, the use of BaCl2 greatly facilitated x-ray contrast with results having applications to other chemical systems that may be kinetically inhibited or difficult to study experimentally. This study sheds light on the use of chemical injectates as mitigation techniques for plugging undesired permeability. |Introduction |Understanding the controls of fracture permeability is important to assessing the economic viability of fracture-dominated oil & gas and geothermal resources as well as the environmental suitability of CO2 sequestration and nuclear waste repositories. In this work, we consider chemical-reaction induced modification to fracture permeability. |Chemical reactions impact fracture permeability through dissolution of fracture walls and asperities or by precipitation infilling. In the subsurface, chemical processes are coupled with stress such that changes in fracture porosity are coupled with changes in fracture stiffness or crystallization forces that modify fracture aperture. Thus, dissolution processes can weaken asperities and facilitate the mechanical collapse of fractures leading to dissolution-induced reduction of permeability (Detwiler 2008). Precipitation processes can prop-open fractures or even force open fractures through the force of crystallization (e.g., Noiriel et al. 2010; Wigand et al. 2009). As discussed by Detwiler (2008), the potential effects of reaction on permeability are controlled by the relative rates of fluid flow and chemical reaction as expressed in the Damkohler number (Da). He showed that dissolution of a fracture under normal stress in a KH2PO4 chemical system can result in permeability enhancement where dissolution in the fracture is channelized at high Da or permeability reduction at low Da where dissolution is distributed and attacks asperities allowing fracture collapse.|",,10

The core samples obtained from Lower Silurian Longmaxi Strata of Sichuan Basin were investigated using X-ray diffraction tests, pyrolysis test, wettability test, Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope tests, nitrogen adsorption tests and uniaxial compressive strength tests to study the impact of oil-based drilling fluid on shale. The results indicate that the lipophilic of shale has an obvious response to its mineral composition and organic matter characteristics. Moreover, the stronger lipophilic is, the more serious wellbore instability problem caused by using oil-based drilling fluid becomes. After the immersion in the oil-based drilling fluid, the SEM results show that a large number of micro-cracks are generated in the sample, but the effect on macro-cracks is not obvious; nitrogen adsorption results also show that the proportion of the micropores, the total porosity increases, but the average pore size decreases. Meanwhile, the fracability of fracturing operation changes with the interaction between shale and drilling fluid. Furthermore, based on fracture mechanics, wettability and interface properties have a significant effect on wellbore instability and fracture propagation. |Introduction |Increasing energy demand and decreasing conventional oil production have shifted the focus of the industry to unconventional resources, such as shale gas resources, which have emerged as an abundant and accessible source of energy. However, successful and sustainable development of shale gas reservoir is still faced with a set of drilling and operational challenges, such as wellbore instability and multi-lateral/multi-stage hydraulic fracturing [1, 2]. Organic-rich shale gas formations are quite different from conventional shale formations due to the characteristics of hydrocarbon source rocks, such as rich organic matter and developed fracture networks. Oil-based drilling fluids are widely used in the drilling operation of unconventional shale gas reservoirs [3], and shale gas wells drilled with oil-based drilling fluids perform better than those with water-based fluids. However, more and more problems during the drilling process indicate that oil-based drilling fluid is not the best choice [4, 5]. Due to the long time immersion in oil-based drilling fluid, the physical and chemical characteristics of shale formations are bound to be influenced to a certain degree, thus maybe affecting wellbore stability in the drilling process and the initiation pressure and fracability in the process of fracturing operation. Fracability can be used to evaluate the ability of rock to form a good fracture network. Organic-rich shale gas formations contain a lot of natural fractures or shale beddings [6]. Oil-based drilling fluids can invade along with a fracture network into formation, and can increase pore pressure of the fracture network to form a local high pressure zone. At the same time, filtrate invaded into shale fracture network may also provide a lubrication for fracture surface. Oil-based drilling fluids require to maintain an alkaline condition to enhance the emulsion stability. However, alkali can corrode clay minerals, quartz and feldspar [7], which plays significant roles in triggering fracture generation and propagation, and wellbore instability.|",,41

Three essential components of the coupling are the stability control algorithm, the fracture permeability model, and the pressure corrector. Stability is controlled by specifying the minimum and maximum numbers of finite elements that are allowed to fail at each timestep. Trial runs with varied timesteps are performed in order to keep the number of failing elements within the prescribed range. The fracture permeability model links the permeability of failed finite elements to displacement discontinuities (rather than to effective stresses.) A pressure corrector is applied to maintain mass balance in the system. Failed elements in the fracturing code create new porosity that is exported to the flow code. If no pressure correction is applied, this effectively means that mass will be artificially produced in the model when fracturing starts. In order to correct for this, the density of the fluid in failed elements is adjusted to maintain the mass balance. This is achieved by introducing a correction to the fluid pressure in failed elements. |Introduction |Depletion of easily producible hydrocarbon reservoirs calls for a steadily increasing share of low-permeability reservoirs in the global fuel portfolio. Such reservoirs include e.g. shale gas reserves and tight gas sands. Also extracting more oil from conventional reservoirs remains high on the agenda. These current challenges require that stimulation techniques used to increase well productivity in low-permeable and/or complex reservoirs be improved and optimized to ensure a stable production over long time. |Hydraulic fracturing is a widespread technique used for well stimulation in conventional and unconventional reservoirs [1]. A fluid, or a sequence of different fluids, is injected form a well into the formation in order to create a hydraulic fracture. With regard to the vertical extent of the hydraulic fracture, treatments are usually designed to contain the fracture within the productive zone and avoid its penetration into the under- and overburden. The fracture length should ensure an economical increase in the well productivity without e.g. jeopardizing the integrity of the neighboring wells. This turns design of a hydraulic fracturing treatment into an optimization exercise. It calls for robust and compute-efficient numerical models that can predict fracture growth in a mechanically and hydraulically heterogeneous, and often naturally fractured, rock.|",,9

M., The Pennsylvania State University","|Abstract: |This paper proposed a conceptual model of broken rock mass compaction based on elastic theory by simplifying this compressing process and assuming the connection is a similar cubic mass without huge void space. With this simplification, the stress-strain constitutive law is established. The compacted rock mass permeability evolution was modeled based on the cubic law of porosity and permeability. The mechanical model was coupled into permeability evolution model. The predicted permeability evolution by coupled model is similar with reported experimental results. The modeled permeability results were indirectly validated using the weak sandstone input parameters. Compared to intact rock mass, we found that the stress-strain curve of compacted rock mass takes a longer stress-strain path to reach the linearity due to the void space compaction resulted from the friction slipping and re-arrangement of grains. It was also found that the grain elastic modulus does not contribute to the overall bulk compaction and permeability reduction at the initial compaction stage and it will control the permeability evolution only after the broken rock got fully compacted when it can be treated as intact rock mass. The proposed models will potentially lay foundation for the future permeability and caving behavior characterizations using numerical simulation for complex gob area. |Introduction |Long-wall mining is a very production-efficient coal mining technology with advantages including high recovery, safe working environment, operator-friendly roof management, easy mine management and highly-developed mechanization. In a typical long-wall operation, a working panel is usually more than 200 m in width and 2000 m in length. During the operation, the panel progressively moves forward as the coal is continuously removed and the immediate roof instantly caves behind the hydraulic supports. However, the overlying rock strata hang up and the span increases with mining advance. The overlying rock strata act like a beam and will break into large blocks until the span reaches to its limiting strength value. The broken rocks composed with immediate roof and overlying strata fill in the caved zone termed as “gob” or “goaf”. To meet the health and safety standards, gob gas control is being a challenging task due to its complexity of the gas flow behavior. |The gob with highly irregular shape and different granular broken rocks could reach 4-11 times the thickness of the mining height.

Synthetic seismicity from the model helps quantify seismic energy released by the slippage on the fault. The model is based on a case study in the Horn River Basin by Snelling et al., 2013a. The multi-stage hydraulic fracture model is able to reproduce seismic deformation characteristics observed in field data. Results show that even stages distant from the fault have an influence on the slippage on the fault with a delayed effect. If the first injection stage is the closest to the fault, a large area will be slipping. Successive stages will have a lesser impact due to stress shadowing. If the first stage is farthest from the fault, then slippage on the fault will be gradual, reducing the amount of seismic moment release in a short period of time. This model can be used as a framework to examine the impact of other geomechanical characteristics or other operational factors, which could help establish best practices to mitigate seismicity when faults begin to be active. |Introduction |Induced seismicity has become a concern for hydraulic fracturing operations in British Columbia and Alberta, Canada. Seismic monitoring is now mandatory for stimulation of two shale formations in this region. The challenge of hydraulic stimulations in areas prone to induced seismicity remains because mitigation can only be achieved with a good understanding of the underlying mechanisms linking multi-stage hydraulic fracturing operations and induced seismicity. |Geomechanical modeling is the best way to understand this link because it allows investigation of the interactions between multiple hydraulic fractures by modeling different injection scenarios and assessment of the sensitivity to different parameters. Many authors have proposed models to investigate induced seismicity (for instance, Goertz-Allmann and Wiemer, 2013; Rutqvist et al., 2013). Most find a strong correlation between pore pressure increase and areas where large magnitude events occur. The models indicate that the increase in pore pressure is caused by the hydraulic fracture following fluid injection. |None of these models can produce synthetic seismicity for quantitative comparison with recorded seismicity. The multi-stage hydraulic fracture model presented here is based on a fully hydraulically-mechanical coupled, 3-D model (Damjanac and Cundall, 2014) which produces synthetic seismicity, which can help quantify the seismic energy released by slippage on faults (Zhang et al., 2015).|",,25

Nicolas, The University of Texas at Austin","|Abstract: |During CO2 sequestration, petrophysical and geomechanical alteration of host formations can occur due to mineral dissolution and precipitation. At the core scale, laboratory tests have shown that sandstone or siltstone can be weakened through either naturally or artificially CO2-related alteration, but few quantitative studies have been performed to fully investigate the mechanism. Based on the hypothesis that CO2 alters the integrity of rock structure by changing cements rather than grains, we attempt to explain the degradation of cementation due to long-term contact with CO2 and how it leads to changes in rock mechanical properties. Pore-scale modeling by means of the Discrete Element Method (DEM) is used to perform the numerical simulations. The model is verified against the analytical Cavity Expansion Model (CEM) and validated against an experimental indentation test on sandstone without CO2-alteration. The experimental result for the same sandstone but with CO2-alteration is reproduced by fitting one microscopic parameter of cementation under the same simulation setup. The result demonstrates that the CO2-related degradation of rock properties can be numerically attributed to the weakening of cementation microscopic properties. Our study indicates that it is possible to describe the CO2-related degradation through particle-scale mechanisms. |Introduction |Geologic sequestration of CO2 is proposed as an economically viable approach to mitigate the CO2 emissions from fossil fuel consumption. Experiments at both field and laboratary scales have shown that injected CO2 is able to change the species composition through mineral dissolution and precipitation (Hovorka et al., 2006, 2013; Carroll et al., 2011; Lu et al., 2012). The occurrence of geochemical reactions initiated by the dissolution of CO2 can have either positive or negative impact. On the one hand, the trapping of CO2 could benefit from some of the reactions transforming the dissolved CO2 into new carbonate minerals (Bachu et al., 2007). On the other hand, other reactions may jeopardize the structure integrity of reservoir and caprock formations by altering the petrophysical and geomechanical properties (Rutqvist and Tsang, 2002; Espinoza et al., 2011; Rinehart et al., 2014; Renard et al., 2008). Positive feedback mechanisms leading to rock degradation at CO2 storage sites may facilitate the leakage of CO2 from host formations. |At the core scale, laboratory tests have shown that sandstones and siltstones can be weakened through either naturally or artificially CO2-related alteration (Sun et al., 2016), which may be the result of dissolution of interparticle cement (Major et al., 2014). Core-flood experiments are a platform for the artificially CO2-related alteration but with the limitation of extended experiment durations and complexity (Carroll et al., 2011, 2013; Rinehart et al., 2014). Autoclave experiments are easy to perform whereas the penetration depth of CO2 is limited to millimeters (Rimmele et al., 2010). Thus, micromechanical tests which can probe the reacted skin provide a diagnostic tool for rocks reacted in autoclave experiments (Sun et al., 2016). Indentation tests have been widely adopted to study the mechanical behavior of different materials (Oliver and Pharr, 2004; Kumar et al., 2012). The assessment of mechanical degradation of the rocks subject to CO2-related alteration can be easily and quickly achieved by indentation tests.|",,34

At such long time scales, rock failure occurs through time-dependent methods such as subcritical crack growth. Natural analogs, such as caves, where rock breakdown has occurred undisturbed over tens to hundreds of thousands of years, can be used to study such failure. An on-going project is reconstructing the process of natural cave breakdown at Kartchner Caverns through LIDAR scanning of the cave geometry and rockfall accumulation and 3D damage modeling of the resulting point clouds. Two modeling methods are compared in order to examine the importance of including time-dependence when analyzing rock behavior over long time scales. The first method is implemented as a fracture mechanics model through user subroutines in Abaqus. Damage occurs through calculation of decreasing rock bridge size from subcritical crack growth. The second method is implemented as a bonded particle model in PFC3D, using the flat-joint contact model for intact rock and the smooth-joint contact model for joints. Damage occurs through strength reduction of the material properties. The trade-offs in the two models (relative computational simplicity vs. more direct inclusion of time dependence) are discussed. |Introduction |Assessing long-term rock stability is an important aspect in the analysis of slopes, dam and bridge foundations, and other infrastructure. Rock behavior over tens to thousands of years must be anticipated when predicting the performance of, for example, an underground nuclear waste storage facility. At such long time scales, the time dependence of rock failure, typically ignored in short time scale analyses, has a significant effect and must be included in the analysis (EPRI, 2006). Time-dependent rock failure is thought to occur along pre-existing discontinuities through the failure of rock bridges (Kemeny, 2003). A rock bridge is a section of intact rock along an otherwise persistent discontinuity in a rock mass. Some examples of rock bridge geometries are shown in Fig. 1. The scale of rock bridges can range from centimeters to meters, but typically the rock bridge area is only a small percentage of the total fracture surface area (Frayssines and Hantz, 2009). Over long time scales, crack growth initiating at the tips of the pre-existing discontinuity slowly decreases the size of a rock bridge. Once the rock bridge size reaches zero (i.e., the former intact portion is fully cracked), the stability provided by the rock bridge ceases and the discontinuity fails (Kemeny, 2003).|",,19

The meshless nature of the SPH method has the potential to overcome the difficulties of mesh-based methods. In this paper, an attempt has been made to develop a numerical procedure for the SPH method which enables integrated simulation of pressure driven hydraulic fracture (HF) propagation, including consideration of natural fracture (NF) interaction. In this procedure, a NF plane or joint plane is approximated by straight line segments connected by a discrete set of joint particles. The jump in the velocity field and the surface traction, due to the discontinuity, are determined using joint stiffness properties on these joint particles. Joint points follow a Mohr–Coulomb friction law with a zero tension cutoff for modelling joint opening or shear behavior of the NF plane. For HF initiation and propagation in the continuous part of the domain, the model relies on the Drucker-Prager plasticity surface to predict the dilatancy aspect of the material response, and the Grady-Kipp damage model for tensile strain. This paper presents three numerical examples to show the capabilities of the proposed procedure for simulating HF-NF interaction. The first example deals with an internally pressurized circular hole under in-situ stress conditions, the second considers failure of a jointed circular rock sample, and last shows internally pressurized circular hole in the presence of a NF. |Introduction |Hydraulic fracturing in rock material is a highly complex process, where this complexity is further compounded by the interaction between pre-existing discontinuities such as a natural fracture networks, faults, and bedding planes. The propagation of a hydraulic fracture (HF) can be either arrested or redirected by a natural fracture (NF), where either case will lead to reactivation of the natural fracture. There are two big challenges in predicting the resultant HF network. First, the natural discontinuity planes have to be identified in terms of geometric and mechanical properties. Second, an understanding of the mechanical deformation of rocks due to pressure driven fracture initiation, and propagation, in the presence of an in-situ stress state is required. Moreover, the interaction between the HF and NF could cause dilation of the NF either in shear or tension. Numerical simulation of hydraulic fracturing is an economical and efficient technique for understanding these complex phenomena. Mesh-based continuum methods have the advantage of using classical nonlinear material models, however they do not always work well in a complex medium involving large deformation, multiple intersecting fractures and their interactions with pre-existing discontinuities. In particular, special treatments and assumptions have to be made for modelling fracture propagation, closing of an opened fracture and shear, which introduce numerical and geometric complexities in the implementation and lead to degradation of accuracy.|",,38
664,665,2016-587,Vast System of Dense Intersecting Fractures: A Key Feature of Hydraulic Fracturing of Gas Shale,"Bazant, Z. P., Northwestern University| Chau, V. T., Northwestern University","|Abstract: |This contribution presents a multi-physics modeling of fluid-driven propagation of a vast network of fractures and open joints in shale, with a fracture spacing of about 10 cm, as deduced from the observed gas extraction history at wellhead. Because of the vast number of fractures and quasibrittle nature of shale, the fracture of shale is analyzed in a smeared way by the crack band model. One key idea is that, to model lateral fractures branching from a primary fracture wall, fracture pressurization, by viscous Poiseuille type flow, of compressible (proppant-laden) fracturing water must be complemented with the pressurization of a sufficient volume of micropores and microfractures by Darcy-type water diffusion into the shale, which generates tension along the existing fracture walls, overcoming the strength limit of the cohesive-crack or crack-band model. A second key idea is that enforcing the equilibrium of stresses in fractures, pores and water, with the generation of tension in the solid phase, requires a new three-phase medium concept, transitional between Biot's two-phase medium and Terzaghi's effective stress. Finiteelement/finite-volume simulations demonstrate the growth of a large hydraulic fracture system. Study of the effects of various parameters could increase the efficacy of fracturing and reduce water injection. |Introduction |The recent advances in hydraulic fracturing of oil and gas bearing shale, which have made the US selfsufficient in energy for the first time in a half century, have been nothing less than astonishing. In 2010 shale gas production accounted for 23% of the total US gas production and it is projected to reach 50% by 2035 even at the current extraction efficiency. Although many aspects of hydraulic fracturing are well understood by now [1, 16, 30, 33, 44, 53, 54, 56], the details of topology, geometry, and evolution of the fracture system are not. Progress in this aspect of fracturing promises increasing the rate of gas extraction, currently standing at only 5% to 15%. |Based on the equations relating the measured gas flux histories at the wellhead (in Fayetteville basin) to the typical permeability of shale [34, 35, 59], a recent study [13] concluded that the spacing of fractures and opened rock joints in gas shale must be on the order of 0.1 m. Because the typical depth of a gas or oil bearing stratum of shale is about 2.5-3 km [24, 49] (Fig. 1), the overburden pressure is assumed to exceed the fluid pressure. Consequently, all the fractures and joints are modeled as essentially vertical, and no horizontal fractures allowed.|",,29

The progressive failure of rock bridges is an important process during damage development and brittle crack propagation in rock slopes. This paper investigates the importance of pre-existing discontinuities and rock bridges at the micro scale on rock strength. Mechanisms of rock crack initiation, coalescence and propagation in rock with an emphasis on rock bridge failure are analyzed using 2D finite-discrete element (FDEM) numerical models. The scope of this study is to simulate the behaviour of a homogeneous and isotropic Barre Granite under standard laboratory uniaxial compression test. The capability of the code to accurately model the mechanical behaviour of homogeneous rock is validated against results published in the literature. In addition, new methodologies are suggested for processing the numerically-generated cracks at the laboratory-scale models. Discrete Crack Network techniques are employed to monitor crack development, locate crack nucleation sites and investigate crack coalescence and propagation associated with rock bridge failure. |Introduction |Step-path failure in rock slopes involves brittle crack initiation, propagation, coalescence and final failure. Stability analysis approaches for high natural or engineering rock slopes should account for brittle failure due to high stress concentrations that may exist leading to the development of stress-induced rock cracks (Hajiabdolmajid and Kaiser, 2002). These stress-induced cracks may provide kinematic freedom for a previously stable block and result in slope failure. The stochastic character of geometric parameters, persistence and water pressure need to be considered in various rock bridge configurations as well as computation of an overall probability of slope failure. The partially-controlled failure occurs through a combination of different mechanisms such as tensile cracking and sliding on preexisting structures in the rock mass. In these cases, development of the stress-induced cracks is required for failure as the rock mass is not kinematically free to move out of the slope. This type of failure often occurs at larger scales where high stress levels may cause the development of secondary, stress-induced damage zones. |Due to the importance of rock bridge formation in geotechnical engineering studies, the cracking stages and the rock bridge response should be investigated at the laboratory-scale. Determination of the cracking levels during crack propagation is one of the key challenges in rock mechanics.|",,35

D., Massachusetts Institute of Technology| Williams, J. R., Massachusetts Institute of Technology","|Abstract: |This paper uses Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) to analyze failure mechanism by predicting initiation and subsequent propagation of cracks without any special treatment or assumption on the fracturing process. An elasto-plastic damage model is incorporated into the SPH framework to enable non-linear behavior of the material. This constitutive model accounts for the irreversible process caused by plastic strain accumulation and the degradation of material properties due to damage initiation and development. A circular disc loaded diametrically is simulated within the proposed framework. It has been shown that the tensile stress distribution at the central area of the disc agrees well with the theoretical results. In order to study the effect of the loading angle on the failure process, three different central angles of the boundary load are considered in the numerical simulation. In addition to the circular disc, numerical simulations of a ring specimen under diametrically concentrated load are also presented. |Introduction |Tensile strength of rock is one of the major concern in the study of rock property along with other properties which plays an important role in various geomechanical activities like blasting of rocks, hydraulic fracturing of a borehole, drilling and excavation in mining. Insight into the understanding of the failure process and prediction of failure paths remain a big challenge for a wide range of problems encountered in the field of rock mechanics and rock engineering. Experimental studies indicate that failure processes are generally initiated by the development of microcracks, propagation and interaction of several cracks, defects and inherent flaws. Mechanical properties and failure characteristics of rock materials are sensitive to the loading conditions. For example, the Brazilian test, as an indirect tensile test, is commonly conducted to determine the tensile strength of rock. The failure of the specimen is expected along the loading diameter into two halves, but another failure mode can occur near the loading boundary. Moreover, the tensile strength and failure characteristics can vary significantly with the specimen size and loading conditions. |The prediction of breakage phenomenon and failure mode remains a big challenge in the experimental test. In view of that, many micromechanical models have been proposed. The concept and theories of fracture mechanics have been applied to predict fracture generation and propagation in rock medium (Paterson & Wong 2005). Computational methods are noticeably well suited to investigate the process of rock degradation and failure, such as the lattice based model (Blair & Cook 1998) in which the local element is considered to be failed by tensile cracking if the local tensile stress exceeds the local tensile strength, the local degradation model on FLAC (Fang & Harrison 2002), the synthetic rock mass model based on PFC (Potyondy & Cundall 2004), and the digital image approaches based on the FLAC (Chen et al. 2004), FEM (Ortiz et al. 1987) for localized failure. Tang et al. (2000) analyzed the rock deformation, both pre- and post-failure using finite element code, in which the elastic modulus and strength of the individual elements were assumed to follow the Weibull distribution.|",,28
667,668,2016-586,Influence of Stress on the Permeability of a Three-Dimensional Fractured Sedimentary Layer,"Lei, Q., Imperial College London| Wang, X., Imperial College London| Xiang, J., Imperial College London| Latham, J.-P., Imperial College London","|Abstract: |This paper presents a stress-induced variable aperture model to characterise the effect of polyaxial stress conditions on the permeability of a three-dimensional (3D) fractured sedimentary layer. The 3D fracture network is created by extruding a 2D outcrop pattern of a limestone bed that exhibits a ladder structure consisting of a “through-going” joint set abutted by later short fractures. Geomechanical modelling of the fractured rock is achieved by the 3D finite-discrete element method (FEMDEM), which can capture the deformation of matrix blocks, the variation of stress fields, the reactivation of pre-existing fractures and the propagation of new cracks. A joint constitutive model (JCM) is implemented to simulate the rough wall interaction behaviour of individual fractures associated with roughness characteristics. The combined JCM-FEMDEM model gives realistic fracture behaviour with respect to opening, closing, shearing and dilatancy, and includes the recognition of the important size effect. A series of 3D geomechanical simulations is conducted for the fractured rock under various polyaxial in-situ stresses. Fluid flow is further modelled for the stressed but static solid skeletons based on the hybrid finite element-finite volume method (FEFVM). The magnitude of the equivalent permeability varies significantly with respect to the change of stress ratio. |Introduction |Natural fractures are ubiquitous in crustal rocks in the form of faults, bedding planes, joints and veins over different length scales (Lei and Wang, 2016). These naturally occurring discontinuities often comprise complex networks and dominate the geomechanical and hydromechanical behaviour of subsurface media (Rutqvist and Stephansson, 2003). The understanding of the nontrivial effects of fractures on the overall behaviour of such highly disordered geological media has important implications for many engineering applications including geothermal energy, nuclear repository safety and petroleum recovery. |Discrete fracture networks (DFNs) are often used to mimic naturally faulted or jointed geological structures (Dershowitz and Einstein, 1988). Compared to the conventional dual porosity model (Warren and Root, 1963) and analytical solution for mathematically idealised discontinuity networks (Oda, 1985), the discrete fracture approach possesses the advantage of explicit representation of fracture geometries together with specific description of hydraulic transmissivity (Herbert, 1996). Flow properties, such as the block or equivalent permeability tensor, of a finite-sized fracture system can be studied from steady state fluid flow modelling (Lang et al., 2014; Renard and de Marsily, 1997).|",,10

L., The University of Tennessee Space Institute| Enayatpour, S., Center for Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering, The University of Texas at Austin","|Abstract: |Realistic fracture simulations in rock as a heterogeneous brittle material with significant inherent randomness, requires the use of models that incorporate its inhomogeneities and statistical variability. Dynamic crack growth in rocks is generally associated with complex features such as crack path oscillations, microcracking and crack branching. We employ two approaches to address rock inhomogeneities for dynamic fracture simulations. First we model fractures explicitly with random size, location and orientation as natural pre-existing crack-like defects. Second, we use a probabilistic nucleation technique based on the Weibull model to implicitly incorporate creation of new cracks during the analysis. Both approaches can be used for the simulation of rocks for which the natural fractures are oriented in a specific angle, as in sedimentary rocks. We use the Spacetime Discontinuous Galerkin (SDG) method to efficiently and accurately capture complex fracture patterns observed in dynamic rock fracture. Specifically we employ a novel crack path tracking method, offered by the SDG method's powerful adaptive operations, to accurately model crack path oscillations, microcracking, and crack bifurcation. Our approach is applicable to rock fracture as well as problems where an induced major crack propagates and intersects natural fractures. Incorporation of macro-micro crack interactions can provide a more accurate estimation in hydrocarbon recovery in tight formations. |Introduction |Rocks are heterogeneous at different scales. At small grain scale, they are characterized by the presence of microcracks and granular microstructures. In fact, rocks contain a large number of randomly oriented zones of potential failure in the form of grain boundaries. At large mass scale, they are described by the presence of different rock types, faults and weak features such as fracture networks. These inhomogeneities affect the continuum level mechanical characteristics of rocks such as strength, toughness, and elasticity properties. However, mechanical properties of a solid can also be estimated by simulating its microstruc-ture while it is loaded. In this context, failure in rock can be considered as the consequence of tensile and shear micro-fractures which progress within the microstructure and finally result in macro-fractures known as a failure state. |In many applications it is important to consider the natural discontinuities of rocks at different observation scales. Microcracks and pores in micro-scale or pre-existing fracture networks and faults in macroscale influence the formation of new discontinuities by joining and interacting with them. Rock blasting and hydraulic fracturing in tight formations are two examples in which the goal of induced dynamic loadings is to increase the discontinuities. This issue needs to be properly addressed in computational simulations. The consequences of rock blasting which includes fracturing of the rock and fragment size distributions should be well estimated in design process. In hydraulic fracturing, an induced major crack propagates and intersects natural fractures which in turn are hydraulically loaded and extended to intersect other fissures and finally results in a new complicated fracture network. Incorporation of macro-micro crack interactions can highly improve computational estimations for the problems dealing with fracture in rocks. For example, models that do not include the interactions of main hydraulically loaded and propagated cracks with natural fissures often underestimate the hydrocarbon recovery from a tight reservoir. In contrast to these problems at which the aim of numerical evaluation is to maximize the fractures and cracks in rock, there are some events aiming to limit the formation of new fractures and prevent rock failure. Natural slopes, dams and underground openings are among the examples in which the existing natural fractures should be included in the simulations for their stability assessments.|",,51

L., The University of Tennessee Space Institute| Omidi, O., The University of Tennessee Space Institute| Abedi, R., The University of Tennessee Space Institute","|Abstract: |Advancing fractures during the hydraulic fracturing process can produce complicated growth pattern when propagating in a pre-exiting natural fracture network. A proper network representation for simulating pressure-driven and natural fracture interactions is crucial as these occurrences may result in significant diversion of fracture paths which potentially generate difficulties in proppant transport and ineffectiveness of the treatment. In this study fracture network and propagation patterns are modeled with a simplicial complex network representation and geometrical information are analyzed with a graph theoretic approach. In conjunction with graph theoretic algorithms, a disjoint-set data structure is employed to track fracture connectivity, dynamic hydraulic load advancing in the fracture network and load transfers between independent sets of fractures. This permits imposing independent loading conditions for arbitrary sets of fracture sets. The procedure is implemented in a spacetime discontinuous Galerkin finite element scheme, whose efficiency and accuracy are very important for the type for fracture simulations considered herein. In addition, the SDG method's powerful mesh adaptive operations enable direct tracking of arbitrary crack propagation patterns. Numerical results, of the dynamics problem solution, from various crack configurations and loading conditions will be presented which can have applications in the stability analysis of natural faults close to hydraulic fracturing reservoirs. For all case studies, the rock matrix domain is subject to confinement (compressive) stress conditions on the boundary; the simplicial complex network is capable to incorporate the connectivity of the main crack with natural fissures and microcracks that are generated due to dynamic loading. |Introduction |Among the variety of ubiquitous engineering applications of the hydraulic fracturing process, the most common representation is within the energy industry; this involves the treatment of tight geological formations by inducing hydro-fractures into natural fracture networks to enhance the production rate of low-permeability reservoirs. To increase the efficiency of this costly process, it is essential to understand the mechanisms involved which can be difficult due to complex fracture networks both natural and created by the hydraulic fracture process. An accurate representation of the hydraulic and natural fracture network is insightful in determining: i) mechanics of applying hydraulic load during the treatment process, ii) the mechanical properties and mechanical integrity of the rock matrix and reservoir, and iii) the reservoir product yield (e.g., hydrocarbon recovery).|",,52

Consequently, upward movement, differential heave on foundations, and foundation failures may be observed due to this phenomenon. The upward movement of swelling claystone layers increase when these layers are exposed to moisture content increase. There are limited studies on evaluating the effects of expansive rock layers such as claystone on the behavior of pier group foundations. In this investigation, the behavior of a group pier system is studied based on the swelling pressure of expansive claystone layers through a series of computational three-dimensional numerical analyses. Numerical results indicate that with increase of center-to-center spacing of the group pier, upward movement will increase. Also, with increase of superstructure pressure, the upward movement decreases. For a 100 percent increase of superstructure pressure, the upward movement is reduced by approximately 77, 72 and 66 percent for ratio of center-to-center spacing to pier diameter of 2.3, 3, and 3.6, respectively. |Introduction |Foundations constructed on weathered rocks especially claystone are subjected to heave and upward movement due to cyclic drying and wetting of expansive layers. Upward movement of foundations cause considerable damages on superstructures. Understanding of swelling behavior of rocks with high percent of clayey material such as claystone or shale is important to identify potential swelling of the ground. Investigation of the response of foundations and superstructure due to ground swelling is also crucial to determine any possible damages or deficiencies. |Different investigators have studied the swelling behavior of expansive rocks with clayey materials. Picornell and Lytton, 1984, and Huang et al., 1986 evaluated swelling responses of cemented claystone and shale, respectively. Mudrock swelling modes have been considered by Sarman et al., 1994. Moreover, the effects of cycling of wetting and drying in weathered mudrock was evaluated by Doostmohammadi et al., 2009. However, there are limited studies for evaluating the heave response of structures and foundations in swelling rocks.

When a hole is drilled through a rock formation, the stressed rock is replaced with a drilling mud. Estimating drilling induced stresses is central to the determination of optimal drilling mud weight. Analytical and numerical solutions to determine the stress field around boreholes in elastic rocks currently exist. However, there exists a lack of reliable numerical methods able to accommodate the highly complex situations present in compactible rocks. |This paper advances a general framework for estimating stresses around boreholes drilled in weak and compactible rocks. A review of the germane forces followed by development of a three dimensional Finite Element model is presented. Rock deformation is modeled using the Extended-Sandler-Rubin (ESR) cap model, a sophisticated material model which includes a non-linear shear failure surface and a second yield surface (cap) to account for inelastic compaction at stress state lower than those required to induce shear failure. |This model couples fluid flow with rock deformation, a major improvement over existing analytical solutions. As such, it can estimate borehole stresses for cases with constant and varying pore pressure. Furthermore, injection and production induced stresses can also be found using this model. Comparisons between the proposed model and the existing analytical elastic solutions in the literature for constant and varying pore pressure are presented. |Introduction |During drilling operations, load bearing formation rock is replaced with drilling mud. This leads to stress redistribution in the vicinity of the well. Non-existent prior to drilling, deviatoric stress forms around the well. Comparatively, weak rock formations have less resistance to deviatoric stress. Hence, determination of the new stress distribution is central to preventing mechanical wellbore stability problems. |Linear Elastic Solutions |Kirsch [1] gave the first general solution to find stresses in a hollow linearly elastic cylinder subjected to internal and external radial stresses. Since then, these solutions have grown tremendously. Nowadays, there is a linear elastic solution for almost every situation one might encounter in the field, including with/without fluid flow, poroelastic effects, and so on [2].|",,10

This paper presents a numerical methodology for studying these forms of unstable failures by calculating the unstable excess energy which is released by their occurrence. An explicit finite difference model is used to demonstrate several cases of underground openings being formed in highly stressed ground. Energy changes calculated by the models are first validated from analytical solutions. The unstable excess energy released during a brittle failure or slip along a discontinuity is compared with the theoretical approach. Effects of material brittleness in more complex models are then explored as well as the strength and failure characteristics of a neighboring fault. Parametric studies are performed to identify the circumstances under which seismicity may occur. Unstable failure conditions resulting in seismicity emerge in some of the models and excess energy is produced which cannot be stored or consumed in the system. This excess energy is calculated for each model and is used to assess the relative magnitudes of instability for the given conditions. The results of the models demonstrate that a reduction in strength of the rock during failure can lead to sudden slip of the fault and can trigger a self-propagating failure, although in-situ stresses and the stiffness of the system can totally alter the results. The energy based methods of analysis outlined in this paper provide a rational means of studying induced seismicity in potentially complex combinations of rock mass properties, excavation geometries, and failure characteristics of faults or bedding plane discontinuities. |Introduction |Induced seismicity is one of the most important, yet difficult to address, challenges in underground projects. Projects encountering induced seismicity range from mining and tunneling excavations (Garvey and Ozbay, 2013), to unconventional oil and gas industry (Suckale, 2009), to enhanced geothermal systems (Evans et al., 2012) or waste water injection (Zhang et al., 2013). This phenomenon refers to tremors precipitated by the stress redistribution and resultant changes in the strain on the Earth's crust. These changes may originate from the release of tectonic stresses or stresses induced by industrial activities. Although relaxing the induced stresses may also lead to relaxing tectonic stresses (Ellsworth, 2013). |In most cases, seismicity is triggered by rock failure in compression or slip along discontinuities in shear. Compressive failures are common in deep underground projects due to the high stresses exceeding the unconfined strength of the rock. A drop of confinement can also cause the rock surrounding an opening to fail suddenly. The stress redistribution may, moreover, lead to de-confinement or an increase in the shear stress along a discontinuity resulting in a slip failure of a fault or discontinuity within the affected stress field.|",,25

Engineers use geomechanical models to better understand the complex interactions occurring at depth (Hazzard, 2002). In turn, these models must be tested to ensure that they are capturing the essential features of the hydraulic fracture. This requires controlled experiments, which can simulate the hydraulic fracturing process at the laboratory scale (mm – cm). |For our study, there were two main goals.

S., ESG Solutions| Toya, Y., ESG Solutions| Hosseini, Z., ESG Solutions","|Abstract: |The rock mass response to mining is a complicated time dependent process that involves elastic and inelastic stress change. For most rock types, a microseismic monitoring system offers a way to see into a volume and accurately identify where inelastic fracture creation, shear movement on faults, or closure type events are occurring. In general mines collect and archive a significant amount of information in a seismic database over time. A closer seismic analysis of data (in addition to location and magnitude) can reveal hidden deformation/failure processes occurring in the rockmass over time, especially when looking at seismic event clusters. This paper presents results from the seismic deformation method and stress inversion analysis applied to seismic clusters from monitoring systems installed in two hard rock mines in Ontario Canada. Seismic deformation projected on a known fault surface is presented as a method for interpreting which region of the fault has failed. Seismic stress inversion analysis is performed on a cluster of seismic source mechanism results as a way to determine local stress directions and stress magnitude ratio in a region of a mine. Seismic stress results offer an important way to help validate numerical stress model results. This paper shows how more advanced microseismic analysis techniques can be used to produce results that can help engineers mine more safely and productively. |Introduction |Microseismic (MS) monitoring is a powerful method for listening to a rockmass and determining details about where fractures are developing. It is a type of “big data” since most sites with a system will record between 50-2000 individual triggers per day on 10-100 sensors at 510kHz sampling frequency. Additionally the systems let the user go back and analyze longer time periods of data. For example, full blast sequences can be extracted and analyzed to help optimize the subblast time sequencing [1]. The blast sequence analysis can check to see that all subblasts are occurring with expected PPV (peak particle velocity). Subblasts with higher than expected PPV may be causing dilution of the ore or possible failure of the support in place on nearby access tunnels. |All users want to get accurate seismic event locations from their system. This fundamental parameter is becoming more accurate as sites regularly calibrate and improve the accuracy of the velocity model being used. Example of the use of a 3D velocity model (3DVM) for a block cave mine with complex geological blocks with different properties and a large cave void was shown by [2] to result in a 47% improvement in location accuracy. Also the move to mixed uniaxial and triaxial sensor systems is a cost effective way to get higher location accuracy since there are more sensors in the ground xial seismic system.|",,25

R., San Juan Coal Company","|Abstract: |The physical, structural, and depositional features of the immediate above seam strata which characterize San Juan Mine are localized in extent; regional scale features having little direct influence. Four primary drivers of ground control difficulties associated with the immediate above seam strata are geomechanical properties, structural features, sandstone channels, and water. The immediate above seam strata are characteristically weak with limited load bearing capacity. Structural features, primarily faults and to a lesser extent weak bedding planes and contacts, present planes of weakness within the strata allowing for displacement. Sandstone channels are associated with higher densities of faults due to compactional shear and are the primary source of mine roof water. Mine roof water has a detrimental effect on the strength of the immediate roof mudstones as well as through degradation of roof support through chemical interaction. |Introduction |San Juan Mine is an underground longwall coal mine located within the San Juan Basin of northwest New Mexico. While mining practices and mine design directly affect short and long term ground control conditions at San Juan, they are themselves governed to a large extent by the physical and geological characteristics of the mineable coal seam and the strata comprising the immediate roof. The immediate roof, here defined as the strata within the bolted beam to approximately 10 m above, has the greatest influence on ground control at San Juan. The physical, structural, and depositional features characterizing the immediate roof determine primary roof support design as well as long term roof stability or lack thereof. |The regional geologic history and setting leading to deposition and formation of the coal seam, while certainly relevant to the discussion of ground control, is subordinate to the mine specific geology when addressing the direct impacts on ground control at San Juan.

An accurate description of the fractures, as well as their behavior during reservoir depletion, is a fundamental aspect during reservoir development and production including well planning, completion operations such as hydraulic fracturing interaction with pre-existing natural fractures, and production/injection operations that might reduce/ maintain the permeability depending on the deformation of the natural fractures, with the obvious effect on fluid production and profitability of the field. |The hydro-mechanical (HM) behavior of natural fractures greatly impacts the productivity of fractured reservoirs. Coupled simulations are especially relevant in this type of reservoirs due to the strong dependence of the fracture permeability on its aperture. The fluid flow analysis affects the geomechanics in terms of pore pressure changes occurring during production and/or injection, which affect the effective stress distribution acting on the natural fractures, and therefore contribute to their opening or closure. At the same time, the geomechanics analysis affects the fluid flow in the sense that changes in fracture deformation and aperture have a major impact on the fracture permeability, in addition to affecting the storability of the system. These changes on the flow parameters affect the pore pressure behavior, which, as already mentioned, affects the effective stress acting on the fractures, closing in this way the HM coupled loop.|",,10

M., Repsol| Mattos da Cruz, A., Repsol| Stachlewski, G., Repsol| Alvarellos, J., Repsol| Vargas, P. E., Repsol| Lakshmikantha, M. R., Repsol","|Abstract: |Salt mechanics plays a main role in the stress regimes of (ultra-deep) pre and post-salt reservoir plays. Stability issues associated to drilling to these targets include salt creep, uncertain fracture gradient and stress orientation at the entrance/exit of salt, or fault stability amongst others. A numerical study is presented, which investigates the criticality of a group of faults in the crest of a diapir in order to optimize well trajectories and reduce drilling risks of exploratory/appraisal wells targeting a pre-salt reservoir. The model allows determining and assessing fault stability under present day stress conditions for all the existing fault surfaces. A hypothetical case without explicit representation of faults is also considered in order to determine the effect of the geological setting alone. The numerical results show that the rock above the diapir structure will fail along planes resembling the major faults observed in seismic interpretation. Plane strain hypothesis have been verified with the result from a 3D geomechanical model, which have been used to predict fracture gradient and stress orientation at the exit of the salt anywhere in the block. |Introduction |Predicting drilling conditions in advance is a fundamental task in well planning operations. This is especially relevant during field exploration and appraisal, when the available information and drilling experience from offset wells can be very scarce. Geomechanical analysis can help reducing risks and optimize drilling operations by estimating the stress conditions along a borehole prior to drilling, and hence predicting safer well tracks optimizing well trajectories and mud weight windows. |In complex geological structural settings numerical modeling can help reducing the uncertainty in predicting the drilling conditions by calculating the 3D stress field distribution, as well as analyzing other health, safety and environmental concerns like fault stability. One of such settings is found in areas influenced by salt tectonics (Alsop et al., 2012), where the effect of salt rheology and geology on the stress distribution must be taken into account during exploration and production activities (Orlic and Wassing, 2012; Henk, 2005; Thornton et al. 2011; Roberts et al. 2015). |Salt structures have several drilling risks associated that must be foreseen in advance before entering or exiting the salt like excessive mud losses and fault stability/reactivation, and other that appear while drilling the salt rock itself, most of them associated to salt creep (Costa et al., 2010; Cullen et al., 2010). Furthermore, drilling in these locations can mean drilling through completely different conditions and scenarios for wells that are separated just a few kilometers away due to the effect of salt tectonics, which forms geological structures with irregular salt layer thickness and lithology distribution that depend on the stress and depositional history. A particular case is the crest of salt diapirs, which are usually highly faulted areas with a specific stress regime requiring special attention for the location and drilling of new wells.|",,23
678,679,2016-519,Simulation of Dynamic Triggering of Acoustic Emissions Using a Bonded-Particle Method,"Lu, Hang, University of Alberta| van der Baan, Mirko, University of Alberta","|Abstract: |Microseismic events are commonly recorded during hydraulic fracturing experiments. In microseismic interpretations, each event is often regarded as causally independent and uncorrelated to neighboring ones. In reality, both the rock deformation (static stresses) and transient wave motion (dynamic stresses) associated with microseismic events influence the stress field together with the external loading (fluid injection). It is thus very likely that many microseismic events are caused by both static and dynamic stress changes. In other words, some events may be caused by propagation of transient waves instead of the stress changes purely related to fluid injection. We study dynamic triggering of acoustic emissions as an analogy of microseismic events using numerical simulations of a biaxial deformation test by means of a bonded-particle method. We apply an external vibration at the bottom platen of the model to study the influence of transient wave motion on failure in a controlled fashion. Our results show that the external vibration can advance the formation of the upcoming large local failure events and delay or advance the final catastrophic failure depending on the vibrational amplitude. |Introduction |In hydraulic fracturing, microseismic events are taken independently in that they are all attributed to the developing hydraulic fractures and no event causes another one. The hydraulic fractures are the result of tensile and shear failure imposed by fluid injection, leading to pore pressure diffusion as well as the large static elastic stress perturbations in the surrounding areas due to imposed volumetric changes. Conversely, seismologists believe that earthquakes are caused by both static and dynamic stress perturbations (Freed, 2005) in that one event may cause another one, leading to the concept of main shocks and aftershocks. Static stress perturbations leave a permanent imprint on the stress field (e.g., a developing hydraulic fracture). Dynamic stress perturbations are generally due to transient waves propagating through the medium. Both dynamic and static stress perturbations can trigger failure, in particular if the system is critically stressed. Our long-term goal is to investigate the effect of dynamic stress perturbations on microseismic event characteristics. |Unlike destructive laboratory tests, numerical simulations have the advantage of repeatability. They provide direct means to measure variables associated with particle dynamics which cannot be done in laboratory or field. We use the bonded-particle method (Ponyondy and Cundall, 2004). It models the real material as a set of particles bonded together according to user-defined microproperties, which present macroproperties, e.g. the bulk modulus, of the real material. Saving the effort in defining complex constitutive relationships, the bonded-particle method can create cracks spontaneously due to local stress concentrations exceeding the bond strength. This makes BPM an optimal method for failure simulation.|",,52

Irazu is a general-purpose numerical simulation software which combines continuum mechanics principles with discrete element algorithms to simulate the mechanical response of brittle geomaterials. To overcome the computational limitations of FDEM codes, Irazu utilizes the parallel processing power of general-purpose graphics processing units (GPGPUs). As a result, Irazu shows impressive speedups compared with a sequential central processing unit (CPU) FDEM code. The code capabilities are illustrated herein by simulating the complex failure mechanics of bedded rock samples. A case study to assess the stability of the overhang of a mine loading pocket demonstrates Irazu's application to field-scale problems. Overall, superior physics and computational performance make Irazu a state-of-the-art, commercial simulation tool for tackling complex geomechanical applications in mining, civil, and petroleum engineering. |Introduction |Conventionally, numerical approaches used in rock mechanics are based on either continuum or discrete (discontinuum) formulations. These approaches fail to capture the emergence of new discontinuities generated by brittle fracturing processes. Over the last decade, multiple numerical approaches have been developed and applied to overcome this limitation (Lisjak & Grasselli, 2014). Among these methods, bonded discrete element models explicitly capture fracturing of brittle geomaterials by introducing cohesive contact models between the blocks or particles used to represent the solid structure. Alternatively, advanced continuum approaches, including the generalized finite element method (GFEM) and the extended finite element method (XFEM), have been proposed. In recent years, the combined (or hybrid) finite-discrete element method (FDEM) pioneered by Munjiza (2004) and implemented in the Y-Geo code (Mahabadi et al., 2012) has emerged as a promising technique to explicitly simulate fracture and fragmentation processes in brittle geomaterials. FDEM is an explicit numerical method which combines continuum mechanics principles with discrete element algorithms to simulate multiple interacting deformable and fracturable solids. While the elastic deformation of discrete bodies is described by the continuum finite element method (FEM), the contact detection and interaction of discrete bodies is captured using aspects of the discrete element method (DEM). The progressive mechanical breakdown and failure of rock material is represented using a cohesive fracture model.|",,48

R., Repsol","|Abstract: |Predicting drilling conditions in advance is of prime importance in oil and gas exploration. A close estimate of predrill pore pressure profiles helps reducing drilling operational risks (e.g. kicks) as well as optimizing drilling operations (e.g. mud weight window, casing design). In addition to undercompaction and other overpressure generation mechanisms, chemical compaction effects can produce overpressure in lithologies subject to high temperature conditions. This work presents a pore pressure model for an exploratory well that reproduces the depositional history of the well including chemical and mechanical compaction. The model has been calibrated and verified by comparison to drilling experience and available logs. Advantages and limitations of the model are presented, as well as its capabilities for pore pressure prognosis for new offset exploratory wells in the region. For such a purpose, the calibrated lithology models have been verified by reproducing the depositional and overpressure generation in two offset wells, obtaining results that compare well with their drilling experience. Finally, the model is used to predict the pore pressure conditions along a proposed new well trajectory. The models also provide estimates of overpressure timing in all the trajectories as valuable information for geologists studying the basin evolution. |Introduction |Exploratory operations can have major uncertainty in predicting drilling conditions, especially in areas that lack drilling experience or in areas that due to some specific depositional history and conditions depart from the general trend observed in nearby wells. One of such special cases is related to overpressure mechanisms due to chemical diagenesis and compaction related processes, which can play a big role in specific rock fabrics exposed to high-temperature conditions [1, 2]. |Predicting pore pressure in advance helps reducing wells operational risks and costs by optimizing drilling operations (e.g. mud weight windows, trajectory analysis and casing design amongst others). Traditional methodologies for pore pressure prediction are based on quasi-empirical estimations of the mechanical compaction disequilibrium that can appear in low permeability rocks (e.g. equivalent depth or Eaton's methods). These methods identify deviations from normal compaction trends using logs like neutron density, compressional velocities (sonic) or/and resistivity, to quantify the amount of overpressure that remains in the formation (e.g. [3]). Finite element modeling can be also used to reproduce the depositional sequence of sediments and study the evolution of overpressure and thermal maturation in sedimentary basins [4]. Other aspects like buoyancy and centroid effect, increase in compressive stress or chemical compaction amongst others can produce overpressure conditions too [5]. In the particular case of overpressure due to chemical processes, this can be triggered by temperature increases and the chemical composition of the rock, which can induce changes in the porosity and pore-pressure generation mechanisms [6, 7]. Overpressure related to chemical compaction might not correlate well with sonic velocities. In order to account for the combination of mechanical and chemical compaction processes, alternative methods to the classical approach based on normal compaction trends can be used, one of them being numerical modeling.|",,10
681,682,2016-514,Workflow on Incorporating Thick-Walled Cylinder Test Results in Finite Element Models of near Wellbore for Sanding Prediction Studies,"Santana, Claudia, Halliburton| Likrama, Fatmir, Halliburton","|Abstract: |Thick-walled (TWC) cylinder triaxial as well as uniaxial compressive strength tests are commonly used experimental techniques for determining the potential for sand production. Industry-wide, the most commonly used analytical and empirical models use the results of these tests as inputs and as a measure of rock resistance to shear failure, which is a necessary condition for sand production. Both triaxial and thick-wall cylinder testing measure rock strength properties; however, thick-wall cylinder testing is the best representative laboratory model of a wellbore perforation in subsurface conditions. Plasticity and scale effects are implicitly incorporated in the TWC strength. Besides analytical methods, finite element methods are increasingly used to model near wellbore stresses, strains, and rock failure for sanding prediction analysis. This work illustrates the need for calibrating the finite element model to thick wall testing results and reproducing them for a realistic simulation of sand production phenomenon. The paper presents a workflow that achieves the best match between laboratory test results and finite element model simulation results. It includes the experimentally observable curves of thick-walled cylinder testing, such as volumetric strain vs. hydrostatic stress. A finite element model of the same test is developed and the material strength and plasticity properties are calibrated to match test results. The paper demonstrates that the Mohr Coulomb failure criterion with the Menetrey-Willam plastic flow model is able to satisfactorily match experimental results and discusses the importance of calibrating post-failure hardening vs. softening parameters. Once the numerical test matches the experimental results, the critical equivalent plastic strain can be estimated and the threshold for failure determined. The calibrated rock properties can then be used to simulate near wellbore failure during fluid production using the correct equivalent plastic strain threshold for failure. This workflow allows for more accurate sanding production prediction analysis providing the link between experiments and numerical modeling. |Introduction |The thick-walled cylinder (TWC) test and advanced thick-walled cylinder (ATWC) test, as well as triaxial and uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) tests are commonly used experimental techniques for determining the potential for sand production of reservoir rocks during production.

B., Chevron Corporation","|Abstract: |Routine measurement of hydraulic diffusivity of ultra-low permeability rocks, such as shale, is a prolonged process. This study explores the effects of sorptive characteristic of porous medium on hydraulic diffusivities of shale rocks. The examined rock types include Mancos Shale, Catoosa Shale, Eagle Ford Shale, and core samples from Gulf of Mexico. Firstly, the adsorption isotherms of the selected shale rocks were obtained. Then, the hydraulic properties of the selected shale rocks were determined using Shale-Fluid Interaction Testing Cell, which employs the pressure transmission technique. The experimental results show that the moisture content of shale is correlated with water activity using a multilayer adsorption theory. It is found that the adsorption isotherms of various shale formations can be scaled using their respective cation exchange capacity, into a single adsorption isotherm. The study proposes an isotherm correlation, which represents ten different shale formations. Analyzing the transient pore pressure response in the downstream side of shale sample allows calculating the transport coefficients of shale samples. Hydraulic properties of shales are obtained by matching the pore pressure history with a 1-D coupled fluid flow model. The experimental results indicate that sorptive properties can be inversely related to the hydraulic diffusivity of shale rocks. It is found that with an increase in the magnitude of sorption potential of shale, the hydraulic diffusivity decreases. This work is useful for shale characterization and provides a correlation, which can have various applications including, but not limited to, wellbore stability prediction during well planning. |Introduction |Prolonged exposure of shale formations with aqueous drilling fluids has shown to be problematic and leads to wellbore instability issues (Rahman et al., 2003; Nes et al., 2012). According to York et al., 2009, the wellbore instability problems in a deepwater offshore well could at least cost $2.5 million. Many efforts have been done to reduce shale instability by modifying the chemical composition of drilling fluid using different categories of fluid additives (Reid and Minton, 1992; Clark and Benaissa, 1993; van Oort et al., 1996; Patel, 2009). One of the important interaction processes between shale and drilling fluid is hydration of clay minerals. This phenomenon often leads to various operational problems such as shale swelling, bit balling, stuck pipe, high torque, and reduction of rate of penetration, which ultimately increase the non-productive time and hence the drilling cost (van Oort et al., 1996; Labenski and Reid, 2003). Basically, two kinds of clay swelling can be recognized, namely, the intercrystalline swelling due to the hydration of exchangeable cations and osmotic swelling, where the latter is due to a substantial difference between chemical potential of shale and drilling fluid (Cases et al., 1992; van Oort, 2003).|",,56

R., REPSOL CTR| Mello, U., IBM Research","|Abstract: |Reservoir Geomechanics is playing an increasingly important role in developing and producing hydrocarbon reserves. One of the main challenges in reservoir modeling is accurate and efficient simulation of arbitrary intersecting faults. In this paper, we propose a new formulation to model multiple intersecting cohesive discontinuities (faults) in reservoirs using the XFEM framework.This formulation involves construction of enrichment functions and computation of stiffness sub-matrices for bulk (rock mass), faults and their interaction DOFs. A sub-divisional scheme has been developed, to perform volume and surface integrations. The sub-divisional scheme can efficiently handle most possible configurations of multiple intersecting/nonintersecting faults in 3D finite elements. In order to be able to model cohesive behaviour of intersecting faults, we have performed additional surface integrations which, to the knowedge of the authors, are not reported in the literature. For example, if an element is intersected by two cohesive faults, we compute 16 volumes an d 8 surface in tegrations for stiffness matrices and 4 surface integrations for force vectors, to form elemental equations. The current distributed implementation using C++/MPI can simulate very large meshes. Three-dimensional benchmark cases are presented to validate the accuracy of the approach, and the potential benefits in applications. The present study shows that interaction DOFs and their associated surface stiffness matrices play a significant role in accurate modeling of cohesive faults via XFEM. |Introduction |Faults are geological entities with thickness several orders of magnitude smaller than the grid blocks typically used to discretize the domain. Due to frictional forces between the surfaces, the natural occurring faults in rock masses are cohesive. Cohesive faults may result in relative displacements in the plane of the fracture. Due to arbitrary and multiple occurrence of faults, many of them may intersect and result in complex 3D geometries. Intersecting faults affect the strength and deformability of rock mass and thus their accurate modelling is required to understand the geomechanical behaviour of reservoirs. Numerical modelling techniques can be classified on the basis of the procedure used to represent faults. Faults can be represented implicitly by using constitutive equation for the continuum and additional deformations due to opening/slip. The explicitly representation of faults may be done in various ways, the more classical one is via zero-thickness (or sometimes thin layer) elements inserted in-between element faces/edges while all nodal variables maintain the traditional meaning as regula displacements (Goodman et al., 1968; Gens et al., 1988). We do implicit representation of the faults using level set functions (Das et al., 2015). The discontinuity can cut the elements in arbitrary ways, which is captured using zero values of level set function. This approach can define the discontinuities with complex geometries. The jump in the displacement field near the fault plane is captured using appropriate enrichment function. For example, for rock faults modeling, ‘Heaviside function’ is used to enrich nodes (Wells and Sluys, 2001).|",,22

However, conventional techniques for refracturing are often challenged by the problem that the new fracture created by the refracturing treatment follows the same path of the original fracture. In this case, only the conductivity of previous fracture is recovered and the new fracture can not contact the undepleted reservoir areas. The application of cryogenic treatment during refracturing process may solve this problem. We conducted rock mechanical properties tests, submersion tests and stimulation tests under cryogenic condition. The test results showed that the shear strength, tensile strength and Mode-I fracture toughness significantly decreased after cryogenic treatment; the large thermal gradient caused by cryogenic treatment could create new microfractures and extend previous microfractures on initial fracture surface; a refracturing network appeared in the stimulation test with cryogenic treatment. The test results indicate that the refracture reorientation depends on the failure of the weakened zones induced by cryogenic treatment, apart from geo-stress field. |Introduction |Hydraulic fracturing is necessary for the economic development of tight oil reservoirs. However, there will be a distinct production decline after a well has been produced for a few years after the initial fracturing treatment. Refracturing is an imperative and high-efficiency method to control production decline by creating new fractures in different directions, and has been proved to be the most important means to enhance oil recovery in low permeability tight reservoirs. However, as the frequency of refracturing treatment increases, production gained from each subsequent refracturing treatment declines quickly. The most important reason for this phenomenon is that the fractures created by the conventional refracturing treatment either follow the same path of the original fractures or propagate away from the original fractures with a very small rotation degree, which is a problem that conventional techniques for refracturing are often faced with. In this case, only the conductivity of previous fractures is recovered and the new fractures can not contact with the undepleted reservoirs. Of course, plugging-off initial fractures can improve the effects of conventional refracturing treatment. However, creating a new fracture with large rotation degree still is very difficult through plugging-off initial fractures. In order to solve this problem and create a complex refracturing network, we have to know more about the weakness of conventional refracturing theory and change the conventional refracturing treatment.|",,23

The method is widely used in on-site tests because it is convenient and the requirement for the sample in PLS is not very strict. However, it's difficult to get an accurate relationship between UCS and PLS in laboratory due to strong heterogeneity of rocks. Discrete element method (DEM) has been proved to be a great tool to simulate and analyze the behavior of rock material. In DEM, the particle properties (such as particle contact modulus) can be set to ensure the rock materials to possess the same properties. So we can get the correct correspondence between PLS and UCS. In this paper 23 sets of data are simulated which from the laboratory test, and it is found that there are good correspondences. Through further analysis, the authors also discuss the influence of experimental conditions on the PLS by DEM, which includes indenter radius, aspect ratio and particle size. By the simulations, we reached three conclusions: 1) the simulated result is higher than that of laboratory test in PLS because of homogeneity; 2) the larger indenter radius, the higher PLS will be; 3) PLS is nearly a constant when the aspect ratio of samples is between 0.3 and1. Besides, if the aspect ratio is lower than 0.3, the PLS will increase rapidly. |Introduction |In rock mechanics, how to describe the mechanical properties of rock accurately has been one of the key issues. So far, some methods can be applied to measure the mechanics properties of rock, such as point loading test, uniaxial compression test, conventional tri-axial compression test, Brazilian disc test, and fracture toughness test. The detailed standard specifications for these experiments are all published (Franklin, 1985; Hatheway, 2009). As one of the main properties, uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) can be measured commonly through uniaxial compression test. |However, uniaxial compression test itself has some disadvantages. First of all, it is time-consuming and expensive to make a high precision sample. The flatness of specimen ends must be machined to 0.001 mm. The side must be smooth and straight and the smoothness of all side must reach 0.3 mm (Hatheway, 2009). And then, some of the rocks are difficult to be processed into standard specimens, such as coal, which is featured by cleats. On the other hand, point loading test is convenient and simple to measure the strength of rock, because it is not strict with the shape of the specimen, and we can get results with any size. Moreover, the point loading test instrument is easy to carry. Point loading test has been widely used in the field of engineering because of these advantages.|",,12

A., The University of Texas at Austin","|Abstract: |We use large-strain, drained poro-mechanical models to investigate the evolution of stress and porosity in fold-and-thrust belt systems. We impose horizontal displacement on an initially horizontal sediment layer to simulate the lateral tectonic loading. We find that the maximum principle stress gradually rotates from its initial vertical direction in the far field to sub-horizontal direction near the backstop. We show that sediments above the decollement compress significantly because of increase in both mean effective stress and relative shear stress ratio (q/<U+03C3>'m). We further show that the sediments within the accretionary wedge are close to or at the critical state (the sediments have reached the highest possible shear stress for the current mean effective stress). We divide the area above the decollement in thrust belts into 3 zones, based on their final relative shear stress ratio (q/<U+03C3>'m): critical state region, transition region, and geostatic compression region. We built these large strain models with Elfen; we model the sediments as poroelasto-plastic materials with a critical state soil model (SR3). Overall, we predict porosity, mean and deviatoric stresses in compressional regimes. Our geomechanical analysis of sedimentary wedges provide significant insights of stress and compression in fold-and-thrust belt systems. |Introduction |In fold-and-thrust belt systems, understanding stress state and compression strains is crucial to ensure a safe drilling environment and can greatly impact the economic risk assessment for exploration activities. Predrill predictions on field stress and pore pressure are routinely estimated using field porosity data acquired from either wells (Zhang, 2009) or remote sensing techniques (Sayers et al., 2002). Most conventional industry workflows assume that sediment porosity is a function of vertical effective stress. However, this assumption is based on uniaxial compression (compaction) conditions, which are not applicable to fold-and-thrust belt systems: in such systems, the lateral tectonic loading plays a critical role on the final stress state and sediment compression (Couzens-Schultz and Azbel, 2014). Using the assumption that porosity is a function of vertical effective stress in compressional regimes may lead to underestimation of pore pressure (Goulty, 2004). |There is an increasing awareness of the importance of relating sediment compression to the evolution of the three dimensional stress state. Hauser (2014) used Modified Cam Clay to describe the sediment compression in deepwater fold-and-thrust belts and demonstrated the importance of incorporating the deviatoric stress. Rowe and Screaton (2012) applied a critical sate soil material model to numerically study stress and pore pressure in the Nankai accretionary wedge. However, there are very few studies that systematically track the evolution of sediment porosity, as well as the overall stress history and failure of sediments in fold-and-thrust belt systems.|",,4

G., IMaGE| Zhang, F., IMaGE","|Abstract: |Conventional microseismic analysis is often inadequate to determine whether refracture treatments stimulate undepleted areas or simply re-stimulate already-depleted areas. The Eagle Ford refracture treatment case study in this paper demonstrates the application of microseismic geomechanics to assess the effectiveness of diversion and estimate the distribution of fluid between previously stimulated and unstimulated areas. |The case study shows that depletion-induced changes in stress can enhance diversion, and the distribution of fluid between fractures in depleted and undepleted areas evolves during the treatment. The geomechanical model is used to identify the characteristic pressure signature and microseismic patterns associated with different hydraulic fracture geometries. A practical diagnostic of diversion effectiveness based on microseismic moment is derived from advanced microseismic analysis of the geomechanical response, and some options for completion optimization are suggested. |Introduction |Due to the low permeability of shale reservoirs, it is generally assumed that production occurs only from those parts of the reservoir that are close to the hydraulic f racture or to natural fractures activated by the stimulation process. Many older horizontal wells were stimulated with 10 or fewer stages, with the stages separated by some distance, due to limitations of completion hardware technology. This resulted in sub-optimal stimulation and some areas of the laterals were not stimulated at all. Refracturing these older wells has been seen as an opportunity for oil and gas operators to increase production at a lower cost than drilling new wells. |In some cases, diverters are used to block access to open fractures and redirect the refracture treatment to stimulate new areas around the wellbore that were not accessed by the initial treatment. It is important to know whether the diversion is successful or if the initial fractures are being reopened. |Microseismic data is often used as a tool to visually assess the geometry of hydraulic fractures, and the related stimulation. This paper shows that this simplistic approach (assuming that microseismic activity is associated with fluid flow and stimulation) is inadequate for refracturing.

For this study, LIDAR data has been collected at the Kartchner Caverns site in Cochise County, Arizona. The discontinuity data collected at this site can be divided into two types. The first type is the overall trends of small to medium-sized discontinuities such as short joints and small fracture faces that appear consistently in the LIDAR point clouds. When added to the numerical model, these fractures can be applied throughout the entire model as joint sets. This is done by inputting statistical information representative of all of the discontinuities in the set such as the mean discontinuity plane orientation, a measure of orientation scatter such as the Fisher constant, and statistical information about joint spacing and joint roughness. The second type of discontinuity information is data collected on a single specific discontinuity such as a major fault or a persistent bedding plane. Because the interaction of these large scale features with one another and with the overall geometry of the cave openings may be relevant to the overall stability of the system, it may be advantageous to model these discontinuities individually, and input them into the numerical model in their actual location. |Introduction |Discontinuities commonly occur in rock masses. In order to ensure proper rock mass classification, safety, and long-term stability in many modern geomechanics projects, the acquisition of geotechnical information about the discontinuities is required. Geometric information about rock mass discontinuities such as dip, dip direction, location, and information related to the persistence or extent size of the discontinuities are important indices to evaluate. Finding a comprehensive, rapid and accurate method for accessing the geometrical and location information is a foundation of rock mass stability assessment. This information can be and has been traditionally measured using a manual compass and a tape measure. However, the rock masses of interest are often located in difficult to access places, and due to poor geological conditions, surveying and mapping may be difficult and dangerous. The traditional methods for engineering geological surveying and mapping work are a time-consuming, labor-intensive, costly, and highly difficult problem. To solve these problems, engineers both in the US and abroad have utilized new technologies, such as 2D digital photo interpretation, 3D digital photogrammetry, and terrestrial laser scanning (TLS). The use of 3D laser scanning technologies provides an effective, practical and advanced technical means, to solve the problems mentioned above.|",,25

J., Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources| Song, I., Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources| Kwon, Y. K., Kongju National University","|Abstract: |We are conducting a small-scale CO2 injection demonstration project in offshore Pohang Basin, SE Korea to test various techniques related to CO2 sequestration, which include reservoir characterization and modelling, drilling and completion, and monitoring systems. The target brine aquifer for CO2 storage is 60 m thick sandstone/conglomerate formations at a depth range between 770 and 830 mbsf (meter below seafloor), which were verified by a seismic survey and a cored borehole (980 m deep). A number of steeply dipping and NE-striking faults cross the target aquifer. To analyze potential risk of shear activation along the faults, we characterize in situ stress state at the site. Borehole image logs showed borehole breakouts along the whole logged section to ~700 mbsf, which consistently indicate an average maximum horizontal principal stress (SHmax) direction of NW-SE. A leak-off test conducted at the bottom of a casing shoe (700 mbsf) yielded the magnitude of the minimum horizontal principal stress (Shmin) lower than the vertical stress (Sv). For the given Shmin and Sv conditions, we used the logged breakout widths and laboratory determined rock compressive strength to constrain possible SHmax magnitudes that could create the observed breakouts. We utilized our estimated stress conditions to analyze slip tendency of the faults. Additional information obtained from LOT is cap rock permeability, which suggests the formation above the storage reservoir is suitable for a leakage barrier. All regional scale faults turn out to have relatively low slip tendency under the given stress condition, suggesting a relatively low risk of triggering shear activation of faults during CO2 injection. |Introduction |The geological storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) has been proposed as a potential method of reducing greenhouse gas emissions (Bachu et al, 2007; Bachu, 2008). In many carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects, when captured CO2 is injected into deep saline aquifer, we need to consider the potential risks of geomechanical problems induced by an increase in formation pore pressure, such as slip reactivation along pre-existing faults, triggered earthquakes, and possibility of cap-rock hydraulic fracturing (Streit and Hillis, 2004; Vidal-Gilbert et al., 2010; Vilarrasa et al., 2011; Zoback and Gorelick, 2012). Because such risk factors can be latent leakage path of injected CO2, it is important to characterize geomechanical aspects of the integral part of the reservoir including cap-rock integrity, potential aquifer capacity and existing fault stability (Hawkes et al., 2005; Streit and Siggins, 2005; Orlic, 2009). |The offshore basin in Pohang, SE Korea, has been accepted as a potential storage site of CO2 by Korean government and many researchers (Han and Keehm, 2013; Kim et al., 2014; Lee and Kwon 2014; Choi et al., 2015; Park et al., 2015; Song et al., 2015). Followed by the acceptance, a small-scale CO2 injection demonstration project is underway in this basin. As a preliminary study, we conducted geomechanical characterization for the potential reservoir system, which includes in situ stress estimation and in situ permeability estimation using an offshore borehole, as well as fault characterization, in order to assess fault stability issues. Our study demonstrates that the offshore reservoir is suitable for CO2 storage.|",,28

The fracture propagation process and the associated BHP history was modeled for both vertical and horizontal wells. For the configurations presented here, the models show that fracture propagation is initially almost uniform from all perforation tunnels. Fractures then propagate preferentially from some perforations to gradually coalesce and form the hydraulic fracture while fractures from the remaining perforations stop propagating. |The near-wellbore fracture system can result in a large pressure drop and may also prevent proppant from entering the main body of the fracture. |The results demonstrate the capability of modeling complex fractures with this lattice based method. The model is also capable of modeling the true 3D hydraulic fracture propagation and interaction with natural fractures. |Introduction |Hydraulic fracture initiation and near wellbore tortuosity i s of great importance to the interpretation of bottom hole pressure (BHP) during hydraulic fracturing treatments. It is generally believed that near-wellbore tortuosity greatly contributes to the abnormal BHP often seen in the field, which can be one order of magnitude higher than theoretical predictions based on classic hydraulic fracture models. However, the stress concentration and complex fracture geometry near the wellbore can be very challenging to model. |In this paper, we used a newly developed 3D lattice based method [1] to model fracture initiation from perforation tunnels. The model is fully coupled hydro-mechanically, and can represent detailed geometries at a wide range of scales, ranging from small laboratory samples (e.g. [2]), to multi-well field-scale models. In the work presented here, the geometry of perforation tunnels and the wellbore are captured in details for two cases, namely a vertical well and a horizontal well. |Modeling Method |The lattice method used in this paper is a simplified form of the particle based bonded-particle method (BPM) [3] with the discrete element method (DEM) [4]. The lattice is a quasi-random 3D array of nodes with masses connected by springs, as shown in Figure 1. It is analogous to the configuration of particles connected by contacts in BPM but with significantly improved computational efficiency.|",,51
691,692,2016-535,Completion Optimization Using a Microseismically Calibrated Geomechanical Hydraulic Fracturing Simulation in a Naturally Fractured Formation,"Lee, B., IMaGE| Mack, M., IMaGE| Maxwell, S., IMaGE","|Abstract: |A 3D geomechanical model of a hydraulic fracture treatment in the Horn River Basin was calibrated by comparing synthetic microseismic events to field data. Using this calibrated model, sensitivity studies were performed to determine the effect of geological parameters and operational variables on the resulting fracture geometry and microseismic response. Microseismic geomechanics was shown to be a reliable calibration methodology for this model because changes in hydraulic fracture geometry were reflected by changes in the microseismic calibration. The results show that the orientation of the DFN is a key parameter driving the microseismic response. When hydraulic fractures intersect natural fractures at high angles, the pre-existing fractures are stimulated more and exhibit a greater microseismic response. Application of the calibrated model to optimize completion changes is demonstrated by investigating the effect of several potential changes on fracture geometry. |Introduction |Hydraulic fracturing of horizontal wells has been an important factor in the development of low permeability formations such as shales (Gale et al., 2007). The high-pressure injection of hydraulic fracturing fluid creates tensile fractures which may connect with and activate natural fractures. Hydraulic fracture modeling requires close coupling between the hydraulic (fluid flow) and mechanical models. For tight formations, the geomechanical aspect of the model is even more important than in conventional reservoirs, because natural fractures can play an important role in production. |Hydraulic fracturing typically causes microseismicity, usually through shear deformation (slip) on natural fractures and bedding planes. This microseismicity is the only far-field measurement of fracture geometry, and can be used to calibrate geomechanical models of fracture geometry and proppant distribution. |This paper presents a case study in which a coupled hydraulic-geomechanical simulator (3DEC, Damjanac and Cundall, 2016) is used to simulate hydraulic fracture growth in a naturally fractured formation and predict the corresponding microseismicity. The mechanical model is constructed with principal stresses, pore pressure and mechanical properties obtained from well logs, and a Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) is embedded in the stimulated area. The evolution of the mechanical deformation during the hydraulic fracturing process is simulated, including both the creation of new (hydraulic) fractures and the activation of pre-existing natural fractures. The model is calibrated by comparing the synthetic microseismic (MS) events with the field data.|",,50
692,693,2016-538,Feasibility Study of Heat Extraction from a Closed-Loop Fractured Geothermal Reservoir; A Multiphysics Problem,"Ahmadi, M., Louisiana State University| Dahi Taleghani, A., Louisiana State University","|Abstract: |Geothermal energy is considered as an attractive alternative source of energy in some parts of the world. In general, geothermal systems can be identified as either open- or closed-loop. In an open-loop system, fluid is produced from the subsurface, while there might be some concurrent fluid injection into the reservoir. The loss of working fluid, surface subsidence, formation compaction, and induced seismicity are major shortfalls of the open-loop systems. To address the indicated challenges, closed-loop geothermal systems can be considered as an alternative option. In this method, a working fluid with low boiling point is circulated through the coaxial sealed pipes to extract the stored heat from the formation rock and fluid. To improve the heat extraction from closed-loop wells, we introduce a highly conductive hydraulic fracture to the system to improve the rate of the heat extraction from the surrounding rocks. Considering the multiphysics nature of the heat extraction from such systems, a comprehensive analysis of this problem requires simultaneous modeling of the interactions between fluid flow, heat transfer and rock deformation. A numerical thermo-poroelastic model is developed using the finite element methods to simulate this problem. The numerical results suggest that fractured wellbore has significantly larger thermal power and cumulative extracted heat than the unfractured wellbore in the proposed closed-loop configuration. |Introduction |Geothermal energy is referred to as an attractive energy resource to address the increasing electricity demand in various parts of the world. This energy resource is derived from the decay of the radioactive materials, such as uranium, thorium, and potassium, or the stored heat in the earth core during the formation of planet Earth. Armstead (1983) showed that the total heat content of the earth is in the order of 12.6 <U+00D7> 1024 MJ from which we only harvest a small portion. Geothermal energy is weather-independent compared to wind or solar energy and is environmentally friendly in comparison to the fossil fuels. Production of electricity from geothermal resources places it third among other renewable resources. Cumulative electricity production from the geothermal reservoirs is higher than the solar and wind resources, however less than the hydroelectricity and biomass. Geothermal resources in the US have the capacity to supply 10 percent of current national electricity consumption by 2050 (Giardini, 2009). Williams et.al (2008) showed that US can economically produce 100 GWe from the enhanced geothermal systems by 2050.|",,50
693,694,2016-382,Numerical Modeling of Land Subsidence Resulting from Oil Production,"Zhang, S., The University of Tulsa| Zhong, R., The University of Tulsa| Liu, Y., The University of Tulsa","|Abstract: |The oil production can cause land subsidence when large amounts of underground fluid have been withdrawn from geo-pressured reservoirs. In this paper, a fast-running numerical model coupled with production history is developed to calculate the land subsidence for arbitrary shape reservoirs. The model is based on Geertsma's poroelastic solution with nucleus of strain theory. The pressure profile is obtained by considering the critical transition time for transient and pseudo steady state flow. Then, the superposition principle is applied to calculate subsidence for the whole discretized model. The numerical model is first compared with Geertsma's analytical solution, which shows an excellent match. A comprehensive parametric study is performed to characterize the influence of different parameters. To show the applicability of the model for arbitrary shape reservoirs, a horizontal well with elliptical pressure depletion profile is created and the corresponding 3D land subsidence profile is obtained. |Introduction |The reservoir compacts due to fluid withdrawal by oil production. This process will finally lead to land subsidence in the surface if no proper water injection treatment is done. States like California, Texas, and Louisiana have suffered the damage for a long time (Pratt and Johnson 1926, Sinder 1927, Gilluly and Grant 1949, Chang et al. 2014). The first mathematical model for land subsidence was attempted by MacCann and Wilts to computing subsidence due to underground oil production (MacCann and Wilts 1951). They investigated two different models, which are “tension center” and “vertical pincer” model for the subsidence behavior above the Wilmington field. Based on their work, Geertsma improved the analogy between the physical parameters of the ground and those in the model using the nucleus-of-strain concept (Mindlin and Cheng 1950, Sen 1950, Geertsma 1973). Segall investigated the subsidence from the theoretical analysis, laboratory experimentation, and direct observation in the field (Segall 1992). The approach used by Segall was similar to Geertsma's approach, which derived the stress field and the surface subsidence resulting from the extraction of fluid or gas from the reservoir. Both of them considered the case of a uniform pressure depletion in a horizontal tabular reservoir and obtained identical solutions as well. Since then, most subsidence studies were based on Segall and Geertsma's work (Fokker and Orlic 2006, Tempone et al. 2010, Chen 2011). On the other hand, the inversion technique which employs surface subsidence observations (GPS, radar, tiltmeter monitoring) can calculate reservoir behavior from subsidence behavior (Fokker 2002, Kroon et al. 2009, Fokker et al. 2012).|",,48
694,695,2016-384,Empirical Slope Design for Hard and Soft Rocks Using Q-slope,"Bar, N., Gecko Geotechnics| Barton, N. R., Nick Barton & Associates","|Abstract: |The Q-slope method provides a simple yet effective empirical means of assessing the stability of excavated rock slopes in the field. Intended for use in reinforcement-free road or rail cuttings or individual benches in open cast mines, Q-slope allows geotechnical engineers to make potential adjustments to slope angles as rock mass conditions become apparent during construction. Through case studies in South-East Asia, Australia, Central America and Europe, a simple correlation between Q-slope and long-term stable slopes was established. Q-slope is designed such that it suggests stable, maintenance-free bench-face slope angles of for instance 40-45°, 60-65° and 80-85° with respective Q-slope values of approximately 0.1, 1.0 and 10. Q-slope was developed by supplementing the Q-system which has been extensively used for characterizing rock exposures, drill-core, and tunnels under construction for the last 40 years. The Q' parameters (RQD, Jn, Ja & Jr) remain unchanged in Q-slope. A new method of Jr/Ja ratios for both sides of potential wedges, using relative orientation weightings is presented. The term Jw, which is now termed Jwice, takes into account long-term exposure to various climatic and environmental conditions (e.g. intense erosive rainfall, ice-wedging effects). Slope relevant SRF categories for slope surface conditions, stress-strength ratios and major discontinuities such as faults, weakness zones or joint swarms have also been incorporated. |Introduction |The Q-system for characterizing rock exposures, drill core and tunnels under construction was developed from rock tunneling and rock cavern related records and has been used by engineers across the world for over 40 years (Barton et al. 1974 and Barton & Grimstad, 2014). |Single-shell B+S(fr) tunnel support and reinforcement design assistance, and open stope design, utilizing Q' (the first four parameters – RQD, Jn, Jr and Ja) have been the principal focus of applications in civil and mining engineering. Correlations of Qc (Q normalized with UCS/100) with stress-dependent P-wave velocities and depth-dependent deformation moduli have also proved useful in site characterization and as input to numerical modelling. These approximate correlations remain with the Q-slope value, which may also vary over six orders of magnitude, from approx. 0.001 to 1000. This large numerical range is an important reflection of the large variation of parameters such as deformation moduli and shear strength. |The Q-slope method (Barton & Bar, 2015) is intended for use in reinforcement-free site access road cuts, road or rail cuttings or individual benches in open cast mines. It is not intended for assessing the stability of large slopes developed by several excavation stages over significant periods of time, such as inter-ramp or overall slopes in open cast mines. |Shear strength input is similar to the Q-system, but more critical, since wedges are unconfined, and dilation is less important than around tunnels as there is usually no increase in normal stress or stiffness when shearing initiates. Filled discontinuities follow the same ‘contact’ scheme as before: a) rock-to-rock contact, b) rock-to-rock contact after shear displacement, c) no rock-to-rock contact due to thick clay fillings. Q-slope utilizes the same six parameters RQD, Jn, Jr, Ja, Jw and SRF. However, the frictional resistance pair Jr and Ja can apply, when needed, to the individual sides of potentially unstable wedges using simple orientation factors.|",,50

E., Petro-Geotech Inc.","|Abstract: |Stresses induced near a hydraulic fracture are calculated in an elastoplastic Mohr-Coulomb type formation. While an effective compressive stress increase may reduce the permeability in the formation, the induced shear stresses and dilatant zone developed can increase the stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) and the size of an enhanced permeability zone. Therefore, the induced shear stresses and dilatant zone are used in this article in order to quantify the SRV. It is emphasized that when the SRV is characterized by elastic strains then it may not be always maintained, whereas those irreversible or dilatant volumetric strains can be the key for producing economically in a low-permeability reservoir. It is suggested therefore, that a production enhancement is dominated by the cohesion and orientation of the natural fracture network and in-situ stress ratios. |Intorduction |Hydraulic fracturing technology has been applied widely as the only effective approach for production enhancement in low-permeability formations such as shale, coalbed and tight reservoirs. Although only 20% of the applied fields demonstrate positive results among shale oil and gas producers, a 30% production increase has been reported after an optimized fracturing strategy utilized by considering pre-stressing conditions (Henning 2013). This indicates that a hydraulic fracture process may not necessarily stimulate a formation for production enhancement, unless certain favorable stressing conditions exist, which can be closely linked to geomechanics-related factors such as natural fracture properties, in-situ stress ratios and more importantly the induced stresses near the fracture and their effect on flow conditions. Discussions and considerations on the induced stresses for stimulating production are not new. Production in stress-sensitive formations has been studied extensively in the past for reservoir simulations and well-testing purpose (Variogs and Rhodes, 1973, Witherspoon, 1980, Zoback and Byerlee, 1975, Klani and 1991, Chen and Teufel, 1993, Chin, 1998, Bai et al., 1994, 1997). Although production increase is normally obtained by increasing drawdown in the field, the permeability in the induced stress areas may be reduced and subsequently production decline can be expected. In order to produce crude or gas economically on these formations, a hydraulic fracture technology has been introduced as a process for production enhancement, i.e. an effective conduit is generated in these low-permeability formations by force fracturing fluid into the formations. One of the major issues is that stress concentration can act as a barrier or skin to compromise this technology when permeabilities in the vicinity of the hydraulic fracture region are reduced. Although stress-sensitivity is identified as an important issue in tight formations, not many data is available to link the production decline to the stress-sensitive effect near a fracture. In addition, shear stresses may also be induced near the fracture and consequently generate a plastic or dilatant zone once these stresses overcome the corresponding strength (Wang et al., 1994, Dusseault, 2012). This plastic or dilatants zone may be enlarged and propagate with the moving fracture. It is the objective of this paper to calculate the induced shear stresses and the range of the dilatants zone, which may increase both the permeability in the formation and stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) at the same time. The existence of orientation-dependent natural fracture and strength-weakening cohesion may further enhance this effect. Thus, combining the in-situ stress ratio, oriented strength, post-yielding strength, induced irreversible deformation and its range, and stresses near the fracture will be the key to evaluate if a tight formation will be produced economically by the hydraulic fracturing technology.|",,52

C., M&K Consulting","|Abstract: |As part of an ongoing research effort to improve ground control safety in deep vein mines, researchers at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Spokane Mining Research Division (SMRD) have developed a simplistic approach to modeling dynamic behavior of rock using commercially available software. This methodology will be applied to study the behavior of underground excavations subjected to dynamic loading from remote seismic sources in order to better understand the relationship between seismic wave-parameters, rock mass damage, excavation stability, and ground-support demands. The potential exists to improve safety in burst prone ground through better understanding of the effects of seismic loads on excavations. This paper describes a preliminary one-dimensional investigation of the model that validates its performance and provides insight into the dynamic failure of rock. The main observation is that the dynamic stresses that develop in the rock near a free surface are different than those that occur within a constrained solid. In a constrained solid, the dynamic stresses are directly proportional to the velocity amplitude of the propagating wave. This study shows that in the vicinity of an unconstrained surface, the accelerations associated with a seismic wave are also important to understanding dynamic stress and rock ejection. As the wave passes, forces develop that are equal to the product of the mass and acceleration of the rock block attempting to eject. For a seismic wave of given peak particle velocity, higher frequencies will be associated with higher accelerations and have the potential to be more damaging to a rock surface. Increased use of dynamic modeling will develop knowledge of the effects of seismic loading on excavations and ground support and may lead to designs that better protect miners. |Introduction |In the last few decades there has been significant advancement in computing power and the capabilities of numerical modeling software for use in geomechanical problem solving. The ability to perform fully-dynamic simulations in geomechanics has never been more accessible or user friendly than it is today. However, practical application of this technology in rock engineering projects is not common place as of yet (compared with static modeling). Further development and increased use of this technology may provide significant insights into problems associated with mining induced seismicity and thereby help protect miners from the hazards associated with rockbursts. |Dynamic problems are particularly challenging because a full characterization of the initial static state can never be completely realized in geotechnical engineering, hindering the analysis from the start. Additionally, the strength and mechanical behavior of intact rock (Christensen et al., 1972; Qian et al., 2009; Johnson 2010), rock joints (Bakhtar and Barton, 1984; Barbero et al., 1996; Mohammed et al., 2006), and many ground support materials (Ansell, 2005, 2006; Player et al., 2008) are dependent on loading rate. Moreover, their dynamic behavior is not well characterized. Lastly, the appropriate dynamic loading must be applied and adequate characterization of seismic loads is challenging.|",,56

However, the way in which the size, location, and source mechanisms of these events relate to the stimulation process is poorly understood. Using the massively parallel multiphysics code GEOS developed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, we model large-scale mechanical deformation, fluid and heat flow, and fracturing processes using a fully coupled 3D Finite Element model and model the corresponding small-scale microseismicity using a point approximation for a population of pre-existing discontinuities distributed throughout the model domain. In our analysis, we explore the generation of microseismic events at the EGS Demonstration Project site at the Newberry Volcano in Oregon. Because the rock mass at the Newberry EGS is naturally very impermeable, the project operators are borrowing hydraulic fracturing techniques from the oil and gas industry to stimulate the reservoir and maximize energy production. Using the GEOS microseismic model we investigate the competing influences of tectonic stress change and matrix fluid flow, anisotropy and heterogeneity in the surrounding rock mass, the population of pre-existing fractures, and the hydraulic stimulation treatment design. |Introduction |Developing a numerical model of induced microseismicity is technically challenging because of the number of potential processes (mechanics, fluid flow, heat flow, etc.) and the wide range of scales (from the size of the reservoir, down to individual asperities on a slip patch) involved in its development. In this paper, we present an approach we are developing to solve this problem using the massively-parallel multiphysics framework GEOS. We use a fully coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) model to solve the problem of fluid and heat flow, mechanics, and fracture growth on the largest scales, a model to evaluate microseismicity on a discrete fracture network (DFN), and a model to evaluate point microseismicity on the smallest scales. |To test effectiveness of this model, we consider a case study from the enhanced geothermal system (EGS) demonstration project at the Newberry Volcano in central Oregon, which is operated by AltaRock Energy, Inc. under a Department of Energy grant (Cladouhos et al., 2009).

698,699,2016-397,Evolution of Relay Zones in Normal Faulted Terranes: Integrating Field Geological Studies with Forward Geomechanical Models,"Goteti, R., Aramco Research Center – Houston| Mitra, G., University of Rochester","|Abstract: |Echelon arrangement of normal faults is a ubiquitous feature observed at multiple scales (mm – km) in many extensional tectonic settings. The deformation in the intervening rock volume between adjacent fault segments, termed the relay zone, occurs under a combination of rotational and distortional strains that are often distinct from the regional strain on the primary faults. As a result, relay zone structures cannot be reconciled with the far-field strain/stress field. We present an integrated analysis in which traditional outcrop-based geological analysis of the Hernandez Relay Zone (HRZ) in the Rio Grande Rift of New Mexico is compared and contrasted with quantitative 3D geomechanical forward modeling to provide a mechanical rationale for the observed structures in the HRZ. The model results suggest that the observed spatial variations in finite strain and the incremental changes in extension direction in the HRZ can be attributed to the interaction between the primary faults. Sensitivity analyses of the models suggests that obliquity of the structures in the relay zone increases with increasing fault overlap (for a given spacing), and decreases with yield strength of the intact rocks and coefficient of friction on the bounding faults. Sensitivity analysis of forward geomechanical models, when calibrated to field observations can be a powerful physics-based technique for predicting the potential orientations of secondary faults that can act as baffles or conduits for fluid flow in the subsurface. |Introduction |Over the past 5 decades, structural geologists relied on geometrical and kinematic techniques (e.g., Dahlstrom, 1969; Suppe, 1983; Suppe and Medwedeff, 1990; Malz et al., 2015; Vidal-Royo et al., 2015) for interpretations and analyses of rock deformation. Using empirical and geometric constraints, such techniques provided rapid insights into structural geologic history in different tectonic settings. However the mechanical behavior of rock masses is generally not considered in such techniques. The factors controlling geological deformation include tectonic loading (imposed far-field stresses or strains), rock mechanical properties, strain rate, ambient temperatures and pore-fluid pressures. A comprehensive analysis of geological structures should ideally consider the interaction among these controlling factors across multiple spatio-temporal scales. While modeling the interactions between all the physical processes is still a challenge, idealized geomechanical forward models can provide some useful insights into mechanical controls on geological deformation. |Over the past 2 decades, increasing integration of traditional structural geology and geomechanical analyses has provided insights into the mechanical evolution of geological structures (e.g., Willemse 1997; Kattenhorn and Pollard, 1999; Crook et al., 2006; Busetti et al., 2012; Goteti et al., 2013; Roberts et al., 2015) and in some cases also been used as a quality check for kinematic models (e.g., Smart et al., 2004; Moretti et al., 2006). Advances in computational power and numerical formulations currently support analyzing elastic modeling of complexly faulted or fractured geological media (Maerten and Maerten, 2006) as well as forward modeling of high strain tectonics (e.g., Beaumont et al., 2001; Goteti et al., 2013; Allen and Beaumont, 2015; Nikolinakou et al., 2014).

The modeling framework presented here establishes the conceptual foundation and demonstrates the required capabilities for a model of a simple two-dimensional cross-section of a deep mine drift. The model has been used to investigate the effects of various wave parameters on the stability of underground excavations, both with and without ground support. Additionally, kinetic energy of ejected rock and energy dissipated by the ground support system are calculated and compared. Finally, the effectiveness of ground support, with and without containment, has been investigated. The main conclusion is that simplified empirical rockburst damage analyses based solely on volume of ejected rock are inadequate. The damage potential of a seismic event should be measured in terms of dynamic energy demand on the ground support. Further, peak specific power may be a better wave parameter to correlate with this demand. This research aids in the understanding of the effects of mining induced seismic loading on underground excavations and support systems, and may lead to improvements in miner safety. |Introduction |Continued advancement of computing technology and capabilities of commercially available numerical modeling software has made fully-dynamic numerical simulation of problems in geomechanics more practical than ever before. However, application of this technology is still not common place (as compared with static numerical modeling). |Numerical modeling in geomechanics is associated with unique and significant challenges because of the uncertainty involved with engineering of natural systems. In rock mechanics, this uncertainty stems primarily from inherent complexities associated with geologic materials. Often times, even for static or quasistatic problems, it is not feasible to incorporate these complexities into a model, resulting in solutions that have high margins of error; the problem is data-limited. |Solutions to dynamic problems in geomechanics are therefore hampered from the outset, because the dynamic solution is dependent upon the initial conditions, which are generally the static equilibrium state of the excavation, which is itself a data-limited problem. Additionally, there is uncertainty surrounding nearly every aspect of the dynamic solution. For a mining rockburst this includes dynamic behavior of intact rock, discontinuities, and ground support; source mechanism; the characteristics of the ground motion and the changes that occur as the wave propagates through the rock mass (path effects); and interactions between the seismic waves, excavation, and ground support.|",,23

To understand the simple physics behind induced seismicity, we analyzed the stress state of a fault plane where large seismicity was induced during hydraulic stimulation in the Cooper Basin, Australia and Basel, Switzerland. Using information regarding the stress magnitude and orientation, and the geometry of the fault plane where large events occurred, the stress state of these events was evaluated and the pore pressure necessary to cause shear slip was estimated. The fault plane of the large event in the Cooper Basin was close to being well oriented and only needed small increase in pore pressure (~10MPa) to induce shear slip. It was also discovered that the fault plane of the largest event at Basel required a moderate increase in pore pressure of around 20 MPa to induce a seismic event. Other large events occurring at different depths needed much lower pore pressures to induce shear slip. On the fault planes at Basel where these large events occurred, large shear stress was present, suggesting causality between shear stress and event magnitude. |Introduction |Hydraulic stimulation is a necessary technology for the enhancement of formation permeability or improvement in system productivity in Enhanced/Engineered Geothermal System (EGS) projects. With the increasing demand for renewable energy, this technology has been used in many EGS projects to create economically feasible geothermal reservoirs. This method, also known as “fracking”, is used in the extraction of unconventional resources such as shale gas/oil. Fluid injection can induce shear slip on existing fractures or can initiate fractures leading to increased permeability. Acoustic energy released simultaneously with rock failure is often observed as induced seismicity, which is considered as the evidence relating these phenomena. |The growing number of large-magnitude, induced seismic events has recently been recognized as a serious problem associated with hydraulic stimulation in geothermal development (Majer et al., 2007). Although the magnitude of induced seismicity is typically less than 1.0, these large magnitude events have had moderate magnitudes (Mw 2~) and it is possible for them to be felt by local residents and also cause seismic hazards. Therefore, a quick development of methods to control seismic activity is necessary, and regulations or protocols based on scientific knowledge for sustainable and reliable geothermal development are required. However, many aspects of the physical mechanism related to large events remain unknown. |In modeling the propagation of injected fluid, as fluid flows through the flow paths in an existing fracture, pore pressure in the reservoir increases with pumping pressure. In an arbitrary existing fracture under tri-axial stress, this increase in pore pressure weakens the effective normal stress. When the shear stress working on a given fracture overcomes shear friction, the result is shear slip. This is known as the Coulomb failure criterion and is the principal behind induced seismicity. It can be described mathematically using equation (1),.|",,45
701,702,2016-362,Hydraulic Fracturing in CO2 Geological Storage,"Papanastasiou, P., University of Cyprus| Papamichos, E., Aristotle University of Thessaloniki| Atkinson, C., Imperial College London","|Abstract: |Among the outstanding technical issues in CO2 geological storage are the risks of hydraulic fracturing and migration of CO2 in upper formations and to the atmosphere, the wellbore CO2 injectivity and the storage capacity of the formation. We present a contribution on these issues based on conclusions of the modelling work of hydraulic fracturing in weak formations. The work was initially carried out with finite element analysis of a fully coupled elastoplastic hydraulic fracturing model and later was extended to analytical work based on a Mohr-Coulomb dislocation model where the complete slip process that is distributed around the crack tip was replaced by superdislocations that are placed in the effective centers of plastic deformation. Scaling of the FEM and analytical results enables the identification of a dominant parameter, which defines the regimes of brittle to ductile propagation and the limit at which a mode-1 fracture cannot advance. We found that a hydraulically induced vertical fracture from CO2 injection is more likely to propagate horizontally than vertically, remaining contained in the storage zone. The horizontal fracture propagation will have a positive effect on the injectivity and storage capacity of the formation. |Introduction |According to the International Energy Association reports the CO2 capture and storage (CCS) must be part of the strategy for mitigating climate changes and keep the increase in the global temperature below the 2°C threshold (IEA, 2015). Though related technologies for CCS projects have been extensively developed in the Oil and Gas industry it still remains expensive to be materialized mainly due to the cost of capture and transportation. For the time being CCS projects are economically viable when they are combined with other benefits such as enhanced oil recovery. Deployment of CCS project at large scales in the near future is primarily a matter of policy decision of the international community on the climate change issue (European Commission 2009, Metz et al. 2005). The risk of CO2 leakage from geological formations with potential contamination of shallow water and soil resources or escape back to the atmosphere is still an outstanding issue highly debatable which, must be addressed by the research community.|",,52
702,703,2016-364,Fully Coupled Geomechanics and Reservoir Simulation for Naturally and Hydraulically Fractured Reservoirs,"Ren, G., The University of Tulsa| Jiang, J., The University of Tulsa| Younis, R. M., The University of Tulsa","|Abstract: |Unconventional reservoirs are often characterized by a multicontinuum stimulated formation with complex propped and unpropped fracture networks that occur over a wide range of length-scales and geometries. Coupled numerical simulation of geomechanics and flow and transport in such formations can lead to an improved understanding of production from these systems. Computational efficiency and accuracy are both critical for modern simulation workflows for engineering design. A mixed continuous-discrete fracture discretization approach is proposed whereby a single Cartesian mesh is applied, and discrete representations are embedded to capture primary fractures, whereas continuous representations may be used for well-connected natural fractures. The geomechanics is approximated using a hybrid extended finite element method (XFEM) for discrete fractures and a dual porosity-poroelasticity treatment for the continuous representations. The flow and transport in discrete fractures are approximated using an embedded-discrete-fracture model (EDFM), whereas the continuous representation is through a dual porosity treatment. In addition to validation and mesh refinement results, a number of computational examples are presented illustrating the first-order effects of the coupled physics in realistic models. |Introduction |Production from unconventional resources such as tight and shale-gas reservoirs involves the coupling of a number of complex multiphase flow and geomechanical phenomena. Unconventional reservoirs are comprised of an ultra-low permeability fractured matrix that may consist of multiple continua. Natural fractures form highly connected networks with a wide range of length scales. The fractures are primarily supported by pore pressure. Horizontal wells stimulated by hydraulic fractures that emanate from the wellbore along clusters within multiple stages. The fractures are supported by pore pressure as well as proppants that are delivered during the completions process. The proppant concentration may vary along fractures. |Empirical observations from field practice suggest that geomechanical effects may play a first-order role in production from unconventional reservoirs. It is frequently observed that the production rate in tight gas reservoirs declines rapidly in a manner that is believed to be closely related to the evolution of fracture aperture and permeability with time (Huang and Ghassemi 2012). Proppant embedment and pore pressure-structure interactions can have a significant impact particularly within the interplay between offset wells. Numerical simulation of the coupled process in such formations can lead to an improved understanding of this interplay. |Numerous models have been proposed to capture the effects of a range of complex constitutive relations for flow and transport including confinement and non-Darcy effects (Jiang and Younis, 2015; Wu et al., 2013). Models for that resolve the geomechanics in gas production systems are scarce due to the complexity of treatment for the coupling to flow and due to the presence of discontinuities in the form of discrete fractures. The influence of conductivity loss associated with discrete hydraulic fractures has also not been well studied. Therefore, coupled processes between matrix deformation and fluid flow are important to predict fracture permeability change and reservoir production behavior (Huang and Ghassemi 2012).|",,12

H., TNO Petroleum Geosciences","|Abstract: |The spatial distribution of reactivated fractures and fracture permeability after stimulation are key controlling factors that determine typical drainage areas, shale to well connectivity, and hydrocarbon flow rates in fractured shales. In this paper, the influence of fault and fracture populations on the permeability of fractured shales is studied using an analytical model and field data of fault and fracture populations derived from a 3D seismic survey covering the Posidonia Shale Formation in the West Netherlands Basin. The analytical model incorporates fault and fracture populations and describes the permeability of fractured shales using 3D permeability tensors for layered shale matrix, damage zone and fault core of fault zones. A model sensitivity analysis shows that bulk permeability can vary considerably, depending on permeability anisotropy in the matrix, damage zone and fault core, the orientation of matrix layers and damage zone fractures, and the location relative to the fault core. The field data shows the distribution of fault sizes and displacements and associated model input parameters in comparison to typical fault scaling relations from literature. Implications of the analysis for optimum well planning and flow stimulation using hydraulic fracturing in naturally fractured shales are given. |Introduction |In many prospective shales, hydrocarbon production is determined by the distribution and properties of natural faults and fractures (Gale and Holder, 2010; King, 2010). The spatial distribution of reactivated fractures and fracture permeability after stimulation are key controlling factors that determine typical drainage areas, shale to well connectivity, and hydrocarbon flow rates. Fault and fracture populations, orientations, and permeability have been analysed in studies of seismic surveys, outcrop analogues, core material, and laboratory experiments (Odling et al., 1999; Bonnet et al., 2001; Torabi and Berg, 2011). Data from these studies can be used to characterize fault and fracture populations, and describe permeability of fractured shales for areas with limited available data (TerHeege and DeBruin, 2015a). Also, natural faults and fractures are not generally incorporated in conventional hydraulic fracturing simulators that are based on tensile opening of induced fractures (e.g., Meyer and Bazan, 2011). Knowledge on typical distribution and properties of natural faults and fractures can therefore help optimizing flow stimulation by hydraulic fracturing. |Reservoir-scale fault zones generally exhibit a specific architecture with a fault core and damage zone, surrounded by intact reservoir rock (Caine et al., 1996). |This architecture will determine the permeability in the vicinity of fault zones (Mitchell and Faulkner, 2012). Considering the importance of the distribution of faults and fractures in determining stimulated reservoir volume and gas production, it is important to better describe permeability in faulted and fractured shales and incorporate this description in models of gas flow.|","Document Type

M., Advantek Waste Management Services| Block, G., Advantek Waste Management Services| Kholy, S. M., Advantek Waste Management Services| Abou-Sayed, O., Advantek Waste Management Services| Abou-Sayed, A., Advantek Waste Management Services","|Abstract: |Slurry injection is commonly used to dispose of oilfield wastes during the drilling and production phases of a well. Waste types include drill cuttings, drilling fluids, produced sands, and other types of wastes produced during production. Although slurry injection is most effective when hydraulic fractures are created, safe operations demand that the fractures remain contained below one or more confining layers that are situated above the permitted injection zone. This paper outlines how numerical simulations of 3D fracture propagation can be used to accurately forecast and monitor fracture containment in support of ongoing injection operations. In particular, simulation results are used to determine the accumulation of stress caused by ongoing deposition of solids within the fractures and near the wellbore. Five case studies highlight both the numerical methods and best practices for safely operating slurry injection wells. Field observations of pressure-fall off data and extrapolated near-well stress and fracture lengths are found to match closely with numerical results. Recent advances using cloud-based diagnostics of well performance also enable using real-time slurry rheology, injection rate and pressure data to drive numerical fracture simulations to predict how operational decisions impact fracture geometry and subsurface reservoir properties. |Introduction |Two common methods for disposing of exploration and production (E&P) wastes include landfills and deep injection wells. Each method has its own risks and potential drawbacks: landfills create environmental hazards, including potential ground-water contamination and impacts on nearby population centers, while deep injection of slurrified waste requires a thorough understanding of subsurface fracture propagation and long-term fluid containment. US shale production has led to a significant increase in the volume of E&P waste produced in regions that did not previously have the infrastructure to support safe disposal. Environmental sensitivities to E&P landfills, in addition to the lengthy regulatory process for siting new landfills, has made use of slurry injection wells for onshore E&P activity an important option. |Subsurface geomechanics plays an essential role in safe operations of slurry injection wells. The fluid rheology and pumping schedules drive much of the subsurface behavior: slurries are often composed of ground-up drill cuttings combined with a variety of drilling and production wastes that the injection facility receives, including: oil- and water-based drilling mud, produced water, rain water, and hydraulic fracturing fluids (flow-back, gels, acids, etc.). The facility is designed and operated with the sole purpose of supporting a sequence of day-long batch injections that may take place every few days. Batch injections are performed at very high flow rates to ensure that the bottom-hole pressure is large enough to stimulate one or more propagating fractures; these fractures may emanate from perforations made in the well's casing within the permitted injection interval or be created as off-shoots from an existing fracture produced during a prior injection. In both cases, the fractures may travel both laterally (away from the well) and vertically during continued injection.|",,57

W., Imperial College London","|Abstract: |A three-dimensional finite-element model for hydraulic fracturing has been developed that accounts for local thermal non-equilibrium between the injected fluid and host rock. The model also accounts for fluid flow and heat transfer within the fracture, heat conduction through the solid rock, deformation of the rock, and propagation of the fracture. Fluid flow through the fractures is modeled using the lubrication equation, and is fully coupled to the thermoelastic mechanical model through the pressure exerted by the fluid on the fracture walls, as well as by ensuring compatibility of fracture volumetric strains. Fractures are discretely modeled using triangular surfaces in an unstructured three-dimensional mesh. The growth of fractures is modeled using linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM), with the onset and direction of growth based on stress intensity factors that are computed for unstructured triangle-tetrahedral meshes. The model has been verified against analytical solutions available in the literature for penny-shaped (3D) fractures. A radial hydraulic fracture from a horizontal well is simulated to investigate the effects of the thermal non-equilibrium between the fracturing fluid and the host rock. For the case of very low matrix rock permeability, results show very little influence of thermal effects on the creation of hydraulic fractures. |Introduction |In hydraulic fracturing, the fracturing fluid is commonly not in thermal equilibrium with the solid medium, leading to heat transfer between the fluid inside the fracture and the host rock, through the fractures surfaces. Natural and man-made examples are the creation of several-kilometers-long magma-driven dikes (Spence and Turcotte, 1985) and hydraulic fracturing of gas shale (Tran et al., 2013), respectively. |Hydraulic fracturing has attracted a great deal of attention over the past decades. Many analytical and semi-analytical solutions have been developed to quantify hydraulic fracturing variables of interest, such as injection pressure, fracture aperture and fracture length (cf. Adachi et al., 2007). These semi-analytical solutions provide the foundation for hydraulic fracturing design (e.g. Cleary, 1980; Cleary et al., 1988). These solutions are constructed by combining the equations for laminar flow through the fracture with elastic deformation of the adjacent rock. Fluid flow through the fracture is commonly modelled using lubrication theory (Batchelor, 1967) for an incompressible Newtonian fluid obeying the cubic law, while fracture aperture is calculated using linear elasticity in conjunction with Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) for the computation of the mode I stress intensity factor at the fracture tip (Geertsma and de Klerk, 1969; Spence and Sharp, 1985). The lubrication equation is derivable from the general Navier-Stokes equation for the flow between two parallel plates (Zimmerman and Bodvarsson, 1996). |Heat conduction between the fluid inside fracture and surrounding rock solid has been of particular interest in many cases including magma-driven fractures (Spence and Turcotte, 1985), hydraulic fracturing of wells (Wang and Papamichos, 1999), and hydraulic fracturing of gas shale (Tran et al., 2013; Enayatpour and Patzek, 2013). Rock temperature at the surfaces of the hydraulic fracture is often considered constant and equal to the temperature of the injected fluid (Tran et al., 2013; Abousleiman et al., 2014). However, such an assumption does not satisfy conservation of energy, and does not account the fact that heat exchange between the fracturing fluid and the rock gradually causes the fracturing fluid to thermally equilibrate with the matrix rock. Consequently, an unrealistically large effect due to thermal non-equilibrium is predicted by such approaches.|",,35

Further rock mechanics investigations changed the level interval from 30 m to 45 m at Balaghat Mine. Moreover, a single-boomer electro hydrostatic crawler mounted drill jumbo has been introduced for drift development.

These deposits are mainly of secondary origin and are associated with the older Achaean meta-sediments (Murthy et al, 2009). The deposits in India were originally classified as three fold (Fermor, 1909), which were subsequently modified as fourfold (GSI News 1973; Khrishnaswamy, 1979) as mentioned below: |Syngenetic Gonditic deposits associated with highly metamorphosed Sausar Group of rocks as in Central and Western India, |Syngenetic reef deposits associated with the Khondalite sequences of eastern ghats, |Replacement deposits in the Banded Iron Formations as in Singbhum, Karnataka and Goa regions; |Lateritic deposits and supergene enrichments associated with all the above three. |The manganese deposits in central India are unique in respect of their formation (Mahadik, 2000).

A., Baker Hughes| Shouse, R., Baker Hughes| Prasad, U., Baker Hughes| Franquet, J. A., Baker Hughes","|Abstract: |For determining strength, core samples should meet the recommended sample length as described in ASTM or ISRM specifications. However, irregularly-sized core samples are tested anyway and the measured strength obtained from these core samples are potentially improperly used in petroleum geomechanics workflows and modeling. Previous studies performed on sandstone samples at different lengths proposed a suitable correction factor to apply for unconfined (UCS) and confined compressive strengths (CCS) and compare it to the ASTM correction factor used in the industry. |This study focuses on applying a correction factor developed in sandstone under triaxial testing to carbonates to verify its applicability in other lithologies. The sedimentary rock type selected and tested in this study is the Alabama limestone and the proposed L/D correction factor allows rock mechanics practitioners to use either 38.1 mm (1.5-in) or 25.4 mm (1.0-in) diameter side-wall core samples extracted via wireline rotary side-wall coring in their geomechanical models. |Introduction |Rock mechanical properties (RMP) are important for petroleum geomechanics analysis. The effect of size, especially as it relates to rock strength, is well understood; what is less understood is the proper correction factor to use when an appropriate core size is not available, especially under confining pressure. Our research has been focused on obtaining a representative size effect correction for RMP and to document what role the lithology of the core sample plays in this phenomenon. |Previous studies by Mogi, 1966, Dirige and Archibald, 2006, Nunes, 2011 and Thuro, 2012, Merwe, 2003 and Bieniawsky, 1968, have shown that there is an effect of length-to-diameter (L/D) ratio on rock strength. |In this paper we present our experimental findings from Alabama limestone samples at different diameters, lengths and confining pressures.

N., TNO – Advisory Group of Ministry of Economic Affairs","|Abstract: |In recent studies on the surface subsidence caused by hydrocarbon recovery of the Groningen gas field, the predicted subsidence is overestimated if results of compaction experiments are not corrected by an empirical ‘upscaling factor’. In order to find an explanation for this ‘upscaling factor’, an analysis is presented of different laboratory experiments conducted by NAM on samples of the Groningen field. In the mentioned studies, the result of the 1st loading cycle is generally used for the compaction calculations, while in the 2nd and subsequent loading cycles a lower compaction coefficient (Cm) is observed. It is also observed that stress path has a significant influence on the measured Cm. A maximum of 25 % of the discrepancy in lab and reservoir scale compaction can likely be attributed to this difference in stress path between laboratory and reservoir. The Cm values of the 2nd cycle compaction experiments with a stress path similar to the stress path of the Groningen reservoir are very comparable to the best-fit line used for predicting reservoir compaction. These results would imply that a 2nd loading cycle is more representative of actual reservoir compaction. |Introduction |The production of hydrocarbons leads to a decrease in pore fluid pressure in a reservoir and consequently to an increase in effective stress acting on the rock reservoir matrix. This increase in effective stress can lead to reservoir compaction, which can have serious negative consequences such as surface subsidence, induced seismicity and well shearing (e.g. Geertsma, 1973a-b; Nagel et al., 2001; Doornhof et al., 2006; van Thienen-Visser and Breunese, 2015; Fokker and van Thienen-Visser, 2016). |The subsurface of the Netherlands contains numerous hydrocarbon reservoirs, mostly gas fields.

J., University of Memphis","|Abstract: |Forestry reclamation approach (FRA) is a technique used in surface mining to reclaim already mined areas, which recommends that upper 1.3 m (<U+2248> 4 ft) of reclaimed slope should be left as uncompacted as possible to facilitate successful tree root growth. However, the consequences of leaving upper 1.3 m of uncompacted material may lead to instability of reclaimed slopes that is not accurately simulated using traditional equilibrium limit methods. A numerical model for slope stability analysis based on the fracture mechanics approach is developed in this research. The interface slope region between the lower compacted and upper uncompacted material is assumed as a joint surface. Two-dimensional constant strength displacement discontinuity (DD) analysis of the joint surfaces is carried out for the dry and hydrostatic pressure conditions. The weight of the overlying material acts as boundary conditions on the joint surfaces. Once, the DDs over the joint surface(s) are estimated, then the stresses at the prescribed points on the slope are estimated and checked using Mohr-Coulomb criterion to locate potential failure surfaces. The advantage of applying the DD analysis is that it reduces the problem dimension by one degree and eliminates discretization of whole slope area. The fracture mechanics based slope analysis gives better estimate of stability, because it accounts for the local stress concentration in vicinity of the cracks. The analytical slope stability results using the DD model, GeoSlope/W model and field slope monitoring investigation results demonstrated that overall slope is stable. Hence, the FRA is applicable to steep-slopes provided the slope gradient is maintained through careful final grading. |Introduction |The stability of natural or man-made slopes are of the great concern in Civil and Mining engineering. The most commonly used approach for the slope stability analysis is the limit equilibrium method (LEM). The LEM assumes slope as a rigid body and the rigid body motion or rotation causes the slope failure. The factor of safety in the LEM approach is determined by the ratio of shear resistance to average shear stress on a pre-defined failure surface. However, the LEM approach neglects the local development of stress concentration in the discontinuities or crack/joints in slope. The most suitable approach in jointed rock slopes appears to be that which considers a failure plane consisting of discontinuous joints separated by intact rocks. Jennings (1970) first suggested the LEM analysis of the jointed rocks and assuming that the intact rock fails in shear mode as a Mohr-Coulomb material and the strength of rock mass is estimated by using the joint persistence, which is defined as the ratio of total length of joints to the length of the failure plane. Tharp and Coffin (1985) applied fracture mechanics approach to the stability of small slope containing single crack. The fracture mechanics based slope stability analysis accounts for the crack-tip stress concentration characterized by the stress intensity factors. This approach is based on the principle that jointed rock slope stability is governed by the stresses intensity factors at the joint tips rather by the frictional resistance along the joint surfaces. The crack initiation starts when the tip stress intensity factor exceeds the fracture toughness of the jointed rocks. The factor of safety in this approach is defined in terms of stress intensity factor required to cause joint initiation compared to the fracture toughness. Scavia (1990 a&b) adopted the displacement discontinuity method (DDM) to deal with system of discontinuities in the slope and analyzed the slope stability using combination of fictitious stress method (FSM) and the displacement discontinuity method (DDM) and suggested to use stress discontinuity (SD) elements for the outer boundary discretization, whereas the displacement discontinuity (DD) elements are used to discretize the joint surfaces. Recently, Zhang et al. (2013 & 2014) presented slope stability studies based on the displacement discontinuity method (DDM) and used only the DD elements to discretized both the slope boundaries and joint surfaces. This approach is adopted in this study.|",,56

H., The University of Arizona","|Abstract: |Up to now, several parameters and methods such as empirical, statistical method, fractal and spectral methods are used to quantify the rock joints surface. Spectral method is the latest method and more comprehensive. One of the most useful tools in spectral method is the Fourier transform. Due to the ability of the Fourier analysis in separating signals to different amplitudes and frequencies, it can separate the roughness profile to some profiles with specific frequencies and amplitudes. Profiles with high frequencies and low amplitudes represent the small asperities and profiles with low frequencies and high amplitudes represent waviness. In previous investigations, Fourier analysis is used to find power spectral curve and roughness parameters or fractal dimension were calculated by this curve. However, in this paper with applying Fourier analysis on profiles and then applying low pass filter on the profiles and investigating the effect of cut-off frequency in low pass filter of JRC profiles on real length and average dip angle, new parameters (CL & CI) are introduced to quantification of rock joints roughness. These parameters have a high correlation with JRC. Since, CI can quantify the influence of shear direction, CI represents roughness |Introduction |In geomechanics engineering, the engineers are faced to several problems, which are caused by geotechnical systems and their structures are located in or on jointed rock masses. In rock masses, joints have complex structures and patterns. Due to this matter and inherited uncertainty in estimating geomechanical properties of intact rocks and joints, predicting of rock masses properties is difficult task. On the other hand, the limitation of the experimental and field data makes it much worse.

Based on these experiments, we propose a criterion for macroscopic breakage wherein failure occurs when a given proportion of available atomic-scale bonds are broken. Consistent with the experiments, this theory predicts that a linearly increasing applied load is expected to result in a linear relationship between the load at the time of macroscopic breakage and the logarithm of the loading rate. Furthermore, the parameters ascertained from the results of the increased load experiments give a lower bound prediction with the same slope for the time to failure under constant loading |Introduction |Static fatigue is a phenomenon that describes a material's tendency to fail under subcritical loads after a period of time (Zhurkov, 1984). Static fatigue is a ubiquitous property of materials and is typically expressed as either an exponential or a power-law relationship between the time to failure (i.e., life of the structure) and the nominal applied stress (Gy, 2003). |According to Zhurkov's 1984 experiments on over 50 materials, the relationship between the lifetime of a specimen under uniaxial load, tf, and the induced tensile stress, <U+03C3>, can be determined by an Arrhenius-type law: |(equation) |where k and T are Boltzmann's constant and absolute temperature, respectively. The characteristic time t0 is found to have the same order of magnitude as the period of thermal oscillation of atoms. U0 is interpreted as the interatomic binding energy. The coefficient <U+03B3> is related to the characteristic of a solid that translates an applied stress into energy available for breaking interatomic bonds. Zhurkov (1984) concluded that the behavior of static fatigue in solids can be represented by this experimentally determined correlation. |The experiments of Zhurkov (1984) included over 50 materials spanning metals, alloys, non-metallic crystals, and polymers. Other experiments have been conducted which applied his theory to experimental results specifically testing rocks (e.g. experiments reviewed by Cruden, 1974, Scholtz, 1972 & 2002). Static fatigue of rocks has been connected in past research to initiation and aftershocks associated with earthquakes (Scholz, 2002) and failure of rocks due to mining-induced stresses (Cruden, 1974). Our present research is mainly motivated by recent investigation showing that characterization of static fatigue properties of a rock can help to interpret subcritical breakdown pressures observed in hydraulic fracture laboratory experiments (Bunger and Lu, 2014; Lu et al., 2015).|",,10

Five groups of samples are tested under the hydrostatic stress of 0 MPa, 5 MPa, 10 MPa, 15 MPa, and 20 MPa. The rate dependent damage model, dominant crack algorithm (DCA), which is a micro-statistical crack mechanics method, is used to numerically model the failure process of the confined BD rock samples. |The testing result shows that the dynamic tensile strength of the rock increases with the hydrostatic pre-stress, which is reasonable since the confinement closes the microcracks and make it harder to break the rock samples. It is also observed that the dynamic tensile strength increases with the loading rate, revealing the rate dependency that is common for engineering materials. The modeling of the failure process matches well with the experimental results, demonstrating the applicability of the DCA model in predicting the dynamic tensile failure of rock materials. |Introduction |Tensile failure is a main failure mode of rocks in underground rock engineering projects, in which rocks are subjected to dynamic disturbances while under in situ stresses. When disturbed by dynamic loads from blasting, seismicity, or rockbursts, the underground rocks would be vulnerable to tensile failure. Even though the far-field load is compressive, the local stresses may be tensile, as shown in Fig. 1. From a macroscopic point of view, the bending of the roof induces tensile stress at the roof of the opening; from a microscopic view, the discontinuities in the rock result in tensile stress locally around the opening, so the dynamic tensile failure of rocks under pre-tension has been investigated by researchers [1, 2]. However, the far field rocks under hydrostatic prestress can also fail in tension under dynamic loads. Therefore, it is the purpose of this paper to investigate the dynamic tensile failure of rock materials under hydrostatic prestress state.|",,13

N., The University of Texas at Austin| Ramos, M. J., The University of Texas at Austin","|Abstract: |Reservoir depletion results in changes in effective stresses, which may lead to significant changes in reservoir permeability. These changes are associated with matrix compaction, fracture closure and potential slip. A depletion-induced increase in effective stresses often leads to a decrease in permeability. However, the opposite is observed to happen in some fractured gas reservoirs with an organic rock matrix that exhibits strong sorption-mechanical coupling. During depletion, an adsorbed portion of the gas desorbs from micropores resulting in shrinkage of the organic components in the rock matrix, effective stress relaxation and a potential increase in fracture permeability. The objective of this study is to develop a reservoir simulator with a full mechanical coupling accounting for sorption-induced change of stresses. This paper aims to estimate the influence of the parameters affecting reservoir permeability and to predict its evolution during reservoir depletion. We compare two natural gas fields with strong (San Juan coal basin) and weak (Barnett shale formation) sorption-mechanical coupling. The results of the study highlight the interplay between mechanical moduli, swelling isotherm parameters, and fracture compressibility in determining the impact of desorption on fracture permeability evolution during depletion. |Introduction |Natural gas consumption currently constitutes a fifth of the total energy sources [1]. About a half of nonassociated gas accrues to non-conventional gas reservoirs, mainly organic shales and coal seams [1]. Non-conventional tight reservoirs have an extremely low permeability, a fair portion of which pertains to fractures as main fluid conduits. The openings of these fractures are dictated by lithology and the reservoir stresses, which may alter during reservoir development [2-5]. Two competitive geomechanical processes are known to affect stresses during depletion in organic-rich rocks: pressure drawdown and desorption-induced shrinkage. The latter is of significant importance in coals because sorbed gas constitutes more than 50% of total gas in place and desorption induces a substantial amount of rock shrinkage [6-8]. Sorbed gas in hydrocarbon-bearing shales constitutes 5-15% of the total gas in place. Sorption capacity is usually proportional to total organic carbon (TOC) in shales [9]. Decreases in pore pressure associated with reservoir depletion cause increases in effective stresses, which often leads to fracture closure and a decrease in permeability. In contrast, desorption and matrix shrinkage result in a drop in effective stresses and an increase in permeability [8, 10, 11].|",,28

The Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was employed to obtain coal cleat geometry at the micro-scale. Based on the real cleat geometry, the Phase Field Method (PFM) was used to simulate the two-phase flow and the combination of shear and tensile failure criteria was selected to evaluate the generation of coal fines. The results reveal that more coal fines are generated in two-phase flow than single-phase flow. For the two-phase flow conditions, residual displaced phase is observed inside the micro-roughness of coal cleat. Majority of coal fines are generated in these regions due to the substantial pressure force induced by significant pressure difference between the trapped phase and the invading phase. Coal wettability plays an important role in coal fines generation. Using the wetting phase as the injection phase will produce one order of magnitude more coal fines than that from the other way. Moreover, the change of fluid phase inside the cleat can create considerable pressure fluctuations up to several kPa, which is not favorable in managing the production of coal fines. |Introduction |The life of a Coal Seam Gas (CSG) well can be divided into three stages: (1) dewatering; (2) stable production and (3) decline (Moore, 2012). With respect to the flow regimes during these stages, it can be categorized into four groups, namely water flow, gas flow, gas-drive-water and water-drive-gas flows. Coal seams are initially saturated with water under high pressure condition. The high water pressure locks CSG in coal matrices as adsorption state (Gilman and Beckie, 2000). Therefore, little gas is produced during the early dewatering stage, and the flow inside coal seams is regarded as single water phase flow. As coal seams are progressively dewatered, at the late stage of the dewatering process, CSG production begins to accelerate while water production starts to decline, thereby, the flow is considered as gas-drive-water two-phase flow till the early stable production stage (Saghafi et al., 2014b). When the CSG production enters the late stable production stage, single gas phase flow occurs in coal seams, since water is mostly exhausted. It is also the case throughout the decline stage of CSG production (Moore, 2012). Additionally, in the dewatering and the stable production phases, pressure transient testing may be conducted in place to obtain dynamic reservoir data, which is frequently associated with well shut-in (Chen et al., 2015). During well shut-in, the build-up of water level and pressure may cease the desorption process, forming the water-drive-gas flow regime in coal seams. Based on these statements, the flow regimes can be summarized in Fig. 1.|",,23

The role of in-situ stress state, discrete fracture network, fracturing fluid and proppant properties have been investigated for an Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS) feasibility study. Modeling results indicated that when designing for EGS wells, the connectivity between the hydraulic fractures and natural fractures for sustaining the desired heat production in the EGS operations was greatly depended on the unique reservoir characteristics of geothermal formations, including lithology, in-situ stress state, pore pressure and natural fracture characteristics such as fracture orientation as well as proper fracturing fluid viscosity, proppant concentration, pump rate, and well spacing. |Introduction |The 2015 annual U.S. and global geothermal power production report indicates that the United States constructed more than 38 geothermal power projects adding nearly 700 megawatts (MW) to the U.S. electricity capacity. Majority of the power had been produced in California. The geothermal industry had approximately 3.5 gigawatts (GW) of installed nameplate capacity and 2.7 GW of net capacity in the US by 2014 while the global market for geothermal industry in 2015 was at about 12.8 GW of operating capacity in 24 countries (GEA, 2015). |When compared to the commercialized energy sources like shale gas and tight oil in the unconventional industry, it is still not economical enough to exploit heat from these hot, ultra-low permeability formations without applying certain stimulation technologies (Tester, 2016). Therefore, the Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) is being developed to enhance the produced heat energy from the unconventional geothermal resources, even those with hard, hot rocks with almost no heated fluid inside. Using stimulation technologies such as multi-stage hydraulic fracturing and horizontal well completion, EGS would expand the geothermal powering capabilities to larger extent. |In order for an effective use of the same technologies in enhanced geothermal system applications, engineers have to implement the different formation characteristics of EGS compared with that in unconventional oil and gas reservoirs. These differences include reservoir lithology, formation temperature, pore pressure, in situ stress states and operational parameter variations resulted from various fracturing fluids, proppants, pumping rates, and well spacing during the treatment operations. Moreover, in unconventional tight oil and shale gas operations, permeable conduits are created through the hydraulic fracturing operations in order to connect the existing natural fractures and pore space together for production pathways inside the formation matrix; while heat exchange inside the geothermal system needs to be established between the injected fluid and the heated formations through the conducted conduit. The effectiveness of the heat exchange in geothermal system depends on the total heat extracting volume among heat bearing matrixes and cold injected fluids under a reasonable flow rate throughout the production life.|",,44

E., Deep Exploration Technologies CRC and University of Adelaide| Taheri, A., University of Adelaide| Chanda, E. K., University of Adelaide","|Abstract: |Rock drilling is essential in the mining industry. Complexities involved in the drilling process encompassing not only rock properties but also the nature of the drilling action impact the drilling performance and operational costs. Brittleness is a fundamental rock property relevant to rock drilling and excavation works. However, rock brittleness is a concept yet to be investigated. In this study, a new brittleness index developed upon fracture energy quantities withdrawn from the complete stress-strain characteristics in uniaxial compression of rock is presented. A vast independent data on the drilling performance reported elsewhere in the literature was evaluated against the new brittleness index. The results show that the proposed brittleness index successfully describes the performance of different drilling methods including PDC (Polycrystalline Diamond Compact) rotary drilling, roller-cone rotary drilling and percussive drilling. |Introduction |Drilling performance is one of the most important parameters to take into account when evaluating project feasibility and economy in the mining and mineral exploration industry. In this sense, several attempts have been made to assess drilling performance by correlating different rock mechanical and physical properties with the drilling performance including rock texture, grain size, density, P-wave velocity, Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS), Mohs hardness and rock mass structural parameters (Altindag, 2003; Altindag, 2009; Hoseinie et al., 2008; Taheri et al., 2016). However, a generalised method to relate drilling performance with rock strength characteristics has not been developed yet. This is due to the complexity of interactions among the variables involved in the drilling process encompassing not only rock properties, but also the nature of drilling. In this view, by coupling relevant drilling parameters with relevant rock properties, a reliable drilling performance prediction method can be developed. |On one hand, to predict rock drilling performance and optimisation of drilling operation, tool-rock interaction laws, i.e. the relations between forces acting on the tool in contact with rock, are essential (Detournay and Defourny, 1992; Detournay et al., 2008; Franca, 2010, 2011; Franca et al., 2015; Hustrulid and Fairhurst, 1971a, 1972a; Hustrulid and Fairhurst, 1971b, 1972b). On the other hand, there is not a unique criterion able to describe rock brittleness quantitatively nor consensus about the most suitable and reliable brittleness index to apply to different rock engineering works encountered in the field. For instance, previously a number of different criteria to assess rock brittleness developed upon prepeak stress-strain characteristics in uniaxial compression (Hucka and Das, 1974; Kidybinski, 1981) and upon rock compressive strength, UCS, and tensile strength, TS, (Altindag, 2002; Hucka and Das, 1974; Kahraman, 2002), are not able describe a scale of brittleness to ductility of rock at all (Munoz et al., 2016a; Tarasov and Potvin, 2013; Tarasov and Randolph, 2011).|",,25
717,718,2016-430,A Comparison of Short-Term and Long-Term Creep Experiments in Unconventional Reservoir Formations,"Rassouli, F. S., Stanford University| Zoback, M. D., Stanford University","|Abstract: |The goal of this study was to compare constitutive parameters derived from short-term (four hour) and long-term (several-week) creep experiments. We conducted a series of creep experiments on clay and carbonate-rich shale samples from unconventional gas and oil reservoirs at room temperature, principally on samples from the Haynesville and Eagle Ford formations. Samples with different mineralogies were subjected to a series of multi-stage loading/creep, unloading/recovery cycles conducted over different time spans. All creep stages of the experiments were performed at a constant differential stress level; only the testing time of each creep/recovery stage was varied. Following Sone and Zoback (Jour. Petrol. Sci. and Eng., 2014), a power-law creep model was used to obtain the creep constitutive parameters. Results of these experiments show that the shale samples follow the same creep trend through time, regardless of the loading history. Also, we show that the simple power-law model is capable of describing creep over multiple time periods. Using this model, we are able to characterize viscoplastic behavior of shale rocks from relatively short-term (1 day) creep experiments. |Introduction |A common challenge in laboratory creep studies is to know how long laboratory experiments need to be carried out to accurately measure the parameters that make it possible to predict rock deformation over relatively long periods of time. This time-dependent deformation affects mechanical and flow properties of sedimentary rocks [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Initial laboratory studies of viscoplatic deformation were carried out via uniaxial and triaxial creep experiments [7, 8, 9, 10]. Because of the time-consuming nature of these experiments, relatively few papers have addressed this topic. |In this paper we carried out a series of creep experiments on shale samples with various amounts of carbonate and clay to investigate the constitutive law and creep parameters obtained in loading steps ranging from several hours to several weeks. We extend the comprehensive short-term (several hour) creep experiments reported by Sone and Zoback (2014) who investigated the role of clay and organic content on viscous deformation of shales from unconventional gas reservoirs [11]. They used a relatively simple (two parameter) power-law model to fit the data. |Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain low temperature creep in sedimentary rocks. Although Peterson and Wong (2004) argue that the deformation of rocks at temperatures below 1200 K can generally be considered brittle [12], other studies have shown that it is possible to observe inelasic deformation of rocks at lower temperatures due to mechanical compaction processes [13]. For example, Sone and Zoback (2014) argued that the time-dependent deformation they observed was accommodated by changes in the pore volume.|",,11

G., State Supervision of Mines| van Thienen-Visser, K., TNO, Advisory Group Ministry of Economic Affairs","|Abstract: |Halite solution mining and natural gas production in the west of the province of Fryslan in the Netherlands cause subsidence significantly exceeding original predictions. Subsidence at the centre of the salt subsidence bowl reached 33 cm in 2015 while only 7 cm had been predicted in the 1995 forecast. Maximum subsidence above the nearby Harlingen gas field was around 33 cm in 2015 compared to 10 cm in the 2003 forecast for the end of field life. In addition, subsidence accelerated over time. From the regulator's point of view, the development of the discrepancies was unacceptable and led to an early reassessment of the salt mining project and to suspension of the gas production by the operator in 2008. Extensive research into the causes of the exceedances was able to provide a proper explanation for both occurrences. For the salt solution mining, cavern convergence rates at the in-situ stresses and temperatures at the depth of the project are much higher than initially estimated. This leads to a different production mechanism (squeeze mining), which gives much more subsidence. After convergence and subsidence modelling were corrected for this in 1998, predicted and observed subsidence are in much better agreement. The additional and accelerating subsidence above the Harlingen gas field can only be explained by pore-collapse of the gas-bearing reservoir chalk. During the laboratory compaction tests used for the original subsidence predictions, pore collapse only occurred at stress levels beyond those possible in-situ. The explanation for the inconsistency was found to be the strong impact of loading rate on the pore-collapse stress level. The applicability of an existing rate type compaction model for the Harlingen chalk was confirmed by new variable loading rate laboratory experiments. Using the model to translate the laboratory measured pore-collapse stresses into values applicable under field conditions, a much better agreement with the observed field behaviour was obtained. The Harlingen case thus provides further evidence that the large influence of loading rate on the chalk pore collapse stress seen during laboratory experiments applies down to field loading rates and that corrections for this need to be applied in compaction and subsidence forecasts.|",,22

The observation of tested samples and blocks at draw points pointed out that veinlets and veins have a high participation in the failure mode, according to this a small volume of rock containing veinlets lees than 1mm is considered to be representative of the intact rock. The structural description of the tested samples pointed out four typical failure types and three of them can be considered valid results to estimate the intact rock properties. This failure classification system is useful to define valid results to estimate the intact rock properties. This method had been applied to several operating mines and projects in Chile obtaining a better estimation of the intact rock and rock mass properties and has been applied to estimate pillars strength, fragmentation curves, large open pit slopes stability or cavability for deep underground mines increasing the reliability of the results. |Introduction |It is normal practice for geotechnical engineers on site to rejects the results from samples which have failed on clearly defined veins or veinlets which are considered to have pre-existed in the sample. These failures are influenced by anisotropy of the rock and tend to be considered separately from the valid results of tests on homogeneous and isotropic intact samples. |The estimation of the intact rock properties from Lab tests, as unconfined compressive strength, tensile strength and triaxial tests represents an important item of the intact rock and rock mass geotechnical characterization, as these parameters are used as inputs for the geotechnical classification systems, geotechnical design and numerical modeling in the mining industry. |The porphyry copper deposits are characterized by a host rock affected by different alteration types and a mineralization mostly hosted in a stockwork of veins and veinlets that makes difficult to obtain samples of intact rocks, as homogeneous and avoid of defects or veins. The presence of the stockwork can produce a strength anisotropy in the collected sample, affecting the value of the Lab test and the estimation of the intact rock properties. Due to this in El Teniente Mine was developed a methodology [1] to select valid results from UCS, triaxial and Brazilian test to estimate in a better way the intact rock properties. |Previous Works |In the past, at El Teniente Mine, the estimation of the intact rock properties was based on the statistical analysis of the results obtained from the Lab tests [1], [2], [3], however, the different results obtained from several geomechanical campaign, pointed out the necessity to have a good structural description of the tested samples [4], [5], [6] and was developed a method for a detailed structural description of each sample previous and post the Lab test [1]. According to this method it was possible to quantify the participation of pre-existing veins in failure mode in tested samples and from observed blocks in draw points, pointing out that over 70% of the tested samples have a failure with participation of pre-existing veins and 100% of blocks at the draw points are delimited by pre-existing veins [1].

A., Schlumberger","|Abstract: |We applied a normal stress (<U+03C3>n = 0 <U+2212> 12.8 psi) to a transparent deformable fracture to investigate the behavior of sand-fiber mixtures. Using light transmission techniques, we quantified the sand volume fraction ?s throughout the experiment. In the absence of an applied normal stress, <U+03C3>n = 0, the sand and fibers settled into randomly distributed sand-fiber islands. Injecting solids-free carrier fluid displaces the settled solids washing them out of the fracture. Results for applied-normal stress experiments (<U+03C3>n = 0 <U+2212> 12.8 psi) demonstrate the sand-fiber islands compacted and the solid volume within them increased as <U+03C3>n increased. We observed that these sand-fiber islands supported the applied normal stress and prevented fracture closure, acting as pillars between the fracture surfaces. After injecting solids-free carrier fluid, while keeping <U+03C3>n =12.8 psi, we observed most sand-fiber pillars remained in place and some solids-free pathways were created. The formation of such pathways shows that the addition of fibers to hydraulic fracturing fluids, even at small concentrations, may increase fracture permeability through the formation of sand-fiber pillars capable of supporting a normal stress, preventing fracture closure. |Introduction |Settling of non-Brownian particles in polymeric fluids (e.g., xanthan or guar gels) is of great importance for many different industrial applications, especially in industries where the aim is to prevent particles from settling or at least decrease the settling rate of the particles, e.g., oil and gas production and well drilling operations. Recently, it has been proposed that the addition of rod-like solids (e.g., fibers) to polymeric fluids may reduce particle settling rates. Elgaddafi et al. (2012) have previously demonstrated a settling rate reduction of a single particle falling through a suspension of dispersed fibers. Much of the recent work has focused on the influence of fibers on the rheological properties of the suspension (George et al., 2011; George et al., 2012; Guo et al., 2005; Ra-jabian et al., 2008). These studies have shown that adding fibers to a polymeric fluid will increase the apparent viscosity of the fluid and reduce settling rate. The reduced settling rate was attributed to the formation of intertwined networks of fibers and polymeric glucose-chains (Guo et al., 2005; Rajabian et al., 2008). Previous research characterized the settling of dispersed sand (Chhabra and Peri, 1991; Guazzelli and Hinch, 2011; Happel and Bart, 1974) and dispersed fibers (Baldock et al., 2004; Herzhaft and Guazzelli, 1999; Herzhaft et al., 1996) suspensions.

The target disposal interval for the deep-borehole option is granitic rock at depths between 3 and 5 km below the surface. The feasibility of the deep-borehole option relies, in part, on designing and constructing an effective seal within the borehole to ensure that the waste package does not communicate with the shallow subsurface biosphere through the borehole itself nor through the disturbed rock zone (DRZ) that surrounds the borehole. |The rock melt borehole sealing concept, which consists of generating a plug from melted rock by means of a downhole heater, is a novel sealing method that has the potential to address concerns with conventional seals (namely, the ability to seal the DRZ and avoid degradation over long time periods). However, both modeling results and experiment observations indicate that the extreme temperature differential has the capability to cause fracturing. Thermomechanical modeling was used to identify maximum heating and cooling rates, which prevent the development of thermally induced fracturing when applied. The defined heating rates were used for laboratory-scale testing and will eventually be integrated into in situ field-scale testing of the rock melt borehole sealing system at the Sanford Underground Research Facility. This paper presents the results of the thermomechanical modeling and compares the predictions with observations and measurements from the laboratory-scale tests. |Introduction |Deep-borehole disposal has received increased attention in recent years as a potential strategy for the long-term disposal of nuclear waste, and numerous factors suggest that the practice is an inherently safe method of disposal (Arnold et al., 2011, 2013). The target disposal interval for the deep-borehole option is crystalline rock, which occurs at depths between 3 kilometers (km) and 5 km. |At these depths, a distrubed rock zone (DRZ) is expected to develop in the rock around the borehole as a result of in situ stresses and normal drilling damage. The DRZ consists of a zone where microfractures (which are disseminated throughout the rock mass) and macrofractures (which are essentially microfractures that have coalesced into visible features) have increased the permeability of the crystalline rock. |The feasibility of the deep-borehole concept relies, in part, on constructing an effective seal within the borehole to ensure that the waste package does not communicate with the shallow subsurface biosphere through the borehole itself nor through the DRZ. Conventional sealing methods consist of redundant seals of cement and bentonite; however, concerns exist in regard to the ability of these methods to effectively seal the DRZ and the potential for seal degradation over extended time periods.|",,25

N., University of Oklahoma","|Abstract: |The analytical poroelastic solutions for an inclined wellbore drilled through an N-porosity N-permeability porous medium were derived, taking into account the mudcake buildup on the wellbore wall. To extend the application of this general solution, a triple-porosity porous medium is studied to illustrate the pressure and stress distributions around the wellbore. Moreover, the stress cloud approach is presented to visualize the wellbore failure potentials and the Drucker-Prager criterion is applied to analyze wellbore shear failure. Each set of porosity is found to significantly influence the stress clouds at the wellbore wall and the mudweight window. Comparison analysis shows that the single porosity simulation predicts the widest mudweight window, followed by the dual-porosity simulation, and then the triple-porosity simulation. Compared to the single porosity case, the dual- and triple-porosity simulations predict 8.0% and almost 15.0% higher collapse mudweights, respectively. Mudcake also plays an essential role in the wellbore stability. Its effect could be to shift down of the stress cloud and therefore decrease the wellbore failure potential. Mudweight window is also found to be sensitive to mudcake thickness and permeability, which clearly shows that mudcake effects should be taken into account. |Introduction |The poroelastic solutions for an inclined wellbore have played an essential role in the wellbore stability analysis for drilling through a fluid-saturated porous medium. The wellbore stability is severely affected by the time-dependent poroelastic responses of the fluid-saturated porous medium, such as the evolutions of stresses and pore pressure around the wellbore which might lead to time-delayed failure (Cui et al. 1997; Abousleiman et al. 2000). Early analyses of the time-dependent stresses and pore pressure responses after excavation were presented by Carter and Booker (1982) who gave the analytical solutions for a circular tunnel excavated in a fluid-saturated medium. Detournay and Cheng (1988) derived the analytical solutions for a vertical wellbore under non-hydrostatic stress field and showed that shear failure could be initiated inside the formation rather than on the wellbore wall. The complete analytical solutions for an inclined wellbore drilled through an isotropic fluid-saturated porous medium was given by Cui et al. (1997). Later, the solutions were generated to account for material transverse isotropy (Abousleiman and Cui 1998) and time-dependent pore pressure and flux boundary conditions (Ekbote et al. 2004). For a naturally fractured fluid-saturated rock formation, using the dual-poroelastic formulation, Wilson and Aifantis (1982) presented the analytical solutions for a vertical wellbore under hydrostatic state of stress and Li (2003) for a vertical wellbore under non-hydrostatic state of stress. Abousleiman and Nguyen (2005) derived the complete analytical solutions for an inclined wellbore drilled through a naturally fractured rock formation and subjected to three-dimensional state of stress. Dual-porosity simulation was found to predict narrower mudweight window than single porosity simulation (Nguyen and Abousleiman 2009; Nguyen et al. 2009). Analytical solutions were also derived for inclined wellbore problem accounting for chemo-electrical and thermal effects which are found to be crucial in wellbore stability analysis (Ekbote and Abousleiman 2005; Ekbote and Abousleiman 2006; Nguyen and Abousleiman 2010).|",,14

Two PMMA blocks were fused along their long edges to form a bonded interface. Six different scenarios were studied using samples of two thickness, 12.7 mm and 25.4 mm (0.5 in and 1 in), and three applied compressive thermal bonding stresses – 6, 12 and 24 kPa.

A displacement controlled fracture toughness test was performed, where the sample is loaded by a compressive stress applied in the direction parallel to the cohesive interface. A visible stable fracture propagating towards both ends of the specimen is produced. The rate of displacement, load, and fracture growth were recorded. This data was used to determine the fracture toughness of the bonded interface. |Introduction |Natural fracture (joint) cohesion plays an important role in rock mechanics; for example, small values of joint cohesion can significantly impact the results of slope and tunnel roof stability analyses. Natural fractures create complicated interactions with hydraulic fractures as implemented in the oil and gas industry to increase the rock mass permeability in the region surrounding the injection point. In fractured media, the hydraulic fracture influences a much larger volume of rock due to the shearing and distortions taking place in the rock mass (Dusseault 2015). This movement causes wedging (Mode I) and slip (Mode II) fracture among the solid matrix fragments. The amount of shearing and consequent shear dilation produced by the fluid injection is dependent on the cohesion level of the preexisting planes of weakness in the rock mass, as well as other mechanical properties of the rock mass. Cohesion is a parameter in Mohr– Coulomb theories of rock mass yielding/failure (Hossain et al., 2002). The aperture dilation of preexisting fractures during shear is also dependent on the roughness of the joint (Barton et al. 1985) and the shear displacements parallel to the joint walls. The higher the cohesion, the more energy the hydraulic fracture requires to open preexisting or incipient fractures, therefore the smaller the stimulated volume adjacent to the main fracture plane is likely to be. It is desirable to study these issues in a controlled laboratory setting. |The amount of energy required to open a sealed crack per unit of fracture area is called fracture toughness. This mechanical property is difficult to measure for brittle materials in experimental and field work (Bunger et al., 2004). In order to measure fracture toughness of brittle materials such as rock or ceramics, three-point tests are usually performed (Hooton et al., 1997). However, this process relies on the initiation of a crack under the central load along the tension side of the specimen and results are influenced by the size of initial imperfections. Similarly, a four point test is used for plastics and other materials (ASTM, 2010), but issues of imperfection size and orientation on the bottom fiber remain important. Both of these tests develop unstable cracks that propagate at large velocities once the critical load is reached.|",,43

In exploring this phenomenon we link permeability evolution to strength evolution during fracture shearing. In particular, permeability is expected to be incremented by shear-induced dilation for velocity-weakening (i.e., seismic slip) rock fractures and decremented by shear-induced compaction or neutral deformation for velocity-strengthening (i.e., aseismic slip) failure. To confirm our assumptions, a series of experiments are conducted in a triaxial pressure vessel, where confining pressure, pore pressure, and shearing velocity are applied independently, and the evolution of fracture permeability is concurrently monitored. We explore rock rheology through these experiments for both velocity-weakening (e.g., Westerly granite) and velocity-strengthening (e.g., Green River shale) states. The results of comparison study are different from what we expected, but are useful to link between permeability and strength evolution during fracture shearing. This concept will be, furthermore, probed by linking permeability evolution to concepts of dilation and wear recovered from rate-state characterizations of frictional behavior (see Fang et al., 2016 for detail). |Introduction |Fluid injection into geothermal and hydrocarbon reservoirs (i.e., hydraulic stimulation) is recognized as one of the most general processes to improve or maintain the ability of reservoirs. However, at the same moment, fluid injections into underground can cause earthquakes (Ellsworth, 2013; Majer et al., 2007), and the construction of modeling frameworks for such induced-seismicity are desirable to determine the best scenario of fluid injection (Fang et al., 2015b; Norbeck et al., 2015). |To adequately model such induced-seismicity during fluid injection or define the impact of hydraulic stimulation, mechanical property (i.e., strength/friction) and hydraulic property (i.e., permeability) of rock fracture during shearing are necessary to be clarified. Though there are significant number of previous studies for the mechanical property (Fang et al., 2015a; Kohli and Zoback, 2013; Marone, 1998), previous studies which note on the hydraulic property are limited. Although the hydraulic properties of fracture has been explored through laboratory experiments (Esaki et al., 1999), numerical models (Ishibashi et al., 2016) or field experiments (Guglielmi et al., 2015a, 2015b), it is difficult to explain these results uniformly. Specifically, in the former two studies, the effects of shearing velocity on hydraulic properties are ignored. Furthermore, no discussion on the link between strength and permeability during shearing are presented.|",,59
725,726,2016-421,Branch Line Analysis of Faults and Fractures,"Busetti, S., ConocoPhillips| Farrell, H., ConocoPhillips","|Abstract: |We examined branch-like fracture sets (joints, shear fractures, and faults) that occur in brittle rock layers across a range of subsurface datasets and scales. Whereas fracture sets are commonly grouped by orientation in order to infer something about their genetic origin, we investigate sets that are believed to be temporally and mechanically related but vary in orientation, specifically, cases where three-dimensional projection of the planes implies hierarchical branching. Examples of these features are: antithetic fault connections; splays and branches commonly found in fault zones, dynamic fracturing, and under injection conditions such as dike swarms. A new analysis method is tested to discern these features from limited sampling data using straightforward geometric relations. A computer script was written to determine all of the potential branch lines, or the intersection lines between two planes in space, along a one-dimensional scanline (e.g. fractures measured along a wellbore). The goal is to identify the spatially dependent types of intersections (a) vertical “Y” shaped branches; (b) horizontal “Y” shaped branches; or (c) 3D arbitrary branches. We compare a few synthetic data sets and a field data set to demonstrate the key patterns. |Introduction |Structural characterization in many subsurface datasets is limited by lack of three-dimensional data at the relevant scale. Wellbore image logs and core provide data on fracture and fault sets at the bedding scale. Seismic data can image fracture corridors and fault zones and discrete faults with larger offsets usually on the scale of features 10s of meters or larger. Typically the structural style is determined from the larger scale, and the challenge is to synthesize smaller scale structures (i.e. wellbore fractures) with the patterns of the larger ones. The patterns of interest to this study are genetically related fractures that are non-parallel and intersect or merge in three dimensions to form tree or branch-like hierarchical structures. |Whereas the terms tree-like or branch-like describe the fracture morphology, the term branching implies the fractures are genetically related surfaces that source from, or merge at, a shared intersection. The branch line is where a master fracture or fault surface splits or branches into two or more surfaces of the same type but with different orientations. Consequently, branching fractures cannot always be grouped into separate fracture sets in the usual way using orientation alone. |The study was motivated by a recent acquisition of a series of subsurface cores and image logs that penetrated several thousand individual fractures that we interpreted as branching fractures linked to a series of fracture swarms (e.g., Fig. 1). We present here a proposed method to help differentiate the three-dimensional nature of the branching using only limited wellbore intersection data. The method is demonstrated on synthetic and field data sets to illustrate key patterns detected from the branch line analysis technique.|",,51
726,727,2016-420,"Deformation Properties of Saw-Cut Fractures in Barnett, Mancos and Pierre Shales","Zhi, Ye, The University of Oklahoma| Ahmad, Ghassemi, The University of Oklahoma","|Abstract: |Creating a fracture network by tensile and shear failure in rock, and keeping it conductive with proppants has been the commonly used conceptual model of designing a fracture job. The key to optimizing reservoir stimulation by shear slip is knowledge of how fracture permeability increases with slip and how the resulting unpropped conductivity evolves as the stresses (shear and normal) on the fractures change during production. Such data can then be used in numerical models that consider shear slip and time-dependent unpropped conductivity loss to help design stimulation jobs that are more effective in self-propping, and retain their conductivity, thus, maximizing its benefits of ultimately needing less proppants, additives, and less water (reduced stages and re-frac). Therefore, fracture's deformation properties such as shear strength and friction are needed. In this work, we performed laboratory experiments on several shale samples from the Barnett, Mancos and Pierre, to characterize their geomechanical properties. A multistage triaxial testing strategy was applied on saw-cut jointed shale samples to measure deformation properties, and then Mohr-Coulomb and Barton's shear strength criteria were used to determine shear strength envelope and friction properties. |Introduction |The mechanics behavior of rock is usually dominated by its discontinuities such as natural fractures, bedding planes, joints and faults, etc. As a result, fractures' deformation and failure properties are significant to engineering practices like wellbore stability and hydraulic fracturing. The natural fracture properties can be measured in two major experiments: direct shear test and triaxial shear test. Direct shear test is widely used to measure the strength and stiffness properties of rock fractures (Goodman, 1976; ASTM D5607-08, 2008), since it is easy to utilize large scale specimens at both laboratory and field site testing. However, the direct shear test has some disadvantages. For example, fractures are sheared without confinements, and the normal stress is limited by relatively low capacity of the shear apparatus, and displacement measurements are usually affected by grout deformation. The triaxial shear test can overcome some of these shortcomings as it can be conducted under confining pressure (Jaeger, 1959; Lane and Heck, 1964; Rosso, 1976; Li et al., 2012). In this test, a cylindrical specimen with an inclined fracture is subjected to a given confining pressure, and then the differential stress (<U+03C3>diff = <U+03C3>1- <U+03C3>3) is increased until slip on the weakness plane is initiated. Thus, the fractures' deformation properties under confining pressure can be estimated from stress and displacement measurements.|",,57

As a result, the characteristic geomechanical phenomena in longwall caving can be described convincingly. |We present results on the triggering of rock bursts at the longwall face, discussing related concepts in coal mining as well as pillar collapse experiments from the 1980s intended for the development of new excavation methods with yielding carnallite pillars. The hydraulic barrier is impaired by (shear and tensile) fractures reaching upward from the mine and by pressure-driven percolation downward from the lowest aquifer in the overburden. The latter process is initiated by the stress redistribution following the excavations, in particular by the lowering of the minimal principal stress due to extensional strains induced by subsidence over mining edges. Once the minimal stress falls below the groundwater pressure, hydraulic integrity is lost and percolation proceeds in the direction of the major principal stress. If the fluid reaches the fracture zone around the cavities, hydraulic pathways open up which lead to a flooding of the mine. We present coupled hydromechanical calculations which can resolve fractures and fluid percolation through the barrier strata. |Introduction |The method of longwall caving is applied mostly in coal mining where it was originally developed. In potash mining, long-wall caving is rarely used or even considered as an alternative to room-and-pillar mining. There are two main reasons: |Fracture processes in the hanging wall jeopardise the integrity of the hydraulic barrier, possibly flooding the mine. |The high stresses at the longwall face, and the associated risks of rock bursts, are hard to keep under control, in particular for brittle salt rocks such as carnallitite. |Hence, longwall caving was employed only for sylvinite, which does not prone to brittle failure, and only historically in the Alsace potash district, and presently in six Belorussian mines around Soligorsk [1]. |The main advantage of longwall caving, as compared to conventional drill-and-blast mining with pillars, is the higher extraction ration when using fully-mechanised mining. Potentially, there is an additional advantage when mining brittle salt rocks, e.g. carnallitite: The mining-induced seismic energy release is limited. Analyses of rock bursts show that the energy release is directly related to the size of the collapsed field and the number of failed pillars. In Fig. 1, we have collected magnitude, number of collapsed pillars, convergence drop and the average stress drop of failing pillars for a number of rock bursts in potash mining around the world.|",,23

J., Utrecht University","|Abstract: |Many hydrocarbons reservoirs are capped by thick layers of rocksalt, a material that creeps when a shear stress is applied to it. Pumping leads to compaction of the reservoir material but also induces shear stresses inside rocksalt. These need to relax, leading to time-dependent ground deformations and surface subsidence. To quantify creep-induced subsidence we have created simplified yet realistic Finite Element models of medium-sized rocksalt-capped reservoirs that include key aspects of the subsurface geometry and material properties layering. These show that creep-induced subsidence can be a significant proportion of the total subsidence and so rocksalt caprocks need to be carefully modeled. We discuss uncertainties relating to the low-stress creep behavior of rocksalt and show the subsidence evolution predicted by the use of different constitutive models for rocksalt creep. Another source of uncertainty is the poor characterization of the rocksalt body's physical properties spatial distribution. Here we touch upon rocksalt grain-size and chemical composition as two such major uncertainties and discuss the effects this can have on the overall subsidence response. We finish with the conclusion that engineers who are faced with the task of predicting the subsidence evolution have to resort to calculating bounds for the resultant response based on a number of possible scenaria for rocksalt body behavior. |Introduction |A large number of economically important hydrocarbons reservoirs worldwide are overlain by thick rocksalt layers. Examples include the natural gas fields in the Netherlands, the large hydrocarbons fields of Brazil (e.g. Mohriak et al., 2012), or of the Gulf of Mexico (e.g. Dribus et al., 2008), and the hydrocarbon fields of northwest China (Yu et al., 2014). Time-dependent subsidence above reservoirs (or stated in a slightly different way - subsidence that is not proportional to the volumes of extracted hydrocarbons) seems to be a widespread phenomenon (e.g. Hettema et al., 2002). The mechanisms through which time-dependent subsidence develops can be numerous, and can include reservoir inelasticity and creep, delayed compaction due to delayed pore pressure equilibration inside a reservoir system. |With previous work we have shown that for rocksalt-capped reservoirs, subsidence due to rocksalt creep can be significant (see Marketos et al., 2015). The above observation alone requires that special focus is given on modeling the rocksalt material response, especially for low-lying coastal regions where subsidence calculations need to be very accurate. With this paper we first briefly present how rocksalt flow can give rise to time-dependent subsidence and then discuss a number of uncertainties related to the rocksalt. With the aid of a Finite Element model of a rocksalt-capped reservoir we then focus on the effects of these uncertainties on subsidence calculations and propose a way forward in order to practically deal with these uncertainties.|",,10

As the confining pressures and the initial porosities of rocks control the dilatancy, a conceptual partition of different dilation zones is proposed. In order to obtain the critical confining pressure of shales at given porosity, a group of shale specimens are subjected to compression tests in the lab. Combining with the dilatancy index, a power function is used to fit the relationship between dilatancy indices calculated by experimental results and confining pressures. The dilatancy indices of shales are found to be decreased with increasing confining pressures as expected. Then a critical confining pressure beyond which the shale specimens would stop dilation is predicted by the power function. And finally some different opinions about the dilation process of rocks are also discussed. So as to get the critical curves in confining pressure verse porosity chart which is crucial in dilation prediction of shales, some more shale specimens should be carried to compression tests in the future. |Introduction |Dilatancy may be described as the change in volume associated with shear distortion of an element in the material (Vermeer and Borst, 1984). The dilation angle was first introduced to characterize the dilatant property of a granular material by Bent Hansen in 1958. |The dilatancy affects the loading-carrying capacity and the spread of the plastic zones (Cox et al., 1961; Zaadnoordijk, 1983; Vermeer and Borst. 1984). Dilatancy is a crucial factor in the stability design at shallow depths, where confinement pressure is low (Reynolds, 1985). The importance of dilatancy on earthquakes is also studied (Frank, 1965; Scholz, 1968; Zoback et al., 1975; Nur, 1975). The dilatancy influences the hydraulic behavior in rocks (Zoback and Byerlee, 1975; Zhang et al., 1994; Peach and Spiers, 1996; Zhu and Wong, 1999; Heiland and Raab, 2001; Simpson et al., 2001; Tang et al., 2002) which may be used in hydraulic fracturing in petroleum industry.

Salt domes have vertical extensions of several kilometres and are consequently well-suited for deep borehole disposal, as an alternative to a mined repository. |The isolation capacity of undisturbed salt rocks is based on the creep behaviour which tends to close any access paths. A number of natural analogues where fluids have been contained in cavities under high pressure for millions of years support this picture. For waste disposal, one has to show that the tightness of the geological barrier is not compromised by the repository excavation and the thermal loading due to the waste, and that suitable geotechnical barriers can be constructed. |We discuss the option of deep borehole disposal in rock salt. In contrast to the mined repositories which are usually considered, this option employs boreholes of several kilometres, drilled into a salt dome. The waste canisters are emplaced in the lower part of the borehole. As backfill material, we propose molten salt mixtures, similar to the ones used in solarthermal plants as heat exchange and storage fluids. The waste-generated heat will keep the salt liquid for a long time, ensuring complete containment without the possibility of ground water reaching the waste. The upper part of the filled boreholes, still inside the salt dome, converges under lithostatic pressure due to salt creep, and the top part can be sealed with asphalt, bentonite and concrete. We present some experimental results on the closure of boreholes under pressure and the properties of liquid salt to support our proposal. |Introduction |The favourable barrier properties of rock salt have long been exploited for cavern storage of gas and oil, and make it a prime candidate for as waste repository host rock. Usual concepts, both in bedded and domal salt, assume a repository mine in a salt formation in a depth of several hundred to a thousand metres where heat-generating waste can be emplaced in drifts or in boreholes below drifts. After emplacement, drifts can be backfilled, and the repository is closed using suitable shaft seal systems. Over time, salt creep will cause convergence in the mine and enclose the waste, completely isolating it from the biosphere. |Meanwhile, in the context of other host rocks such as claystone or crystalline rocks, the deep borehole disposal concept has been suggested. In this paradigm, boreholes are drilled to a depth of several kilometres, and the waste canisters are emplaced directly from the surface. Details of casing, seals etc. depend on specific concepts and host formations. In the crystalline basement, the waste will be presumably be in contact to ground water, however, due to the large depth and hydrogeological factors, the waste can be effectively decoupled from the biosphere. Technically, this approach can be much simpler than a mined repository. |Here we propose to combine the advantages of these concepts: Salt domes can have thicknesses of several kilometres, and can correspondingly accommodate deep boreholes. In large depth, convergence is much faster, and waste can be completely contained rather quickly, without any groundwater access. A novel backfill material – eutectic molten salt mixtures – can further enhance this idea, offering immediate complete containment of the waste as well as retrievability.|",,14

In general, fracture characteristic such as length, height growth, extent and conductivity, which in turn contributes to the overall complexity of the resulting fracture network, are controlled by a combination of operational parameters and local geology/subsurface conditions. The operational parameters include well spacing, well orientation, number of stages, number of clusters, treatment rates, and fluid characteristics among others. These parameters are optimized to maximize hydrocarbon recovery and Conductive Reservoir Volume (CRV) and in the meantime fractures are contained within the target zones and subsurface integrity is maintained. This optimization, however, needs to be evaluated within the context of local geology and subsurface conditions. For example, presence of natural fracture swarms, mega fractures (or faults), and stress anisotropy can present hydraulic fracture design challenges that need to be carefully addressed by advanced geomechanical analysis. |In this paper, a 3D hydraulic fracture propagation code is utilized to quantify the impact of operational parameters and subsurface conditions on the resulting hydraulic fracture growth/containment and engineering design considerations. Extensive sensitivity analysis investigates the effect of each operational parameters and subsurface conditions. Examined effects include vertical stress contrast, fracturing fluid properties, completion design, mechanical interactions between multiple stages and/or neighboring wells, and interactions between natural fracture and hydraulic fracture. |The model results show that the hydraulic fracture growth, containment (vertical or horizontal containment) and the resulting quality of the CRV is primarily a function of the in-situ stress profile, stimulation design parameters (simultaneous or sequential injection, zipper fracturing), well architecture (number and spacing of stages/clusters, well spacing and location), and the reactivation of pre-existing natural fractures. Results show that, if not designed properly or contained, fractures can grow in and out of zones, intersect with the pre-existing fracture networks, interact with existing hydraulic fractures, and interfere with existing wells and thus significantly impacting resulting CRV. |Introduction |Advanced technologies, such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, are developed and widely used to increase hydrocarbon extraction from low-permeability formations.

The present laboratories are developed primarily in Precambrian-age amphibolite host rock, but Tertiary-age rhyolite intrusives are also present. A portion of the pillar in the vicinity of the new physics laboratories on the 4850 level (1.5 km below the surface) was chosen for examination using seismic tomography to evaluate the degree and location of potential pillar degradation. Geophones and sources were placed on opposite sides of a pillar formed by the intersection of two drifts, and an acoustic wave was passed between them to produce multiple paths along which the P-wave velocities were calculated. The resulting tomographic velocity map of the pillar adjacent to the intersection shows a well-developed pattern of decreasing velocities toward the acute end of the triangle due to a decreasing pillar cross-section. Higher seismic velocities are associated with areas where the stresses are greater but where the rock has not failed, such as adjacent to well-maintained drifts. |Introduction |The Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) is being developed as an underground scientific laboratory in a former gold mine in northwestern South Dakota, USA (Heise, 2015; Lesko et al., 2011). The underground workings are extensive and have a history that extends over 125 years. The facility is a host for a number of existing and planned physics experiments that require shielding from cosmic radiation along with a lesser number of geological, geomechanical, and biological experiments. Although it is still indeterminate, a design life of 30 years is not unreasonable for this type of facility. Given the age of much of the underground infrastructure and the expected long operational life of the facilities, it is important to have monitoring programs that can assess the condition of rock making up the underground infrastructure. Such programs will allow evaluation of the necessity for mitigation of degradation of rock conditions. The purpose of the present study was to image the conditions of the rock in a pillar at the 4850 Level of the facility (1.5 km below the surface) near a critical part of the underground infrastructure. |The geology of the mine and of the rocks that constitute SURF was studied extensively during the 125 years when it was an active gold mine. Caddy, et al., 1991, and Bachman and Caddy, 1990, provide the most recent summary of the geologic environment in terms of the overall geology.

Generally, pore pressure generation is understood mostly from a mechanical properties perspective i.e. compaction. The exponents of the resulting compaction models range from 1.2 to 5. However, the piece of the petroleum system, which is given less attention, is the thermodynamics of such system i.e. heat flux through the formation and formation thermal Conductivity. The reason may be due to the inability to identify the subtle changes in thermodynamic properties of formation material and how they influence subsurface pressures. Furthermore, thermal seals and storage of thermal energy is rarely addressed. In this regard most researchers take the abnormally “pressured” zone to be composed of one interconnected zone that requires finding the “top” of such zone or measure the pressure only at one point in this zone. This paper show that Thermodynamic phenomenon can coexist or even dominate Compaction effects, portraying evidence of multiple source of overpressure within an abnormally pressured region. The thermodynamic properties (heat flux and thermal Conductivity) the authors also show can indicate maturity of hydrocarbon and location of the oil and gas reservoir depth. |Introduction |We have examined the work of various authors as it relates to pore pressure and fracture gradient. The Predrill estimation of pore pressure and fracture gradient analysis is the bedrock of well-planning processes. Optimal pore pressure and fracture gradient estimates rely on the accuracy of overburden gradient calculations, which signifies the characteristics of a given basin. If overburden or vertical stress gradient calculations are off, then pore pressure and fracture gradient estimates may be grossly underestimated or overestimated, both of which can result in severe wellbore instability and/or well control issues. |To introduce a system of pore pressure calculations for oilfield, Eaton, B. A., 1975 developed a modified model for pore pressure and fracture gradient for US Gulf Coast. Eaton built on previous works of Hubbert and Hubbert et al., 1959, Hottmann and Johnson, 1965, Matthews and Kelly, 1967, Timko and Fertl, 1971, Barker, 1972. Additionally, Eaton introduced the concept of how overburden gradient, Poisson's ratio, and petrophysical properties of formations vary with depth. Eaton then incorporated several parameters in an equation to determine formation pore pressure and fracture gradient. The above authors have built on the overburden compaction theory developed by Terzaghi and Peck, 1948. Subsequently, they defined the effective stress of a system as the difference between the total overburden of overlying sediments and the pressure of fluids occupying the pores of rock material. Later the oil and gas industry defined the “normal” pressure as the Salt water gradient or 0.465 psi/ft for the Gulf of Mexico and any pressure in excess of normal gradient as “abnormal” pore pressure. With that said, it is also worth mentioning that pore pressure and fracture gradient cannot simply exist by themselves. The authors put forth this argument because different mechanisms govern the behavior of pore pressure and fracture gradient from basin to basin. Furthermore, Terzaghi's approach to the compaction-dominated system does not need to take into account the effect of “high” Temperature and Thermal Conductivity of rock material but it would have been appropriate to have included the cold and low temperatures. This is because unusual pressures are often seen to affect the freez-thaw cycles which in turn afect the shape of pores and in places such as Alska affects certan surface pressures. For example, the contribution of temperature or geochemical reactions to the effective stress gradient is not represented in neither Terzaghi's equation nor the publications by the above mentioned authors. This could be due to the fact that (perhaps) the Civil Engineering works is limited to rocks and soils buried in shallow depths. However, other than Bower, 1994, the above authors expanded further on Terzaghi's “compaction” theory work by incorporating different mechanical parameters of the basin system that affects pore pressure and fracture gradient; nonethe less they do not include in their models the Temperature and Thermal properties of rock.|",,30

N., Baker Hughes","|Abstract: |Rock behavior frequently does not fit the classical theory of continuum mechanics because of rock heterogeneous structure. Particularly, rock failure may be accompanied by zonal disintegration formation. |The key to building the non-classic model of rock failure is the structure with grain boundaries. Deformations of solid bodies with microscopic flaws can be described within the scope of non-Euclidean geometry, and non-trivial deformation incompatibility can be referred to as a fracture parameter. |The new continuum model presented in this paper enables prediction of the fractured zones initializing and developing as a periodic structure. The non–Euclidean description of phenomenon initiates an appearance of two unusual material constants that can be called ‘non-classic’ moduli. The coupled model must comprise the fourth–order parabolic equation on disintegration thermodynamic parameter to be solved with the classical hyperbolic system of equations for the dynamics of continuous media. |In the classic approach to the rock cutting problem, the fracture is caused by critical shear stresses when failure criterion based on Tresca (or more general Mohr) theory is applied. In this case it is hard to predict the chip size and optimal depth of cut because the criterion is beyond the model. |In this paper, the developed theory of zonal disintegration is applied to analysis of rock cutting by PDC cutter process. It is shown that initial shear stress at the cutter tip causes the disintegration (destruction) developing deep into the medium with contouring of the rock failure scale; and along the cutting direction with the forming of rock failure scale as well. |Introduction |The difficulties of mathematical description of the rock cutting process, as it is emphasized in Cherepanov [2], arise from the elongated plastic zones around the cutting edge of a cutter and the interaction of multiple fractures generated from cutting. Cutting the rock formation with an apparent shear plane typically occurs under the brittle mode with cuttings formed as rock particles. The size of the rock particles is characteristic for the cutting process. The main experimental results of the cutting process are well studied (e.g. see Borisov [3],[4]) and are typically reduced to describing the key patterns of the transitional process leading to the steady mode, as well as to characteristic features of the steady mode. On the other hand, the steady cutting mode is characterized with the measureable force of resistance to cutting, including cases when it is a function of the linear velocity of the cutter (Cherepanov [2]). Any theoretical model of the rock cutting process under the brittle fracturing mode proposed must confirm the experimental results. Adding new characteristic features of the cutting process does not bring more clarity to the physics of this phenomenon. The main problem of the rock cutting process may be reduced to finding the characteristic scale of formation fracturing under the conditions of a load applied to the cutter (weight on bit and torque on bit), taking into account the features of the stressed state of the formation in the vicinity of the cutter tip. Another issue that must be clarified in order to optimize the drilling process is an optimal cutting depth at a given cutter velocity. The presented study is an attempt to answer these two questions.|",,52

N., Hokkaido University| Kawasaki, S., Hokkaido University","|Abstract: |Biogrouting is a new soil improvement methos based on biological processes. Calcium phosphate compounds (CPCs) are commonly used as biogrouting materials. Their solubility of CPC is pH-dependent, with optimal values for extraction at approximately pH 8. Urea hydrolysis is a well- known biological catalyst. It can be induced by urease and releases hydrolysis ions, which can then increase pH. In this study, CPCs and urea hydrolysis were utilized to solidify sand. The urea hydrolysis can be used as a pH regulator for CPCs. Furthermore, urease is ectracted from Momordica charantia seeds. To test this process, the unconfined compressive strength (UCS) of sand samples was measured. The UCS and pH of the sand samples containing a CPC solution, urea, and Momordica charantia seed extract were found to increase. In the sand samples with CPCs and urea hydrolysis, pH was increased by approximately 1.5 and UCS was increased to twice that found in sand samples containing only the CPC solution.This study suggest that CPCs and urea hydrolysis together have the potential to increase the strength of sand materials. |Introduction |Chemical injection of grouting material is an important method of improving soil strength. Water glass and cement are examples of widely used materials for grouting that use chemical reactions for solidification. In contrast, in recent years, biogrout(Paassen et al. 2010; Whiffin et al. 2007) has been introduced, which uses biological reactions for solidification. This process of ground improvement by biological reaction is termed “biogrouting”. Urea hydrolysis has been extensively studied as a biological reaction for biogrouting and as follows: |(equation) |Calcium phosphate compound (CPC), derived from bones and teeth, are also used as a biogrouting material(Kawasaki and Akiyama 2013; Akiyama and Kawasaki 2012) and are more environmentally friendly than other chemically based materials. CPC also have some unique features, including self-solidification and solubility that depends on its pH. Figure 1 shows that CPC precipitation occurs mostly at around pH 8. The basic principle of improving soil strength using CPC as a biogrouting material is that CPC precipitate between particles of sand at a pH of approximately 8, which can be increased using a biological reaction. In our study, CPC is used as a biogrouting material together with a plant-derived urease as a pH regulator. Plant-derived urease is safer, can be obtained from commercial food waste and is cheap.|",,21

Experimental analyses of coal mass concreted with cement in size of 300<U+00D7>300<U+00D7>280mm were conducted using triaxial test system. The effects of in-situ stress, tensile strength, natural macro-cracks on cracks formation and propagation were discussed in the process of hydraulic fracture; further surface morphology of fractured coal mass was analyzed by using laser 3D scanning system after hydraulic fracturing. The experimental results indicated that the natural fracture inclining does not have any effect on the fracture extension when the natural fracture strike parallel to the minimum principal stress direction. Many cracks in coal mass are formed in the direction of perpendicular to the bedding. In addition, 3D scanning results indicated that the surface morphology of fractured coal mass is much rougher than that of peripheral concrete, and the roughness of coal mass in the direction of vertical to the bedding plane is higher than that of parallel to the bedding plane. The rougher the fractured surface is, the more consumed energy is. It can be deduced that the fracture development in rock is easier than that in coal. |Introduction |The permeability of coalbed methane reservoir is generally low. As one of the main approaches to improve permeability in reservoirs, hydraulic fracturing has played an important role in enhancing permeability of the reservoirs and gas production (Cipolla et al., 2009; Chen, 2013; Hou et al., 2013). Numerous theoretical investigations and experiments (Blanton, 1982; Chen et al., 2000; Teufel and Clark, 1984; Zhou and Xue, 2011) indicates that geological parameters, such as in-situ stresses, fracture orientation and rock anisotropy property etc., have a significant influence on the propagation of hydraulic fracture. In the process of hydraulic fracturing propagation encountering with the natural fractures, there are two probable behaviors (Cheng et al., 2014): penetrating the natural fracture or not. In addition, when the fracture extension encountered with weakness plane, the small closed weakness cracks won't change the fracture extend trend (Daneshy, 1974), but the fracture extension direction will appear deflection due to the presence of large open crack. Zhou (2007) revealed that the differential stress in horizontal and the approaching angle were the macro-parameters affecting the hydraulic fracture propagation in normal stress state. Jia (2013) found that the hydraulic fractures propagate not always along the natural cracks, but along the maximum principal stress direction. However, few of them had taken natural large open crack specimen but artificial crack into test.|",,25

V., Universite Grenoble Alpes| Guglielmi, Y., Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory| Castilla, R., Total, Jean Feger Scientific and Technical Center| Gout, C., Total, Jean Feger Scientific and Technical Center","|Abstract |Fluid propagation inside a fracture crossing another one is investigated. A fully hydro-mechanical coupled numerical model has been used to simulate different three-dimensional configurations. These configurations provide insight on how the crossed fracture is mechanically or hydraulically activated depending on well-defined parameters. It has been shown that the natural fracture can be either activated hydraulically without any shear displacement or mechanically activated while not loaded hydraulically. These configurations are controlled at a first order level by the combination of the in-situ differential stress state and the crossed fracture orientation. |Introduction |If pressurized fluid can play a major role in the shear reactivation of faults zone, fluid can also propagate without triggering any significant sliding response (Rutqvist et al., 2013). Micro-seismic activities are often recorded while loading hydraulically a fracture network (Van der Baan et al., 2013). However, aseismic response can also be observed. In this case, it is still not clear if several micro-seismic events occur but too small to be recorded or if some configurations can promote a pure hydraulic reactivation process without any induced seismicity. |Different models for simulating the fluid propagation inside a fracture network have been developed (Damjanac & Cundall, 2016;Yaghoubi & Zoback, 2012 for examples). However, it seems that a systematic analysis to understand the hydromechanical (HM) response of a hydraulically loaded fracture has not been achieved yet. As the fluid propagates inside a fracture network, it might cross another fracture without change of direction or it might be deviated in a new one depending upon both the HM properties of the different fractures and the in-situ stress field acting on the fracture. For example, in the case of a fluid driven fracture, the intersected fracture is under the influence of the effective stress field variation before fluid eventually invades the intersected fracture (Ching, 1997). Such stress transfer effect can greatly affect the HM behavior of the crossed fracture. It can drive the fluid in a preferential direction or completely close the fracture, inhibiting the fluid invasion and favoring the fluid to cross this heterogeneity. Or, it can also favor slip under shear stress, and depending on the dilation amplitude, trap or not the propagating fluid with an associated shear displacement. Thus, the fluid propagation through the fracture network will depend on in situ stress, rock and fracture properties but also on the fluid properties and pressure. Extensive theoretical and experimental studies are still carried out for developing a rule governing this type interaction (Rahman, 2009; Fu et al., 2013; Khoei et al., 2015; Grasselli, et al., 2015, for examples) but new fully HM coupled simulations are still useful to understand the interaction processes.|",,39
738,739,2016-457,Wellbore Geomechanics of Extended Drilling Margins and Engineered Lost Circulation Solutions,"Mehrabian, A., Halliburton| Abousleiman, Y. N., University of Oklahoma","|Abstract: |Wellbore tensile failure is a known consequence of drilling with excessive mud weight, which can cause costly events of lost circulation. Despite the successful use of lost circulation materials (LCM) in treating lost circulation events of the drilling operations, extensions of wellbore stability models to the case of a fractured and LCM-treated wellbore have not been published. This paper presents an extension to the conventional stability analysis of a wellbore to such circumstances. The proposed wellbore geomechanics solution redefines the extended Equivalent Circulation Density (ECD) criteria and margin for re-breakdown of a fractured and, if the case, LCM-treated wellbore. An analytical approach is taken to solve for the related multiscale and nonlinear problem of three-way mechanical interaction between the wellbore, fracture wings, and LCM aggregate. The criteria for unstable propagation of existing near-wellbore fractures, together with those for initiating secondary fractures from the wellbore, are obtained. Results suggest that, in many circumstances, the occurrence of both incidents can be prevented, provided that the LCM blend is properly engineered to recover certain depositional and mechanical properties at downhole conditions. Under such optimal design conditions, the maximum ECD to which the (re-)breakdown limit of a permeable wellbore could be enhanced is predicted. |Introduction |The mud pressure that causes tensile failure of the rock surrounding a wellbore is known as the wellbore tensile limit. Alternatively, wellbore lost circulation limit is defined as the mud pressure causing lost circulation from a (fractured) wellbore. Although the two are often considered identical in the conventional practice of wellbore stability analysis, the lost circulation limit of a wellbore can be greater than its tensile limit (Fjaer et al. 2008). The resulting extension in equivalent circulation density (ECD) margins of drilling operation, simply known as drilling margins in the industry, can be large enough to find practical significance in drilling through the so-called narrow-margin zones or depleted sand. |Early field evidence (Fuh et al., 1992) and laboratory experiments on fracturing large size rock samples (Onyia et al., 1994) revealed that the initial tensile limit of a borehole is independent of the specific type or formulation of the drilling mud. Conversely, the re-breakdown pressure of an already fractured borehole was observed to depend on the mud type and composition. The term wellbore strengthening generally refers to the practice of enhancing the lost circulation limit of a wellbore through the proper design of the drilling mud formulation. Particulate-based mud additives known as lost circulation materials (LCM) have been commonly used for this purpose (Morita et al., 1990; Onyia, 1994; Dudley et al., 2000).|",,10

The overall strength of layered rocks is useful for predicting their stability or failure under production conditions, which may contribute to vertical height containment of hydraulic fractures in an unconventional reservoir. In this work, triaxial experimental testing of reservoir-analog materials and three-dimensional Particle Flow Code (PFC3D) simulations were used to evaluate the contributions of layer properties, such as number, thickness, and sequence, on the average strength of a layered reservoir. |The laboratory and PFC simulation results show that the stiffness and strength of a layered sequence are not affected by factors such as bedding plane strength, the number of layers, or layer thickness. However its stiffness and strength can be related to the relative proportions of stiff and soft layers. The stiffness of the layered sequences obtained from the experiments and PFC models are closely predicted by a calculated harmonic average stiffness of the sequence. The stiffness-strength relation obtained from the reservoir-analog materials has a similar form to those in the literature that were obtained from natural rock types, supporting the utility of PFC models of layered sequences. These results support the use of harmonic average and PFC simulations in estimating elastic stiffness and strength in layered and unconventional reservoir sequences. |Introduction |Oil and gas production from unconventional reservoirs generally requires hydraulic fracturing within a layered reservoir, which is usually stratified with layers of different mechanical properties. For instance, Eagle Ford shale is a well laminated reservoir with alternating stiff carbonate rich layers and soft clay rich layers [1]. In order to produce hydrocarbon from unconventional reservoirs more efficiently and economically, a better understanding of hydraulic fracture propagation in layered reservoirs is needed. Among all the issues, vertical height growth of hydraulic fractures is recognized as one of the critical factors to the success of hydraulic fracturing treatments [2, 3]. If the expected hydraulic height growth is not achieved, a large area of payzone will not be stimulated which affects the production. In contrast, if hydraulic fractures grow into the adjacent rock layers which are not productive, an excessive amount of injection fluid and proppants will be wasted [4].|",,22

The uniaxial compression strength (UCS), as one of the most important mechanical properties of rock, is used to evaluate its load capacity during petroleum exploration. In this study, the Hoek-Brown criterion is introduced to evaluate the UCS of rocks in order to eliminate the influence of confining pressure on the mechanical properties of rock. Through the X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis the mineral compositions are obtained, thereby to establish the relationship between the mineralogy and the estimated UCSs through regression analysis. Based on that, a piecewise linear relationship is obtained between the dolomite contents and the rock mechanical properties. This phenomenon is further verified with the DEM (discrete element method) simulations, and the piecewise linear relationship between the mineral compositions and the rock mechanical properties is applicable for general rocks. |Introduction |In the sedimentary rocks, the compressive strength and elastic modulus of rocks increase with the high strength mineral compositions like quartz (Chang et al., 2006, Nicksiar and Martin, 2013). The contents, structures and properties of the minerals have the important influences on the physical and mechanical properties of rocks (Fj<U+00E6>r et al., 2008). To determine the reservoirs mechanical properties, the conventional method is to test the rock samples from the stratum. The rock mechanic tests need core samples of ISRM requirements. The standard cores cannot always be extracted from weak, highly fractured, thinly bedded, foliated and/or block-in-matrix rocks. However, the mineral compositions can be obtained easily through the X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. For this reason, studying the correlations between mineral compositions and rock mechanical properties become attractive. |Rock, as a complex material, is an aggregate of mineral compositions. The mechanical properties of rocks are influenced by many factors. Fj<U+00E6>r et al., 2008 proposed that, as a generalized elastic material, the elastic properties of rocks depend primarily on the following three factors: |the relative amount of each component present; |the elastic properties of each component; |the geometrical distribution of each component. |",,40
741,742,2016-466,Stability of Borehole with Breakouts – An Experimental and Numerical Modelling Study,"Wu, B., CSIRO Energy| Chen, Z., CSIRO Energy| Zhang, X., CSIRO Energy","|Abstract: |This paper presents a preliminary experimental and numerical modeling study on stability of boreholes with preexisting breakouts. A set of borehole and breakout stability experiments were carried out using a polyaxial cell on weak sandstone samples. The tests were performed by increasing the outer boundary stresses at a given stress ratio until sufficient failure was induced. The samples were then unloaded and the failed material removed manually to form breakouts. The samples with the new hole geometry were then re-tested along the same stress path with further failure monitored. It was observed that the failure started from the breakout tips. The failure initiation stress was slightly less that on the circular borehole and significantly less than the applied maximum stress in the borehole stability experiments. The breakout did not widen until the external load was close to the applied maximum level. The experiments were simulated numerically using an elasto-plastic damage constitutive model. It has been observed that the numerical simulation was able to qualitatively re-produce some of the experimental observations. |Introduction |Wellbore instability is a significant contributor to nonproductive time and a major cause of equipment lost in hole during drilling (Wu and Tan, 2011). Industry approach to overcome the problem is to select a compatible drilling fluid for the rock formations to be drilled (van Oort, 2003) and an optimal drilling fluid density that prevents significant wellbore instability and drilling fluid loss (Zoback, 2010). Well trajectory could also be optimized based on wellbore stability considerations if permitted by the local geological conditions and production requirement. Furthermore, drilling fluid temperature may be conditioned to effect the near wellbore stress condition to prevent wellbore failure or mud loss (Maury and Guenot, 1995). |Majority research on wellbore stability has focused on initial stability of a circular borehole by comparing borehole stress with formation rock strength, and once the former is greater than the latter for a certain portion of borehole circumference, borehole failure is assumed. Such an approach does not consider progressive borehole failure. It is well known that wellbore and/or reservoir stress condition can change during drilling and production. It is important to understand how the borehole that already suffered rock failure and breakouts would response to the changed wellbore and reservoir stress conditions, and whether the breakouts would remain stable or enlarged further resulting in large cavings and borehole collapse.|",,9

Each time fracturing occurred, we calculated the seismic moment tensor from the obtained displacement field and newly fractured area. Then, using this information, we modeled intensity, location, number of the events, and time of MEQs. We simulated various scenarios, taking single phase flow (i.e., water) in order to remove complex responses from multiphase flow. We first studied a synthetic reservoir having one single shale layer with two strong bounding layers and a horizontal well. The simulated MEQs reflected the propagation of the hydraulic fracture, where the magnitudes of most MEQs were between -1 and -3. Then, we simulated a vertical well in the more realistic geological model of the Arch Forth-Worth Basin, where the Barnett shale is located. We studied two scenarios: one in which the fluid was injected into the Lower Barnett shale and it only fractured into the injected layer, and one in which there was fluid migration from the injection point into the Upper Barnett Shale. The magnitudes of MEQ for these two scenarios were similar and mostly between -0.75 and 0.75 in strength. For all cases, the event locations of MEQs corresponded to the fracture propagation. Thus, the forward simulation of microearthquakes can be a useful to detect propagation of hydraulic fractures and stimulated reservoir volume. Additionally, we showed that under some reservoir conditions it is possible for fluid to fracture layers above the injection point without fracturing the targeted layer. |Introduction |Hydraulic fracturing has revolutionized the energy industry for the last decade. This process entails pumping large amounts of sand and water down a well, where the increase in pressure creates a network of fractures that allow petroleum engineers to access trapped hydrocarbons. The operation is poorly understood, so the development of successful hydraulic fracturing methods has been too often a trial and error process. This poses monetary and environmental risks, and a general sense of mistrust towards the oil and gas industry. However, the basics of hydraulic fracturing dictates that a large planar fracture is created in a direction perpendicular to the minimum horizontal stress. In addition to this, a significant number of shear failures (micro-earthquakes) are generated in the surrounding intact reservoir rock [1]. Furthermore, depending on the reservoir on which it is performed, hydraulic fracturing can cause fault reactivation and shear slip of existing natural fractures [2, 3]. |The simultaneous combination of these phenomena makes the physics of the problem a difficult subject to study. Nevertheless, because the failure induced by perturbation of fluid pressure implies strong interaction between flow and geomechanics [4], we employed a coupled simulator to accurately predict and assess any risk derived from hydraulic fracturing a vertical well.|",,14

It involves two steps: 1) an estimate of the stress components is given for integration point of the discretization, and 2) global equilibrium is verified and re-balancing nodal forces are applied if needed. While the second step is a closed procedure based only on statics, the estimate of the in-situ stress field can be done in different ways in order to incorporate all the information available of the rock mass. In this paper, more traditional approaches are discussed and a new procedure based on the Airy stress function is described, in order to generate a stress state proposal at each Gauss point of the domain. Finally, the performance of different approaches is illustrated with a reservoir example. |Introduction |A rock mass or any geological material that is located at a certain depth is subjected to an in-situ stress field. This stress field is the result not only of the geometry and weight of the geologic structure but also of a non-trivial geologic history. This history may include complex phenomena such as deposition, compaction, erosion or tectonic events. |Gravitational stresses are induced by the weight of the overburden, and often the vertical (or z) axis is a principal stress direction, while the other two principal stresses are contained in the horizontal plane (xy). Tectonic stresses may be the result of the tectonic movements at local or regional scale. The residual stresses are produced by strain energy locked-in in the rock from previous processes such as burial, lithification, denudation, heating and cooling. According to Friedman, 1972 a fraction of these residual stresses persist even after the rock is freed from boundary loads. When the in-situ stresses at a site are measured using any of the techniques available, the stress measure obtained includes the contributions from all those origins combined.|",,36

In order to assess the risk of failure, we varied the values of bottom-hole pressure, permeability multipliers for our permeability step function, and the cohesion values between the well casing and the surrounding cement to represent different quality levels of the cementing operation. Additionally, we studied shear failure for a homogeneous and a heterogeneous three shale layer reservoir. From numerical results, higher bottom-hole pressures increased the fracture propagation speed because it implied higher geomechanical loading. Furthermore, a higher permeability multiplier leads to a larger failed zone because higher permeabilities pressurize the failed zone faster. Also, simulations showed that there is very little fracturing when the cement is of high quality. On the other hand, incomplete cementing and/or weak cement can cause significant shear failure and the evolution of long fractures along the vertical well, where they become a factor for potential contamination of aquifers. Moreover, simulations of heterogeneous shale reservoir showed how mechanical properties of the reservoir rock can help resist shear failure of the wellbore. Finally, a coupling strength sensitivity analysis of the steel-cement interface layer demonstrated that higher coupling strengths induce shear failure. Thus, high-quality cement, complete cementing, strong formation rock properties along the vertical well, and low poromechanical effects between fluid and geomechanics appears to be the strongest protection against shear failure of the wellbore cement and contamination hazards to water aquifers during hydraulic fracturing. |Introduction |The combination of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing can extract enormous quantities of natural gas from previously thought uneconomic reservoirs [1], making shale gas production an important energy resource of the future [2, 3]. However, the extreme low permeability of the shale gas reservoirs requires hydraulic fracturing to enhance productivity [4, 5]. At the same time, environmental impacts induced by hydraulic fracturing have been raised, for example, contamination of ground water, unstable growth of hydraulic fractures, seismic risks, reactivation of existing faults, and soil contamination due to proppant chemicals [6]. The potential environmental impacts have had a negative influence on public opinion, which is curbing and even halting the American shale gas revolution in its tracks. |Dusseault et al. (2001) [7] studied compaction-induced shear failure of vertical wells by fluid production. Shear failure is one of the typical mechanisms of well instability. Incomplete cementing between the well and reservoir formations is considered one of the highest environmental risks of ground water contamination, as well as a catalyst for wellbore failure [6, 8]. Pressurization at the bottom of the well causes high shear stress along the vertical well and can result in shear slip at the contacting area between the well casing and the cemented zone if the contacting area is poorly cemented. Cracks from shear failure along the well can be a potential pathway connecting deep shale gas reservoirs to shallow aquifers with higher permeability.|",,46

We employ the finite element methods for geomechanics and electrical/EM modeling, while the finite volume method is used for flow modeling. After converting flow-geomechanics models to conductivity models via a rock physics relationship, we show that anomalous distribution of electrical conductivity is directly related to injected water saturation, implying that EM responses are directly sensitive to hydraulically-active fractured zones. In our modeling experiments, we inject saline water that has high concentration of NaCl, to enhance EM signals associated with the hydraulically-active fractured zones. By using a steel-cased injection well though which surface electrical sources directly charge saline-water-saturated fracture zones, we demonstrate that surface electrical/EM methods can identify the difference in the electric fields between with and without the hydraulic fracture. Thus, this measurable difference implies that the electrical and EM methods can be an important complementary tool to detect and image propagation of a large hydraulic fracture. |Introduction |Micro-earthquake (MEQ) monitoring has mainly been studied for imaging fractures and fluids [1, 2]. MEQ provides general information about locations of fracturing events. However, the mapping highly depends on initial velocity models which we do not know well, leaving uncertainties in the amount of correlation with the areas that are hydraulically active [3]. The magnitudes of MEQ are often too small to be reliably recorded in practice. More importantly, MEQ monitoring does not accurately indicate if the fluid pathways remain open after the injection stops. Electrical/electromagnetic (EM) geophysical methods have a potential to complement MEQ because they are be sensitive to fluids in pores and fractures, and have potential to provide independent information about fluid flow associated with hydraulic fracturing. |In this study, we investigate detectability of electrical/EM methods for fracture propagation induced by water-based hydraulic fracturing (HF). The goal of this study is to evaluate EM geophysical methods for detecting hydraulically-active fractured zones in HF operations. For the goal, we use the 3D finite element method (FEM) for geomechanics, taking linear elastic fracture mechanics, while the 3D finite volume method (FVM) is used for flow [4]. We also employ 3D FEM for DC and diffusive EM modeling [5], which can accurately and economically handle irregular fractured zones not conforming to rectangular Cartesian grids.

Rebound hardness and scratch tests have been employed to overcome unique sampling challenges concerning shale lithology. Both approaches estimate UCS values in shale formations where sampling is impossible. In addition, this study develops a new approach to estimate UCS of shale referred herein as the “Drill Test”. Comparison and discussion between the three alternative tests and the traditional UCS test are presented. UCS estimations of the three alternative methods showed a range of UCS values from 1933–39,299 psi, whereas uniaxial compressive tests using plugs varied from 1328–58,280 psi. Overall, the four methods showed fairly good agreement. However, the current empirical calibration equations were developed from UCS data less than 40,000 psi, but the real range of strength was up to 58,000 psi. Therefore, equations should be updated with additional samples greater than 40,000 psi UCS to represent the wider range of rock strength from this Barnett core. |Background |Uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) has widely been applied in rock engineering as a design index of rock structures, since it is one of the fundamental rock mechanical properties. In general, NX-size (2.16 inches in diameter) plugs have traditionally been used to determine UCS values of hard rocks in geological and mining engineering. UCS is also important for petroleum engineering regarding drilling, drill bit designs, wellbore stability, sanding prediction, perforation tunnels, well completions, and frac designs. The oil and gas industry, however, primarily uses smaller-diameter (1 inch) plugs due to limited core resources. Further, unconventional reservoir formations have more restrictions in preparing standardized rock specimens based on horizontal discontinuities along bedding planes such as laminations [1-2]. Therefore, other alternative methods have been developed to overcome the restrictions and estimate formation strength. This study conducted four different laboratory experiments to determine or estimate horizontal UCS values of a Barnett shale core. They are scratch [3-29], drill [30-38], rebound hardness [39-44], and uniaxial compressive tests. The first three methods are indirect estimations of UCS, and thus, they converted each test result to the corresponding UCS value using empirical calibration equations.

Oil companies have continually worked to develop technology to maximize performance and reduce the cost per barrel of crude produced, lately with the optimized performance of horizontal wells. Horizontal wells allow for more resources to be produced per well; however, they are more expensive since the horizontal section substantially increases length and drilling time. In drilling, now more than ever, optimization of the drilling parameters needs improvement to assist these companies in reducing the drilling time which can potentially save millions of dollars. Numerous individuals have analyzed theoretical rate of penetration (ROP) equations by finding the optimum value for constant drilling parameters for single bit runs, however, since the formation drilling variables change throughout the drilling process, so should the drilling controllable variables. Therefore, the idea of constant drilling parameters potentially results in wasted time and dollars for operators, which could be vastly improved through use of dynamic variables. This leads to a new research approach, one that attempts to optimize drilling parameters through the use of a swarm algorithm with the goal to reduce the drilling time through measurable improvement in rate of penetration, and therefore, reduced total drilling time. In the work presented herein a particle swarm optimization technique (PSO) has been incorporated to find the optimum combination of the drilling parameters, weight on bit (WOB) and revolutions per minute (RPM) for every foot of formation to be drilled. The integration of this new swarm algorithm into the optimization process allows for ROP equations to dynamically change, which can better adjust to the formation environmental variations throughout the drilling process. The results of this new area of research could change the way future horizontal wells are planned. Implementation of this algorithm can be applied in a multitude of ways; incorporating it as an artificial intelligence module in an existing drilling optimization simulator program, and/or directly integrated in the planning process by the drilling engineers to optimize drilling parameters for future planned wells. |Introduction |Drilling Overview |Oil well drilling is a complex procedure and in order to optimize it, the physical phenomenon must be modeled as represented by the primary governing equation (Kerkar et al., 2014). Before the early 1980s, most oil wells were mainly drilled vertically (Helms, 2008). These vertical wells were influenced by many physical control variables including: weight on bit (WOB), revolutions per minute of the bit (RPM), drilling fluid type, drilling fluid viscosity, bit type, bit wear, etc. For drill bits, there are many sub segments of this area, however, most all of them can be classified into three categories: Natural Diamond Bits (NDB), Polycrystalline Diamond Compact Bits (PDC) and roller cone bits. NDB's are bits that have natural diamonds that are set along the surface of the bit face and grind the rock. PDC bits have polycrystalline diamond cutters set in the blades at the bit face and scrape or shear the rock. Roller cone bits are bits that have cones that roll along the rock face which crushes and gouges the rock as the bit teeth crush and penetrate into the rock. In this research, PDC bits will be incorporated since they are the most common.|",,22

We employ the total Lagrangian method (TL) for coupled flow and geomechanics, which does not need to update the coordinate system each time step. The use of the deformation gradient as well as the first and second Piola stresses reflects the change of reservoir configuration, being mathematically equivalent to the updated Lagrangian method. To accurately model full-tensor permeability derived from the Piola transformation in permeability, we use the multi-point flux approximation (MPFA). The total Lagrangian method with MPFA can provide high accurate and rigorous modeling. We thus consider the total Lagrangian method with MPFA as the reference method in this study. Then, we compare it with two other methods: Total Lagrangian method with the two-point flux approximation (TPFA) and infinitesimal transformation assumption with TPFA. From numerical simulation, we find differences between the reference method and the other two methods. Displacement based on the assumption of the infinitesimal transformation is different from that of the total Lagrangian method. Also, we find that volumetric strain and pressure of TL-MPFA are different from those of TL-TPFA. As the anisotropy ratio of permeability increases, the errors between MPFA and TPFA increases. |Introduction |Small deformation (i.e., infinitesimal transformation) is typically assumed in reservoir geomechanics [1, 2, 3, 4]. This assumption is usually valid in reservoir engineering problems associated with rock, which induce small deformation. However, the assumption might be invalid in largely deformable reservoirs, such as oceanic gas hydrate deposits and fractured/crashed salt domes [5, 6]. Anisotropic reservoirs are profoundly sensitive to substantial changes in reservoir configuration, having full-tensor permeability and elastic moduli during deformation. This causes non-orthogonal grids in flow. However, the modeling of largely deformable anisotropic reservoirs has little been investigated. |In this study, we employ the total Lagrangian method for coupled flow and geomechanics. The coordinate system remained fixed both for flow and geomechanics. Instead, the deformation gradient reflects the change of reservoir configuration, which yields mathematical equivalence to the updated Lagrangian method [7, 8, 9]. The total Lagrangian method also induces full-tensor permeability from the Piola transformation, even if the initial permeability tensor is diagonal [11]. To accurately model full-tensor permeability, we use the multi-point flux approximation (MPFA) [12]. Then, the total Lagrangian method with MPFA can provide high accurate and rigorous modeling, honoring the objective stress rates (i.e., Lie derivatives). We thus consider the total Lagrangian method with MPFA as the reference model in this study.|",,59

R., Oklahoma State University| Nygaard, R., University of Missouri Science and Technology","|Abstract: |The drill bit blaster (DBB) studied in this paper aims to maximize drilling rate by creating drilling fluid pulsation, which could lead to lower drill string friction, more efficient removal of cuttings underneath the bit and increased nozzle fluid pressure and velocity; all of which could ultimately lead to more efficient cutting and transport of cuttings while drilling. A testing procedure was established in order to measure the fluid pulsations in above ground testing and to create a repeatable method of testing further designs. An analytical model was created in an attempt to predict and describe the pulsation pressure characteristics as a function of operating conditions and internal geometry and compared against experimental results. The results indicated that internal tool design and operating conditions have a significant effect on the pulsation frequency and amplitude. Application of this technology in future designs could allow the bit pressure oscillation frequency and amplitude to be optimized with regard to the lithology of the formations being drilled. This could lead to faster, more efficient drilling which could cut drilling costs and lead to a larger number of oil and natural gas plays being profitable. |Introduction |Motivation |Recovering oil and natural gas resources is an efficiency driven process. Often the rate of penetration (ROP) of drilling bottlenecks the entire process so it is of significant interest within industry to find methods of improving the overall ROP of drilling operations. The drill bit studied in this paper creates a pulsating pressure variation within the body of the drill bit by periodically opening then restricting the drilling fluid flow to nozzles, which run through the bit face. These pulsations could lead to an improved ROP through several mechanisms that have been demonstrated to independently increase drilling ROP in laboratory and field testing. Often there is a difficulty in communicating the surface weight on bit (WOB) down hole through the drill string to the bit, which reduces the overall ROP as well as introduces uncertainty in surface measurements. Barton et al. (2011) recently demonstrated that by creating low frequency vibrations in the drill string the bit life can be extended, better tool face control maintained and drilling ROP increased. During testing the DBB created similar magnitude low frequency vibrations due to the changing fluid paths and flow areas through nozzles in the bit. The slightly outward nozzle orientation from the centerline of the bit resulted in force generation along the axial and transverse axis similar to the design tested by Barton et al. (2011). The second ROP improvement mechanism is due to improved efficiency of bit face cleaning and due to the vibrations created by the pressure pulsation. Lianggang et al. (2015) showed that the greatest benefit of vibration while drilling occurs when the vibration frequency of the bit approaches the resonant frequency of the substrate being drilled. And while the resonant frequency of typical drilling substrates is orders of magnitude above those of the DBB vibration frequency there was still an improvement demonstrated for vibration frequencies far below the resonant frequency. One of the most problematic ROP reducing drilling phenomenon, which occurs primarily in deep wells, is known as the confinement or chip-hold down effect and can decrease the ROP to a fraction of the rate seen during shallow drilling. In deep wells the intense pressure imposed by the drilling fluid column on the bottom of the borehole confines the drilling substrate causing it to become much harder and more difficult to drill. Furthermore, the pressure can cause the substrate to transition from a brittle to a ductile mode of fracture, which further reduces its drillability. Lastly, the constant fluid pressure exerted on the bottom of the borehole by conventional drill bits can hold down cutting chips generated during drilling and lead to a regrinding of cuttings which further reduces the ROP and can lead to a premature wearing out of the drill bit. The DBB routes the flow of drilling fluid through different nozzles during each cycle of the internal flow interrupter plate, which leads to a depressurization of certain zones under the bit face reducing the tendency of the rock to harden as well as enabling more efficient transport of fresh cuttings away from the face of the bit. These mechanisms have been demonstrated by Kolle (2000) during the testing of a design that impulsively depressurized the bit face by periodically blocking the fluid flow and were shown to lead to an increased ROP. Most importantly these ROP improvement mechanisms have been tested in the field in ultra-deep (5000-7000 m) wells in China by Li et al. (2009) with a vibration and pulsation inducing mechanism consisting of a spinning impeller blade which caused fluid pulses due to cavitation behind the blades. Li et al. (2009) measured very similar fluid pulsation pressure frequency and magnitude (maximum of 10 Hz and 300 psi) during testing of this design and recorded between a 10.1-31.5% increase in the ROP and a 29.1% increase in average bit life compared to historical performance in the region. If these improvements could be demonstrated with the DBB the reduction in drill time could lead to significant cost savings while drilling and lead to an increased number of oil and natural gas plays being profitable. And due to of the highly modifiable nature of the pulsation generating mechanism in the DBB the pressure profile frequency, amplitude and waveform shape can be adjusted by varying the geometry of the flow interrupter plate holes. This flexibility could allow for an interrupter plate selection based on the operational drilling needs and characteristics of the drilling substrate which could lead to an increase in the ROP beyond what has already been demonstrated with previous designs.|",,37

K., Geomechanica Inc.| Grasselli, G., University of Toronto","|Abstract: |This paper presents the development, verification and application of a new, fully-coupled, hydro-mechanical (HM) formulation for a finite-discrete element method (FDEM) software package called Irazu. FDEM is a general-purpose numerical approach which combines continuum mechanics principles with discrete element algorithms to simulate the mechanical response of brittle geomaterials. In the newly-developed, integrated hydraulic solver, fluid flow is assumed to occur through a network generated from the same triangular mesh used for the mechanical calculations. The flow of a viscous, compressible fluid is explicitly solved based on a cubic law approximation. The modeling approach is applied to the field-scale simulation of fluid injection in a jointed and porous rock mass. Results show that the proposed numerical approach can be used to obtain unique geomechanical insights into coupled HM phenomena, including fluid-driven fracturing in permeable rocks and interaction between induced and natural fractures. |Introduction |The interaction between hydraulic and mechanical processes in rock masses is commonly known as hydromechanical (HM) coupling. Rock masses consist of a porous matrix with embedded discontinuities, including joints, faults, bedding planes, and anthropogenic fractures. In general, it is possible for fluids to fill and flow through the permeable matrix, the existing discontinuity network, and any new fractures that may be generated by hydraulic and mechanical loading. Mathematical descriptions of the rock mass HM behavior should therefore consider the coupled response of all the above components. Theoretical and computer simulation advances in coupled HM processes have been driven by several geomechanical applications in rock engineering (e.g., stability of underground and surface excavations), underground nuclear waste disposal (e.g., design and performance assessment of geological repositories), exploration and production of hydrocarbons (e.g., hydraulic fracturing), extraction of geothermal energy (e.g., enhanced geothermal systems), and mining (e.g., coal methane extraction). |The goal of this paper is to present the preliminary results of a research effort aimed to develop and validate an HM formulation for the hybrid finite-discrete element method (FDEM). FDEM is a general-purpose numerical approach which combines continuum mechanics principles, such as theory of elasticity and non-linear elastic fracture mechanics, with discrete element algorithms to simulate multiple interacting, deformable, and fracturable solids (Mahabadi et al., 2012). In recent years, it has been used for a variety of rock mechanics problems where an explicit consideration of fracture nucleation and growth is of paramount importance (Mahabadi et al., 2014, Tatone and Grasselli, 2015, Lisjak et al., 2015). The new HM formulation was implemented in the FDEM software of Geomechanica Inc. named Irazu (Geomechanica Inc., 2016). Irazu is an innovative simulation package that leverages the parallel processing power of general-purpose graphics processing units (GPGPUs) to gain significant performance boosts compared to existing sequential FDEM codes (Mahabadi et al., 2016).|",,44

This paper proposes a modified GSI table to characterize the Miami Limestone. Based on the Hoek-Brown Criterion, the GSI values are used to determine the global shear strength of the rock mass to evaluate potential punching failure of shallow foundation for bridges through the Miami Limestone. Additionally, statistical information about the geotechnical property indices, such as unit weight, unconfined compressive strength, modulus of elasticity and tension, as well as percentage of recovery and Rock Quality Designation (RQD) are included in this paper to have a better idea of the conditions of this limestone. |Introduction |The Miami Limestone (formerly the Miami Oolite), named by Sanford (1909), occurs along the Atlantic Coastal Ridge in portions of Dade, Monroe, Broward and Palm Beach Counties. |The use of the Geological Strength Index (GSI) introduced by Hoek et. al. (1994) has been limited in the Miami Limestone and minimum information has been previously reported. |In recent years, the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) has been improving existing roadways and developing new projects where some bridges have been designed bearing on Miami Limestone. FDOT requires the use of the FDOT Soil and Foundation Handbook (SFH) and American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) Bridge Design Specification to design bridge foundation. |Based on AASHTO LRFD 2014 to define the elastic modulus of the rock mass (Es) and the global rock mass strength (<U+03C3>cm), the GSI should be determined using Figure 1. These two parameters are the basis for calculating the total settlement and punching failure of shallow foundations. |Determination of the type of the structure and the surface conditions of the discontinuities in the Miami Limestone is a challenge because this lithology is jointless.

Existing methods have not identified the micro effects of the interlacing kerogen into the overall clay and non-clay matrices. Here we demonstrate a sophisticated tool for mechanically characterizing KRS in that it accounts for contributions from both the rock and the organic matter. Micro-beams are manufactured with a focused ion beam under a scanning electron microscope (FIB-SEM) and then loaded in cantilever mode with a nanoindenter while monitoring in-situ via SEM. The force-displacement curves were analyzed in light of the high resolution images collected during fracture initiation, propagation, and ultimate failure. Under loading, the micro-beams exhibit linear elastic behavior followed by plastic yielding before complete failure. This behavior has been shown to correlate with the amount of organic matter in the failure zone of the cantilever beam. |Introduction |Mechanical characterization of source rock reservoirs such as shales is of primary interest to the oil and gas industry as it seeks to optimize hydraulic fracturing operations. This porous granular material has proven a complicated specimen for mechanical studies due to its high degree of porosity, its silt-sized quartz and other hard mineral particles, and the sea of nanoscale clay platelets that creates an encompassing matrix [1, 2]. Shale is a transverse isotropic material [3] whose bedding planes result from the mode of deposition during sedimentation. |The tensile strength of rocks is an important mechanical parameter for hydraulic fracturing design. During the fluid treatment, the pore pressure is increased by injecting fluid under high pressure into the formation. The pump pressure is raised until the formation breakdown pressure is achieved and the fracture initiates. As many laboratory experiments have demonstrated, the tensile strength influences the formation breakdown pressure [4]. Classical macroscale testing methods based on ISRM standards have been established for determining this rock tensile strength [5]. For example, the Brazilian test proposed in 1943 by Carneiro is still widely used to indirectly determine the tensile strength of rocks, concrete, etc. [6]. |However, these methods were not able to capture the true tensile behavior of the kerogen-rich shales (KRS) in source rock reservoirs. Kerogen is the hydrocarbon source material which is interbedded and interlaced with the clay and non-clay mineral matrix on the micro- and nanoscales [7]. The kerogen content varies from one shale source to the next, and the trace levels present in kerogen-free shales (KFS) have no observable effect upon the mechanical properties. Rather, the anisotropic mechanical properties of KFS were determined by nanoindentation to be governed by packing density, porosity, and the stiffness of the various components [8]. Some success has been seen using the nanoindenter to determine the mechanical properties of KRS [9, 10]. These small scale measurements were able to isolate the elastic properties of kerogen from the surrounding minerals [9].|",,10
753,754,2016-444,Importance of Fluid Compressibility and Multi-Phase Flow in Numerical Modeling of Hydraulic Fracture Propagation,"Park, Jaeyoung, Texas A&M University| Kim, Jihoon, Texas A&M University","|Abstract: |We evaluate the validity of the two assumptions on hydraulic fracture propagation. We employ the semi-analytical approach in modeling of coupled flow and geomechanics, where flow is solved numerically, whereas geomechanics is solved analytically. We first model a PKN hydraulic fracture geometry numerically and incorporate the fluid compressibility term in order to investigate the effect of the fluid compressibility in hydraulic fracture geometry evolution. The results show that as the fluid becomes compressible, the fracture propagation is delayed because it takes time for pressure to be built up to extend the fracture. In multi-phase flow system, we model a hydraulic fracturing process in a gas reservoir by solving flow numerically yet geomechanics analytically. The fracture propagates slowly when water saturation of the reservoir is low. This implies high initial gas saturation, resulting in high total compressibility of reservoir fluid. We observe the gas concentration at near fracture tip, caused by (1) the movement of initial gas within the fracture to the fracture tip and (2) the possibility of the leakage of gas from the formation to the hydraulic fracture. This existence of gas is another factor that can lead fluid flow within the hydraulic fracture to be compressible. |Introduction |The scientific community has taken several assumptions in the study of hydraulic fracturing. For example, one of the assumptions is to ignore the effects of fluid compressibility by assuming the fluid to be incompressible, which is the main assumption used to derive the analytical solutions of the hydraulic fracturing problem. But, considering the stiffness of a typical rock and the stiffness of the injected fluid (e.g. water), fluid compressibility cannot be ignored. Furthermore, when the injected fluid is gas, such as nitrogen and carbon dioxide, the fluid compressibility must be considered to account for the geomechanical changes in the reservoirs. Another common assumption is to disregard the reservoir gas that is going to infiltrate the hydraulic fracture from the reservoir formation during hydraulic fracturing operations, whereas the leak-off from the fracture into the reservoir is usually considered. However, some studies have indicated that the existence of a gap between the fracture tip and the water front is possible (i.e. vacuum area [1]). This gap implies the possibility of the leakage of shale gas from the formation into the hydraulic fracture. |In order to investigate the importance of fluid compressibility in the hydraulic fracturing process, we first focus on modeling a Perkins-Kern-Nordgen fracture geometry which is first introduced by Perkins and Kern [2] and further improved by Nordgren [3]. A PKN geometry has been considered to be physically acceptable in a sense that the fracture length is larger than its height, which is one of the primary assumptions of the geometry. We derive mass balance equations assuming the fluid is not incompressible to incorporate fluid compressibility term in the equations. We then validate our numerical modeling by comparing the numerical results with analytical solutions, taking zero compressibility.|",,46

Most platinum mines using room and pillar method have failed to reach the target milestones of zero harm due to the presence of geological discontinuities. Geological discontinuities along the Great dyke of Zimbabwe comprise of shear zones, sympathetic joints together with dykes. The prevailing geological structures have led to a decrease in productivity and challenges of support failure. Virtuous mining practices together with good support design will lead to an improved productivity, less operating costs and improved safety. The need to improve the key performance indicators led to the compulsion for this research to be conducted based on support design and mining practices in bad ground conditions. Geological data and geotechnical data were obtained from a Zimbabwean platinum mine. It was clinched that the presence of shear zones deteriorated the rock mass which have led to the unpredictable unravelling of the rocks. The current support systems as well as the mining practices were analyzed and benchmarked. Empirical support designs together with numerical modelling were used to design optimum support system. Support design encompasses regional support of pillars and local support of roofbolts. Various rock mass classification methods were used to get the quality of the rock. From the analysis of the current support systems used, it was noted that the current support systems together with mining practices need to be adjusted for sustainable operations. Furthermore, the current mining practices need to be revised since the use of ANFO explosive results in excessive bad hangings, stoping overbreak and increased costs. The bords currently mined gave a shorter stand-up time which again compromises safety. Pillars need to be redesigned together with the implementation of a new roofbolt system to improve both productivity and safety.

Acquisition of discontinuity orientation data required for slope stability assessment using downhole geophysical techniques is faster, more accurate, and significantly less expensive than acquisition via oriented core drilling. As a result of the cost effectiveness, additional data can be collected to provide a more thorough understanding of spatial variations in discontinuity patterns throughout a proposed open pit mine area. Discontinuity data can be collected utilizing rotary and reverse circulation drilling methods, reducing the need for expensive, time-consuming core drilling. The speed of the data acquisition using down-hole geophysical methods in rotary holes, as compared to acquisition via oriented core, can eliminate interruptions to mining operations. Data collected via ATV logging is coupled with in-pit observations and, if available, core data resulting in fast, cost-effective stability evaluation. Field data collection involves drilling and geophysical logging of holes, geologic and discontinuity mapping by geologists, and collection of core or rock samples for laboratory analysis. The data collected is utilized to conduct both deterministic and probabilistic assessment of kinematic and overall slope stability conditions. |Introduction |Relatively recent slope failures have increased attention, including that of regulatory agencies, to slope stability assessment in open pit mines. Generally speaking, drilling efforts often understandably focus on exploration of an ore body. Such practices often produce geologic models that define the ore body very well, but that contain very little to no geotechnical (and sometimes even geological) data with regard to the expected pit wall rock. Geotechnical data can be collected via mapping by geologists in excavated areas, but open pit mine mapping is often limited due to ongoing operations and potentially unsafe access conditions. Additionally, the only way to assess the geotechnical aspects of proposed pit walls in unmined areas (expansion or new mining) is via drilling. |Downhole geophysical logging tools have been used for geotechnical characterization of rock and subsurface conditions associated with mining and non-mining applications for many decades.

Moreover, the drilling mud with higher salinity where thermal osmosis weakening the chemical osmosis effect boosts the favorable conditions required for concurrence associated with longitudinal and transverse fractures in the top and low sides of the horizontal wellbore while the corresponding combined tensile fracture regions progressively aggrandize with time progress. |Introduction |Wellbore instability issues are often encountered when drilling the inert to generating mud cake due to low permeability regarding shale formation with the laminated heterogeneity and chemically active characteristics in deep high temperature environment by horizontal borehole. Accordingly, it is necessary and urgent to understand the complex wellbore instability mechanism with reference to time dependent reestablishment of stresses and pore pressure around ther wellbore determined by poroelastic effect associated with undrained loading after instantaneous bored (Detournay and Cheng, 1988), chemical effect related to the chemical osmotic flow resulting from solute transfer (Heidug and Wong, 1996; Yu et al.,2003; Ghassemi and Diek, 2003; 2009; Zhou and Ghassemi, 2009) as well as water activity difference (Chen et al., 2003) between drilling mud and pore fluid in shale formation, thermal effects arising from heat transport (McTigue, 1986; Chen and Ewy, 2005; Zhou and Ghassemi, 2009) and thermal osmotic (Ghassemi and Diek, 2002; Ghassemi and Diek, 2009). |Shale formations are characterized by parallel discontinuous planes of weaknesses configurations of which may exhibit pronouncedly more potential to fail along the slip surfaces as compared to through compact rock matrix. Accordingly, the strength criteria pertaining to shale rock may be determined by different controlling factors associated with dominated failure behaviors. In regard to intact rock failure, poly-axial shear failure strength criteria, such as: Modified Lade (Ewy,1999) and Mogi-Coulomb (Al-Ajmi and Zimmerman, 2005) appropriately evaluate the strengthening effect concerning the intermediate principle stress such that efficiently guide the practical drilling designs, however, Mohr-Coulomb criterion is expected to be significantly conservative in estimating the minimum mud pressure required to ensure the wellbore stability, since the influence of intermediate principal stress on rock strength is disregarded. In another aspect, the single plane of weakness theory is expressed in the form of Mohr-Coulomb differentiating failure modes of the intact rock and weak plane by the angle between major principal stress and the normal of isotropic planes of laminated medium (Jaeger et al.2007).|",,35

We experimentally analyzed intensity of wear-rate and frictional strength during shear of dolomite and granite samples at slip-velocity of V = 0.001 <U+2212> 1.0 m/s, and normal stresses of <U+03C3>n = 0.25 <U+2212> 4.5 MPa. The experiments showed that the friction coefficients of these rocks depend on the mechanical power-density, which is the rate of energy dissipation during slip. The wear-rates, WR, showed dependency on the mechanical-impulse of the form WR = a · [<U+03C4>/V]b where <U+03C4> is shear stress, V is the slip- velocity, and a and b are material constants. This relation of wear-rate to loading indicates that for rocks, the Archard (1953) model is only a special case for low slip-velocity. We propose here a model based on microfracturing wear at stressed asperities that explains the observed dependency of wear-rates on the mechanical impulse. |Introduction |The resistance of faults to slip serves as a proxy for the strength of the crust. In addition, the static and dynamic frictional strength of rocks are fundamental for understanding faults behavior during creep and earthquakes [Brace and Kohlstedt, 1980; Lockner, 1995]. Frictional sliding is always associated with rock wear by fracturing, shearing, particles plucking and rock comminution [Haggert et al., 1992; Hundley-Goff and Moody, 1980; Mair and Abe, 2011; Scholz and Engelder, 1976; Boneh et al., 2013]. The common product of fault wear is gouge powder, which is a fine grain material found everywhere along natural and experimental faults. When fault blocks start slipping against each other, the associated wear is characterized by three stages: Initial, running-in and steady-state [Boneh et al., 2013]. The very high wear-rates during the early two stages gradually decrease with slip, and the steady-state stage displays low and constant wear-rates [Wang and Scholz, 1994; Queener et al., 1965]. These stages also correlate with the friction evolution from a transient stage of weakening to steady-state [Boneh et al., 2014]. Microstructural observations relate the wearrate stages with the development of a gouge layer as a ‘third body’ between the fault blocks [Siman-Tov et al., 2015; Godet, 1984; Boneh, 2012]. |The controlling parameters of fault wear-rates and the quantitative relations between wear-rate and friction are still enigmatic in spite of some recent developments (Lyakhovsky et al., 2014). We experimentally analyze here the wear-rates and frictional strength of a sedimentary rock (Kasota dolomite) and an igneous rock (Sierra White granite) during steady-state slip. At this stage, a gouge layer is mature and fully separates the fault blocks into a three-body configuration. We demonstrate that the wear-rate intensity is best represented by the mechanical impulse of the shear loading.|",,19

S., The University of Texas at Austin| Gray, K. E., The University of Texas at Austin","|Abstract: |Borehole breakouts, a series of complex processes that simultaneously affect the borehole wall, are characterized by initiation, propagation, and stabilization sequences. This paper presents a hydro-mechanical model incorporating plasticity strain softening by a Drucker-Prager-plastic yielding criteria and fluid seepage by Darcy's law in simulating breakout behavior. Damage-induced permeability change is also considered and modeled with a predefined relationship between the magnitude of plastic strain and permeability. A sensitivity study was performed using the proposed model to quantify the effects of in-situ stresses, mud pressure, and seepage time on breakout initiation and/or propagation. Results show that stress concentration induced initial breakout shape with low mud pressure is larger than that with high mud pressure. Fluid flow in the formation significantly affects breakout propagation and makes it a time-dependent process. For low mud pressures, the initial breakout shape without seepage is similar to the final breakout shape after seepage. For high mud pressure, the initial breakout shape is smaller than final breakout shape. The final breakout shape is also influenced by anisotropic in situ stresses and formation permeability. This proposed model provide a useful tool for evaluating the risk of wellbore breakout. |Introduction |A “borehole breakout” is a phenomenon in which portions of failing rock spalls from the wellbore wall due to high compressive stress around wellbore wall during or after drilling. Excessive breakout can lead to problematic wellbore stability and integrity issues, such as wellbore washout, wellbore collapse, and completion difficulties. Moreover, spalled cuttings resulting from borehole breakout are difficult to circulate out while drilling, which negatively affect drilling efficiency. On the other hand, field breakout events can be analyzed to obtain useful in-situ stress information. Breakouts are routinely used to determine the direction of horizontal stresses, and some authors have also suggested using it to constraint the magnitude of the maximum horizontal stress (Zheng, Kemeny, and Cook, 1989; Zoback et al., 1989; Dart, 1990; Ito, Zoback, and Peska, 2001). |For a vertical well, Bell and Gough (1979) first observed that breakouts normally occur as a cross-sectional elongation in regions of high compressive stress (usually tangential stress around wellbore) and that they are parallel to the direction of the minimum horizontal stress (J. S. Bell, 1979). For a deviated well, stress concentrations around wellbore are influenced by well azimuth, well inclination, in situ stresses, rock properties, and drilling mud pressure (Li and Gray, 2015). The breakout of a deviated well also occurs at the region of maximum compressive stress but it is no longer parallel to the direction of minimum horizontal stress (Zhou, 1994). Generally, the initial shape of breakouts induced by stress concentration for hard and brittle rocks can be estimated by a linearly elastic model with idealistic assumptions that wellbore is circular and intact and rock properties are homogeneous for both vertical and deviated wellbores.|",,29

E., The University of Texas at Austin","|Abstract: |With ongoing environmental concerns and increasingly stringent regulations, the traditional topic of wellbore integrity is more important than ever before. A great deal of importance is attached to the cement sheath because it is necessary to provide zonal isolation and well integrity during the life of a well. Debonding at the casing/cement or cement/formation interfaces, which may result in substantial flow channels and fluid leakage, is often responsible for the loss of wellbore integrity. A three-dimensional finite-element model is developed in this paper to simulate debonding fracture propagation at cement interfaces. Debonding is driven by pressure build-up at the casing shoe due to fluid leakage. The model can be used to quantify the length, width, and circumferential coverage of the debonding fracture. The simulation results show dependence of debonding fracture width and circumferential coverage on in-situ stress conditions, initial cracks around the casing shoe, and cement and formation properties. For example, with initial cracks in the cement interface, debonding fractures tend to develop vertically along the axis of a vertical well, rather than circumferentially around it. The method proposed herein presents a useful step towards prediction of well integrity and provides improved guidance for cement selection and completion optimization. |Introduction |Well integrity, always of importance, is becoming more so because of increasing environmental concerns and regulatory activities. Moreover, increasingly hostile environments such as HTHP fields, ultra-deep-water fields, and geothermal fields, along with more complicated development operations, such as those encountered in gas producing wells, gas storage wells, water injectors, and cuttings/waste injectors, all present new challenges for well integrity. Failure of well integrity can lead to costly remedial operations or total loss of the well, severe environment contamination, and even fatal accidents to operating personnel. |The cement sheath is the heart of well integrity. It is expected to ensure well integrity by providing zonal isolation and support for the casing throughout the life of a well, from well construction, hydrocarbon production, to post-abandonment (Gray, et al., 2009; Feng, 2016). A successful cementing job is expected to result in complete zonal isolation, without leaving any leakage pathway in the annulus between casing and formation. Unfortunately, this goal is not always achieved, and failure of cement sheath commonly occurs during the life of a well (Fourmaintraux et al., 2005).|",,3

Fracture propagation and closure in a pressure sensitive material is important to many engineering disciplines, including the structural, geotechnical, mining, and petroleum industries. Central to these studies has been the use of sophisticated material models. One of these material models, referred to as the Extended-Sandler-Rubin (ESR) cap model, includes a non-linear shear failure surface and a second yield surface (cap) to account for inelastic compaction at stress state lower than those required to induce shear failure. |In numerical analysis schemes involving inelastic rock behavior, loads are applied incrementally. Elemental material tangent stiffness tensors must be evaluated in every increment. The existing traditional analytical formulation in the literature is not suitable for use with the ESR model. This paper presents a careful examination of the derivation of this formulation revealing why. |Furthermore, this paper introduces a numerical algorithm to calculate material tangent stiffness tensor and incremental changes in elemental stresses. Through several case studies involving existing experimental rock mechanics test data in the literature, it is demonstrated that using the traditional formulation leads to incorrect estimations of material tangent stiffness tensor. The presented algorithm, however, matches experimental data closely. The case studies include experimental data for the McCormick Ranch Sand and two reservoir formations in the Lost Hills oil field. |Introduction |Uniaxial strain test, triaxial stress test and biaxial test all result in a stress-strain curve. These curves are then used to determine what constitutive model best describes material behavior. The stress-strain behavior of some solids is best delineated using elastic-plastic constitutive models. Sometimes referred to as the Extended Sandler and Rubin model, the Cap elastoplasticity model is one such model. This model has been used to describe the behavior of materials with a high pressure-dependency such as soils, unconsolidated rocks and poorly consolidated rocks.

M., Texas A&M University| Chester, J. S., Texas A&M University","|Abstract: |In this study, micro-mechanisms that govern the viscous and damage behavior of salt polycrystal during creep processes are investigated. A Finite Element model is designed with POROFIS, in which surface elements represent salt grains and joint elements represent inter-granular contacts. Microscopic observations of salt thin sections serve as a basis to design the mesh, which includes voids. We compare three strategies to predict microscopic damage in the salt polycrystal: (1) inter-granular damage represented by damage propagation in joint elements; (2) intra-granular damage represented by stiffness degradation in grain surface elements; (3) damage in both surface and joint elements. We simulate creep tests in conditions typical of Compressed Air Energy Storage. The three models capture polycrystal stiffness degradation and the initiation, propagation and coalescence of cracks that originate from geometric incompatibilities and local stress concentrations. The model with damageable joints presents a more ductile behavior and captures a smooth transition between steady state and tertiary state creep. This research is expected to improve the fundamental understanding of viscous damage mechanisms in salt rock for geostorage applications, and bring new insights on numerical modeling of multi-scale damage processes in crystalline materials. |Introduction |Because of its low gas permeability, high solubility in water, favorable creep properties and fast self-healing potential, salt rock is considered as an appropriate host media for geological storage of nuclear waste, petroleum, and high-pressure gas. Fundamental deformation processes and flow properties of salt were investigated at the crystal scale (Carter and Hansen, 1983). Constitutive models were also proposed to assess the long-term performance of salt caverns at the field scale (e.g., Berest et al., 2001; Zhu et al., 2015; Martin et al., 2015). But few numerical studies exist to correlate microscopic phenomena occurring at the grain scale to salt behavior observed at the macroscopic scale. |Microstructure-enriched models allowed better understanding the influence of grain size, orientation, shape, and boundary topology in polycrystalline materials. Finite Element (FE) models are only available for with simple grain geometries, with squared or cubic meshes (e.g., Beaudoin et al., 1995). Such methods ignore the influence of real microstructure on the macroscopic behavior of the polycrystal. |To study the deformation and strength of polycrystals at multiple scales with Finite Element Methods (FEM), discontinuities were modeled with Cohesive Zone Models (Espinosa and Zavattieri, 2003) and extended Finite Element Methods (XFEM) (Sukumar et al., 2003). Metals were extensively studied with microstructure-based FEM, but not salt. Indeed, accounting for the time-dependent viscous damage in salt polycrystals subjected to long-term creep loading remains a major challenge in FEM. Only a few studies are based on a realistic representation of microstructure and investigate inter-and intra-granular damage (Musienko and Cailletaud, 2009).|",,59
763,764,2016-252,"Non-linear Shear Strength Descriptions Are Still Needed in Petroleum Geomechanics, despite 50 Years of Linearity","Barton, N. R., Nick Barton & Associates","|Abstract: |Despite utilizing multi-discipline teams in petroleum and service companies, and despite the remarkable abilities of these same companies to produce petroleum in many forms and in highly adverse environments, there appears to be a misalignment between the geomechanics used, and rock mechanics, the latter apparently not used, judging by workshop presentations. Is it possible that this is because geomechanics specialists are not aware of long-available non-linear description of shear strength, for both the fractures and matrix, in NFR and gas shales? Description of the non-linearity has been a goal of many in rock mechanics for the last 50 years, with a well-known start by Patton, 1966 reporting in the first ISRM congress held in Lisbon. His bi-linear strength envelope was an immediate improvement on Mohr-Coulomb linearity, and set the scene for others to improve upon this bilinear description. The 1973 non-linear JRC- and JCS-based criterion of the present author was considered too complex by Byerlee, 1978, who favoured use of a friction coefficient. Shear strength represented in geomechanics remains linear, so is often unrealistic. |Introduction |Due to remarkable educational compartmentalization, there is widespread use of linear shear strength assumptions in the petroleum geomechanics taught in university courses. This is further applied by many oil companies and oil service companies, actually on both sides of the Atlantic, and indeed even in the Middle East. This is undoubtedly due in part to the application of Byerlee's well-known friction coefficients by Zoback and co-workers at the University of Stanford during the last several decades. The linear frictional strength assumptions are applied to signify probable critically stressed fractures, first in deep wells, later in naturally fractured petroleum reservoirs, and in the more recently exploited unconventional gas shales. Linear shear strength assumptions are also applied to the intact rock, which is usually described by simplified linear Mohr-Coulomb, despite many tens of MPa change of effective stress during the sometimes short lives of the reservoirs. |The commonly used Byerlee-type friction coefficient to signify that fractures may be critically stressed, with values quoted typically from 0.6 to 0.85, actually gives no insight into pre-peak phenomena, which include the beginnings of roughness and dilation mobilization, giving potential permeability enhancement in the case of gas shales and critically stressed fracture sets in NFR.|",,38

Sanding criteria are based on a combination of tensile and shear failure from Mohr-Coulomb theory and strain-hardening/softening. Once the failure criteria are met, a new erosion criterion for entrainment of the sand based on the calculation of hydrodynamic and resistant forces on sand grains is implemented to predict sand erosion. To capture the strain localization, dynamic mesh refinement has been implemented in the model. An open-hole completion is first simulated to conduct a sensitivity study with both mechanical and fluid flow properties. Then, cased & perforated well completions are modeled to analyze the stability of perforations. Sand failure and production are induced primarily by stress concentration around the borehole and large gradients in fluid pressure. Several factors, including the perforation orientation, perforation arch stability, perforation diameter, and length of perforation, are shown to be important and are discussed. This model is able to predict the onset of sanding and the severity of sand production around wellbores and perforations, and help design perforated completions. |Introduction |It is estimated that 70% of the total world's oil and gas reserves are in poorly consolidated reservoirs [1], where sand production is likely to happen. Sand production may affect the completion adversely due to plugging of perforations or production liners, wellbore instability, failure of sand control completions [2], and collapse of some sections of a horizontal well. In addition, sand-related problems always increase production costs considerably by erosion of pipelines and surface facilities, reduction in productivity, intervention costs and complexities, and other environmental effects [3]. On the other hand, a controllable amount of sand production can avoid redundant and complex sand controls, such as gravel packs, which have been extensively used to prevent sand production in unconsolidated formations [4]. Thus, a model that is able to predict the onset of sand production and the volume of sand produced is crucial before making a decision of whether to use sand control and how best to utilize such methods.|",,46

The permeable zones of an EGS must be created by stimulation, a process which involves fracture initiation and/or activation and propagation of discontinuities such as joints by pore pressure and stress perturbations. Economic design and operation of EGS can be achieved by reliable characterization of the stimulation results which relies mostly on analysis of micro-earthquake (MEQ) and tracers. In this work we study the reservoir stimulation process on a laboratory scale to improve the current understanding and to help quantify the fracture geometry using acoustic emission (AE) cloud, spontaneous potential (SP), and tracer analysis. To do so, we have developed a new poly-axial hydraulic fracturing test system which allows us to perform reservoir stimulation experiments on rock blocks with size up to 18’ x18” x 18” under pore pressure and representative in-situ stress regimes while simultaneously recording SP and AE during fracturing and circulation. In this paper, we describe preliminary experiments conducted at room and elevated temperatures along with a circulation phase in the latter case. Reservoir stimulation has been accompanied by AE events that are generally correlated with the stress state and fracture geometry, however with less than expected intensity. Results show excellent correlation between the fracturing events and the SP signal. |IntroductionGeothermal energy is considered as a promising optionfor future clean and sustainable energy supply.However, certain technical barriers need to be removedfor large scale utilization of the resources. Particularly,questions related to reservoir creation in different rocktypes and stress conditions need be addressed.Laboratory scale studies present a good opportunity tohelp resolve some of the pending challenges along withrecent field-scale efforts within the framework of theFORGE (Frontier Observatory for Research inGeothermal Energy) initiative.

Unlike conventional triaxial tests, true triaxial testing incorporates the effects of the intermediate principal which are now widely recognized as important in high stress environments, such as deep boreholes. Previous studies have shown that the increase in rock brittle strength as a function of the intermediate principal stress can be substantial, as much as 50% or more in some case. Using a historical context of development of methods and techniques, we explore and compare the evolution of true triaxial testing machines spanning several world regions such as Russia, Asia and North America. Current standards of the specimen preparation are described and the problems related to true triaxial rock testing are then discussed. In general we classify these challenges in categories associated either with a machine's material and design or with contact between the machine and specimen. Finally we cover the most popular machines, their importance and benefits, and factors leading to future directions. |Introduction and Background |Brittle rock strength can be expressed in terms of the minor principle stress, <U+03C3>3, intermediate principle stress, <U+03C3>2, and the major principle stress, <U+03C3>1. The role of the intermediate principle stress is commonly ignored given that its effect on rock strength is relatively less than that of the minor principle stress. However the significance of the intermediate principle in extreme earth engineering such as large earth dams, deep underground mining, and in borehole break outs, geothermal and earthquake studies is now widely recognized. True triaxial rock tests unlike conventional triaxial rock tests account for the role of the intermediate principle stress (Figure 1). |True triaxial rock tests are important because they satisfy the general rock testing principle that stress conditions applied to specimens mimic ‘in-situ’ conditions. For example, while useful, Uniaxial Compression Stress (UCS) tests (<U+03C3>1 > <U+03C3>2 = <U+03C3>3=0) are not valid for simulating conditions within the Earth's crust. On the other hand conventional triaxial tests (<U+03C3>1 > <U+03C3>2 = <U+03C3>3) are more reasonable and are widely used in practice. It turns out that, although cumbersome to undertake, it is actually true triaxial (polyaxial) tests (<U+03C3>1 > <U+03C3>2 > <U+03C3>3) which represent insitu conditions very close to reality.|",,46

J., Afek Oil and Gas Co. Jerusalem","|Abstract: |Based on the assumption of Vertical Transverse Isotropy (VTI), we investigated the ultrasonic velocity and anisotropy of organic-rich chalks (ORC). These chalks, from the late Cretaceous Ghareb and Mishash formations in Israel, have a wide range of porosity (0 – 45 PU), high kerogen content (5 – 15 wt% TOC) and include sections with varying degrees of thermal maturation. Cores were extracted both from the Shefela basin of central Israel and two wells in the southern Golan Heights. We measured ultrasonic velocities of P and S waves in different directions using the ultrasonic transmission method, whilst adjusting effective (confining) pressure levels. The elastic constants were then calculated from the measured velocities and densities, as well as Thomsen anisotropy parameters. Compared to previous studies of organic-rich shale source rocks, which exhibit strong acoustic anisotropy, these organic-rich chalks display weak, yet still measureable transverse anisotropy. Our results present significant differences between the immature and early-maturation stage samples. In our samples, it had become evident that microcracks are present during the early-maturation stage, yet are absent throughout the immature stage. An additional distinction between the maturation stages reveals itself while examining the elastic constants, showing a much stiffer nature in the early-mature sample, which could also be attributed to compaction and lower porosity. |Introduction |Accelerating interest to develop unconventional oil and gas fields in the late Cretaceous Ghareb and Mishash formations in Israel motivates our laboratory work to measure and describe the seismic anisotropy of these rocks. These Late Cretaceous formations consist mainly of fine-grained carbonates with high concentrations of organic matter. The lithology of these rocks is mostly chalk, with occurrences of cherts, marls, porcelanites and phosphorites. These target layers show sedimentary layering and complex network of organic matter and minerals. Evidence of mechanical and petrophysical anisotropy had been recognized in previous studies of immature ORC from the Shefela basin [1], [2]. As far as we know, however, it is the first time that acoustic anisotropy of these formations is being measured. |It is generally believed that at the field scale seismic anisotropy is influenced by three major factors: (1) interlayering of lithologies, or laminae, of contrasting elastic properties on scale much finer than the propagating seismic wavelength (2) preferred orientation of minerals and (3) stress-induced fractures and microcracks that show preferred alignment [3].|",,3

In this study, we used a Finite Difference method in a Reservoir Simulation software to simulate heat transfer within the reservoir, due to cold water injection. Then, we modelled the stress changes induced by the temperature changes, using a Finite Element Method in a Geomechanical modelling software. The results from this study clearly show the formation of thermally-induced fractures at the injector wells due to tensile stresses, a direct consequence of cold water injection. Results also show how the deformation increases when the reservoir formation temperature is further lowered as more cold water is being injected. Using the coupled simulations, North Sea Operators can now understand the interaction between pressures, stresses and fracture propagation away from their injectors. Knowledge of the fracture propagation gives the operator an idea of the optimum well spacing between the producers and injectors, and limits on the maximum injection rate and pressure. This avoids channeling of injected water at the injectors through the thermally-induced fractures directly to the producer thus, protecting multi-million dollar investments. |Introduction |Thermal induced fracturing has been an area of interest for many years and this has substantially increased in the past decade with sustained high oil prices. A large percentage of producing oil fields around the world are applying some form of secondary injection with a good chunk of that percentage injecting water for secondary recovery and pressure maintenance. Many offshore operators directly inject sea water into their reservoirs which could potentially lead to shrinkage of the near wellbore rocks. The degree of shrinkage is particularly important in temperate regions where there is a higher temperature differential between the reservoir and the injected sea water. This shrinkage results in tensile stresses being induced in the formation and may lead to thermal induced fracturing. |In every formation, we have the 3 principal stresses which are the Minimum Horizontal Stress (<U+03C3>hmin), the Maximum Horizontal Stress (<U+03C3>hmax) and the Vertical Stress (<U+03C3>v). In conventional fracturing due to pressure induced stresses, for fracturing to occur, <U+03C3>hmin has to be exceeded. But in the case of thermal induced fracturing, the reservoir could fracture at a pressure substantially lower than the minimum horizontal stress. At failure, this stress value is closer to the tensile stress cut-off of the formation.|",,54

Y., Cairo University| Sone, H., University of Wisconsin-Madison","|Abstract: |This paper studies the apparent relation between the ultimate strength and the elastic properties, anisotropy, and composition of shale rock. The study uses a series of Finite Element Models created in the numerical analysis software ABAQUS. The model considers a representative volume of shale rock adopting a binary mixture of a soft phase (clay and kerogen), and a stiff phase (quartz, feldspar, pyrite, and carbonates). The geometry of the finite element model is similar to the theoretical representation of the clay and kerogen shale constituent as an ellipsoidal inclusion in a stiff matrix. This method describes how the far field stress which is the average stress acting on the total volume of rock is partitioned among its stiff and soft constituents. The volume fraction of the ellipsoidal inclusion controls the clay and kerogen volume, while the aspect ratio of this inclusion controls the anisotropy of the rock. The Young's Modulus predicted by the FE models match very well with those predicted from the semi-analytical Differential Effective Medium (DEM) model when the same elastic properties are adopted for the inclusion and matrix. The DEM investigates the correlation between the internal stresses acting on each rock constituent and the mechanical properties of the composite rock. Two groups of analysis are performed to investigate failure anisotropy. The first group used MC model for both stiff and soft component and the second group used MCC for the soft component. Results explain the mechanical anisotropy by depicting the failure mechanisms in both horizontal and vertical samples. |Introduction |The strength and deformability of shales are fundamental properties relevant to shale gas production. Understanding how different factors affect these mechanical properties is of great importance to successful exploration and production from unconventional reservoirs. Sone and Zoback (2013a, 2013b) showed a clear correlation between ultimate strength and stiffness of the shale gas and the percentage of clay and kerogen content. Another factor crucial to the characterization of shales is its mechanical anisotropy and how it is related to the orientation of bedding planes in the fabric. |Although it is not easy to accurately predict rock strength from petrophysical parameters (Chang et al., 2006); Sone and Zoback (2013b) showed that the elastic modulus seems to be a reasonable indicator of rock strength and ductility. An explanation for that is not readily available because of the fundamental differences in time scale and strain magnitude between elastic deformation and rock failure. In addition, both elastic modulus and ultimate rock strength are found to be consistently higher in horizontal samples (compression direction is parallel to bedding) than in vertical samples (compression direction is perpendicular to bedding).|",,48
771,772,2016-268,Implementing a Universal Tip Asymptotic Solution into an Implicit Level Set Algorithm (ILSA) For Multiple Parallel Hydraulic Fractures,"Dontsov, E. V., University of Houston| Peirce, A. P., University of British Columbia","|Abstract: |The near-tip behavior of a hydraulic fracture determines the local dynamics of the fracture front, and therefore affects the global fracture geometry. Several physical mechanisms may compete to determine the near-tip behavior. In this paper, we consider the simultaneous interplay of fracture toughness, fluid viscosity, and leak-off, which together cause the solution to vary at multiple scales in the near-tip region. In order to avoid having a mesh size that is able to resolve the finest length scale, an Implicit Level Set Algorithm (ILSA), which uses a suitable asymptotic solution for the tip element to locate a fracture front, is employed. The latter asymptotic solution comes from the analysis of a semi-infinite fracture propagating steadily under plane strain elastic conditions. Equipped with an accurate closed-form approximation for this asymptotic solution, which resolves the effects of the fracture toughness, fluid viscosity, and leak-off at all length scales, we analyze the problem of the simultaneous propagation of multiple parallel hydraulic fractures. |Introduction |Hydraulic fracturing is a process, in which a pressurized fluid is injected into a rock formation to induce crack propagation. This technology is used primarily to stimulate oil and gas wells [1], but, in addition, is used for waste disposal [2], rock mining [3], as well as for CO2 sequestration and geothermal energy extraction [4]. To increase the efficiency of operation in petroleum applications, multiple hydraulic fractures from different perforations are often generated simultaneously from one well-bore. In this situation, outer fractures induce an additional compressive stresses on inner fractures and cause non-uniform fracture growth. This phenomenon is called stress shadowing and has been addressed in numerous studies [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] to name a few. It can significantly affect the fracture geometry and the associated production rate. For this reason, it is important to develop numerical models that are able to predict simultaneous growth of multiple hydraulic fractures and that can be used to design more efficient hydraulic fracture stimulations.|",,25

S., Texas A&M University| Zhu, C., Georgia Institute of Technology| Arson, C., Georgia Institute of Technology","|Abstract: |Uniaxial consolidation of granular salt is carried out to study the mechanical behavior and fabric development in a material that deforms by microscopic brittle and intracrystalline-plastic processes. Dry granular salt is sieved to produce well-sorted size fractions. The granular salt is consolidated in a heated cell at axial stresses up to 90 MPa and temperatures of 100 - 200 °C to document stress-consolidation relationships and microstructural development. Polished and chemically-etched petrographic sections of salt samples prior to and after deformation at 150 °C are studied using transmitted- and reflected-light optical microscopy. We show that temperature has profound effect on porosity reduction during consolidation. At tested conditions, the dominant deformation mechanism is crystal plasticity; brittle deformation is largely suppressed. Samples consolidated at higher maximum axial stress develop higher overall dislocation densities. The distribution of dislocations, however, is strongly heterogeneous from grain to grain because of the complex grain-scale loading geometries and the distribution of intragranular flaws such as fluid inclusions. Static recrystallization occurs in some highly strained areas, but overall is minor at 150 °C. The experiments help to improve our understanding of consolidation, and serve to guide the fabrication of synthetic rock salt as experimental material, as well as to inform and test constitutive models of deformation of granular salt for engineering needs. |Introduction |The rheological properties of rock salt have been an important research focus because it is considered aviable geomaterial for engineered repositories of waste and energy resources, such as radioactive waste, oil, and gas (Urai et al., 1986; Carter et al., 1993). Rock salt also is studied as an analog to other geomaterials in that various deformation mechanisms, including cracking, frictional sliding, pressure solution, crystal plasticity, and dynamic recrystallization are easily activated at laboratory conditions (Zhang et al., 2007). |Extensive experimental work has been done on rock salt to determine constitutive relationships and guide numerical modeling (e.g., Watanabe and Peach, 2002; Ter Heege, et al., 2005; Zhu and Arson, 2015). Both natural and synthetic rock salt have been used for experimental investigations; artificially prepared rock salt is of higher purity and can be fabricated in a way that best serves parametric studies (e.g., Carter and Hansen, 1983; Schenk and Urai, 2004; Bourcier et al., 2013). Consolidation of granular salt is a common method used to produce synthetic rock salt samples; however, salt is highly sensitive to moisture so it is critical to have a good control of the humidity of the environment in which nominally-dry salt samples are produced, stored, and processed. Maintaining a consistently dry environment during all stages of handling salt samples can be challenging.|",,59

The aim of this research is to assess the potential risk to the wellbore related to salt creep. For this purpose, a finite element model of a Pre-salt like synthetic wellbore is used. The evaluation scenario considers an elliptic borehole in which the casing remains uncovered by the cementation sheath. The emergence of plastic deformation in the casing is considered here as a failure event. The salt rock (halite) is modelled as an elasto-viscoplastic material, and creep behavior is simulated using the sophisticated Multi-mechanism Deformation model. Uncertainties associated to the key parameters for salt creep behavior are taken into account as random variables described by probability distributions. The fast probability integration Mean Value methods are adopted to obtain the cumulative probability distribution for the time when the failure event occurs. The probabilistic analyses have highlighted that the most important variables for salt creep and associated threats are those related to the stress state, temperature and creep-rate parameters. In this research, the probability of the casing undergoing plastic deformation before the time predicted by the deterministic analysis is 40%. The results show that even representative geomechanical models with sophisticated constitutive laws can lead to an unreliable solution when parameter uncertainties are neglected. |Introduction |Geomechanical uncertainties inherent to the Pre-salt wellbores may introduce severe operational and environmental impacts, since drilling deep wellbores in salt rock formations is challenging and risky. |Typically, wellbore integrity analysis relies on several geomechanical parameters taken as deterministic values, and the results are directly related to that specific parameter set. Hence, even the most sophisticated geometric models may not provide an accurate response whenever the parameter variability is not considered. |Having in mind the operational threats related to the Pre-salt exploration, one can observe that the uncertainties omitted in the deterministic analyses may represent severe financial and environmental costs. Hence, considering the complexity of this scenario and the duality between risk and benefit, it is highly advisable to take into account the uncertainties related to the geotechnical parameters.|",,48
774,775,2016-277,New Performance Criterion for Thin Spray-on Liners: Tensile Toughness,"Guner, D., Middle East Technical University| Ozturk, H., Middle East Technical University","|Abstract: |This study suggests a new support performance criterion for TSL “Tensile Toughness”. For an effective TSL support performance, neither highest strength nor elongation capacity alone is enough by itself. The key criterion for support performance must consider both requirements for load carrying and straining capacities of a TSL. Tensile toughness of materials can combine these two parameters and give better representation of energy absorbance capability of TSLs. For this purpose, 3 different widely used 7-day cured TSLs were tested according to ASTM D-638 tensile testing standard. As a result of these tests, tensile strength, elongation at break were measured and the toughness values were calculated. Details of sample preparation in the laboratory and the testing procedures were also presented in detail. As a result of this study, for the first time in the literature, various TSLs' energy absorbance capacities were found. |Introduction |Ground support is always a primary concern in all earthwork projects. Going deeper in underground mining has been necessitating the requirement for different types of support systems by the help of the technological improvements. In accordance with this, thin spray-on liners (TSL's) were invented in 1990's. TSL's are generally cement, latex and polymer based, either reactive or non-reactive, fast curing multi component surface support materials that are sprayed to the rock surface at a layer of 3 to 5 mm thickness. Although they are known as a new form of shotcrete, they have numerous advantages in comparison. Those advantages are; |Fast curing rate and ability to reach adequate mechanical properties in few hours after application [1, 2, 3] |Discardable rebound amount and wastage during spraying process [2, 4, 5] |Wide displacement range (elongation ratio) [6, 7, 8, 9, 10] |Ease of application and fast application rate [2, 6, 8, 11, 12] |Smaller spraying equipment [6, 13, 14] |Less material handling with respect to other ground support products [6, 15, 16, 17] |Decrease in the operating costs [4, 5, 6, 11] |Thinner thicknesses of applied material with respect to other surface support systems [5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 15, 17] |",,10

Matrix stimulation and hydraulic fracturing (HF) are two common methods for reservoir stimulation, intended to improve the flow connection of the wellbore with the reservoir and therefore aid flow rate and usually enhance the ultimate hydrocarbon recovery factor - RF. HF is usually the most effective approach to accelerate hydrocarbon production and improve RF in many reservoirs as it can access larger reservoir volumes than other methods, particularly in the case of horizontal wells and multistage HF. HF treatment of horizontal drains is a complex engineering process with large capital investment needs; a 16-well shale gas pad in the United States or Canada can cost $USD 100,000,000 or more. Hence, to mitigate risks of inadequate HF treatment by reducing uncertainty in the design phase, HF design parameters may be better defined through laboratory tests. This study was performed on a series of specimens prepared from specimens of core from an Iranian carbonate gas reservoir. The 400 meters cored interval was first categorized into five geomechanical units (GMU) based on rock texture and fabric. Then, six intact specimens from each GMU were selected, and laboratory hydraulic fracturing tests were performed on three specimens of each GMU at three different confining pressures (5, 10 and 15 MPa). The HF test conditions (confining stress, fluid properties, injection rate and etc.) were identical in order to evaluate the lithology variation impacts, and were not intended to assess differences in viscosity, rate, or other related effects. Brazilian tensile strength tests were conducted on three samples of each GMU. By establishing the relationship between breakdown pressures and confining pressures, the HF tensile strength of each GMU was calculated. Results illustrate that there are meaningful differences between tensile strengths inferred from Brazilian tests and those back-calculated from laboratory HF tests. These differences are larger as a function of the porosity: generally, in high porosity specimens, tensile strength values derived from the HF tests are about 4-5 times higher than from the Brazilian test. Issues of defect size and poroelastic effects are invoked to explain the large differences, although proving this quantitatively remains an elusive goal. It is not apparent what mathematical modeling approach might be used to more rigorously assess the differences quantitatively, but a micromechanics fracture modeling approach based on statistical inference using micro- to core-scale tomographic input or digital micro- to macrofabric maps may allow better incorporation of the fabric elements at various scales.|",,28
776,777,2016-275,Modeling of Natural Fracture Propagation under Sedimentation,"Ouraga, Z., IFP Energies nouvelles| Guy, N., IFP Energies nouvelles| Pouya, A., IFP Energies nouvelles","|Abstract: |During sedimentation, buried rocks are subjected to an increase in vertical stress. This increase leads to a decrease of porosity that is commonly called mechanical compaction. Indeed the mechanical compaction, depending on its rate and on the burden rocks' permeability, can induce a significant overpressure. Thus, a competition is initiated between dissipation of fluid overpressure and sedimentation rate. The overpressure decreases in horizontal effective stress and may result in fracture initiation. The present study deals with the propagation of natural fractures in seal formations. A particular emphasis is put on mode I fracture propagation due to rapid sedimentation process. The initiation of fractures and their growth are studied by numerical simulation using on finite element code dedicated to fractured porous media (Porofis). Fractures are represented in this modeling by cohesive joint elements undergoing damage, and the flow in the fracture is described by the Poiseuille's law. The interaction between hydraulic and mechanical processes are studied in order to understand the mechanisms of natural fracturing under sedimentation |Introduction |Basin modeling is commonly used to describe the basin evolution during sedimentation from a reconstruction of its history. In some particular cases, transfer properties of sediments can change significantly due to natural fracturing (Twenhofen, 1950; Schneider et al. 1999). In petroleum industry, and especially for exploration, the knowledge of fracturing processes and history enhances the prediction of overpressure, the potential locations of hydrocarbon storage and the matrix equivalent permeability. Fractures can constitute preferential flow paths or barriers that control hydrocarbons migration in petroleum reservoir. The deep natural fractures initiation and propagation is a well-known topic in geomechanics. It seems obvious to observe that in depth, fractures nucleation and initiation are triggered by existing defaults, but the loads behind its initiation are unknown or poorly characterized. Historically it was impossible to imagine joints initiated at very high depth which from an analytical view was inconsistent with the deep stresses field. It took until the effective stress concept introduced by Terzaghi, (1936) and the concept of poroelasticity introduced by Biot, (1941) to explain tensile stress at very high depth. According to these concepts fractures are initiated when the pore pressure exceeds the main compressive minor stress, this phenomena is called natural hydraulic fracturing (Audet et al., 1992; Mourges R. et al., 2011; David et Andrew, 1990). Lorenz and Finley, (1991) and Lorenz et al.,(1991) have shown that it is not possible to initiate fractures in homogeneous poroelastic formation in regional context. Furthermore previous references showed that natural fractures are initiated in the vicinity of natural defaults in the rock. |In this paper it is shown that when sediment layers have heterogeneous poroelastic properties, especially their compressibility, it is possible to gather favorable conditions to initiate fractures at the interface between the layers. In the following basin's typical structures that are likely to produce a natural fracturing under a rapid sedimentation will be presented. Then the main governing equations of the different physical phenomena involved will be given. Finally from a numerical modeling with a code based on finite element method (Porofis) natural fracture propagation in a typical case will be simulated.|",,52

H., Colorado School of Mines| Gutierrez, M., Colorado School of Mines","|Abstract: |Tunnel design in urban areas must account for overburden loads as well as additional loads imposed by future surface infrastructures, called the embankment load. In saturated ground, the embankment load will generate not only mechanical response through stress and displacement changes, but also hydraulic response through pore pressure changes. Because this hydro-mechanical (H-M) response will be transferred to the tunnel liner and because the liner deforms with the ground, the embankment load will correspondingly influence the liner's stability. This paper examines how severely the induced H-M response from the embankment load will affect the integrity of a horseshoe-shaped (NATM) tunnel in saturated ground. Two tunnel models are created in the computer code FLAC. One model is under weak and low-permeability ground (i.e., clay), and the other one is under relatively strong and high-permeability ground (i.e., granite). Each tunnel model is run under different liner drainage conditions: permeable and impermeable. The embankment load is then applied 10 years after tunnel construction. Simulation results suggest that impermeable tunnels will experience the most severe bending moment from the embankment load, particularly for tunnels in clay. Further, the severity does not stop shortly after the load is applied, but continues towards the steady-state. |Introduction |One of the geotechnical issues associated with tunneling in urban areas is excavation-induced deformation which, if not carefully controlled, may cause damage to existing surface structures. While this effect of tunneling has been a major environmental issue and widely studied for decades, research on the reverse situation – the influence of surface structures on an existing tunnel – has been limited. Nevertheless, the extra deadweight from future surface infrastructures, called the embankment load, should be addressed for tunnel design because it can affect the structural integrity of the tunnel. |In dry ground, the embankment load will change the stress and displacement fields of the ground beneath the structure until equilibrium is reached. In urban tunneling, where the overburden is shallow, changes in the stress and displacement in the ground will easily generate additional ground pressure and structural forces on and in the liner, respectively, i.e., increasing the liner axial forces and bending moment (Rezaei et al., 2013; Katebi et al., 2015). Further, embankment loads have also been seen to widen settlement troughs, such as those found above the metro tunnels in London and Frankfurt (Potts & Addenbrooke, 1997).|",,38
778,779,2016-270,Breakage Mechanics Modeling of the Brittle-ductile Transition in Granular Materials,"Wang, P., Georgia Institute of Technology| Arson, C., Georgia Institute of Technology","|Abstract: |During comminution, several energy dissipation processes operate simultaneously, including plastic work due to internal friction, fracture energy release due to particle breakage, and plastic work due to the rearrangement of fragments. Recent studies show that the plastic work due to particle rearrangement amounts to an important part in the total dissipated energy, which is much larger than the fracture energy released to create new surfaces, especially at high stress. This evolution of energy distribution between breakage dissipation and plastic work during the comminution of granular material manifests as a transition from brittleness to ductility. However, there is still no micromechanical model that can capture this transition. Breakage mechanics is a continuum mechanics theory that allows to analyzing the behavior of granular materials based on statistical and thermodynamic principles. We use this theory to propose a model that couples the energy dissipation caused by breakage and frictional plastic work. A friction plasticity parameter is coupled to the breakage parameter. Physically, the relationship between plasticity and breakage translates: (1) the increase of the dissipation induced by breakage in front of that induced by plastic deformation when fragments produced by breakage have rougher surfaces with higher friction angles than the non broken particles; and reversely; (2) the increase of the dissipation induced by plastic deformation in front of that induced by breakage when the multiplication of fragments results in higher particle coordination numbers, shielding effects and higher particle strength. Our modeling hypothesis is supported by experimental observations reported in the literature, and simulations show that our coupled breakage-plasticity model better captures the brittle-ductile transition observed in granular materials. The proposed modeling approach is expected to improve the fundamental understanding of quasi-static confined comminution, which is a major issue in civil engineering, powder technology and the mineral industry. |Introduction |The quasi-static confined comminution is used in civil engineering, powder technology and mineral industry. It is well known that during this process, particle movement and crushing will occur in order to increase the compressibility.

M., Shell Global Solutions International B.V.| Foo, I., Shell Global Solutions International B.V.| Ellis, F., P(Ten) Ltd| Proughten, A., P(Ten) Ltd","|Abstract: |For reservoir injection and containment studies we need to be able to describe the relationship between the change in formation pore pressure and the in-situ stress magnitudes, specifically, the minimum principal stress magnitude which is the primary control on the pressure required for tensile fracturing and/or the opening of existing natural fractures. The coupling of the pore pressure change and stress response is termed the ‘Stress Path’. |The oil and gas industry has reasonable field data to understand the stress path during reduction of reservoir pressure, however, there is very little published data for the change in in-situ stress magnitude with reservoir pressure increase subsequent to a depletion stage (e.g. Santarelli et al, 1998). The field data showed almost zero increase (rebound) of the minimum principal stress as the reservoir pressure increased, which would lead to a small and decreasing operational ‘window’ for an injection project where hydraulic fracturing could cause loss of containment. |Two comprehensive field studies have been completed where reservoir pressure depletion was followed by water injection which increased formation pressures. The first case study analysed data from a field located in the UK sector of the central North Sea, where reservoir sands were depleted prior to the start of water injection. Well and subsurface data have been collated and analysed to determine the pore pressure – stress coupling during depletion and during injection. We have determined explicit stress paths for the depletion and the rebound, with the latter being significantly different from the one previously published value. |The second case study from an offshore field, South China Sea, analysed a comprehensive data set of step-rate test data which measured the change in the minimum principal stress magnitude as the reservoir pressure increased over a number of years. The data supports a rebound stress path which depends on the effective stress changes during both depletion and injection and whether the Coulomb failure limit is reached. |The results of the studies have been used to determine the operational drilling window for further drilling and well intervention activities, which reduces costly non-productive time events. The findings of these studies have a much wider impact in terms of how we understand and operate water injection projects as well as having major implications in terms of understanding containment modelling and assurance |Introduction |When the pore pressure decreases as a result of production, the effective stress increases and the porous rock compacts. Because the depleting reservoir and the non-depleting rock around the reservoir remain connected, the compaction-induced displacements at the reservoir boundaries induce deformations and stress changes in the rocks around the reservoir. These stress changes will, in turn, affect the depletion-induced effective stress change in the reservoir (coupled system, see Addis, 1997).

The impact of rock anisotropy and natural fractures on the evolution of a fracture network is also examined. Both 2D and three dimensional simulations using DD-based methods and finite element modeling are presented. |Introduction |Development of unconventional geothermal and petroleum resources requires reservoir stimulation to access a large volume of rock with a network of fractures that provide both surface area and fluid flow pathways. In the case of petroleum source rock development, stimulation is often accomplished by multiple hydraulic fracturing of horizontal wells whereas geothermal reservoir stimulation relies upon injection induced shear on pre-existing fractures and their coalescence. Maximizing facture permeability generation and retention, and minimizing the risks of seismicity and other environmental impact is a highly desirable goal, so that stimulation modeling and analysis are called upon to guide the practice. The hydraulic fracturing process presents a complex mathematical problem that involves the mechanical interaction of propagating fracture(s) with the dynamics of the injection fluid. Specifically, fracture initiation, fracture propagation, fluid flow in a deformable fracture and fluid diffusion into the rock, heat transfer between the fluid and the rock, and hydraulic fracture interactions with the natural fractures need to be considered. Therefore, advanced modeling is necessary for improved understanding of the stimulation process and for design optimization. Such models can be used to predict fracture geometries, orientation, stimulated volume, and induced stresses in the reservoir (e.g., for MEQ interpretation and refrac analysis). |Hydraulic fracturing numerical models are usually developed based on a particular conceptual model. Early hydraulic fracturing numerical models (e.g., Carter et al., 2000; Ouyang et al., 1997; Yew, 1997; Lee et al., 1994; Clifton and Wong, 1991; Clifton and Abou-Sayed, 1981; 41; Vandamme and Curran, 1987; Cleary et al., 1985; Wiles and Curran, 1982; Abe at al., 1976) were developed for conventional reservoirs based on the concept of a tensile fracture propagating under fluid pressure (e.g., Barenblatt, 1962; Perkins and Kern, 1961; Geertsma and de Klerk,1969). However, field observations of micro seismicity during fracturing of geothermal reservoirs (e.g., Cornet, 1997; Roff et al., 1996; Fehler, 1990) and surface area estimations based on gas production in shale reservoirs (e.g., Ghassemi and Suarez-Rivera, 2012) show the existence of a complex fracture network, suggesting shear-slippage as a major mechanism of stimulation. Indeed, numerous hydraulic fracturing jobs have shown shear failure to be the main source of permeability enhancement, particularly where natural fractures are pervasive (Rutledge and Phillips, 2002; Mayerhofer et al. 1997; Chipperfield et al. 2007). However, analysis of pressure transients and rates often indicate the propagation of a major feature in the tensile mode consistent with the classical hydraulic fracturing concept. In this scenario, one could still envision leakoff from the major hydraulic fracture into the rock would cause slip on pre-existing or newly formed discontinuities and enhances the permeability in the vicinity of the main fracture via shear stimulation (e.g., (e.g., see Dusseault and McLennan, 2011). Different interpretations of field experiences have spurred different stimulations concepts and numerical models for analysis.|",,48
781,782,2016-284,The Effects of Stress Changes and Natural Fractures on Hydraulic Fracture Interactions,"Mack, M. G., Itasca IMaGE","|Abstract: |A fully three-dimensional hydraulic fracture simulator was used to demonstrate the impact of stress changes and natural fractures on hydraulic fracture network geometry. Propagating hydraulic fractures change the local stress field, affecting the trajectory of nearby fractures propagating simultaneously (e.g. in a multi-cluster stage) or sequentially (e.g. subsequent stages in the same or other laterals). This can induce fracture complexity even in a very simple stress regime with no pre-existing natural fractures. The paper also shows that the geometry of a natural fracture system can dominate the shape of the fracture network developed during hydraulic fracturing. It is essential to simulate fracture propagation in three dimensions to capture these effects accurately. |Introduction |Most hydraulic fracture simulators were initially developed to simulate the propagation of a single planar fracture from a vertical well. Their ability to model multi-stage, multi-cluster fracturing of horizontal wells is very limited because it is often added using approximations and empirical correlations. More recently, a general-purpose fully hydraulic mechanically-coupled geomechanical simulator (Damjanac and Cundall, 2016) has been used to model these scenarios. This type of simulator, based on the Distinct Element Method (DEM), captures the effects of stress changes around complex fracture networks, including both the induced hydraulic fractures and natural fractures and faults (e.g. Mack and Zhang, 2016, Maxwell et al, 2016 and Leonard et al., 2016). |In the DEM-based simulator, the fracture trajectory is limited to the geometry of the pre-defined blocks in the model. It thus becomes very computationally challenging to model the propagation of fractures for which the fracture trajectory is unknown. Some solutions have been developed for two-dimensional problems (e.g. Olson, 2008, Cipolla et al, 2011), but these methods are not easily adapted to situations with dipping beds, slip on bedding planes, significant height growth or varying material properties. |Damjanac et al (2015) have described a simulator (XSite) which can be used to efficiently model fully three-dimensional fracture propagation. The simulator was specifically developed to model realistic hydraulic fracturing scenarios, including the interaction of multiple fractures with each other and with pre-existing natural fractures. |This paper presents the application of this simulator to typical field cases including zipper-fraccing and a case in the Horn River Basin in Canada with extensive natural fractures.|",,22

Subsequent hydrostatic compression of these fractured samples with synchronous radial strain and flow measurement indicates that both mechanical and hydraulic aperture reduction varies linearly with the natural logarithm of effective normal stress. These stress-sensitive single-fracture laboratory observations are upscaled to models of fracture populations displaying frequency-length and length-aperture scaling laws commonly exhibited by natural fracture arrays. Functional relationships between reservoir pressure reduction and fracture network porosity, compressibility and directional permeabilities are generated that can ultimately be exported to the reservoir simulator for improved naturally fractured reservoir performance prediction. |Introduction |Many fine-grained reservoirs (clastics, carbonates and mudrocks) require the additional permeability associated with partially open natural fractures (NF's) to achieve economic flow rates. Depletion-driven matrix compaction is routinely accounted for when simulating the performance of conventional reservoirs such as deep-water sands (Guenther et al, 2005; Pourciau et al, 2005) however predicting in a similar fashion the impact of declining fluid pressure on naturally fractured reservoir (NFR) productivity is less well-established. |Uniaxial strain testing of recovered core provides direct measurement of formation compressibility and matrix permeability reduction (Crawford et al, 2011; Ewy et al, 2012) that can subsequently be incorporated in conventional reservoir simulation studies to account for compaction. Challenges in capturing analogous geomechanical effects in NFR performance prediction can in part be attributed to a paucity of hydromechanical measurements of NF response to effective stress changes appropriate to the hydrocarbon reservoir environment and difficulties in upscaling the laboratory stress-sensitivity of single fractures to in situ NF populations exhibiting frequency-size distributions in geometric attributes. |We report new measurements of stress-dependent mechanical and hydraulic aperture reduction in fractured specimens and describe a workflow for upscaling this dynamic response to discrete fracture network (DFN) models which we use to rank the influence of in situ stress orientation and magnitude, pressure depletion and fracture surface roughness on network compressibility and permeability response.|",,11

Sand production rate after the onset of sanding is also calculated and two different formulations defined by sanding zone change and displacement at the wellbore wall for an open hole case are developed and used. |Introduction |Differential temperatures applied between a wellbore and found in the far field, impose a non-isothermal condition in energy producing formations. Both formation mobility and skeleton deformation may induce incremental flow and possible formation failure leading to either wellbore collapse or sanding issue at the same time. These effects can be a major concern for well completion, as unwanted sand may be triggered, attempting to improve the production in petroleum engineering. As a possible post-CHOPS production strategy by heating the formations up, sanding may be purposefully mobilized for permeability enhancement and for better steam circulations. A combination of viscosity reduction and formation permeability increase, mobility change, is intuitively desirable for production enhancement in those mature EOR processes. Although extensive sanding related studies has been reviewed by Veeken et al 1992, thermally related reports on sand prediction and sand rate calculations are rare and quite limited (Wang, 1998). Thermal coupled geomechanical related studies seem to heavily be focused on wellbore stability and fracturing issues (McTigue (1990), Kurashige (1989), Wang & Papamichos (1994), Wang & Dusseault (1995), Settari & Walters (2001)). Part of the reasons for the lack of the related studies on sand production with thermal effects may be due to the fact that the conventional thermally related EOR processes are combined with a strict sand control strategy. Furthermore, a complete fully coupled thermal-geomechanics-flow framework is rather complex and poses great challenge mathematically. |CHOPS has been applied in Alberta and elsewhere for those intermediate heavy oil reservoir. About 8-15% recovery rate by the current CHOPS completion (Smith, 1988) pushes us to search a post-CHOPS strategy to produce additional oil after a preliminary production. Field experiences and our intuition with a combined CHOPS-thermal method indicate that incremental oil can be produced by reducing oil viscosity and introducing sanding related permeability enhancement. Furthermore the steaming circulation process may be enhanced once wormholes or high permeability zones are generated and thermal effect may further improve sanding processes. In this study, a general thermal-geomechanics-fluid coupling procedure is reviewed. Three possible sanding mechanisms are identified, reflecting different sand failures mechanisms, and the corresponding critical drawdowns are derived. Both critical producing drawdowns and sand rate subject to different wellbore temperatures are calculated, respectively.|",,35

History match from ten wells in Northwest China shows a significant and sustained production decline, despite a continuous increase in drawdown. A critical drawdown is identified, after which the drawdown increase effect is neutralized from that from the permeability reduction. A different drawdown increase strategy by maintaining a constant bottom hole pressure (BHP), yet increasing the far-field reservoir pressure is proposed and applied. This way the drawdown can be increased without reducing the near wellbore permeability. Production decline can be stopped and reversed. Simulations on the field indicate that more than 30% production rate increase can be expected from each well, depending on the in-situ stress level against the permeability changes in the formation. Identifying these critical drawdowns is also economically important, as ineffective drawdown increase can generate zero or negative incremental production, at extra cost. |Introduction |Permeability reduction and production decline are well-known problems in stress-sensitive formations. Such a permeability change normally is evaluated in the lab when the confining effective stress changes is correlated to the permeability changes. Production declines are believed to be triggered by this permeability reduction when the near wellbore stresses are increased in these stress-sensitive formations. This phenomenon can be observed in the field but may not be specifically quantified, when an increasing drawdown is applied, attempting to increase production. Although simulations and history matches were performed extensively (Bai et al., 1994, Klkanl and Pedrose 1991, Chen and Teufel 1993, Chin et al., 1998) a comprehensive study on how to reverse a production decline in a stress-dependent permeability formation is desirable. In this study, a basic correlation between permeability and effective stress changes is utilized. The in-situ permeability and those corresponding stress levels are identified. We must emphasize that the formation permeability may change with the effective stresses, but the range of the stress changes and the corresponding permeability should be identified first so that we can anticipate if those induced stresses due to a drawdown change fall into the sensitive range. This is an important indicator if we may link the production declining issue to the stress sensitivity in these reservoirs. A procedure for simulating and solving a problem as such is proposed in this article. First of all we can determine what kind of stress-sensitive experimental tests should be performed and used for field production evaluation. Commonly, the permeability is defined as a function of the confining stress, which is in the principal stress direction. In what follows, we propose to define the permeability as a function of the normal stress to the principal flow direction, which is dictated by the natural fractures and the geological bedding. Furthermore, if plasticity and dilatancy occur, the shear component of the stress tensor should be also used. Secondly we can determine if a production decline can be reversed by controlling the wellbore drawdown, i.e. if the drawdown and stress concentrations fall into the sensitive range to the permeability indicated from the experiments. Thirdly we may diagnose if a production decline in a specific field is mainly caused by these stress sensitive permeability change. Finally we may find alternative ways to increase drawdown without bringing down the permeability particularly near a wellbore at the same time. In other words, once we can correlate producing well drawdown to the induced stress changes, which are in the stress-permeability sensitive range, then we can adjust the producing drawdown to serve the purpose for production enhancement. Once these factors are identified, a dual-porosity model is utilized for production calculations. It should be realized that without considering these factors, any attempt to increase production by lifting drawdown may be fruitless or neutralized by the consequence of permeability reduction. Production declines in a fractured carbonated reservoir northwestern China are observed and enhancing strategies are proposed.|",,34

Optimal completion of producer wells requires horizontal stress distributions and anisotropic mechanical properties from sonic data acquired in a vertical pilot well. Minimum horizontal stress distributions require estimates of multiple Transversely-Isotropic (TI) elastic constants. Conventional techniques for the estimation of a sub-set of TI-constants yield C33, C55, and C66. To obtain the minimum horizontal stress, another off-diagonal element C13 must be estimated from a rock physics model MANNIE that requires calibration against either core data or minimum horizontal stress estimated from the micro-frac tests at select depths. This paper describes a new workflow that yields four of the five TI-constants C33, C55, C66, and C13 from the inversion of dipole flexural dispersions in the absence of any dipole shear slowness anisotropy. In addition, inversion of the fast- and slow-dipole flexural dispersions observed in thin limestone stringers interbedded in shales yield six of the nine orthorhombic constants. Estimates of C13 and C23 provide the key inputs to the poroelastic stress model to output both the minimum and maximum horizontal stresses. This new workflow accounts for shale heterogeneities on a scale that is of importance in the placement of lateral producer wells, fracturing stages, and perforation clusters. |Introduction |Stress distributions and rock mechanical properties in organic shale-gas reservoirs play an important role in an optimal placement of a lateral and completion of a producer well for enhanced hydrocarbon productivity (Walsh et al., 2006; 2007; Higgins et al., 2008; Waters et al., 2011). Optimal placements of a lateral is preferred in depth intervals bounded by higher minimum horizontal stresses than the target producer well. Stress distributions of this type help to constrain the hydraulic fractures within the producing layer. Anisotropic mechanical properties of shale formations are expressed in terms of the vertical and horizontal Young's moduli and three Poisson's ratios from the five TIV constants. Young's moduli and Poisson's ratios can help to predict the fracturability of shale intervals. |Conventional techniques for the estimation of minimum horizontal stress gradient as a function of vertical depth is based on the poroelastic stress equation. Inputs to this equation are the 5 TI-constants together with tectonic strains that require calibration against measured minimum horizontal stress from a micro-frac test at a nearby depth. While sonic data from a vertical pilot well is routinely processed to yield the TI-constants (C33, C55, and C66), one of the important off-diagonal elements C13 requires cluster processing of sonic data from both a vertical and deviated sections in the same shale lithology (Jocker et al., 2013a; 2013b; Brooks et al., 2015). Alternatively, C13 can be estimated from compressional wave velocity in an oblique core plug. Yet another technique is based on invoking a rock physics model MANNIE together with the necessary calibration against core plug data (Schoenberg et al., 1996; Suarez and Bratton, 2009; Horne, 2013). All of these three techniques are based on inverting velocity data acquired in different volumes of shale formations for the estimation of C13. These volumes of shale can be far away from the vertical pilot and lateral producer wells that need to be optimally completed for enhanced hydrocarbon productivity.|",,13
786,787,2016-305,A Novel Mesh Generation Algorithm for Field-Level Coupled Flow and Geomechanics Simulations,"Florez, Horacio A., The University of Texas at El Paso| Ceberio, Martine, The University of Texas at El Paso","|Abstract: |Generating a suitable hexahedral mesh for field-level coupled flow and geomechanics computation is still a challenging task. The lack of an analytical representation of the reservoir geometry makes generating a valid mesh for geomechanics a tedious and time-consuming endeavor. Indeed, usually the reservoir description comes as a static-model, i.e., corner-point geometry mesh, which is appropriate for flow simulations but not necessarily for mechanics. Having different meshes for flow and mechanics can alleviate this constraint but there is an intrinsic interpolation error in the procedure. |In order to minimize this error, we generate in the pay-zone region a mechanics mesh by smoothing the flow mesh. This procedure ensures that a valid mesh for finite element purposes is obtained and the projector, which maps pressures from the flow mesh into the generated reference mechanics mesh, is the identity matrix. This resulting pay-zone mesh is propagated into its surroundings by means of elliptical smoothing using linear elasticity. We also show that the same hexahedral mechanic pay-zone's mesh can be converted to a valid tetrahedral mesh by exploiting every hexahedron in a certain number of tetrahedrons. This latest procedure is attractive to bringing tetrahedral meshes into the picture, which allows treating constraints for the meshing process, i.e., faults and pitchouts, accordingly. |Finally, field-scale reservoir compaction and subsidence computations are carried out by using continuous Galerkin finite elements for mechanics, coupled with a slightly compressible single-phase flow simulator in order to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed algorithm. |Background |Geomechanics at the reservoir level, i.e., reservoir compaction and subsidence, usually involves solving flow and mechanics by an iterative coupling technique [1-3]. This raises a question about what it is going to be a valid mesh for mechanics. At first glance, one may consider using the same mesh for flow and mechanics, at least in the so-called pay-zone. Meshing only in the pay-zone requires the in-situ stresses as Neumann boundary conditions, which is limited due to the uncertainties to measure them accurately in the field [4]. Another approach is to extend the reservoir mesh on its surroundings (i.e., non-pay-zone), which increases the computational cost by generating a large mesh for mechanics but it allows using simpler Dirichlet boundary conditions for displacements instead. This latter approach is more tractable in spite of its additional computational effort [1]. |There exists a gap between static-model builders packages, such as Schlumberger's Petrel for instance, and mesh generators. Usually as a starting point, one may have a corner-point mesh for the pay-zone but neither geometrical nor analytical description of the reservoir itself [5]. This lack of representation makes generating a mesh in the non-pay-zone for mechanics a complicated and tedious task for most users. Another advantage of having such geometry is being able to generate a different mesh for mechanics even in the pay zone, which is quite attractive for several reasons such as having a coarser mesh for mechanics in the pay-zone or even non-matching meshes in the non-pay zone.|",,37

In this research, lost circulation materials (LCM) in combination with other fluid loss control (FLC) additives with a small amount of barite nanoparticles in a weighted water based drilling fluid were used to investigate the plugging capabilities of the mixtures. A high pressure LCM testing apparatus was used to evaluate the performance of three different water-based drilling fluids in sealing a slotted/tapered disc. For this testing, barite nano-micro particles were prepared chemically and mechanically, and substituted API barite replacing 3% by total sample weight in the base case. Ground nutshells were used in the formulated water based drilling fluid systems to increase the sealing capability. Based on the results, the combination of both 142 gr/lit (50-ppb) nutshells and barite nano-micro particles resulted in higher sealing pressure than other LCM treated drilling fluids. Using nano-micro particles in conjunction with the nutshells improved the sealing pressure more than 205 % using the mechanically generated nanoparticles as compared to the base case. The paper discusses the potential reasoning behind the large increase in the sealing pressure. |Introduction |Lost circulation is one of the most challenging situations during drilling fractured and highly permeable formations. The related consequences include an increase in well construction cost, wellbore instability due to losing hydrostatic pressure, kick and blowout in severe lost circulation conditions. Improving wellbore stability and reducing non-productive time caused by lost circulation can be controlled by mitigating drilling fluid losses into permeable or fractured zones. Primary attempts to control lost circulation include reducing the mud weight, treating the mud with: granular bridging materials, fibrous, flaky materials, or a combination. Selecting the appropriate material depends on the type of lost circulation zone and the severity of the losses. Traditionally, lost circulation materials (LCM) such as mica, sized graphite, nutshells, cottonseed hulls, cellulose fibers and plastic chips are used to seal (and bridge) seepages in fractured zones and pore throats in permeable formations. Previous studies focused on improving both chemical and mechanical ways to control lost circulation, and developing a standard test method which simulate actual conditions. |Vidick et al., 1968. suggested using a solid-free silicate system to cure lost circulation. They evaluated the performance of their system based on gelation time, plugging capability and long-term stability. The reported results showed a successful application of their silicate system for cores with different permeabilities. Burton et al., 2001. used cross-linked polymers in combination with fibrous LCM to control drilling fluid loss into cavernous formations. It was found that drilling fluid losses were successfully stopped after the injection of chemically activated cross-linked pills (CACP). Whitfill et al., 2007. studied the use of resilient graphite carbon and ground marble with different particle size distribution to produce deformable-viscous-cohesive systems, which successfully controlled lost circulation in depleted sand formations in a well in Gulf of Mexico.|",,29

E., Oklahoma State University| Qader, R., Oklahoma State University| Hareland, G., Oklahoma State University","|Abstract: |Drillstring torque and drag are parameters that can adversely affect the planning and drilling stages of an extended reach or horizontal well. The addition of barite nanoparticles to weighted water based drilling fluids improves the fluid's lubricity coefficient and reduces the friction coefficient between the drillstring and wellbore. This paper will discuss the preparation and analysis of the drilling fluid samples: a fluid sample with normal barite and two fluid samples containing chemically and mechanically generated barite nanoparticles. In addition, the effect of different concentrations of chemically generated nanoparticles on the lubricity was investigated for the water based drilling fluid system. The results indicate a reduction in friction coefficient of more than 34 percent substituting a concentration of 3% by weight of chemically generated barite nanoparticles and that mechanically generated nanoparticles reduces the friction coefficient by more than 15 percent. This emphasizes the significant role the chemically generated barite nanoparticles could have enhancing the lubricity coefficient while lowering the friction coefficient. From a horizontal well a set of drillstring torque and drag analysis show that it would be possible to drill a longer horizontal section by extending the reach thousands of meters with the same drillstring input power at surface. |Introduction |Drilling fluids are used in drilling operations to fulfill the needed functionalities including providing proper cuttings transport to the surface, sufficient hydrostatic pressure against the wellbore wall, and bit lubricating and cooling, to name a few. Although water-based drilling fluids (or “muds,” WBM) are preferred for economic reasons, oil-based and synthetic-based drilling fluids show better performance in shale inhibition, bit lubrication and torque reduction. High friction between the drillstring and the wall of the borehole may cause higher hook-load (axial tension) while pulling the drillstring out. This may shorten the well length and accelerate tubular wear in deviated or horizontal wells. A better lubricity coefficient would allow for a decreased probability of stuck pipe or pipe buckling, especially in extended reach and horizontal wells. Johancsik et al. (1984) developed a mathematical model to predict drillstring drag and torque in directional drilling. It was concluded that sliding friction between the drillstring and the wall of the borehole causes drillstring drag and rotational torque. Over the years, many researchers have used different additives in WBM fluids to reduce the torque and drag of the drill-string in order to maximize extension of the well length in extended-reach and horizontal wells. Dzialowski et al. (1993) studied the effects of using different salts, solid content and polymers in water-based drilling fluid on the lubricity and wear of Pierre shale. It was found that bentonite and barite solids did not significantly affect the coefficient of friction. Skalle et al. (1999) used polymer microbeads in WBM system to decrease the coefficient of friction; they reported a 40% reduction in the coefficient of friction using mono-sized polystyrene crosslinked with divinylbenzene polymer microbeads. Schamp et al. (2006) investigated mechanical torque reduction tools including clamp-on and integral connections in drillstring to reduce torque while drilling. They also studied the performance of different lubricants on torque reduction for extended reach wells.

Previous experiments performed by Zakaria et al. (2012) and Contreras et al. (2014) have focused on the effect that nanoparticles have when added to oil-based mud (OBM), while studies by Jung et al.

In this work, the thermal effect is investigated using DEM-based micromechanics model implemented in Particle Flow Code (PFC). The rock mass is represented by an assembly of discrete particles that are bonded at contacts. In the developed thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) module, heat conduction across the solids in the rock matrix and heat convection between the injected fluid and solid particles are coupled. The evolution of the system is driven by a continuous point source of heat. Simulation results show that the thermal induced stress, temperature and pore pressure predicted by this model are consistent with laboratory observations and simulation results from conventional continuum mechanics models. This study indicates that thermal stresses can greatly affect initiation and propagation of fractures and assist the communication between injection pressure and pore pressure in the rock formation; thermal fracturing can be considered as an effective method to connect fracture network, enhance weak zones and create more fractures. |Introduction |The effects of thermal contrast between injecting fluid and surrounding rock can play very important roles in initiation and propagation of fractures in completion and stimulation operations. A significant temperature difference between the wellbore fluid and rock formation may introduce additional compressive or tensile stresses, depending on whether the fluid temperature is higher or lower than the surrounding rock [1]. Most existing research works related to thermal stresses have focused on the geothermal and fractured reservoirs. For example, Zeng et al. [2] investigated the potential of heat production from deep hot dry rock and indicated that produced heat relies on thermal conductivity, injection temperature and water production rate. In a fractured reservoir, the heat flow within the fracture is primarily accomplished by advection; in the area outside the fractured zone, heat flow is mainly controlled by conduction [3]. |The investigation of Thermo-Hydro-Mechanical (THM) process in fractured reservoir has been developed rapidly in recent years. Both numerical simulations and laboratory experiments showed that cooling injection is an effective approach to improve reservoir permeability. |Three-dimensional structural model showed that rock shrinkage will very likely take place after several months of cooling circulation and the tractions across fractures around reinjection borehole can significantly increase [4]. The laboratory studies showed that a strong thermal gradient is generated by increasing the number of cryogenic stimulation after injecting liquid nitrogen (LN2). The fracturing can be enhanced as a result of creating new cracks and reactivating/opening preexisting cracks. In addition, this method avoids the shortcomings of water-based hydraulic fracturing, such as formation damage, water supply shortage, and contentious political climate [5].|",,3
793,794,2016-335,A Hydro-mechanical Erosion Analytical Model for Sand Prediction,"Gravanis, E., Cyprus University of Technology| Sarris, E., University of Nicosia| Papanastasiou, P., University of Cyprus","|Abstract: |Sand production is one of the major research subjects in petroleum industry. The physical processes that dominate the problem depend on the in-situ stress field and the hydro-mechanical conditions (i.e. the state of the material). The problem is usually dealt with either experimentally or numerically due to the complexity of the governing equations. In our previous work, we introduced an erosion model which is built upon the physics (fluid-solid poro-mechanical coupling) usually incorporated in erosion models for the prediction of sand production. In this work we briefly outline the mathematical framework upon which our sand production model works due to erosion. The focus of this analysis is the parametric investigation of the material parameters that dominate the poro-elastoplastic constitutive model (cohesion and friction angle) for weak unconsolidated formations. Typically such formations are dominated by plastic compaction upon loading and are characterized by low cohesive strength (low cohesion) but significant frictional stress dependent strength (high friction angle). |Introduction |Sand erosion, in the sense that interests us in this work, is the phenomenon where a fluid saturated rock loses its mechanical integrity due to the applied stress field and is transported away in the presence of pore pressure gradients. The unintended by-product of solid particles of oil and gas production is generally referred to as sand production. In practice, the aggressive pumping of oil from the well causes grain dislocation from the solid matrix of the rock thereby leading to mechanical problems such as accumulation of sand in the wellbore and the creation of unstable cavities in the geological formation. Particle influx into the wellbore may lead to various problems such as erosion of valves and pipelines, plugging of production liners and sand deposits in the separators. Additionally, during production, sudden erosion in high pressure gas wells represents a major safety risk (Tronvoll and Fjaer 1994; Tronvoll et al. 1997). The design issue that arises from this problem and it is of considerable interest to the oil and gas operating companies, is the prediction or control of these particles. |In the view of modelling, the different processes that are involved in the sand production problem are associated with: 1) fluid and solids transport, 2) fluid/rock interaction and 3) rock deformation. Modelling of the sand production physical problem is not a trivial process as it involves the following coupled mechanisms: a) the mechanical instabilities and localized compressional or tensile failure (damage) of the rock in the vicinity of the wellbore due to stress concentration and b) the hydromechanical instabilities caused from internal and surface erosion, which manifest themselves in releasing and transferring the particles caused by the action of seepage forces. These two mechanisms are coupled since the stress concentration will lead to loss of cohesion of the material causing localized damage which in turn will increase the amount of loose solids that can leave the rock formation (Vardoulakis et al., 1996; Papamichos and Stavropoulou 1998; Papamichos et al., 2001).|",,57
794,795,2016-330,Well Strengthening in Gas Wells from near Wellbore Drying,"Papamichos, E., Aristotle Univ of Thessaloniki","|Abstract: |The effect of flow-through drying in sand production is analyzed. In flow-through drying, evaporation of the connate water of the reservoir sandstone occurs into the gas phase during natural gas production. This results from the compressibility of the gas. Near the wellbore the gas pressure drops and thus its relative humidity level drops as well. When an unsaturated gas flows through a medium, it can evaporate the connate water in the medium. Simultaneously, rock drying leads to capillary wicking form regions of higher water saturation. The strength of sandstone is affected by the water saturation with dry rock being stronger than water saturated rock. Drying the formation near the well due to gas flow will thus lead to an increase in the critical stresses for failure and sand production. Results from coupled finite element simulations are presented that demonstrate this effect on the hollow cylinder test configuration. Experimental results corroborate the observed drying and the well strengthening. |Introduction |Flow-through drying has been investigated in the past as a means of increasing the near wellbore relative permeability of the flowing hydrocarbon. This can be accomplished by reducing the water saturation in the formation. In the optimal case of complete water drying, one-phase hydrocarbon flow is obtained, decreasing the near wellbore skin significantly. |Well stimulation with vaporization of formation water (Allen 1968) or dry gas injection (Murphy and Scott 1973) have been proposed. Allerton et al. (1949) studied flow-through drying of dry gas in packed beds of crushed quartz or other materials. Zuluaga and Lake (2004) developed a mathematical model to simulate experiments on water vaporization for gas injection. No compressibility effects were considered while the focus was on the traveling evaporation front that separates two regions, the upstream state of dry gas without any liquid and a downstream state of fully saturated gas and trapped liquid. |Mahadevan, Sharma and Yortsos (2006, 2007a, 2007b) looked at wet- or dry-gas injection after the end of the viscous displacement when the water liquid is trapped in the formation and does not flow (irreducible water saturation Swi). They identified two important phenomena at play: (a) Gas compressibility, which is necessary for evaporation into water saturated gas, and (b) Capillarity which is necessary for the spreading of the liquid saturation profile across drying fronts since the bulk liquid does not flow. Capillary pressure–driven film flow (the capillary-wicking effect) enhances drying by transporting liquid from the deeper recesses of the porous medium to the regions nearer the outlet surface where drying rates are greater. The stronger the capillarity, the larger the enhancement in drying.|",,13
795,796,2016-319,Analysis of Roof Control Plans for Improved Stability at Four-Way Coal Mine Intersections,"Sinha, Sankhaneel, Southern Illinois University Carbondale| Chugh, Yoginder P., Southern Illinois University Carbondale","|Abstract: |In their ARMA 2015 paper “Numerical Modeling of Roof Support Plans at 4-Way Coal Mine Intersections” authors presented an approach to quantify reinforcement effect of a roof support plan over a designated area based on critical failure strains in tension, compression and shear in the immediate roof, pillars and immediate floor strata [1]. The above led authors to evaluate roof support plans at two coal mines in Illinois for an idealized four-way intersection with one cut corner [2]. In this paper authors use the above approach to analyze the effects of two variables on intersection stability: 1) Effect of error in estimating GSI on assessing stability of intersection, and 2) Effect of mining cut sequence in relation to the orientation of pre-mining maximum compressive stress. First, sensitivity of critical strain zones is analyzed due to an error in assessed GSI values used for estimating the Hoek-Brown failure properties for different lithologies. Then, the effect of two cut sequences is analyzed on the stability of the intersection. The developed 3-D numerical model was calibrated using in-mine measurements of convergence and instrumented bolt loads. Differential pre-mining horizontal stress field result in high shearing strains at pillar corners. The immediate roof strata in the N-S entry was subjected to high compressive strains of about 4 mm/m while low confining stress in the ribs resulted in high tensile strains. Contours of yielded zones in coal ribs extended 0.8 m (2.5 ft.) in the E-W direction that increased to 1.2 m (4 ft.) at the base of the pillar with failure occurring in the shear mode. Pillar corners and 0.4 m (1.25 ft.) of the ribs along the N-S entry fail in shear and tension. Some pillar settlement with shear failure occurs in the weak floor around all corners. |Introduction |Room-and-pillar and longwall mining systems develop underground excavations whose stability must be considered over their service lives. The primary concern is around intersections since 70-80% of roof falls in US coal mines typically occur there. An analysis of 2004 to 2008 roof falls in Illinois mines also showed that over 80% of these falls were concentrated at intersections [3]. |Rock bolts are extensively used as primary and secondary support elements in coal mines around the globe. Typical cost of roof control in Illinois mines constitutes about 7-20% of the production cost depending upon site specific geo-mining conditions. In spite of considerable previous research on the topic, there is a need to improve the scientific basis for the design of roof control plans. Most of the currently practiced bolting layouts have been developed based on field experience rather than on a scientific basis. Therefore, it would be a contribution to develop an approach that can identify critical areas of instability around an intersection and assess the efficiency of a roof control plan. The critical zones can then be reinforced with appropriate support elements to develop sound roof control plans that will control the rock mass deformations around intersections.|",,46

C., Norwegian Geotechnical Institute| Grande, L., Norwegian Geotechnical Institute| Jostad, H. P., Norwegian Geotechnical Institute| Manalac, E. B., Statoil ASA| Thompson, N., Statoil ASA","|Abstract: |This study presents a numerical approach to account for the non-linear clay plasticity on wellbore stability analysis for deep water drilling. The numerical model considers the stress path dependent (anisotropic) strain-hardening/post peak softening behavior, which is typically observed during undrained laboratory testing of clay materials, using the NGI-ADP soil model. A linear-elastic assumption estimated almost no drilling window that did not fit with the field drilling experience. The analysis including the hardening behavior results in a smaller failure zone around the wellbore wall than the linear-elastic perfectly plastic model. When the collapse criterion is defined as an extension of the failure zone that does not trigger a drastic reduction in the shear strength around the well, the proposed approach estimates a possible drilling window for a horizontal well, which was originally estimated as having no drilling window. This study indicates that proper modelling of clay plasticity can provide an efficient solution for deep water drilling of shallow reservoirs. |Introduction |Shallow clay sections in deep water settings are a complex challenge regarding wellbore stability analysis. Often, clay strength is low compared to pore pressures and the drilled formation behaves under an undrained condition due to relatively low permeability compared to typical drilling times. Consequently, collapse gradients, estimated using an idealized linear elastic or linear elastic perfectly plastic behavior, are commonly estimated as too high [1]. |As illustrated in Figure 1, clay materials show significant non-linear plastic ductility, more than mudstones or stiff shales. When the idealized elastic model is used for the clay material, importance of nonlinear plasticity is ignored. Neglecting plasticity may result in inaccurate wellbore analyses. It is common in the field to observe that drilling through clays or soft shale formations are possible even beyond their elastic limit or the peak failure strain due to non-linear plasticity [2, 3]. Therefore, for an optimum well design in deep-water drilling scenarios, the non-linear plastic behavior of clay around the drilled wellbore should be properly taken into account. |This study investigates the effect of non-linear clay plasticity on wellbore stability by a numerical approach. |The numerical model considers anisotropic strain-hardening and softening behavior of clay, which is typically observed during undrained laboratory testing of clay material, using NGI-ADP soil model [4]. First, a typical plastic behavior of clay while drilling is discussed and compared to laboratory tests. The model is then applied to a deep water drilling design, which initially estimated almost no drilling window using a linear-elastic assumption; a mismatch with a field drilling experience. In the end, applicability of calculated plasticity on the collapse gradient is discussed.|",,48
797,798,2016-316,Nonlinear Elasticity Theory: Two-Velocity Model of Microfractured Porous Saturated Media,"Dorovsky, V. N., Baker Hughes Inc.| Perepechko, Yu. V., Baker Hughes Inc.","|Abstract: |Full nonlinear elasticity theory of a two-velocity continuum describing the propagation of elastic deformations in microfractured porous media is based on general physical principles: the first law of thermodynamics, the conservation laws, the kinematic relationships in the metric tensor and the Galilean principle of relativity. As theory verification, the theory of the Stoneley waves in microfractured porous media is developed. The simulation results are compared with the results of physical measurement of the Stoneley wave parameters in boreholes. It is shown that an additional fluid transport through fractures makes it possible to satisfactorily correlate the experimental and theoretical data. In general, the developed theory is a nonlinear physical model of fluid dynamics in a fractured porous deformable media. The Stoneley wave attenuation under borehole conditions has been studied. It is shown that the discrepancy observed between results of two-velocity filtration theory and direct permeability measurements in cores may be eliminated within the framework of the theory of microfractured porous medium developed here. |Introduction |Modeling fluid flow in the microfractured porous medium is especially relevant for the problems of applied geophysics. By using physically and mathematically correct equations that would serve as the basis for describing these processes; we can develop the acoustic theory. The acoustic theory of the microfractured porous medium enables a method of implicit measurement of formation permeability when the formation is saturated with the water-oil mixture under borehole conditions. The general ideas behind this measurement method may be found in (Dorovsky et al. 2010b). In addition, creating models of the microfractured porous media is relevant for the general description of condensed media with different sorting patterns (Landau and Lifshitz, 1987; Dorovsky, 1989, 1995). Models of the microfractured porous media taking into account the finite deformations of the elastic skeleton and the multi-velocity character of the motion of the microfractured porous media are of a special interest. Accurate descriptions of these processes must be based on fundamental physical principles to yield reliable results. These principles include conservation laws (whose general structure flows from the kinetic theory of condensed media), principles of the equations' invariance with respect to the Galileo transform, and the First and Second Principles of Thermodynamics (for equilibrium and non-equilibrium processes). There are publications devoted to developments of the acoustic theory of the microfractured porous media. The models developed there tend to introduce frequency-dependent coefficients in the Biot acoustic equations (Dvorkin and Nur, 1993; Parra, 1997; Diallo and Appel, 2000; Chen et al., 2002; Yang and Zhang, 2002; Adelinet et al., 2011; Tang, 2011; Tang et al., 2012), while the Biot equations are considered within the frequency domain. Many papers do not consider satisfying the First and Second Principles of Thermodynamics as important. Furthermore, these problems are often neglected, even though these theories appear to be continual. It should be noted that conservation laws, principles of the equations' invariance with respect to the Galileo transform, and the First and Second Principles of Thermodynamics are the cornerstones of any continual physical theory that aspires to be accurate. Moreover, at the moment there seems to be little reported in regards to the comparison of the theoretically and experimentally obtained parameters of Stoneley waves for the microfractured porous media.|",,61

F., Samson Resources","|Abstract: |Integrated evaluation of unconventional shale is a basic need for drilling and evaluation, as well as for completion and production. A large number of isotropic and anisotropic rock properties were measured and thoroughly verified. One of the interesting observations during the study was the values obtained for Poisson's ratio for vertical transverse isotropic (VTI)-like material such as Haynesville shale. A typical nonsymmetrical Poisson's ratio obtained from reliable sources and measured in the current work was presented, compared and analyzed. The five elastic constants that describe constitutive behavior were critically reviewed. Finally, the Poisson's ratio was found to be nonsymmetrical, obeying the necessary equality with Young's modulus, which is rarely observed in the geomechanics literature. The nonsymmetrical Poisson's ratio has a special bearing in analyzing anisotropic materials behavior and is used for in-situ stress estimations and hydraulic fracturing. |Introduction |Integrated evaluation of unconventional shale is a basic need for drilling and evaluation, as well as for completion and production. These evaluations are necessary to assess the resources available, the type of hydrocarbon reserves, planning for the best potential well, the landing need from vertical to lateral, the direction of the well, the type of fluid to be used for drilling, how the well will respond to drilling, and how the well will respond to successive stages for hydraulic fracturing. Market research indicates that as much as $7B is spent on unconventional wells in the USA that do not reach or stay within the potentially highest-producing intervals of the reservoirs. In addition, approximately 70% of operators say they do not know enough about the unconventional subsurface. Only 30% of the time do operators claim to know enough to drill and complete wells with confidence. Consequently, it is necessary to understand the true behavior of shale, especially with its unique characteristics that are regularly used as inputs in models or computer code modeling for drilling, evaluation, completion or production. |A large amount of work was done in characterizing shale using an integrated approach that includes mineralogical, physical, mechanical and petrophysical properties, including downhole and laboratory measurements (LeCompte et al., 2009 [1]; Sone, 2012[2]; Prasad et al., 2015 [3]). However, often mechanical property details are ignored and not investigated because of complications originating from the fissile nature of shale. Sample preparation is difficult, and sometimes impossible. Further, the measured geomechanical properties show wide scatter, reflecting inherent depth variability and rock heterogeneity. Wireline logs provide near-continuous data but rarely yield direct measurements of rock mechanical properties, so correlations are needed to obtain static rock mechanical properties. It is very important to have quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) on laboratory-measured properties (Prasad et al., 2015 [3]) for calibrating log-based static rock mechanical properties because pre-existing correlations might not be adequate for a particular field. The present work shows a case study for characterizing Haynesville shale as an integrated approach at both ambient and 120°C. A special emphasis was given measuring and discussing non-symmetric Poisson's ratio from dynamic measurements.|",,36
799,800,2016-321,Influence of Recycled Rubber Tire Morphology on the Mechanical Properties of Well Cements,"Agapiou, K., Halliburton| Gamwell, C. R., Halliburton| Sodhi, T. S., Halliburton","|Abstract: |Recycled waste products are used for several applications in oil and gas well operations. Waste rubber tires are a recycled product that can be used as an additive in oilwell cement slurries and can impact the mechanical properties of the set cement placed down hole. Various forms of waste rubber tire are available that exhibit varying degrees of morphology; however, it is unclear if and how such varied morphologies influence the final properties of the cement. This paper presents an investigation of the effects of three forms of waste rubber tire—ground rubber tire, tire rubber crumb, and tire buffings —on the mechanical properties of oilwell cement systems. The waste rubber tire forms were analyzed using a number of methods to evaluate the physico-chemical properties of each type. Furthermore, set cement samples containing each of these waste rubber tire forms were subjected to a suite of mechanical properties testing to determine their influence on the cement mechanical properties. Cement composites containing ground rubber tire exhibited the greatest compressive and tensile strengths of those tested. Under the test conditions, no significant differences were observed in the elasticity of the composite samples containing different forms of waste rubber tire. Rubber crumb and tire buffings performed similarly from the perspective of compressive and tensile strength measurements—Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio—for their respective composites. |Introduction |Waste rubber tire (WRT) is a recycled product derived from a large volume of scrapped automobile tires, which otherwise would be disposed of by means of land filling, burning, use as a fuel source, pyrolytic processes, etc. (Thomas and Gupta, 2016). In the United States alone, over 300 million tires are discarded each year, and nearly 600 thousand tons of scrapped tires were disposed in landfills (Aslani, 2015). A significant quantity not landfilled is subjected to burning, which poses the health and environmental hazard of releasing gaseous pollutants (Thomas and Gupta, 2016; Ahmad et al., 2015). The growth of construction and civil engineering projects globally has led to an increase in the use of WRT as an aggregate in concrete (Thomas and Gupta, 2016; Aslani, 2015; Ahmad et al., 2015; Gesoglu et al., 2015; Lukose, 2013). Not only does WRT provide interesting properties and economic benefits to the resulting concrete composite, but the practice of recycling WRT into concrete products also contributes toward efforts to reduce quantities of Portland cement consumed, which ultimately impacts carbon dioxide levels derived from cement manufacturing. |WRT can be obtained in a number of forms (i.e., different morphologies and particle sizes), owing to the choice of manufacturing method. Generally, two processing systems are used to produce WRT–ambient processes and cryogenic process (Blumenthal, 1996). Ambient processes provide WRT of relatively large particle size and make use of mechanical processes that cut or grind tire rubber to specific sizes under ambient temperatures. Ambient processes provide WRT with coarse ground sizing (13 to 3 mm), fine grind sizing (2 to 0.6 mm), and ultra-fine sizing (< 0.6 mm). Cryogenic processes begin with approximately 2 in. shredded scrap tires that are introduced to liquid nitrogen, cooling the material to temperatures below -80°C. At these temperatures, the WRT is below its glass transition temperature and becomes brittle. The result is that the WRT under these conditions can be easily broken, crushed, and ground to the desired size. Cryogenic processes produce WRT that is smaller than 0.6 mm. In both ambient and cryogenic processes, the WRT is subjected to separation steps that remove undesirable contaminants, such as fiber and metal (e.g., steel).|",,42

These analyses represent a significant upgrade in modeling capability, as the following enhancements have been developed: a 6-million-element finite element model of the entire West Hackberry dome; cavern finite element mesh geometries fit to sonar measurements of those caverns; the full implementation of the multi-mechanism deformation (M-D) creep model; and the use of historic wellhead pressures to analyze the past geomechanical behavior of the caverns.

W., University of Toronto","|Abstract: |The use of cemented paste backfill (CPB) in the mining industry has increased over the past two decades. A comprehensive understanding of the stiffness development of CPB during early binder hydration stages has great impacts on the safety and economy of mines. Ultrasonic wave velocity measurements were performed to characterize the effect of relative humidity (RH) conditions and binder content on the stiffness development of CPB. In this paper the evolution of degree of hydration (DOH) is investigated for CPB with binder contents of 3% and 5% at different RH conditions to study the impact of cement hydration on stiffness development. An insight is presented on the development of shear wave velocity (Vs) with the ongoing hydration process during the first week after mixing. Developing self-desiccation suction in sealed samples was measured. The lack of significant early restraint by the paste to volume change resulted in the delay of the evolution of significant suction forces until high DOH is reached. The study concluded that low cement concentrations results in delaying the formation of solid paths and stiffness development. Therefore, changes in shear stiffness of the CPB and self-desiccation suction are not proportional to changes in DOH. |Introduction |Cemented paste backfill (CPB) has been increasingly used in the mining industry over the past two decades. Confidence in cemented paste backfilling systems has been increasing as it has the advantage of easy transportation to underground openings, rapid rates of backfilling, increased ore recovery, less water drainage concerns, and the environmental benefits of diverting tailings from surface storage. A comprehensive understanding of the strength and stiffness development of CPB during early binder hydration stages has a great impact on the safety and economy of mines. In particular, it helps to achieve safe and economic barricade designs and to optimize the backfilling process which impacts the scheduling of mining activities. Strength and stiffness development of CPB are believed to be mainly influenced by two factors, the binder content and type; and the curing relative humidity (RH) conditions. One of RH bounding conditions is when free water is available to compensate for pore water consumption ensuing cement hydration. The other bound is when CPB is left to air-dry. Stiffness development in CPB at both bounding RH conditions is investigated by studying the ongoing changes in ultrasonic wave velocities during the first week of curing by Galaa et al. (2011). Wave velocity measurements to characterise stiffness development of CPB was practiced in several studies such as Ercikdi et al. (2014), Yilmaz et al. (2014) and Yilmaz and Ercikdi (2015). In the area of cement and concrete research, ultrasonic wave velocities have been used to assess the hydration process and strength development by many researchers (e.g. D'Angelo et al. 1995, Boumiz et al. 1996, Chotard et al. 2001, Akkaya et al. 2003, Abo-Qudais 2005). Moreover, the effect of RH curing conditions in the context of strength assessment and/or autogenous shrinkage prediction is extensively studied in the concrete area (Molina 1992, Jensen and Hansen 2001, Lura et al. 2002). However, the water to cement (w/c) ratio in CPB is extremely higher than what is normally used in concrete. Consequently, various factors are found to be of influence on cement hydration in concrete and may not have the same level of significance in the case of CPB. Galaa et al. (2011) concluded that RH has a more significant effect on CPB than that of the binder content. In the current study, the degree of hydration is measured for identical samples at the same RH conditions in Galaa et al. (2011) in order to further investigate the conclusion drawn by the mentioned study. In addition, another RH condition is studied where samples are sealed, evaporation is neither allowed, nor free water supply is available.|",,39

Petrological properties were studied by thin section analysis. Both, synchrotron and neutron diffraction data were analyzed for preferred orientation with the Rietveld method. The program MAUD was used for texture analysis. Velocity measurements were done by classical measurements of P- and S-wave velocities using the pulse transmission technique at room temperature and pressures up to 600 MPa with a triaxial apparatus. There was also measured 3D velocity distribution of spherical samples by P- and S-wave ultrasonic sounding. Determination of P, S1 (fast) and S2 (slow) wave velocities enables to calculate a full stiffness tensor. The crack distribution from non-linear approximation of P-wave measurements on sphere was determined. From quantitative texture measurements, elastic properties are modelled by self-consistent averaging. Comparison of experimental and model Cij parameters is done based on microstructures. Both, results from diffraction methods and velocity measurements are compared. Good agreement between the velocity and microstructural models is observed. |Introduction |Serpentinites are formed at the top of subducting plates when fluids are liberated and transform olivine-bearing rocks [e.g. Bostock et al. 2002]. During subduction, serpentinites may deform and develop crystal preferred orientation as has been documented for samples from the Alps, Southern Spain, Cuba, Japan and China. Because of the high elastic anisotropy of antigorite crystals [e.g. Bezacier et al. 2010], representing the high-temperature type of the serpentine minerals, crystal alignment produces significant anisotropy of serpentinite slabs and may be responsible for the observed trench-parallel seismic anisotropy in subduction zones [e.g. Long and Van der Hilst, 2006]. Therefore, there has been a lot of interest in structural properties of serpentinites, not just natural samples but also in deformation experiments [e.g. Hirauchi, 2013]. |The goal is to quantify the microstructure and particularly crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) in this sample with modern diffraction methods, time-of-flight neutron diffraction and synchrotron Xray diffraction. We will then compare ultrasonic velocity measurements in three orthogonal directions on cubes with new 3D velocity determinations on spheres. The samples used for the seismic as well as for the texture measurements were prepared from the same block of serpentinite. Finally, we will predict elastic properties of the serpentinite based on CPO data and compare them with those that were actually measured.|",,61

The time history of displacements measured in the last 20 years shows that the ongoing deformation process is essentially a stationary creep phenomenon, also influenced by transient variations in pore pressure distribution. The movement was recognized after the discovery of intense cracking in the concrete lining of a hydraulic tunnel running across the slope, which will serve for water diversion from a rockfill dam, not yet in operation, located adjacent to the moving mass. Field investigations strongly suggest the ongoing movement takes place along a basal slip surface, formed by a tectonized clay rich interbed, with mobilized friction angle close to residual. The influence of reservoir level increase on the slope displacement and mobilized friction angle of the slip surface has been highlighted. The observed slope movement has been studied by employing viscoplastic model in 2D plane strain analyses (FLAC code). The steady state movement can be predicted reasonably using the model. Some creep analyses, carried out considering also the proposed stabilizing embankment at the toe of the slope have shown a substantial decrease in horizontal displacement velocity. |Introduction |The slope movement presented in this study was recognized in 1985 after the construction of a hydraulic tunnel in right bank of Chiascio river valley (Italy) (Fig. 1). The movement affects large portion of a ridge which has a longitudinal direction approximately perpendicular to the river valley. The moving mass accounts for about 18Mm3 and is creeping at an average velocity of 13-17 mm/y. |A rockfill dam was built in 1984 just downstream of the moving mass to create a reservoir at the toe of the slope for water supply by a diversion tunnel located on the right bank. Up to now, the reservoir behind the dam has never been impounded. The tunnel departs at the toe of the slope perpendicular to the valley and runs downstream crossing the slope in the east part (Fig.1). So far, the diversion tunnel has been operated only once, in 1991-1992, not for regular water conveyance but for temporary deviation of the river flow. |The first sign of the ongoing movement was seen from a damaged section of the diversion tunnel located well inside the ridge, at 250m from the intake structure under an average overburden depth of 50 m. The damaged tunnel stretch was soon interpreted as the place where the tunnel axis intersects a deep-seated slip surface.|",,61

W., The University of Arizona| Shu, B., The University of Arizona","|Abstract: |The intact rock properties and discontinuity properties for both Devonian Rodeo Creek (DRC) and Devonian Popovich (DP) rock formations that exist in the selected open-pit mine were determined from laboratory mechanical property tests conducted on rock samples. Special survey equipment was used to perform remote fracture mapping in the research area. From remote fracture mapping data, the fracture orientation, spacing, size and density were calculated using more refined procedures compared to what exist in the literature. Discontinuity orientation distributions obtained through remote fracture mapping agreed very well with the results of manual fracture mapping conducted by the mining company. The GSI system and Hoek-Brown rock mass failure criterion were used to estimate the rock mass properties combining the aforementioned fracture geometry parameter results with laboratory test results of intact rock samples. Fault properties and the DRC-DP contact properties were estimated based on the laboratory discontinuity test results and field discontinuity information. The built major discontinuity system of 44 faults in 3DEC with their real orientations, locations and three-dimensional extensions were validated successfully using the fault geometry data provided by the mining company using seven cross-sections. The displacements occurred between July 2011 and July 2012 due to the nearby rock mass excavation that took place during the same period were compared between the field monitoring results and the predicted numerical modeling results; the best agreement was obtained for k0 = 0.4. Therefore, k0 = 0.4 can be considered as the most probable k0 value for the studied mine site. Overall, the successful simulation of the rock excavation indicated the possibility of using the procedure developed in this study to investigate rock slope stability with respect to expected future rock excavations in mine planning. |Introduction |Large scale open-pit mine failures occur from time to time. Many mining companies spend millions of dollars on slope displacement monitoring equipment and technology to deal with rock slope failure problems, to ensure the safety of people and equipment, and to reduce economical loss. The deformations and possible failures that take place depend on the following factors: (a) the lithological system, (b) major and minor discontinuity geometry, (c) geo-mechanical properties of intact rock and minor discontinuities, (d) geo-mechanical properties of major discontinuities, (e) in-situ stress system, (f) groundwater conditions if applicable for the site and (g) dynamic loadings if applicable for the site. All these factors change from one mine to another. This means deformation monitoring data collected from one mine cannot be applied to predict the possible deformation and failure behavior for another mine. However, such predictions can be made by using either continuum or discontinuum stress analyses. Continuum numerical modeling methods have limitations of simulating large scale displacements and rotations that occur in discontinuous rock masses arising due to the presence of discontinuities; therefore, those methods may not be accurate enough to investigate the realistic behavior of rock slope stability problems. On the other hand the discontinuum numerical methods can simulate large scale displacements and rotations. Therefore, the discontinuum numerical methods are more appropriate than the continuum numerical methods to investigate the realistic behavior of rock slope stability problems.|",,3

Finally, a subsidence profile was constructed to show the subsidence at all locations along the length of the surface and region of influence on the surface. |Introduction |Surface subsidence is a significant problem affecting infrastructure, settlements and forests over underground workings. In this paper, a discussion on ore extraction, backfilling operations and the consequential surface subsidence is presented considering the case study of the Luohe mine in China. Luohe is an underground pyrite holding of the Magang Steel Company in the Anhui province of China. The 250 m thick orebody lies at a depth of 400 m (Magang, 2012a), under a significant number of surface infrastructure (Fig. 1) which need to be protected from any adverse consequences of mining the iron deposits. To limit the subsidence, the mine has adopted backfilling operations post extraction in all stopes. In this paper, a section of the unmined orebody is considered and analyses have been performed to predict the amount of subsidence that the region is likely to undergo due to the extraction methodology being currently adopted in the mine. |Because this study has attempted in incorporating the effect of in-situ stresses in the region, fault network, rock mass mechanical properties, interface features and backfilling operations on the subsidence, the discrete element method has been selected to carry out the analyses.|",,37
806,807,2016-339,Considerations on Slope Stability in a Jointed Rock Mass,"Cundall, P. A., Itasca Consulting Group, Inc.| Damjanac, B., Itasca Consulting Group, Inc.| Varun, _, Itasca Consulting Group, Inc.","|Abstract: |We consider a jointed rock mass in which significant brittle fracturing is necessary between discontinuous joint segments for overall failure to occur. Simple methods to determine slope stability in such a rock mass rely on assumptions about the behavior of rock bridges. We use simple examples to show such assumptions — for example, the notion of an equivalent shear strength — to be unjustified. Further, the fracture behavior of a joint segment may be influenced by the proximity of another joint segment, even if there is no fracturing between the segments. The conclusion is that small details of joint geometry may influence the stability of a slope. Since such details cannot be determined for in situ rock masses, it is believed that for the class of rock masses considered slope stability estimates must be assigned great uncertainty, or a large number of realizations must be considered to understand the range of outcomes and to determine the probability of failure. |Introduction |The methods by which the stability of slopes in jointed rock can be determined depend on the nature of the jointing. For pervasive jointing at a wide range of joint orientations, the rock may resemble a soil, so that soil-mechanics approaches (e.g., analyses of slip surfaces) may be appropriate. At the other extreme, for very sparse jointing in a weak rock fabric, a similar approach works. In both of these cases models based on continuum mechanics formulations are appropriate and have been used successfully for analysis of slope stability. The continuum rock mass properties, typically characterized by Mohr-Coulomb or Hoek-Brown failure criteria, are determined by using empirical relations to upscale strength parameters determined in laboratories on relatively small samples (e.g., 5 cm in diameter). These models usually show that failure mechanisms form as a result of shearing under confined conditions. The unconfined (UCS) and confined compressive strengths best characterize resistance of material to such a failure mode. Consequently, attention and resources are focused mostly on determination of compressive strength of intact rock and increasing the confidence in the failure criterion in the region where all principal stresses are compressive. In these kinds of rocks, similar to soils, stability of the slopes is often characterized by a single number, the factor of safety. Although the factor of safety of slopes is not uniquely defined, because the usual definition of <resisting-force/driving-force> cannot be used when such forces cannot be identified, the strength-reduction approach (Dawson et al., 1999) has been widely used. |For intermediate cases of joint spacing, where significant brittle fracturing between joints is necessary for overall failure, a different approach is needed. The failure of the rock mass, which can lead to slope instability, is a combination of sliding on pre-existing joints and failure of intact rock (or rock with discontinuities on a smaller scale) between pre-existing joints. The intact rock between pre-existing joints is often referred to as a rock bridge. For example, Read & Stacey (2009) discuss a method by which a composite slip surface is identified, with the surface consisting of a sequence of entities that may be joint segments or rock bridges. The latter entities apparently can either be intact rock or an equivalent rock mass volume that contains distributed small, disconnected fractures. The authors appear to assume that the mode of failure in the rock bridges is one of shearing.|",,39

P., Agapito Associates, Inc.| Yu, B., Agapito Associates, Inc.","|Abstract: |Creep plays an important role in mine design and ground control for potash solution mining. In order to predict the temporal evolution of underground caverns during and after solution mining, the long-term creep behavior of sylvinite and halite, i.e., secondary or steady-state creep rate, must be known. To date, however, only limited secondary creep test data for sylvinite and halite have been published. Additional laboratory compression creep tests results for sylvinite and halite samples from seven different potash projects worldwide were compiled in this paper. The influence of deviatoric stress, confining pressure, and temperature on secondary creep rate was evaluated based on these recent test data. Because the individual test conditions were originally designed to meet the specific needs of each project, the test conditions for the creep tests varied. The study in this paper is not a scientific study, however, it may be useful in regard to prediction of creep behavior of sylvinite and halite from potash deposits. This paper presents the results of those creep tests; summarizes the influence of deviatoric stress, confining pressure, and temperature on secondary creep rate, and; discusses an application of the creep test data to numerical modeling of potash deposits for mine design and ground control. |Introduction |Solution mining is a process whereby a leaching solution is injected through wells drilled into an ore deposit to dissolve and recover soluble minerals. Solution mining is widely used to extract potash deposits. Heated water or saturated sodium chloride (NaCl) solution is pumped into potash deposits through an injection well, and saturated brine is pumped out to the surface from underground caverns through a production well. Potash is then recovered from the saturated brine via recrystallization. |The ground response associated with underground cavern development from potash solution mining can affect cavern and pillar stability, injection and production well integrity, and surface structure integrity. Potash creep properties can greatly affect solution mining ground response. |Creep is characterized as a time-dependent deformation under constant load. Creep deformation can be divided into three different stages: primary creep, secondary creep, and tertiary creep. Primary creep starts at a rapid rate and slows with time. The secondary creep stage is the longest stage, with respect to time, and is the period during which creep rate tends to become constant. In the tertiary creep stage, creep rate accelerates and terminates upon rupture of the material. The secondary creep stage is of great interest due to its relevance for potash formations. Mining engineers are interested in the effects of cavern closure immediately after solution mining of potash and the rate of closure hours, days or weeks afterwards. Secondary creep rate is a function of confining stress and deviatoric stress. Increases in both deviatoric stress and temperature result in an increased creep rate.|",,61

The Lower O'Connor-A (LOA) seam has been displaced by a fault within the study area at the mine. The declines have been driven in relatively thin interburden and connect the existing mains in the LOA seam to the mains in the same coal seam in the proposed underlying mine level. The primary objective of the study was assess the roof and rib stability of both the declines and the connecting crosscut, while establishing a viable brow thickness above the decline entrance. The impact of driving the declines on the stability of the mains pillars in the proximity of the decline in the upper and lower levels were analyzed, while concurrently evaluating the effect of multi-seam mining in the lower level mains pillars. The study was performed using a combination of numerical modeling tools, LAMODEL and FLAC3D. The study results indicated likely rib and roof stability within the declines and crosscut, as well as the pillars in the vicinity of declines in both the mining levels. |Introduction |The Skyline Mine (Skyline) is a deep underground coal in Central Utah located southeast of Salt Lake City. A geotechnical evaluation was performed to assess the stability implications of driving two declines in the relatively thin interburden at the Skyline Mine. This study was performed prior to the work to evaluate the stability of two declines connecting the existing LOA seam mains in Mine-2 (mid-level) at Skyline to the LOA mains in the underlying SWR (Southwest Reserves, bottom level)), as the seam has been displaced by a fault. The proposed mains were developed after ramping down two declines from the existing mains in the up-thrust side of the LOA Seam to the down-thrust side. The newly developed mains are directly overlain by existing mains in the Lower O'Connor-B (LOB) Seam in Mine-2 (Figure 1) and sealed workings in Mine-1 (upper level) in the Upper O'Conner (UO) seam. Information from drill holes near the decline bottom indicated the SWR mains are separated from the Mine-2 mains by an interburden thickness of approximately 26 feet (ft). The SWR mains in the LOA seam will service several proposed longwall panels in the lowermost level. These mains are anticipated to be in service for upwards of 10 years. |Since the completion of the study, the mains have been developed by ramping down two declines from the existing mains in the up-thrust side of the LOA Seam to the down-thrust side. The interburden was excavated utilizing a continuous mining machine for the initial floor. A roadheader was then utilized to establish the brow, and was used for the remainder of the project. The declines were excavated at an angle of approximately 8 degrees from horizontal. The declines are spaced approximately 59-feet apart (rib-to-rib) and have their centerlines coincident with the mains entries in Mine-2 (mid-level) and SWR workings (lower level).|",,57

G., Sandia National Laboratories","|Abstract: |Oil leaks were found in two wellbores of the Big Hill Strategic Petroleum Reserve site. According to the field observations, two instances of casing damage occurred at the depth of the interbed between the caprock bottom and salt top. A three-dimensional finite element model, which contains wellbore blocks at the center of the caverns and allows each cavern to be configured individually, was constructed to investigate the wellbore damage mechanism. The causes of the damaged casing segments are a result of vertical and horizontal movements of salt dome top. To assess how much the wellbore impedes the movement of the salt top, a comparison of the analyses' results from meshes with and without the wellbore blocks was performed. This paper shows models that omit the wellbore blocks could be used for as an acceptable simplified simulation of Strategic Petroleum Reserve sites. |Introduction |The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) is a U.S. Government complex of four sites with deep underground storage caverns created in salt domes along the Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coasts. The caverns have a design capacity of 114 MMm3 and store emergency supplies of crude oil owned by the U.S. Government. |Oil leaks were found in wells of two caverns, Caverns 105B and 109B, at the SPR Big Hill (BH) site in southeastern Texas (Ehgartner 2010, Ehgartner 2011). The Cavern 105B leak started after December 3, 2009, and had progressed to 8600 barrels by May 14, 2010. The Cavern 109B leak started on October 8, 2010 and the total amount of oil leaked is estimated to be 2700 barrels. The locations of both leaks were found to be close to the interbed between the caprock and the salt dome. The wells of BH 114A and 114B were found to be in danger of starting to leak from interpretation of multi-arm caliper survey data (Wynn 2012). |The causes of the damaged casing segments are a result of vertical and horizontal movements of the interbed between the caprock and salt dome. The salt top subsides because the volume of caverns below the salt top decrease with time due to salt creep closure, while the caprock subsides at a slower rate because the caprock is thick and stiffer. This discrepancy produces a deformation of the well casings at the depth of the interbed (Park 2014 a).|",,11
810,811,2016-346,Roof Collapse Modeling with FLAC3D,"Tulu, I. B., NIOSH Pittsburgh Mining Research Division| Esterhuizen, G. S., NIOSH Pittsburgh Mining Research Division","|Abstract: |Recently, a numerical model based approach for support analysis has been developed at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). In this approach calibrated models are used to determine a stability factor for a supported entry. The stability factor is determined using the strength reduction method (SRM). The success of the SRM depends on the ability to accurately identify a collapsing or stable roof condition in the models. A collapse condition can be identified by considering the mechanical ratio and the velocity/acceleration of the roof grid points. It is found that during collapse, grid points of the zones within the collapsing roof move at least 50 to 100 times faster than in the remainder of the model. However, the default local damping scheme in FLAC3D attempts to arrest the collapsing roof, which may result in an incorrect assessment of roof stability. In order to solve this problem, combined damping is used. In addition, unloading of the model to simulate the excavation is controlled strictly with a relaxation algorithm to provide efficient energy dissipation. |Introduction |The strength reduction modeling technique has a long history in numerical model analysis in rock slope stability engineering (Lorig and Varona, 2000). This modeling technique was adapted to underground coal mine entry analysis by Esterhuizen (2015) to address the need for a method to compare the effectiveness of different support systems when designing ground support in coal mines. The SRM calculates a stability factor of the entry roof by gradually reducing the rock strength until failure is indicated. The stability factor is expressed as the inverse of the strength reduction factor. For example, if collapse occurs when the strength is reduced by a factor of 0.5, the entry stability factor will be 2.0. The stability factor can be used to assist in developing a final support design by comparing the effectiveness of various support systems and the stability of excavations under various geological and loading conditions, as demonstrated by Tulu et al. (2016). |The success of the SRM depends on the ability to accurately identify a collapsing or stable roof condition in the models. In this paper, a procedure to reliably identify the collapsing roof in a FLAC3D model is presented. |The Modelling Approach |The SRM stability factors are determined using the FLAC3D finite difference code (Itasca, 2014). A systematic procedure is used to estimate model inputs based on the Coal Mine Roof Rating (Esterhuizen et al., 2013a). Model calibration and validation studies were conducted to ensure that the developed modeling technique provides realistic estimates of the stability of mine entries. As part of the validation studies, model calculated stability factors were compared to the results of the empirically based Analysis of Roof Bolt Systems (ARBS) method (Mark et al., 2001). Outcomes of the validation studies are presented by Esterhuizen et al. (2013b, 2013c).|",,23

The systematic sensitivity study also points to a workflow for using field microseismicity to calibrate the geomechanical models, which can then be used as an optimization tool for future hydraulic fracture treatments in similar wells. A number of sensitivity studies of model input parameters are investigated including stress anisotropy, well orientations, DFN properties, and fluid viscosities. In addition, sensitivity studies are also used to understand the effect of various operational parameters on changes in various drilling and stimulation parameters. A series of charts showing the sensitivity of the model results (fracture geometry, net pressure, reservoir contact and microseismic activity) to both reservoir and completion parameters. The estimated results of these changes can then be used to guide field testing and fine-tune drilling and completions. Geomechanical attributes of the hydraulic fracture models can be imported in reservoir simulators for further optimization. |Introduction |Many standard hydraulic fracture simulators were developed for single fractures with simple planar geometries. Their ability to model multi-stage, multi-cluster fracturing of horizontal wells is generally very limited because it is often added using approximations and empirical correlations. In this work, a fully hydraulically-mechanical coupled 3-D model (Damjanac and Cundall, 2013) is used to conduct a comprehensive sensitivity study of factors affecting hydraulic fracture geometry (length, width and height), proppant placement and microseismicity during the stimulation of a horizontal well. A thorough understanding of these parameters on the reservoir geomechanics can be used as guiding principles for engineering design. |An important aspect of geomechanical modeling is the initial conditions, including stresses, fractures and mechanical properties. Gray et al., (2012) estimates geomechanical and stress parameters within a reservoir from analysis of 3D seismic data. In order to fully exploit the value proposition of seismic reservoir characterization, a workflow is needed to transform the information into a complete engineering tool. An appropriate method will improve decisions of drilling wells and hydraulic fracture stimulation. A geomechanical simulation of hydraulic fracture networks is a way of integrating discrete fracture networks, reservoir elastic and stress properties from 3D seismic to model expected hydraulic fracture characteristics and ultimately predict the expected microseismic response. A calibrated geomechanical model will facilitate the geological earth model and microseismic data with engineering injection parameters for a fully integrated interpretation of the hydraulic fracture.|",,27
812,813,2016-624,Using Scratch Tests for Rock Strength Determination in Discrete Element Method,"Joodi, B., Curtin University","|Abstract: |Discrete Element Method (DEM) has been used in many areas to capture the behavior of non-continuous systems. Several factors, however have restricted its application in geomechanics. One of the main drawbacks of this method is the extremely high CPU time required to model a relatively small rock sample with realistic grain size. It has been shown previously that the cutting specific energy, derived from the tangential force, estimates the specific energy. In this study, mechanical properties of a Bentheimer sandstone was determined by laboratory testing. The commercial Particle Flow Code in 3D (PFC3D) was used to simulate the rock sample. Micro-properties of the sample were calibrated to match the lab results. Extensive sensitivities carried out on cutter-to-particle size ratio, depth of cut, cutting speed and back-rake angle. The results showed that the cutter-to-particle size needs to be large enough for strength estimation. The fracture generation pattern was investigated and a peak at the beginning of all tests identified to be related to the formation of fractures ahead of the cutter. It was concluded that under controlled parameter range, the unconfined compressive strength of rock samples can be estimated by scratching test. A comparison of the required CPU time is presented, which shows significant reduction in the computation time. The main advantage was the ability to calibrate the micro-properties of samples with realistic grain sizes and shapes. Using UCS test simulation for this purpose was not practical, mainly due to hardware and time restrictions. |Introduction |The Uniaxial Compressive Strength (UCS) is the most important geomechanical input parameter for geomechanical modelling (Reyer and Philipp, 2014). It is the most frequently used procedure for mechanical characterization and the only criteria for numerous classifications of rocks (Borba et al, 2014). |ISRM standards for UCS measurement requires compressing a cylindrical plug between two metallic caps in a stiff system. The compressional stress on the rock sample increases gradually until the sample fails. The test results in the rock's UCS, Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio. |The method, although being popular in geomechanics, has several drawbacks. The samples need to be perfectly cut and polished from intact rock. Slight imperfections on the edges can have significant effects on the failure stress. The standard UCS test is destructive and the crushed samples normally cannot be used for any further testing. The results are also known to be sensitive to parameters like moisture content. The samples need to be chosen such that it is representative of the rock body. This may not be possible in the heterogeneous, fractured or layered rocks (Richard et al, 2012). The final measured strength is considered as the average for the interval of coring and it cannot capture the strength variation in smaller intervals.|",,61

The damage of the cement sheath may result in abnormal annulus pressure and potential leakage. So internal wellbore pressure window based on cement failure is introduced to preserve zonal isolation during different well stages. A Two-dimensional analytical model using a multi-layer thick-wall cylinder is applied for calculating stress distribution in the casing-cement-formation system. In the model, we assumed perfect bonding (continuous stress and displacement) at the interfaces and plane-strain condition. Then the internal pressure limits can be obtained using the cement failure criteria for both axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric stress fields. Analytical solutions of the 2D model subjected to the axisymmetric stress field showed that the stress state, the mechanical properties of casing, cement sheath and formation, cased wellbore geometry and cement strength parameters both have effects on the internal pressure window, which provides guidance for the cement design. This method provides petroleum engineers a robust tool to maintain cement sheath integrity. |Introduction |Cement sheath, as a part of well barriers, is expected to provide mechanical zonal isolation and borehole integrity during well construction and well life [1]. The damage of the cement sheath may result in abnormal annulus pressure and potential leakage. Hence, the increasing awareness of avoiding the cement sheath failure has been raised among researchers. Thus internal wellbore pressure window based on the cement failure is introduced to control the wellbore pressure during different well stages for safety. |After cement sets, casing-cement-sheath system withstand the stresses induced by the well events and maintain integrity during the life of well [2]. However, Cement sheath, casing and formation with different mechanical properties have different failure conditions. Many cases showed that abnormal annular pressure occurs without casing failure [1], which means that in some conditions the possibility of cement failure is higher than that of casing failure. So it is necessary to develop a model based on cement failure instead of casing failure, since cement failure happens prior to casing failure. On the other side, cement failure may destroy the wellbore integrity, creating flow channel for oil/gas migration between different formations. Excessive pressure and temperature change during well operations lead to significant damage to the cement sheath [3]. Thus we need to develop a model to determine the internal wellbore pressure window maintaining cement sheath integrity (neglecting temperature variation) during different well stages.|",,51

The calibrated fracture model includes an estimate of the propped portion of the fracture network and can then be used to investigate alternate designs to optimize the well, completion and injection to maximize the conductive fracture and thereby reservoir drainage. |Introduction |Development of unconventional reservoirs has transformed the energy industry, expanding hydrocarbon reserves into previously untapped, impermeable reservoirs. Economic exploitation of unconventional reservoirs requires an effective hydraulic fracture stimulation to enhance flow in these inherently low permeability formations, by injecting high pressure fluid to create fracture flow paths. Hydraulic fracture growth typically involves creation of new tensile fractures and interactions with pre-existing planes of weakenss in the reservoir, resulting in complex fracture networks. The hydraulic fracture growth is driven by the interplay between pressure diffusion and mechanical deformation, ultimately controlled by the dynamic hydraulic and geomechanical characteristics of the reservoir. The hydraulic and geomechanical factors are closely coupled, such that the high pressure fluids can cause fractures to dilate thereby enhancing flow and changing the pressure distribution. Localized fracture deformation can occur directly on the pressurized fractures as well as at more remote locations with the associated stress field perturbations. Utlimately, proppant particles including with the fracturing fluid keep the fracture open and permeable after the end of injection. |The geomechanical component of the fracture growth can lead to inelastic strain and associated microseismicity that is commonly monitored to image the hydraulic fracture network. The microseismicity represents one specific component of the geomechanical deformation, often the instantaneous shear fracture slip along pre-existing planes of weakness. Nevertheless, the microseismicity provides important geomechanical information about the dynamic geomechanical processes. Understanding the coupled geomechanical and hydaulic processes is key to understanding the fracture geoemetry and contact with the reservoir and more crucially the proppant placement and associated enhanced permeability. Ultimately, a customized hydraulic fracture design can be defined for specific reservoir conditions to both enhance production and optimized operational costs.|",,21

During the production, the integrity of the casing–cement–formation system is generally damaged by perforation and fracturing operation, leading to failure of fracturing operation. Experiments indicates that Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion may fail in a HPHT condition when doing simulation applied to hydraulic fracturing. In this paper, triaxial tests of cement samples are carried out under HPHT condition. Cement samples are scanned by SEM to analyze the micro damage mechanism. Finite element simulation of fracturing process in casing well is done to analyze the integrity of the casing– cement–formation system. Experiments show cement sheath strength decreases in an extreme HPHT condition because the micro structure has already been destroyed by the long-term high pressure. The simulation shows that cement with low Young's modulus and high Poisson's ratio is crucial to retain the integrity of the casing–cement–formation system. Fracturing operations should be initiated on sections of cements with lower Young's modulus and higher Poisson's ratio. The experiment results and simulation model proposed can not only gain insight into interaction of casing metal, cement and rock, but also optimize the design of perforation operation for reservoir stimulation in casing wells. |Introduction |During well cementing operation, cement hardens to form cement sheath, and then form the casing-cement-formation system. Cementing is an important procedure for well completion. The ultimate purpose is to provide effective zonal isolation of the formation which have been penetrated by the wellbore. Once a well is put into production, the wellbore conditions will change under various processes, such as casing perforation, fracturing stimulation, acid treatment, etc. Pressure increases when perforation accompanied with the firing of the guns can lead to cement damage. If fracturing stimulation or acid treatment is adopted, the increase of the wellbore pressure is more harmful to the casing-cement-formation system because the fluid pressure is high and the fluid injection lasts from minutes to hours. Moreover, the change of external loading can be applied to the cement sheath. For example, the pressure on the external surface of the cement sheath will increase because of formation creep. In this case, it may lead to fracture propagation or annulus cracks around the cement sheath, eventually lead to the failure of fracturing operation. Scholars have done a lot of experiments to study the properties [1-3] of cement sheath. Many scholars [4] also studied the effect of wellbore pressure on the cement sheath, used the analytical model to predict well life and using a finite element model to simulate the actual working conditions. Experiments indicates that Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion may fail in a HPHT (high pressure and high temperature) condition [5-7], so the actual failure criterion in HTHP condition must be reconsidered when doing simulation. |In this study, triaxial tests are performed under various confining pressures and temperatures for cement samples.

CAES facilities are designed to deliver full-power capacity in a very short time period, which implies high gas-production rates and multiple yearly pressure cycles. A decrease in gas temperature during a pressure drop depends upon gas pressure, withdrawal rate and cavern size. Thermal tensile stresses, resulting from gas cooling, may generate fractures at the wall and roof of a salt cavern. However, thermal stresses do not penetrate deep into the rock mass. These fractures are perpendicular to the cavern wall. The distance between two parallel fractures becomes larger when fractures penetrate deeper in the rock mass, as some fractures stop growing. These conclusions can be supported by field observations, closed-form solutions and numerical computations based on fracture mechanics. |Cavern Thermodynamics |Salt caverns are deep cavities (from 200 m to 3000 m) that are connected to the ground level through a cased and cemented well. One to several strings are set in the well to allow injection or withdrawal of fluids into or from the cavern. These caverns are created by solution mining in both bedded and domal salt formations; they range in volume from 5000 m3 to 5,000,000 m3. When solution mining is completed, the cavern can be filled with crude oil, LPG, natural gas, hydrogen, compressed air, etc. In this paper, we mainly are interested in the thermal and mechanical effects of gas withdrawal (and injection) in a Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES). |Energy Balance |Gas temperature can be considered almost uniform throughout the entire volume of a cavern. Gas effectively is stirred by thermal convection as the geothermal gradient (Ggeo = 1.6–1.8°C/100 m is typical) is larger than the dry adiabatic gradient (Gad = g/Cp, g = 10 m/s2, CP = 2345 J/kg-°C = for natural gas; CP = 1000 J/kg-°C for air), below which no convection appears (Berest et al., 2012). In a typical gas cavern, the Grashof and Prandtl numbers are so large that convection is turbulent. The actual thermal gradient, G, in the cavern is small. Fosse and Rovang, 1998, measured G = 0.39°C/100 m and 0.50°C/100 m in two gas caverns at Etzel in Germany. Kneer et al., 2002, computed that the temperature difference between the top and the bottom of a 200-m high cavern was 0.5°C. An exception was found when cold brine was left at cavern bottom, hindering onset of thermal convection (Crotogino et al., 2001, Klafki et al., 2003, Skaug et al., 2010).|",,50

In this study, the initiation and propagation of borehole breakout under monotonically increased far-field stress at reduced-scale are investigated using discrete element method (DEM). The micro-structure of Mancos shale is captured by explicitly representing the presence of weakness with a series of parallel smooth joint contacts. Square samples (50 mm<U+00D7>50 mm) with a 10 mm borehole in the center are loaded until the formation of breakouts. Effects of different factors on the borehole breakout process are evaluated systematically, including the borehole diameter, rock anisotropy and far-field stress conditions. Reduction of borehole diameter significantly increases the hydrostatic pressure. Rock anisotropy plays an important role in the stress state around wellbore which lead to the formation of preferred cracks under hydrostatic stress. Under anisotropic far-field stresses, V-shapes borehole breakouts align with the direction of minimum principal stress in isotropic model and close to the minimum principal stress orientation in anisotropic model. Results from this study agree well with those obtained in laboratory on hollow cylinder tests and can provide in-depth understanding on the grain-scale mechanisms that control the previous observations in laboratory and field on the borehole instability in anisotropic rocks. |Introduction |In recent years, with the increasing exploitation of unconventional shale gas/oil reservoirs using deviated drilling, a number of borehole instability problems were experienced in field (Okland and Cook, 1998). Stressinduced borehole breakouts cause major problems during and after drilling. The integrity of wellbore is influenced by several factors, e.g., the in-situ stress state, anisotropy of rock deformability and strength, the applied mud weight, and drilling direction (Zhang, 2013). Moreover, horizontal drilling has been extensively used in anisotropic shale formations, which are more sensitive to the effect of rock anisotropy (Ong and Roegiers, 1993). Therefore, understanding the underlying mechanisms for borehole breakout mechanisms associated with anisotropic formations is essential in optimizing well production. |Numerical and analytical analyses have been extensively adopted to evaluate and predict the failure of borehole in anisotropic rock formations for several decades. Most rock mechanics analysis on stability of openings in rock formations should involve two key steps, first, the calculation of borehole stress distribution for rocks, and second, a stress-related failure criteria (Gaede et al., 2012). Among the numerous proposed models in the literature, a linear elastic and isotropic constitutive model, in conjunction with a linear failure criterion, is perhaps the most common approach. However, shale is known to exhibit anisotropic properties not only for their elastic behavior but also for their strength due to their laminated structure. The analytical solution of the nearwellbore stress distribution in anisotropic formations was developed by Amadei et al. (1983). The determined stress field is then used to evaluate the damage of the formation in the borehole vicinity. Stress redistribution after the creation of fractures is a dynamic process which is difficult to be captured by constitutive modeling. These uncertainties make it difficult to predict and control failure around underground openings.|",,4

M., NTNU| Vilarrasa, V., EPFL","|Abstract: |Safe injection of a fluid, like carbon dioxide (CO2), into geological formations is an essential part of CO2 storage and enhanced oil recovery (EOR) projects. Injection causes pressure changes inside the reservoir, thus changing effective and total stresses inside and outside of the reservoir. These changes can bring the reservoir and/or its surroundings to failure conditions. The existence of faults and weak zones increases the likelihood of failure in rock masses depending on the amount of the injection-induced changes and the formation properties. This paper discusses the stress changes in different reservoir and injection conditions. To do so, an in-house numerical code (MDEM) was used. Analysis indicates that the pressure buildup can significantly change the total and effective stresses. Also, the presence of a fault can influence the stress changes at the fault vicinity, both in the cap rock and the upper portion of the reservoir depending on the fault properties and the in situ stress regime. Simulation results show that the upper portion of the reservoir and the cap rock experience a greater decrease in the mean effective stresses and a greater increase in the deviatoric stress in the footwall of the fault in reverse faulting stress regime. This means that the presence of faults can bring some parts of the reservoir and the cap rock to a more unstable condition. But this does not necessary mean that the fault is unstable itself. Analysis indicates that due to injection, i.e., unloading of the reservoir, faults can deform elastically and the pore pressure difference between the reservoir and the cap rock and/or underlying layer leads to different stress changes compared to the reservoir center. |Introduction |Fluid injection operations related to geo-energies are becoming more frequent. Geo-energies aim at significantly reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to the atmosphere to mitigate climate change. In particular, carbon capture and storage (CCS) has been proposed as one of the most feasible options in the short-term to reduce CO2 emissions (IEA, 2010). Nevertheless, the cost of CCS may hinder the deployment of CCS projects. Thus, giving an additional value to CO2 injection through its utilization to obtain an economic benefit will motivate CO2 storage in the subsurface. An option of carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) is enhanced oil recovery using CO2 (CO2-EOR), as it has been done at Weyburn, Canada, since 2000 (Verdon et al., 2011). |Most of the research involving geomechanics related to geologic carbon storage considers extensive aquifers without including faults (e.g., Gor et al., 2013; Vilarrasa, 2014; Goodarzi et al., 2015). However, the pressure perturbation cone will extend over large distances (up to hundreds of km) for the duration of CO2 injection, which is planned to last over several decades (Birkholzer et al., 2009; Vilarrasa and Carrera, 2015). Thus, faults present in the far-field will be affected by injection. Additionally, the available storage formations will not always be extensive and injection may have to be done in reservoirs limited by faults (Castelletto et al., 2013), like at Snohvit, Norway (Hansen et al., 2013). Furthermore, mature oil reservoirs for CO2-EOR are usually compartimentalized, so the assumption of extensive formation may not be applicable.|",,50

Unlike in traditional methods that rely on the use of an electronic device, such as strain gauges or load cells, these new methods do not use electronic devices for reading data, but instead use mechanical schemes to measure axial forces at the same time. Since the methods are electricity free, they are maintenance free, long-lasting and can be produced at low costs. The methods are also beneficial in terms of safety management since the costs of axial forces measurements are low and can visualized for workers at all times. The concepts for designing the new devices, lab test results and some field application examples are introduced in this paper. |Introduction |It is of primary importance to grasp axial forces in ground supporting members, such as rock bolts or ground anchors as pointed by Conover (2010). As they are installed with an important mission to suppress deformation of rock masses, it is ideal that axial forces acting in them are grasped at all times for the purpose of safety management. Standard methods for monitoring axial forces are based on use of load cell inserted behind a base plate, or strain gauges attached to main tendon or rock bolt (for example, Hyett and Spearing, 2012). These schemes require electronics hardware for data collection. On-Site Visualization of measured axial force, using electricity, has been proposed by Akutagawa (2012) and the importance of sharing measured information on a real-time basis has been pointed out by Izumi et al. (2014). However, it is often the case that axial forces of up to only 5% of all the ground supporting members are usually monitored, if at all, because of required cost to do so. In order to increase the ratio of monitored ground anchors or rock bolts, for the sake of safety management, a new series of techniques, all of which work without using electricity, were developed to measure axial forces as 1) needle rotation, 2) magnified deformation between a specially created gap on an anchor plate and 3) change in crack patterns appearing on a bearing plate of a rock bolt. Principles and applications of these new techniques are introduced in this paper.|",,15
820,821,2016-620,Failure Criterion with Intermediate Stress and Two Friction Angles,"Labuz, J. F., University of Minnesota| Makhnenko, R. Y., Laboratory of Soil Mechanics, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL)| Harvieux, J. T., Stanford University","|Abstract: |For many rock types, Mohr-Coulomb (MC) failure criterion is a reasonable approximation to strength data, featuring a linear relation with two principal stresses and two material parameters that describe a stress intercept (e.g. uniaxial compression or uniform triaxial tension) and pressure sensitivity (e.g. internal friction angle ?). A criticism of MC is the absence of the intermediate principal stress. Paul-Mohr-Coulomb (PMC) criterion removes that limitation by including three principal stresses. PMC has the advantage over other multi-axial stress criteria in that three material constants, such as one stress intercept and two friction angles, one for compression ?c and one for extension ?e, are readily identified. |PMC failure criterion is reviewed and data from a series of conventional triaxial compression and extension experiments on Indiana limestone are analyzed. The extension friction angle is larger than the compression friction angle, a sufficient but not necessary condition of the intermediate stress effect. To capture the behavior of the rock in multi-axial loading, PMC is extended to include the results of plane strain compression experiments through the construction of two planes with six parameters. |Introduction |A failure criterion can always be written as a function of principal stresses <U+03C3>I <U+2265> <U+03C3>II <U+2265> <U+03C3>III or <U+03C3>1, <U+03C3>2, <U+03C3>3 with no regard to magnitude. As proposed by Paul (1968), and in a special form by Haythornthwaite (1962), the simplest failure criterion applicable to rock in the brittle regime is a linear function: |(equation) |Meyer and Labuz (2013) named this failure criterion Paul-Mohr-Coulomb (PMC) and wrote it as |(equation) |where Vo is the theoretical – it is not measured – uniform triaxial (all-around equal) tensile strength and |(equation) |where ?c is the friction angle for compression (<U+03C3>II = <U+03C3>III) and ?e is the friction angle for extension (<U+03C3>II = <U+03C3>III). PMC can be evaluated by performing conventional triaxial testing on a right circular cylinder, where axial stress <U+03C3>a |is applied independent of radial stress <U+03C3>r to achieve either compression failure, which involves axial shortening, or extension failure, which involves axial lengthening. Note that Mohr-Coulomb (MC) criterion is recovered when ?c = ?e = ? (Nc = Ne), with Vosin? = Socos?; So is the shear stress intercept on a Mohr plane known as cohesion. PMC and MC are approximations to the observed failure response, which exhibits a nonlinear variation of strength with mean stress P = (<U+03C3>1+<U+03C3>2+<U+03C3>3)/3, although PMC contains the intermediate principal stress <U+03C3>II, which for many rock types, influences strength (Paterson and Wong 2005; Mogi 2007; Haimson and Rudnicki 2010; Ingraham et al. 2013; Cornet 2015).|",,0

K., Itasca Consulting Canada","|Abstract: |Rock blasting is an economically efficient method to break and move rock. An improved predictive capability of blast outcomes leads to greater efficiency. Numerical modeling of rock blasting is beginning to see wide spread practical use. The physical processes occurring in rock blasting span six orders of magnitude in length-scale, time-scale and pressure. The interactive physical processes involved are time-dependent, non-linear, difficult to quantify experimentally and occur in a discontinuous, heterogeneous medium. These factors present a significant challenge to the modeler. Itasca Consulting Group has developed a three dimensional numerical model of rock blasting based on the discrete element method. The software, called Blo-Up, was developed as part of the industry sponsored Hybrid Stress Blast Model (HSBM) project. The model is unique as it employs a combination of continuous and discrete numerical methods. Blo-Up is a model of the complete blasting process including detonation, crushing, fragmentation, burden movement and muckpile formation. This paper gives a description of the modeling method and a summary of recent applications. Recent applications include (i) analysis of pre-split and trim blast designs to limiting high wall damage and (ii) optimization of sub-level cave ring design. |Introduction |Since 2001, Itasca has been a member of the Hybrid Stress Blast Model (HSBM) project with the goal of developing a numerical model of the rock blasting process.

Mineralogy is a key parameter in the description of sedimentary formations, and it influences decisions made in oilfield formation evaluation, drilling, completions, and production. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy has become an alternative to commonly accepted X-ray diffraction (XRD) for quantitative mineral analysis. This study introduces two analytical improvements to previously published FTIR procedures, provides a direct comparison of FTIR and XRD mineral solutions, and demonstrates the higher accuracy of the FTIR results. The improvements address two known challenges for FTIR—cloudy pellets and the presence of adsorbed water on the potassium bromide (KBr) pellet and in the resulting infrared spectra. Historically, most of the pellets that are produced are clear, but many are cloudy, which scatters the infrared light. With a modification to the pellet pressing technique, uniformly clear pellets are generally obtained. The second problem arises because KBr is hygroscopic and water adsorbed to the pellet absorbs infrared light in broad bands located between 3200 and 3600 cm–1, which overlap those of clay and mica minerals and interfere with qualitative and quantitative interpretation of the infrared spectrum. Fortunately, a secondary absorbance region of the adsorbed water is not shared with that of the clay and mica hydroxyls, and the improved technique uses this region to effectively mitigate the measurement problem.
The accuracy of the enhanced FTIR technique for quantitative mineral analysis is validated and compared to that achievable by commercial XRD using independently measured elemental concentrations. In the quality control of mineralogy (QCMIN) procedure, major element (Si, Ca, Al, K, Na, Mg, Fe, and S) concentrations are reconstructed from bulk mineralogy and compared with independently measured elemental concentrations on the same samples. The sum of the average absolute differences between reconstructed and measured concentrations of the eight elements is the QCMIN score. For an assemblage of 84 oilfield samples, the QCMIN score from FTIR is 3.2—substantially better than a QCMIN score of 10 from analysis of the same samples by multiple, commercial XRD laboratories.
As oilfield exploration and production moves to increasingly complex sedimentary environments, accurate mineral analysis is ever more crucial in appraisal, drilling, completion, and production decisions. FTIR provides this analysis, with an accuracy that is consistently superior to industry XRD.|","Document Type

The inherent natural fractures (NF) in the rock fabric provide enhanced porosity and permeability, whereas induced hydraulic fractures (HF) provide pathways for hydrocarbon flow into the wellbore. Understanding hydraulic fracture mechanism and its interaction with natural fractures plays a vital role in assessment of stimulated rock volume (SRV) and prediction of flow rates. |Barmer Hill formation in Mangala & Aishwariya area of Barmer Basin (North West India) is a low permeability laminated Diatomite/Porcellanite reservoir with high porosity (20-35%) but low matrix permeability (0.2- 4mD). Conventional cores, image logs, and well test data suggest presence of natural fractures in this reservoir. After the initial success of production testing with HF in appraisal/development wells, it was felt necessary to understand the NF-HF interaction in these reservoirs for large scale field development. |Understanding of rock failure mechanism and geomechanical properties (Young’s Modulus, Poisson’s Ratio and Uniaxial Compressive Strength) are important in designing a frac job. However, well flow rates are very much dependent on the rock fabric and natural fracture characteristics. Hence better understanding of interaction of hydraulic fractures with natural fractures is essential for successful field development. |To understand NF-HF interaction, an innovative idea was tested using time lapse image log acquisition plan during multiple phases of induced hydraulic fracture operation. Generally, oil-base mud is used for drilling in this area to avoid shale stability problems; however, Well-X was drilled with water base mud in Aishwariya Field to obtain high-resolution micro-resistivity imaging. A pre-frac “base” Image log (Run-1) was acquired to identify laminations and presence of natural fractures & their orientation. Consecutively induced hydraulic fracture was initiated using water and then by proppant separately in two operations. Image logs were acquired after each operation as Run-2 (post step rate test-1) and Run-3 (post step rate test-2). |Base image log indicated variations in angle and distribution of natural fractures in different units of Barmer Hill. Comparison of subsequent image logs brought out that while the rock was relatively resistant when homogeneous on image logs, the laminations helped in hydraulic fracture initiation. Presence of pre-existing fractures at high angle (>30deg) helped in fracture initiation while no hydraulic fractures could be generated where low angle fractures (<15 deg) existed. This is in agreement with the principle of critically stressed fractures. It was also evident that new induced fractures were created using water & proppant and also further accentuated the natural fractures. Micro-seismic monitoring in key wells in the Barmer Hill also confirmed that the rock develops tensile failure along maximum horizontal stress direction in this low anisotropy environment along with frac continuity between the layers. This innovative field experiment was also useful to understand the rock behavior at micro & mega-scale. |This innovative data acquisition program is “first in type” and can act as a benchmark study to understand the natural/hydraulic fracture interaction in fractured reservoirs. |","Document Type

Understanding structural traps surrounding salt domes can be difficult where the surface seismic does not have sufficient penetration ability or resolution. The use of borehole acoustic data with its higher frequency, coupled with its source and receiver configuration, provides the potential to help resolve some of this ambiguity. Recently, an improved borehole acoustic acquisition sequence provided the ability to see much deeper into the formation in a deviated well. This improved detection was achieved by utilizing all the information captured in the waveform in addition to the standard guided acoustic modes. The combination of this sequence with new processing methods produced a new directional capability to obtain key structural parameters for the exploration and development of an offshore resource in the Gulf of Mexico.
This technology was developed to understand the well position in relation to structure in poorly consolidated sediments where the surface seismic resolution is compromised. Although the acoustic data were acquired in unconsolidated formations, the method enabled evaluation more than 100 feet from the wellbore imaging beds and faults, resulting in refinement of the reservoir architecture and potential connectivity.
This paper includes a case history that shows an integrated validation of the structural elements at the borehole wall with standard borehole images and induction resistivity-derived dips as well as the extension into the surrounding rock using acoustic body waves generated in the formation by a dipole acoustic source. It is well known that the dipole source generates a borehole-guided flexural mode that is utilized for borehole acoustic shear measurements. In addition to the borehole guided mode, the dipole source also creates acoustic compressional and shear body waves that radiate from the borehole into the formation. Given the correct geometry, these body waves can be reflected back to the borehole, enabling structures and features to be imaged. By utilizing the azimuthal sensitivity of the dipole, the strike of the structure can be determined and further refined by the integration of additional information.
Future development of the service is being extended to a 3D volume, enabling visualization of the salt dome and associated structures. In horizontal wells, this 3D visualization enables detection of layers above and below the wellbore as well as reflectors often associated with natural fractures and faults, both intersecting and non-intersecting with the borehole.|","Document Type

Proper placement of the lateral section of a horizontal well in the reservoir is of fundamental importance to the success of the well. Reservoir navigation (commonly known as real-time geosteering) plays a key role for drillers trying to maintain the well trajectory within the desired interval. However, various geologic features, either crossing the well-bore or present around it, can impact the well performance in a variety of ways that can affect operational efficiency and well productivity. As such, during the completion design phase, operators have to choose between the options to either avoid or target these features.
Recent enhancements in the processing techniques of wireline acoustic data have made it possible to locate and characterize the distribution of acoustic reflections and other wave-field attributes such as near-well fractures, faults and other structural features including bedding boundaries out to more than 100ft from the wellbore. This new deep shear wave imaging technique (DSWI), in combination with the reservoir navigation analysis allows high-grading of completion design efforts, by helping to verify the correct well placement in the target formation, and in identifying precise location of geologic hazards, such as faults, thief zones and naturally fractured intervals along the lateral.
The acoustic data for this application can be acquired in horizontal wells, both in open hole and through casing. In the studied well acoustic data was recorded inside of a cemented 5.5 in. casing and processed to identify reflected acoustic signal. Deep shear wave imaging results and reservoir navigation analysis data were then integrated to design a multi-stage, plug-n-perf completion. This combination of data was used successfully to identify multiple through-going faults along the lateral, which were potential communication pathways with the underlying aquifer. The fracture stages and perforation placement strategy was designed to avoid hydraulic fracture in the faulted intervals, thereby limiting the risk of connecting to the water zone below the well.
To better understand the reservoir's response to the hydraulic fracture treatment (HF) in this well, real-time microseismic monitoring was used, having this data made possible to make decisions on the fly, such as the identification of faults which could potentially create pathway to the Edwards aquifer below the lateral. Inadvertent connection to the Edwards aquifer has occurred in all previous wells in the area, resulting in a corresponding loss of the investment. The combination of reservoir navigation, deep shear wave imaging and micro seismic monitoring allowed us to successfully treat this well, enhancing production while avoiding creation of a pathway into the underlying aquifer.|","Document Type

Acoustic velocities are one of the key measurements for production enhancement and increased drilling efficiency in unconventional reservoirs, but the environment can present considerable complications to accurate data interpretation. Because these reservoirs are often produced by way of horizontal boreholes through shales, the sonic logs respond to intrinsic shale anisotropy, natural fractures, drilling induced stress, and nearby beds above or below the target formation. These intertwined effects frequently lead to misinterpretations such as picking a compressional slowness from an approaching bed but the shear slowness from the current formation, leading to odd (and confusing) geomechanical results. Other times, shale anisotropy is inadvertently assumed to be linked to natural fracture networks. Interpretations from different vendors, and even different analysts within the same team might vary greatly due to different processing methods. Thus, we need to consider the various aspects of sonic response in horizontal wellbore through unconventional reservoirs and proscribe a workflow and quality control regime to ensure consistent and valid results.
We begin with a discussion of the unconventional reservoir applications which require sonic data as key inputs, followed by a brief review of 3D anisotropy. The remainder of the work focuses on understanding the complex sonic log responses in horizontal shale reservoirs. A workflow is described, with the goal of correctly determining the compressional and shear velocities for the bed in which the tool resides as well as the nearby beds. Several field examples will be examined in detail, describing the correct methods for interpretation and the common pitfalls. Examples of how incorrectly interpreted results impact formation evaluation calculations follow. Finally, operational recommendations to optimise sonic data collection in shale reservoirs will round out the discussion.|","Document Type

This paper describes new modeling capabilities and processing/inversion workflows to output dipole shear anisotropy answer products, such as the fast and slow dipole shear slownesses; and the fast-shear polarization direction. A major objective is to model the coupling between the drill-collar and formation flexural modes and invert either of these two modes for the formation dipole-shear slowness. A new dispersion extraction algorithm isolates and identifies both of these dispersive arrivals in the recorded wavetrain. This is followed by a model based inversion of either the drill-collar flexural or formation flexural dispersions to obtain the dipole shear slownesses either in a fast or slow formations. The inversion algorithm inverts a dipole flexural dispersion in a chosen bandwidth where the dispersion sensitivity to the formation shear is significant.
In a fast formation, the modeling results reveal that the two coupled (drill-collar and formation) modes show complementary features in terms of the shear sensitivity and the signal strength. That is, at low frequencies, the formation flexural mode has high sensitivity to the shear slowness but weak signal strength. On the other hand, the drill-collar flexural mode at high frequencies exhibits less but still a considerable amount of shear sensitivity with strong signal strength. Against the misconception that the drill-collar mode only interferes with the formation mode with no useful information, this paper shows that it is possible to use both dipole drill-collar and formation flexural modes to maximize the reliability of extracting the formation dipole-shear slowness from the coupled flexural dispersions.
The proposed workflow is first validated with synthetic datasets in both the fast and slow formations and then applied to two field datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time in the industry to systematically output the fast and slow shear slownesses from a directional dipole firing that would enable complete anisotropy characterization in unconventional organic-shale resources.|","Document Type

The goal of this study is to define a uniform organic matter (OM) correlation for North American shales with fundamental petrophysical parameters taken into consideration. Several log based methods to calculate volume of OM have been developed over the past several decades. This paper compares three of the most common OM correlation techniques in twelve different North American shales. The techniques evaluated are a density based approach similar to Schmoker's relation, a gamma ray based approach similar to that used by Boyce and Schmoker, and Passey's <U+0394>LogR method. It has been hypothesized that thermal maturity, kerogen type, lithofacies, redox potential, sedimentation rate, age and organic source will have a large effect on the shape of the correlations. However, the data shows that despite both geologic and geographic differences, the apparent slope, intercept and LOM values are very similar. In fact, one correlation can often be used in the absence of any additional data.
The Leco and Rock-Eval6® total organic carbon (TOC) measurements in this paper are taken from a core consortium for North American shales and other public core data. For LECO TOC, the samples have been digested in HCL to remove inorganic carbon and in some cases run through a soxhlet extraction if oil based mud was present. For Rock-Eval6 TOC, the samples have been submitted to pyrolysis and oxidation using a discrete temperature program. Log data (density/gamma ray) was used to create correlations because it is more representative of subsurface conditions and less prone to alteration, although there are issues with vertical resolution and depth corrections. Further the log data was normalized to remove any bias based on logging vendor and vintage. All values in this paper have been converted from weight% TOC to volume% OM.|","Document Type

829,830,2016-N,Deploying a Fit-For-Purpose Formation Evaluation Program to De-Risk Tight Gas Sand Plays,"de Oliveira Neto, Jose Murta, BG Group plc. – A Royal Dutch Shell subsidiary| Pritchard, Tim, BG Group plc. – A Royal Dutch Shell subsidiary","|Abstract
Unconventional reservoirs present several challenges for petrophysical analysis where uncertainties are often much larger when compared to the usual conventional reservoirs. These low porosity and permeability rocks are associated with complex mineralogical properties and require an integrated approach to better characterize the reservoir, starting from a fit-for-purpose logging suite, the acquisition of high quality core and the implementation of an optimised core analysis program.
In this paper the authors discuss an approach used to de-risk a tight gas play, where they made particular use of NMR log and Dean-Stark analysis for porosity and water saturation model calibration. OBM drilling fluids could not be used due to environmental restrictions consequently Deuterium Oxide (commonly known as D2O) was used to dope the water based drilling mud, to discriminate between the volumes of mud filtrate and formation water within the formation.
The formations intercepted by the boreholes proved to have similarities from a stratigraphic/geological point of view, but showed significant differences when seeking to define producible water volumes using NMR estimates of irreducible water saturation (Swi) and core derived water saturations. In Well#1 resistivity derived water saturations were low and very close to NMR irreducible water saturations suggesting little or no formation water should be produced. In contrast in Well#2, a much more conglomeratic rock, a discrepancy was observed between core derived water saturations and NMR irreducible water saturations suggesting that this formation was not a irreducible water saturation and would likely contain producible water. It was also noteworthy that there existed a salinity variation between the two wells, where in Well #2 for formation water was more “fresh-brackish” then in Well #1.
Well #1 was subsequently fracture stimulated and produced a mixture of gas, condensate and water (assumed to be frac fluid – based on salinity measurement) and well#2 was put on hold based on high water saturation indication and complex conglomeratic rock matrix. Petrophysical analysis played a key role in enabling the business decision through the integration of advanced logging and core analysis.|","Document Type

However, only three can be measured through sonic log measurements. This gap has traditionally been filled by applying the ANNIE model. One of the critical assumptions in the ANNIE model causes vertical Poisson's ratio to always be greater than horizontal Poisson's ratio and predicts the anisotropic and isotropic stresses to be equal. However, these assumptions are usually not the case in unconventional reservoirs. |A modified-ANNIE (M-ANNIE 1) model helps overcome the limitations of the ANNIE by introducing two empirical multipliers. However, both the ANNIE and M-ANNIE 1 models require Stoneley wave velocity as input, which prevents their applicability in cased-hole conditions or conditions with no advanced sonic logging tools. |Recently, two new methods, velocity regression (V-reg) model and a further modified ANNIE model (M-ANNIE 2), were proposed to predict the stiffness coefficients independent of the Stoneley wave. It is observed that the simple generic relationships derived from core ultrasonic data are not sufficient for stiffness coefficients characterization. |Ultrasonic velocities were measured on whole cores from a North American shale play in 0, 45, and 90° orientations to obtain direction-dependent compressional (Vp) and shear waves (Vs) velocities. Different anisotropic acoustic models were applied to compare their prediction capacity and limits. This study includes more laboratory data, such as X-ray diffraction (XRD) mineralogy and total organic carbon (TOC), to provide a lithological context. It was observed the shale has a large portion of carbonate (> 80v%), and its acoustic anisotropy indicator Thomsen parameters, epsilon and gamma, are strongly related to clay and kerogen content. This paper discusses how the high carbonate content alters the previously established generic models for M-ANNIE 1, 2, and V-reg. The paper also investigates the relationship between the dynamic and static elastic moduli interpreted from the ultrasonic and triaxial data, respectively. The dynamic and static data were used to fit widely used dynamic-to-static conversion equations: the Canady and Morales equations. The Canady equation was extended to the “very hard” (greater than 70 GPa Young's modulus) regime, while the Morales equation was extended to the regime of less than 10% porosity. Next, the calibrated dynamic Young's modulus is also used to estimate the unconfined compressive strength (UCS). The prediction qualities of different acoustic anisotropic models are investigated. |As compared with the conventional ANNIE and isotropic models, the lithology-based anisotropic acoustic models (M-ANNIE 1, 2, and V-reg) highly improve the predictions of the stiffness coefficients and elastic moduli; hence, they provide better predictions of the minimum horizontal stress. Accurate predictions of elastic moduli and stress are crucial for selecting proper drilling mud, cement weights, and drilling/perforation locations.|","Document Type

831,832,2016-KK,How Can Microfracturing Improve Reservoir Management?,"Malik, Mayank, Chevron| Jones, Colin, Chevron| Boratko, Edward, SPE","|Abstract
Microfracturing is an excellent method of obtaining direct, in-situ stress measurements, not only in shales, but in conventional reservoirs as well. Recent advances have shown that microfracturing can help improve reservoir management by guiding well placement, optimizing injection rates, and managing perforation strategy.
Microfracturing consists of isolating small test intervals in a well between inflatable packers, increasing the pressure until a small fracture forms and then by conducting a few injection and shut-in cycles, extend the fracture beyond the influence of the wellbore. Results show that direct stress measurements can be successfully acquired at multiple intervals in a few hours and the vertical scale nearly corresponds to electric log resolution. Therefore, microfracture testing (generally performed in a pilot / vertical well) is an appropriate choice for calibrating log derived geomechanical models and obtaining a complete, accurate, and precise vertical stress profile.
This paper describes the microfracturing process and presents several examples that led to increased hydrocarbon recovery by efficient stimulation and/or completion design. Case studies presented range from optimizing hydraulic fracturing in unconventional (Delaware Basin, USA), determining safe waterflood injection rates in brownfields (Offshore UK), and helping improve perforation placement in ultra-deepwater reservoirs.|","Document Type

A new workflow has been developed for an azimuthal fracture indicator that estimates fracture presence by using measurements of attenuation of dipole acoustic waveforms as a complement to the established Stoneley fracture analysis. The new approach computes normalized differential energies (NDE's) for the oriented dipole for subsequent integration with the traditional Stoneley and image analysis of fractures. A combination of the two methods provides a more confident directional fracture indicator and an improved 3D acoustic characterization of the formation. The new workflow was successfully tested on field data, from both vertical and horizontal wells from unconventional and conventional plays.

Representative mineral characterization of the reservoir is a key element for accurate petrophysical evaluation. Conventional cores are considered as the best option to obtain detailed lithology and mineralogy of the formation. But, it is impractical and costly to obtain conventional cores across the entire well interval. Natural and pulsed-neutron induced gamma ray spectroscopy from openhole measurements have been widely used in conventional and unconventional reservoirs, for defining the lithology and mineralogy. In older wells or the wells where openhole data acquisition was prohibitive due to operational and/or financial considerations, lithology and mineralogy information may not be available. In the cased-hole environment, the casing and concrete cause attenuation and contribution effects on the spectral gamma rays, which increase the uncertainty in measurements, making cased-hole spectroscopy analysis extremely challenging.
For the purpose of characterizing the attenuation and contribution effects of casing and concrete on spectral gamma ray measurements, proprietary correction algorithms are developed using a combination of lab experiments and modeled tool response standards. The natural and pulsed-neutron induced gamma ray measurements are processed using these correction algorithms to obtain elemental composition. This information feeds an interpretation system to determine lithology and mineralogy of the formation. A methodology to separate organic and inorganic carbon is utilized to identify the Total Organic Carbon (TOC) content of the formation. The pulsed-neutron generator and high density gamma ray scintillator detector instrument allow measurement of natural, inelastic and thermal capture gamma rays, enabling elemental deconvolution through spectroscopy analysis.
This paper demonstrates the validity of this novel technique by comparing the results of cased-hole and open-hole mineralogy of the Vaca Muerta Formation in the Neuquen basin in Argentina. The cased-hole results show successful lithological and mineralogical classification, highly agreeing with open-hole analysis in siliciclastic and carbonate formations of the basin. Data from the cased-hole is also analyzed to obtain TOC of the formation.
This capability to determine lithology, mineralogy and TOC of the formation through the casing is particularly important to identify any bypassed pay zones in older wells or to evaluate the impact of formation on the production, especially if the well doesn't have conventional cores. And particularly in this formation, one of the most important unconventional plays in the world, which originally was not the target, when the field was, and still is, developed as a conventional play. Deployment through casing and usage of pulsedneutron generator, reduces Health, Safety and Environment (HS&E) hazards and promotes environmentally friendly data acquisition. This innovative technology enables the operators to gather additional data, previously possible only in the openhole environment, to characterize the reservoir for maximizing the production.|","Document Type

This paper presents an experimental study and comparison of the wettability of the organic-rich carbonate shale from Eagle Ford (EF) and Middle East (ME) formations. Rock samples used have the similar mineralogical compositions (mainly composed of calcite) and total organic carbon (TOC) contents. However, our experiments demonstrate that their wetting affinity of oil and water is completely different.
We conduct spontaneous imbibition experiments using 5% KCl brine and diesel to compare the wetting behavior of EF and ME samples. Plugs are drilled perpendicular or parallel to the beddings, and referred as the vertical and horizontal samples, respectively. Each plug is further cut into two smaller twin plugs. One of them imbibes the diesel and the other twin plug imbibes the brine for varied times in the regular imbibition tests. Later they are exchanged to imbibe the other fluid in their reversed imbibition. The rate and amount of fluid imbibed are determined from the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) T2 measurements.
Both EF and ME samples imbibe the brine and diesel, which indicates a mixed wettability for these organic-rich shale. The NMR T2 signature of the imbibed brine and diesel occurred mostly at relaxation times faster than their bulk relaxation time, respectively, indicating the dominance of surface relaxation. ME samples imbibe the diesel faster than the brine, while EF samples imbibes the brine faster than the diesel. For ME samples, the brine is observed to percolate continuously into large pores while the diesel invades into small pores. The fractures (or gaps) between thin layers of ME sample are interpreted as large pores in the NMR T2 spectra and are strongly hydrophilic-wet. For EF samples, the opposite imbibition behavior is observed: the brine imbibes continuously into small pores while the diesel percolates into large pores. In addition, EF horizontal samples imbibe both brine and diesel much faster than the vertical samples.|","Document Type

835,836,2016-GGGG,An Experimental Multi-Scale Approach for Assessment of Uncertainty in Elastic Properties of Organic-Rich Mudrocks,"Valdes, Clotilde Chen, Texas A&M University| Heidari, Zoya, The University of Texas","|Abstract
Reliable evaluation of elastic properties is challenging in mudrocks, yet required for geomechanical modelling and successful fracture treatment. It is important to assimilate variable elastic properties and distribution of each matrix component, as well as rock fabric in evaluation of effective elastic properties of organic-rich mudrocks. Although existing methods (e.g., effective medium theories) for well-log-based assessment of elastic properties take into account stiffness and approximate shape of the rock components, they all assume that elastic properties of each rock component remain constant. However, these properties might vary depending on the distribution and size of that particular component, as well as its adjacent minerals. Furthermore, there is a significant uncertainty in elastic properties of kerogen. The uncertainty associated with the aforementioned parameters on effective elastic properties of rocks has not been investigated in previous publications.
In this paper, we quantify the uncertainties involved in the evaluation of effective elastic properties in mudrocks, by quantifying the variability in elastic properties of individual rock components caused by their spatial distribution, size, and rock fabric, at the micro-scale domain. We performed nanoindentation mechanical tests at identified locations on samples from the Haynesville and lower Eagle Ford formations, to measure Young's modulus of individual and mixtures of rock components. Finally, we quantified the variability of Young's modulus in the micro-scale domain and their impact on effective elastic properties at the micro-scale and well-log domains in organic-rich mudrocks. The uncertainties involved in the evaluation of effective elastic properties of the samples are quantified by taking into account the measured variability in elastic properties of each individual component. The estimated effective elastic properties are then compared against core-scale measurements of elastic properties, previously obtained via tri-axial mechanical tests.
The results revealed significant uncertainties in measurements of elastic properties of soft rock components, such as clay minerals and kerogen. Young's moduli of individual clay components when located adjacent to stiff rock components (e.g. large quartz and calcite grains) are at least 15% higher, compared to the cases where they are located adjacent to other clay minerals. The uncertainty in measured Young's moduli is smaller in the case of non-clay minerals. Elastic properties of kerogen are also quantified, and the measured average variability in kerogen Young's modulus is estimated to be 10%. The results showed that the impact of variabilities in individual elastic properties of rock components on estimates of effective elastic properties at the micro-scale and log-scale domains is less than 5%. We also estimated an average relative difference of less than 25% between estimates of effective vertical Young's modulus estimated using the inputs from nanoindentation tests and vertical Young's modulus measured from core samples.|","Document Type

As hydrocarbon fields in production mature, the resultant increase in produced water poses a problem due to the ever-increasing costs associated with handling and separation. Current technology requires produced water to be brought back to a host platform or onshore from offshore reservoirs to address this issue of produced water separation and disposal. Significant interest within industry exists for Subsea Separation Technology, especially where current technology is challenged. The need for new or improved technologies is particularly salient when considering the topic of seabed discharge of produced water. Interest is further magnified in regions such as Trinidad and Tobago, where exploration activities in deepwater blocks have commenced and subsea processing could prove advantageous when compared to topsides. 
This paper will discuss the need for development and testing of a subsea produced water treatment system for seabed discharge and the ongoing efforts involved in commercializing this technology. Various existing subsea separation systems will be presented, with reasons why each has failed to render a solution to the issue of disposal of the produced water to the sea. A discussion will be made to illustrate the new era of linear separators, spherical separators, and compact flotation devices that may bring about a technology breakthrough for allowing subsea separation and discharge of the environmentally clean produced water to be discharged at the seabed. 
Oil-in-water sensors enabling continuous measurement of produced water discharged at the seabed will also be introduced to illustrate current technology developments. The sensors' design basis and criteria are compared to existing discharge limits in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Trinidad and Tobago to highlight the benefits of their use in these regions. In particular, four (4) sensor technologies subject to bench-scale testing in mid-2016 and their working principles are outlined.|","Subsea, Separation, Discharge, Processing, Produced Water",0

Slim-hole drilling refers to the drilling of a well with a wellbore typically less than seven inches in diameter. Slim-hole drilling is beneficial to the low budget operator as there are considerable savings on rig time and costs and the rig size is ideal for drilling in remote areas. During slim-hole drilling, drilling fluid hydraulics is of great concern since significant pressure losses can occur in the drill pipe and annulus due to the reduced annular clearances. In addition, the flow regime generated in a slim-hole and the compatibility of the drilling fluid with the formation, can have an impact on the stability of the wellbore. 
Slim-hole drilling has been successfully conducted onshore Trinidad in the Morne Diablo / Quinam Block for a number of years. The most commonly used drilling fluid is salt water based mud since it is cheaper and easier to dispose of than oil based mud. However the open literature did not show any studies conducted to determine the impact of drilling fluid hydraulics and drilling fluid compatibility on well-bore stability. In this study, twenty-five water based drilling mud formulations were prepared using different concentrations of sodium chloride, potassium chloride and calcium chloride. The rheological properties of each formulation were determined and the Bingham Plastic and Power Law models were applied. The frictional pressure losses for three commonly drilled slim-hole configurations were then computed and compared. Outcrop shale samples from the area were then treated with each formulation and the percentage loss in mass due to hydration and disintegration was measured for each sample. 
The results from these two tests showed that of the mud formulations tested, overall, those with KCl (2.9 %) and CaCl2 (0.7 %), KCl (3.6 %), KCl (0.7 %) and NaCl (2.9 %), NaCl (0.7 %), and CaCl2 (2.9 %) were determined as best suitable for slim-hole drilling for the well configurations used. For these mud formulations, frictional pressure losses using both rheological models were the lowest and provide adequate rheological properties. The outcrop samples also showed the lowest percentage loss by mass when treated with these formulations indicating that they possess the desired wellbore inhibition properties. However, formulations containing NaCl only are the least expensive with straight KCl formulations being the most expensive.|","salt water based mud, Onshore Trinidad, Slim-Hole Drilling, drilling fluid hydraulics, well-bore stability",46
838,839,180788-MS,Development of a Real-time Decision-Making Dashboard for Drilling Homogeneous Unconventional Shale Plays,"Driver, R. P., Baker Hughes| Atwal, H. S., Baker Hughes| Knight, S. J., Baker Hughes","|Abstract 
In the current market of drilling programs that emphasise cost effectiveness, making optimum decisions in a dynamic real-time setting is very important. We have observed a disproportional reliance on intuitive decision making in upstream oil & gas operations. In this paper, we propose a process that enables data driven decision making. We then implement this process for a specific situation. 
In homogeneous unconventional shale drilling, the number of factors that effect drilling performance are greatly limited. Well drilling times are relatively shorter and so many more wells are drilled in a short period of time. This allows for an opportunity to learn quickly from past wells. We developed a decision-making dashboard that uses data from past wells and helps predict the outcome of a change before it is made. We used multiple linear regression (MLR) as the statistical tool to derive correlations between parameters and drill rate (ROP). Historically, MLR has been used as a tool to optimize the conventional rotary drilling process. However, these analyses are based on limited field data and can yield inaccurate results. The introduction of new drilling technologies such as polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) bits, rotary steerable systems (RSS), and horizontal well placement have render past models obsolete when applied to modern unconventional homogenous shale wells. 
Real-time data were collected from the lateral sections of eight horizontal Marcellus Shale wells drilled from a single pad located in Greene County, Pennsylvania. Twenty-seven variables were identified and evaluated. A MLR of these variables was calculated for each of the eight wells. Weighted averages of the resulting coefficients were then used to derive a predictive ROP model. A decision-making dashboard was created using the coefficients generated through MLR on field data specific to the rig, well-plan, and area being drilled. 
In conclusion, a novel method of making data-driven decisions in real-time was developed. This dashboard is especially useful because it formulates a method of extracting actionable information from historical data. Care must be taken to ensure data used for analysis are of good quality and specifically related to real-time applications. These considerations include rig limitations, formation types, well profiles, mud properties. Updating the dashboard with more data as it is gathered enables continued learning from historical well-data in a systematic, data-driven method that has not existed in the past.|","new technology, unconventional plays, remote drilling, realtime optimization",37
839,840,180803-MS,Rock Mechanical Properties of Shallow Unconsolidated Sandstone Formations,"Ramcharitar, Kamlesh, Petrotrin| Hosein, Raffie, The University of the West Indies","|Abstract 
Rock mechanical properties, such as the Poisson's ratio, Bulk, Shear and Young's moduli are required for various oilfield operations such as seismic processing, reservoir simulation studies, and hydraulic fracturing for sand control. These properties are usually determined from compressional (P) and shear (S) wave velocities which can be captured by the dipole sonic logging tool. For unconsolidated rocks (shallower than 6000 ft), the P and S-wave velocities are difficult to predict due to the dispersive nature of these rocks. Also, the available correlations in the open literature to determine these parameters should be used with caution since these were developed mainly for deeper formations. 
In this study, we compared the sonic wave velocities empirically predicted by Castagna et al., Eberhart-Phillips and Han with the logged sonic wave velocities across the Cruse Formation for eight onshore wells in South-Western Trinidad. We also investigated more suitable methods of matching the logged velocities across the Cruse, by developing new empirical models and an analytical method (Hertz-Mindlin contact model) to account for the unconsolidated rocks. The basic input data required for predicting the sonic velocities and dynamic rock mechanical properties were porosity, clay content and bulk density which were taken from the log data. The models for obtaining the static rock mechanical properties were tested against the results of Mini-Frac tests in two offset wells in the Cruse. 
The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) empirical method was shown to be best suited for predicting the dynamic rock mechanical properties for the Cruse Formation, since Average Absolute Errors (AAE) of 3 and 6 % were obtained in matching the P and S-wave velocities respectively. Similarly, the AAE obtained from applying the three empirical correlations were worse than 17 and 30 %. This error was generally observed to lessen for wells which encountered the Cruse at greater depths. While AAE of 6 and 12 % were obtained from applying the analytical method, reservoir depletion was found to significantly affect the results of the modeling due to the implied presence of hard-to-predict free gas saturations. Also, it was found that the analytical method is the only viable procedure to predict the static rock mechanical properties in lieu of laboratory core tests. The analytical method has been tuned in this study using True Vertical Depth (TVD) as a correlation parameter for the first time, and it can generally be used to estimate both the dynamic and static rock mechanical properties of the Cruse Formation for future oilfield operations.|","Hydraulic Fracturing, Young's modulus, Rock Mechanical Properties, Unconsolidated, Cruse",11

The application of horizontal well drilling coupled with the multistage fracturing technology enables commercial development of shale gas formations. However, due to the complexity of fracture network propagation, simulation of such reservoirs is challenging and associated with uncertainties. In order to minimize the uncertainty of modeling, we correlate first-hand pumping schedule data with the reservoir performance directly through coupling a fracking process with a reservoir simulator. This provides us an integrated way to characterize a well trajectory, hydraulic fracture configurations and shale gas reservoir performance. In addition, a geomechanical effect on the reservoir performance under certain fracture configurations is studied using a geomechanics module developed by CMG Ltd. 
GOHFER is widely used in a hydraulic fracking analysis. In this work, we couple GOHFER simulation output with the CMG module to determine the hydraulic fracture configuration. Thus, a method to correlate the first-hand pumping data (a slurry rate, slurry concentration and pumping pressure) with the reservoir simulator is given. Because of the stress sensitivity of a shale formation, we employ a linear-elastic constitutive law to depict the rock behavior with Young's modulus of 5,000,000 psi and Poisson's ratio of 0.2. Moreover, a Barton-Bandis model is used to describe the tensile opening of natural fractures for the dual-permeability reservoir model. 
From a series of numerical simulation studies, we find that the effective normal stress will increase with the development of a shale gas reservoir which will lead to a decrease in porosity and permeability. For the base case without a geomechanics effect, it will produce higher cumulative gas production than the case with the geomechanics effect. When producing for six months, the difference of the cumulative gas production between the two cases is 14.3%. The integrated process provides insights about shale gas reservoir performance with available data and handy tools.|","Integrated Method, Barton-Bandis Model, Characterization, Two-way Coupling, Geomechanics",43

A Case of Study in Teak Field TSP, East Coast Trinidad","Martinez-Zuazo, I., Repsol| Fernandez, M., Repsol| Medina, A., Repsol| Segnini-Rodriguez, C. J., Repsol| Atienza, J., Repsol| Alkatiri, F., Repsol","|Abstract 
One of the most critical issues in TSP fields is the unconsolidated character of its sands. Historically, most of the wells drilled in TSP fields, including vertical, deviated and horizontal wells, have been completed with cased hole gravel pack (CHGP). However, over the course of the years, these completions have been known to fail eventually, especially in the case of horizontal completions. Among the failure reasons are the complexity of such operations and the drawdown applied during production. 
During the last drilling campaign in 2014, a horizontal well was completed with open hole gravel pack (OHGP). In addition to the change of completion, the production strategy was also modified to delay the water breakthrough and reduce the drawdown. These changes have significantly contributed to increase the production of the asset and opened the opportunity to apply these changes in wells for future campaigns. 
The horizontal well, was drilled through unconsolidated sand (Pliocene), where continuous fluid losses were expected to be encountered. During the well project execution it was necessary to create a mitigation plan in order to minimize the risk of fluid loss (rate) circulation before running the lower completion. For this it was necessary to include an isolation valve to control the losses once the packer was confirmed to be set. Normal reservoir pressure, and available facilities, was key factor to decide to include a gas lifting system in the upper completion which was also designed to have the maximum ID as possible for future intervention jobs such as acid stimulation and logging operations. Finally the well was successfully completed in OHGP with no signs of bridging. Based on the results obtained a complete detailed analysis for the pre and post job will be exposed in this document. 
This paper outlines the different challenges faced, as well as to highlight the action plans, mitigations and lessons learned encountered during the planning, design, and execution of the completion phase. In addition, a review of the production history of similar completions and the production strategies followed will be discussed. Finally, the results of this well will be summarized and lessons learnt shared.|","open hole, completion, TSP, horizontal",12

Steam-Assisted-Gravity-Drainage (SAGD) has been extensively applied in thermal recovery from oilsands reservoirs in the Athabasca region of Northern Alberta. As the steam chambers associated with SAGD well pairs become mature, a form of abandonment is often applied for pressure maintenance in the depleted zone. Quantification of potential surface subsidence associated with SAGD abandonment becomes critical especially when the mature wells are in proximity of future developments. In addition, induced shear stresses should also be estimated to fulfill well integrity requirements. In this case study, a coupled reservoir – geomechanical simulation model is developed, calibrated and utilized to estimate the magnitude of post-abandonment subsidence and the induced shear stresses in Surmont SAGD Pilot Project. In the context of this study, first, the development of a simplified 2D static geomechanical model using an original geomodel realization as well as geomechanical properties and stress profiles is discussed, which forms the basis for the coupled simulation model. The calibration workflow of the coupled reservoir-geomechanical simulation model to historical heave data is then reviewed and the impacts of different parameters on calibration quality is investigated. Finally, the estimation of subsidence and the induced shear stresses in the nearby wells is discussed, and the magnitude of residual heave is quantified. The results of this study show that only a fraction (up to 40%) of surface heave is reversible (in form of subsidence) during the abandonment phase. Therefore, the magnitude of the surface subsidence and the associated shear stresses are quite small. The modeling study has also shown that a small magnitude of subsidence may be recorded even 10 years after abandonment. However, more than 50% of the surface subsidence is observed in the first two years post-abandonment. Other important findings of this study includes (1) documenting the effects of thief zone interaction as it relates to irreversibility of surface heave; (2) documenting the impacts of various geomechanical parameters on the quality of calibration against the historical heave data; (3) observation of the relative impacts of the pressure and temperature fields on the magnitude of heave; and (4) quantification of incremental, yet small, shear stresses along the nearby horizontal wells.|","Geomechanics, SAGD Abandonment, Heave, Subsidence, Thermal Recovery",45

One of the most important of these characteristics is an in-situ evaluation of the magnitude and variation of the minimum in-situ stress, the measurement of which is critical for geomechanical modelling and thereby a range of applications such as well construction, caprock integrity, and completion optimization. |A wireline formation testing (WFT) tool is a common approach for obtaining direct measurements of these stresses at a range of depths. This process is referred to as microfracturing and is most typically performed in an openhole environment. Typical toolstrings consist of a straddle packer arrangement, a pumping mechanism, gamma ray for accurate depth correlation, a motorized valve/manifold arrangement, and pressure/temperature gauges. To perform a stress test, a specific interval of the wellbore is isolated by inflating the straddle packers. The interval is then pressurized by incrementally pumping fluid until a tensile fracture has been initiated. In an open hole, the fracture will initiate and propagate normal to the minimum stress at the wellbore and multiple injection and falloff cycles are subsequently performed to ensure fracture growth beyond the influence of the hoop stress regime. The data are then analysed to determine fracture initiation, reopening, propagation and closure pressures. Additionally, it may be possible to approximate fracture orientation, if an image log is available. |This paper describes the process of obtaining minimum in-situ stress measurements using a WFT and advanced integrated stress analysis (ISA) process, in an ultradeep reservoir at ultrahigh pressures.

This paper presents a numerical assessment for the Maximum Operating Pressure (MOP) of a Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) project considering the effect of the Natural Fractures (NFs) and intrinsic anisotropy of the cap shale. Current numerical and heuristic assessments usually ignore the effect of the intrinsic and structural anisotropy of the cap shale in the caprock integrity studies. 
A coupled Hydro-Thermo-Mechanical (HTM) model was developed to assess the MOP. The coupled model employed a novel constitutive model which was developed to investigate the effect of NFs and intrinsic anisotropy in the cap shale. The coupled model was validated against surface heave measurements, and later utilized in a sensitivity study to assess the MOP for cases with different number of NF sets, fracture density and fracture dip angle. 
Results indicate that the MOP is highly sensitive to the fracture density and dip angle. According to the results, vertical fractures have minor effect on the MOP while oblique fractures with the dip angle between 25° to 65° significantly affect the MOP. Neglecting the NFs can lead to significant overestimation of the MOP. This highlights the necessity to include the NFs in the caprock integrity assessments. 
The numerical model presented in this paper considers the intrinsic anisotropy and the presence of NFs in the cap shale, while existing mathematical tools for caprock integrity studies have not incorporated the intrinsic and structural anisotropy. Ignoring the anisotropy in caprock can potentially cause a considerable overestimation of the MOP.|","Shale anisotropy, Natural fractures, SAGD, Maximum Operation Pressure, Coupled numerical modeling",35

The aim of North Senoro Project Development is to produce gas from limestone reservoir (Mentawa reef) which has unique characteristic formation that total loss hazard wasn't found at the adjacent well. One of effort to solve the problems is bullheading. In this paper, it will explain how bullheading might become a sufficient method for controling pressure during stripping operation while curing loss circulation problem. Well control situation in sandstone and carbonate formation has different characteristic. In carbonate, well control issue is mostly come by total loss which caused the mud hydrostatic pressure was less in the wellbore. Curing loss circulation was the first major to control pressure on the well. Also on sandstone formation, has more compact if hasn't fault or fracture on there. |The well control issue happened in 8-1/2? hole section; the situation occurred when suddenly got total loss in the bore hole. It was followed by the increasing number of background gas from the cutting. Shut in well, got record of SICP is 1700 psi and SIDP is 0 psi.

Decided to circulate on the two side, through annulus and inside drill string, while circulate mud and LCM through drill pipe got plugged. The engineer team made some analysis then created few scenarios, such as severing BHA, perforate drill pipe to make communication with annulus, continued pumping mud and LCM via annulus (bullheading), or stripping operation. With all assumptions and condition, the stripping operation while bullheading became the best choice to POOH BHA and running OE to cure loss circulation with BDOP/BDOC, then continue with circulate out gas/kick.

848,849,180746-MS,Experimental Study On The Failure Behavior of Inter-Bedded Shale During Thermal Stimulation,"Zhang, Shengfei, Petro China| Li, Xiuluan, Petro China| Wang, Hongzhuang, Petro China","|Abstract 
For the last decade, the integrity of caprock was the dominant topic in SAGD aspects, especially after Josyln creek steam release accident (ERCB, 2010). Lots of works had been done to identify the failure mechanisms (Carlson, 2012) and massive progress had been made(Collins, Walters et al., 2011; Yuan, Xu et al., 2011; Walters, Wang et al., 2012). One of these efforts was to determine the maximum operating pressure from geomechanical study (Walters, Wang et al., 2012). Another issue in SAGD operation falled into geomechanical category as well was inter-bedded shale (IBS), which largely impeded the vertical growth of SAGD chamber (ITO, T. HIRATA et al., 2004). IBS generally yielded low operation performance in heterogeneous reservoir and gradually draw the attention of the industry and academia. Yang (Yang and Butler, 1992) was the first to conduct physical simulation to study the effect of relative position and size of IBS on SAGD performance. He concluded IBS above the injector would force steam chamber to detour which largely delayed the rising process of chamber. So breaking IBS to facilitate fluid flow has been an objective pursuit by the industry. 
Actually the efforts to prevent caprock from failure was essentially the reverse purpose of breaking IBS. The conditions leading to caprock integrity issue were exactly those to promote potential failure of IBS. Conventional ideas like drilling slim hole, vertical well, tunnel or fishbone wells (Chang, Ivory et al., 2012; JOHN L. STALDER, 2012; PTAC, 2012; TUNNEY CATHAL, 2012) might sound great but failed to meet the challenge of identifying location of IBS precisely. Alternately in situ method was more feasible and most works reported in public domain fell into this category. As is well known, rock failure happened normally in the forms of shear failure and tensile failure (Carlson, 2003; Collins, 2005; Dusseault and Collins, 2008). Shear failure was especially common in anisotropic stress condition. Accompanying with this concept, uniaxial boundary condition was widely integrated (Walters, Wang et al., 2012). It was rather simple and ideal model. In addition, failure criteria was another important ingredient for shear failure study. Models like Mohr-Coloumb (Carlson, 2003; Collins, 2005; Dusseault and Collins, 2008) and Drucker-Prager (Yuan, Xu et al., 2011; Yang, Xu et al., 2013) were generally used in academic research. The former one was widely used in engineering activities while the latter one was commonly adopted for numerical simulation (IPEK, FRAUENFELD et al., 2008; Du and Wong, 2010). Tensile failure was also possible in certain unloading condition (XU, YUAN et al., 2011) and should be concerned properly. It's necessary to mention Li's work (Li and CHALATURNYK, 2006) in which a relation between permeability and volumetric strain was derived. This essentially bridged the gap between reservoir engineering and geomechanical research and helped understand permeability enhancement after failure. 
Apart from numerical simulation, physical experiments also provided valuable thoughts to address IBS issue. Collins & Carlson (Carlson, 2003; Collins, Walters et al., 2011) taught proper methods to core, store, and prepare core plugs for experiments. Collins (Collins, 2005) reviewed the work at UTF project and concluded that stress front propagated far ahead of temperature and pressure front. This finding indicated IBS would be broken by means other than fluid injection. One of the most feasible approach was thermal stimulation which was already there in SAGD operation. Heat was one of the most important component in thermal stimulation process and heat transfer always exist in IBS no matter steam or hot water entered. In contrast, fluid wouldn't penetrate IBS with extremely low porosity and permeability and hence alter the stress condition inefficiently. Dr yuan (XU, YUAN et al., 2011) conducted lab tests and showed both shear failure and tensile failure of IBS during thermal loading. He argued that the stress path and loading history was important and might lead to thermal contraction or thermal expansion. Thermal expansion was critical in thermal stimulation process(AGAR, MORGENSTERN et al., 1983; BUTLER, 1986) which might result in pore pressure increase and anisotropic stress status. To which extent this factor might affect the strength of IBS depended on the competition between thermal expansion and pressure dissipation. On the other hand, thermal contraction of shale was also extendedly studied (Bois, CurisTec et al., 2011; Li and Wong, 2013) and fractures would developed in certain condition. Hueckel (Hueckel and Baldi, 1990; Hueckel and Borsetto, 1990) studied saturated clay heating under undrained condition. He presented yield surface change in p'- q - T plot and found overconsolidation ratio played an important role in the failure behavior. Wong (Wong, 1998) proved that swelling caused by water imbibition was an alternative to weaken shale and improve effective permeability.|","Thermal loading, Inter-Bedded Shale, SAGD, Geomechanical, CT scanning",27

While the field development has been successful, opportunities and challenges remain. Below the producing reservoir levels, there is potential for additional reservoirs - unlocking those deep hydrocarbons would require to drill beyond present well control. At the same time, drilling development wells cost effectively has remained challenging even for shallow intervals given subsurface heterogeneities, which often cause borehole stability issues.    |This study introduces a novel workflow that allows the asset to leverage quantitative seismic interpretation, that is closely integrated with geomechanics modelling to address both the deep reservoir potential opportunity and the borehole stability related drilling cost challenge. Here we focus on the integration of the geomechanical and geophysical data and workflows rather than on the successful prediction of deep sand probabilities using seismic AvO inversion and Bayesian facies classification. As part of the seismic inversion, 3D dynamic Young's Modulus and Poisson's Ratio volumes were derived. In parallel, a finite-element mesh for geomechanical modelling was created from the structural interpretation and then populated with the seismic derived rock properties. The resulting field scale 3D geomechanics model helps to address production-related challenges such as top seal integrity, fault reactivation, compaction, subsidence, injection, depletion, borehole stability, and sand control. |For this study, seismic data needed to be inverted over an interval from near seabed to deep targets below well penetration - some 3 seconds TWT or 10,000ft, a much larger window than normal for single reservoir-focused studies. Seismic AvO inversion was run using overlapping, time windows from shallow to deep, to account for wavelet transmission effects. The resulting inversion outputs, acoustic and shear impedance, were used to derive shale and sand probability volumes. Well based analysis was used to determine the best relationship between acoustic and shear impedance and Young's Modulus for both sand and shale facies. Using the facies probability volumes from seismic inversion, 3D dynamic Young's Modulus and Possion's Ratio volumes were calculated from the acoustic and shear impedance volumes.    |A 1D geomechanics model, calibrated against drilling experience, was used to convert from dynamic to static Young's Modulus. Finite-element geomechanical modelling was used to produce the 3D stress model combining pore pressure, structural information, seismic-based static rock properties, and far-field horizontal stresses. The final stage of stress analysis involved calculating stresses that honor local field measurements and incorporate regional trends.    |Utilizing 3D finite element models constrained by seismic yielded a high resolution predictive model that will significantly improve wellbore stability predictions along the paths of future development wells. The business impact for the Asset is reduced development well costs by having a more predictable geomechanics model, fully constrained by lateral variations from 3D seismic data, and greatly reduced cycle times for borehole stability predictions for future wells.|","Geomechanics, Seismic AvO inversion, Nigeria, borehole stability, 3D stress",3

Reservoir deformation during steam injection of SAGD operation can result in the increase in formation permeability that can positively impact to the bitumen production. The reservoir deformation behavior is controlled by the mechanical properties of oil sand, which are highly dependent on temperature. This work is focused on the temperature dependency of elastic properties of oil sand and its impact on geomechanical responses during a SAGD operation. Coupled geomechanical and fluid flow modeling technique is employed to illuminate the impact of the change in elastic properties to the reservoir deformation behavior. 
Rock physics modeling is conducted at first for quantifying the temperature effect on the elastic properties of oil sand. Based on the investigation of log data from an actual SAGD operation field, we used the soft-sand model to calculate dry-frame elastic properties of the unconsolidated sand. We then applied and investigated several substitution methods to quantify the effect of the pore-filling bitumen on the elastic properties of the oil sand. We selected one of the solid substitution methods instead of Gassmann equation because bitumen behaves like solid at low temperature. The coupled hydraulic, thermal, and geomechanical simulator, TOUGH-FLAC, is used to investigate the effect of oil sand's elasticity on reservoir deformation behavior. The coupled modeling for SAGD is conducted for two simple cases; one case with the elastic properties at original reservoir temperature and the other case with the updated elastic properties considering the increased temperature. Comparison of the results from the two cases demonstrates the importance of considering the effect of temperature on the elastic properties of oil sand. This work is new in terms of combining rock physics modeling for quantitative description of the oil sand elastic properties and the coupled hydraulic, thermal, and geomechanical modeling considering the temperature-dependent elastic properties of oil sand.|","elastic moduli, coupled simulation, SAGD, geomechanics, rock physics",52

Geomechanical simulations are often used to study the deformation and mechanical failure behaviour of caprock formations in a SAGD operation. Different assumptions are made when building the simulation models. Usually the overburden formations above the reservoir are described by a limited number of vertically separated layers with varying thickness. Each layer is assumed homogeneous with laterally uniform material properties. In many cases, these simplifications are not accurate. It is important that the simulations properly consider the vertical and lateral variations. 
This paper presents a probabilistic analysis on caprock integrity using a randomized finite element simulation approach. Volume of shale (VSH) logs and X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis data are used to generate stochastic distribution of 3 major litho-facies: sands, shale with low illite/smectite (I/S) contents and shale with high I/S contents. The litho-facie distributions are then mapped onto the finite element discretization of simulation models. Mechanical properties of the 3 major litho-facies are measured in a geomechanical laboratory test program. The geomechanical finite element model is coupled with thermal reservoir simulation results to study the deformation behaviour of caprock during a SAGD operation. Following a number of simulations, the results are statistically analyzed to estimate the probability of the caprock to enter plastic yielding.|","Caprock, Geomechanics, Probalistic Analysis",38

Dilation start-up has been widely used in Petro-China's Xinjiang oil field as a means of reducing start-up time and enhancing production from its ""super"" heavy oil reservoirs through the Steam-Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) process. SAGD dilation start-up employs geomechanical dilation mechanisms to achieve these preferred results. Using a short-period of small-volume and high-pressure fluid injection, the dilation start-up facilitates the development of a dilated zone that vertically connects the SAGD well pair and is laterally uniform along the length of the well. This zone allows for more effective heat transfer to the inter-well area through convection than what is achieved through simple conduction during the conventional SAGD steam circulation start-up. In Petro-China's Xinjiang oil field, conventional SAGD start-up requires 10 to 12 months of non-productive steam circulation before oil production can begin. Wells treated with the SAGD dilation start-up can be converted to production after only 2 to 3 months of steam circulation. 
This paper presents optimized steam circulation strategies which can be used with the dilation start-up treated SAGD well pairs. Numerical simulations are effectively integrated with field trials to derive best practices for steam circulation after the dilation start-up. The objectives are to get earlier and increased SAGD production as well as enhanced horizontal steam conformance. Operating parameters such as steam injection pressure, rate and pressure difference between the SAGD well pair were found to influence these objectives.|","SAGD, Dilation Start-up, Steam Circulation",21

It is generally accepted that solvent-steam injection in heavy oil/bitumen reservoirs outperforms steam only injection in terms of oil recovery rate, ultimate oil recovery and steam oil ratio. Important parameters in SA-SAGD design are solvent selection, injection strategy and solvent retention in situ. The role of geomechanics in optimum application of SA-SAGD, however, remains largely unexplored. 
Recent studies suggest that solvent transport, solvent dilution effect and the temperature distribution around the edge of the steam chamber have major control over SA-SAGD performance. Solvent-steam injection significantly alters the temperature distribution around the chamber edge compared to steam only processes (SAGD). The temperature redistribution, in addition to the altered pore pressure, produces geomechanical effects such as porosity and permeability alteration, relative permeability changes and residual saturation alterations which in turn, influence solvent-steam-oil phase behavior and solvent transport and retention, among others. These chains of events affect the steam chamber growth and the solvent distribution, which affect optimum solvent selection and solvent-steam injection scenarios. These geomechanical considerations are of particular interest for bitumen deposits, both oil sands and carbonates, where chemical, thermal and fluid pressures can impose significant volume changes within the reservoir especially in shallower, lower confining stress settings. 
The role of geomechanics in SA-SAGD was explored numerically using a sequentially coupled modeling approach with STARS (CMG) and FLAC (Itasca). A 2D homogenous oil sands reservoir geomodel at a shallow depth was considered for the purpose of this paper. Studies were conducted at two scales: 1) edge of steam chamber and 2) reservoir scale including underburden and overburden. The results of these numerical studies revealed geomechanics considerations directly affect the optimum solvent type selection and injection strategy during high pressure SA-SAGD processes. These studies provide valuable direction for further detailed mechanistic studies (both numerically and experimentally) and provide valuable input to the challenges of optimizing SA-SAGD processes in oil sands.|","SA-SAGD, Solvent Assisted SAGD, Geomechanics, Oil sands, Reservoir",36

It changes during jetting process and increases with soaking time. But the change rule and mechanism remain unclear. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to explore the change mechanism of lateral friction during and after conductor jetting process by field experiment and numerical simulation. |Firstly, a field experiment was conducted to simulate actual surface conductor jetting process. The time- dependent change rule of radial pressure, pore water pressure and effective skeleton pressure were obtained. Then, the stress states of soil bodies during this process were analyzed. Based on experiment and analysis results, the primary reason that causes the change of lateral friction was found. After that, to explore the specific change features of bearing capacity of seabed soil for surface conductor, another field experiment was conducted. Finally, finite element method was adopted to simulate the conductor jetting process and to verify the research conclusions. |The field simulation experiment showed that the sensor at the base of surface conductor suffers conspicuous higher value of radial pressure than other sensors above. Meanwhile, the effective pressure of each layer has a tendency of declining as time increasing and then gradually adds after reaching a certain value. These regularities matches the change rule of radial pressure on piles during driving process. Based on the stress analysis, it is certain that the soil compaction effect does exist in conductor jetting process, caused by which, the formation and dissipation of pore water pressure during jetting process would be highly related to the change of lateral resistance against surface conductor. After jetting into position, soil lateral friction would increase with time non-linearly. The change rate would gradually rise at the first 10 hours. After 72 hours, the added values of friction are small and the change rate turns to flat. According to the numerical modeling results, under the action of jetting force, on one hand, soil bodies that are closed to bit are cut into grains and flow out from wellbore with drilling fluid; on the other, soil bodies that are farther from bit would be squeezed down and then pushed around. |Previous studies mainly considered the soaking time and bearing capacity of surface conductor, focused on specific values. This research designed a system to simulate surface conductor jetting process to explore the change mechanism of lateral friction against surface conductor by combining the method of numerical modeling and field experiment.|","Surface Conductor, Deepwater Drilling, Simulation Experiment, Mechanism Research, Lateral Friction",52

R., Staatsolie Maatschappij Suriname N.V.","|Abstract 
A polymer flood pilot has been ongoing since September 2008 in Suriname in the heavy oil Tambaredjo field operated by Staatsolie. Initially, the pilot consisted of one injection well and four producers and was later expanded to three injection wells and nine direct offset production wells (all vertical). 
The Tambaredjo oil field is the largest oil field in Suriname and has been producing since 1982. The field contains approximately 525 MMSTB STOOIP of 16° API oil with an initial viscosity of 300 - 600 cP at reservoir conditions. Primary recovery (± 30% OOIP) is relatively high given the oil viscosity; this is believed to be due to a combination of compaction drive, edge water drive in the northern part of the field and limited bottom water influx in other areas, and perhaps foamy oil behavior. In spite of this high primary recovery, large quantities of oil remain in the reservoir, making it an attractive target for EOR. 
Due to the relatively thin pay, thermal methods have not been considered for the reservoir but on the other hand polymer flood was judged suitable. The oil viscosity is high but still lower than in other successful projects for instance in Canada while other reservoir characteristics are also suitable: low reservoir temperature and low water salinity allow the use of standard HPAM polymer, and high permeability is beneficial for injectivity. Moreover, the reservoir is highly heterogeneous, which has presented some challenges to the process. 
Initially, a polymer viscosity of 45 cP was injected which was later increased, first to 85 cP and then to 125 cP in order to improve the sweep efficiency. The overall response to polymer injection has been positive even if some wells have not responded positively to the injection, and incremental recovery (over primary) to date is estimated at on average 11% STOOIP. Due to the unconfined nature of the pattern some wells adjacent to the pilot have also shown response to injection. 
Given the success of the project, work is currently under way for an expansion of the polymer flood to encompass 33 additional injection wells. 
The paper presents the results of the pilot and describes the operations and challenges encountered during the project, in particular during the injection of the higher viscosity polymer. The combination of high reservoir heterogeneity, use of hydraulically fractured vertical wells and high polymer viscosity injected contribute to make this pilot an interesting field case.|","pilot, Polymer flood, heavy oil",23

Simultaneously, StressCage has become common practice as a method to overcome challenges drilling through depleted zones, in order to cope with complex mud-window constraints for new developments and infill wells. The success of these drilling and completion approaches and their rapid widespread application has resulted in ever more depletion. This has potentially created a vicious circle in terms of drilling the well to desired depth vs. the ability to install a low-skin frac-pack completion. |While these two techniques in isolation represent uniquely optimal solutions to their individual challenges, there is growing evidence that their application within the same wellbore has the potential to create conflicting ideals. The StressCage application is associated with the plugging of small fractures which have been induced in the wellbore wall, thereby increasing the effective fracture gradient, which allows for the drilling of substantial depletion. However, the presence of a range of widely distributed particle sizes in the mud system, as well as increased general solids loading, may result in deep and invasive plugging of the permeable formations and any smaller fractures within the same open-hole sections. When these plugged formations are then the target for subsequent fracturing operations, there is a significant potential to create near wellbore problems that complicate or bring into question the ability to install a frac-pack completion. |This paper will provide a number of examples of the application of StressCage, where resulting frac operations appear to have been hampered or complicated by the use of the StressCage approach and/or associated mud conditions. These examples will provide some evidence of such interactions but, more importantly, demonstrate the contradiction that these two techniques potentially represent. The paper will also outline a scenario resulting from a sand-control lower completion assembly in place, in a new borehole drilled with StressCage method, that could be resistant to any form of frac breakdown (or simple mechanical intervention), and, thereby, compromise the frac and well completion itself. |In addition to the case histories, the paper will outline various engineering approaches that should be considered, including geo-mechanical analysis of well placement, identification of near wellbore issues prior to and during the fracturing operations, careful management of stress caged solids makeup, mud management and frac-pack design in order to avoid or overcome such challenges.

Thermal production is an important heavy oil recovery method. While production, Steam injection triggers complex thermal and hydraulic processes which can dramatically alter the formation pressure and temperature leading to various changes within the reservoir as well as in the surrounding rock. This study is conducted to experimental research on the thermal cracking characters of mudstone barriers induced by heavy oil thermal production. 
In this research, a thermal-mechanical coupling experimental device was developed. It can impose triaxial stresses and local wellbore high temperature to the rock sample. The temperature sensor was used to record the temperature change in the rock sample. Industrial computerized tomography (CT) technology was employed to scan the rock sample before and after the experiments, compared the changes of CT images and observe the thermal cracking characters of mudstone. 
Mudstone of our laboratory studies were coring from the heavy oil reservoirs of Xinchun Oilfield (Xinjiang, China). The experimental results are listed as follows: (1) The thermal cracking developed with heating temperature increase. It's observed that the micro-fissures developed and connected to form larger fractures under 260°C. (2) The fractures propagate along the maximum/minimum horizontal stress direction on the surface of rock sample. CT images indicated that fractures propagation along the horizontal stress direction inside the sample. The propagating patterns also affected by the rock lithology, natural fissures and formation heterogeneity, etc. (3) The width of thermal cracking change with temperature, and the fractures closure during cooling from the growth temperature of 260°C to room temperature. 
The above works show that thermal production affect the deformation and failure behavior of the mudstone barriers, it may cause the thermal cracking during multiple steam stimulation process. This will be instructive for optimizing the parameters of thermal production.|","thermal cracking character, experimental test, mudstone barriers, Heavy oil thermal production, CT image",42

Steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) is a widely used thermal recovery method. During steam injection in interbedded sands, the portion of the deposits above the vertical permeability barriers is likely not recoverable with current practices. This paper discusses some of the geomechanics and fracturing aspects of using multistage fracturing in SAGD operations in interbedded sands such as IHS, where the vertical permeability barriers impede the gravity drainage process. 
The first part of this work (to be presented in a separate manuscript) covered the reservoir engineering aspects of this method, where it was assumed that it is possible to successfully create vertical fractures in the oil sands and through shale layers. In this paper, the geomechanical challenges in implementing the method and after the start of operation are discussed, starting with a review of relevant hydraulic fracturing field trials in the oil sands. Some interface crossing criteria are reviewed and the extended Renshaw and Pollard criterion is used to study fracture propagation through sand-shale interfaces. These results are then compared to results of a numerical simulation using a coupled reservoir-geomechanics-fracturing simulation software. It is shown that tensile hydraulic fractures can be created in the oil sands, and fractures can cross sand-shale interfaces and be filled with desired concentration of proppant. It is shown that small but high conductivity fractures that are required for the success of the proposed method, can be generated by using currently available proppants and fluid systems. After start of the steam injection, the conductivity of the fracture might be reduced by various mechanisms such as proppant embedment. It is shown that the reduction due to embedment would not be significant at high range of proppant concentrations and also due to the low stress regime in the Alberta oil sands. Furthermore, the design considerations for various liner systems that can combine the fracturing process and the SAGD phase are discussed and a few new designs are proposed. Finally, a step by step roadmap for field implementation of this method is presented. 
The novelty and main contribution of this paper is the analysis and design considerations of the application of multistage fracturing in SAGD process in the field. Our results indicate that the field execution is feasible, and a field trial of the technique is justified.|","Rock Interface, SAGD, Interbedded Sands, Fracture Mechanics, Multistage Fracturing",61

Caprock integrity is essential to the success of Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) operations. This issue is especially critical in the case of shallow SAGD operations where the in situ stresses are relatively low and, by necessity, the steam pressure has to be limited in order to ensure the safety of the process. Limited information is available on changes in caprock material properties that occur when temperature and stress conditions change in areas of the caprock affected by SAGD. By including these changes in caprock properties in the calculation of maximum operating pressure (MOP), it is possible that the allowable MOP could increase. This would allow the sealing capability of the caprock to be exploited more fully and provide an avenue for improving the economics of shallow SAGD operations. 
This paper presents the results of experiments measuring geomechanical properties of Clearwater caprock, at both ambient temperature (25°C) and elevated temperature (115°C and 200°C). The shale samples used in the tests were cut from two sets of shale cores that had been obtained from the Wabiskaw Member of the Clearwater Formation at Athabasca oil sands SAGD projects. The first set of core samples originated from a depth of approximately 200 m. The second set was obtained from a different site and a shallower depth, approximately 150 m. The purpose of these experiments was to study the effect of temperature on geotechnical properties such as the elastic parameters (bulk compressibility, Young’s modulus, Poisson’s ratio) and shear strength parameters (cohesive strength, friction angle), and to investigate the behaviour of shale permeability in a stress, pressure and temperature environment similar to one that might exist during SAGD operations. 
The experiments were performed in a triaxial cell, under conditions in which the pore pressure and axial and confining (radial) stress were controlled. The triaxial compression tests indicated that the elastic properties and shear strength of the shale samples were sensitive to temperature, for the range of effective stresses used in the tests. While the change in bulk compressibility was negligible, the samples became much stiffer (higher Young’s modulus) and stronger (higher cohesion, lower friction angle) at elevated temperature. The measured increases in permeability caused by a reduction in effective stress were relatively small, usually not greater than a factor of ten over the initial permeability. In one exceptional case, at elevated temperature, the permeability increased by a factor of nearly one million, but even in this case the maximum permeability measured was never larger than 10 md. A substantial portion of the change in permeability occurred after the sample failed in shear. The increase in permeability that was measured on the Clearwater shale samples at elevated temperature was somewhat greater than at ambient temperature, particularly at larger volumetric strains. 
At present, only a limited number of tests have been carried out to measure changes in caprock properties under temperature, pressure and stress conditions that prevail during SAGD. Further tests would be required to establish a better quantitative understanding of these changes in caprock properties.|","Clearwater shale, Elevated temperature, Permeability change, Strength, Elastic properties",48

Unconventional plays such as Vaca Muerta are geologically complex and heterogeneous. Wells must be hydraulically fractured to produce, and material fabric, material properties, and in situ stress strongly influence this process. When logs are not available in the laterals, measurements on drill cuttings can be used to estimate anisotropic mechanical properties and stresses. The proposed method relies on two main steps. First, using one or more data-rich pilot wells, we define and calibrate rock physics and geomechanical models. The rock physics model provides the necessary relationship between the petrophysical volumes (mineralogy, organic matter and fluids) and the elasticity moduli, and the geomechanics model the relationship between elasticity moduli and the stress indices and the minimum stress. Second, in nearby lateral wells, we measure mineralogy and organic matter on cuttings samples using Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and apply the models to compute the elastic and stress properties. We illustrate this method using two vertical pilot wells that cross the Quintuco and Vaca Muerta Formations, Argentina, and one horizontal lateral well in Vaca Muerta. A complete suite of petrophysics logs have been acquired in both pilots, in addition to DRIFTS measurements on cutting samples in one of them and rock mechanics lab measurements on cores in the other one. In the lateral well, DRIFTS data have been acquired. We limit this paper to the construction, calibration and application of the rock physics model, as the construction and calibration of the geomechanical model is reported in a companion paper. We show that the sonic moduli can be reconstructed very accurately from the petrophysical volumes in the Quintuco and Vaca Muerta formations. The rock physics model highlights the impact of the high TOC in Vaca Muerta and of the mineralogy in Quintuco. The anisotropic shear moduli of Vaca Muerta are also predicted satisfactorily. To demonstrate the methodology, DRIFTS measurements on cuttings from the pilot well, are used to predict the sonic-derived moduli. Despite the sampling of the cuttings every few meters compared to the log data every 15 cm, we show an excellent consistency between DRIFTS- and log-derived elastic moduli. The model is then applied to DRIFTS data acquired on cuttings in a lateral, and the cutting-derived stress indices are computed. This method is both practical and theoretically sound. First, deterministic rock physics and geomechanics models are calibrated with high-resolution log data in a pilot well to relate petrophysical volumes to stress properties. Second, the use of spectroscopy logs in pilots and spectroscopy measurements on cuttings in laterals allow accurate estimation of stresses using cutting-based measurements in data-lean environments.|","Vaca Muerta, cuttings, spectroscopy measurements, anisotropic mechanical properties, stress profile",36

For MFHW planning and design, it is important to be able to make decisions on several variables, such as number of wells, number of fractures per well, amount and type of proppant per fracture, fracture dimensions (length, width, and height), and possibly others. Standard practice for making such decisions is mostly empirical. However, empiricism may not be as successful for new cases that are significantly different from old ones. In such cases, what-if analysis is used by combining intuition with numerical simulators to assess the outcomes of possible decisions. Even though this approach may produce feasible results, it is unlikely that it leads to optimal decisions because of the complexity of the problem. Therefore, a systematic methodology is needed for MFHW planning and design that produces optimal solutions efficiently and effectively. |In this work, we develop such a methodology that optimizes net present value (NPV). The methodology poses the design problem as nested optimization in which the outer-optimization shell involves decisions on the number of wells, number of fractures per well, and amount of proppant, whereas the inner optimization maximizes the productivity index (PI) by selecting optimal fracture dimensions. The proposed methodology integrates in a systematic way a fracture-design module, a production-estimation module, and an economics module. Because the methodology is automated and numerically efficient, one can use it effectively for field development. |A case study is used to illustrate the applicability of the proposed methodology, and suggestions are made for further improvements.|","Unconventional resources, Shale gas, Tight gas, Hydraulic fracturing, Optimization",39
866,867,180999-MS,Conventional Fracturing vs. Complex Fracturing Network in Tight Turbidite Oil Deposits in Mexico,"Murillo, G. Gutierrez, PEMEX| Salguero, Javier, Calfrac","|Abstract 
Over the past decade the hydraulic fracturing industry has been working to increase oil production from low-permeability or ""tight"" sands formations by applying the experience and techniques gained from shale oil and gas well completions. The shale-based completion approach calls for the creation of complex but short-length fracture networks via the use of low-viscosity fluid systems combined with pumping at higher rates than a conventional stimulation. This paper is a case study of an oil-producing basin in Mexico. It evaluates the impact on cumulative production from stimulations assumed to have a greater fractured length compared to stimulations of the complex fracture network type with their associated shorter fractures. This paper uses data from a 13-year period (2003 to 2016) comparing wells in two tight sands fields with varying characteristics such as well design, vertical and horizontal configuration, fracture fluid systems and completion techniques. 
Due to the studied fields' petrophysical characteristics, hydraulic fracturing was necessary in all cases to economically produce hydrocarbons. Beyond this common characteristic, key properties varied across fields, with high heterogeneity due to the characteristics of the turbidite reservoirs. Natural fractures were not always present, permeability varied from 0.3 to 5 mD, while average porosity was 15% with low changes in vertical stress. Microseismic data acquired in the Basin provided information critical to understanding fracture behavior and, when combined with fracture simulation software, estimating propped geometry. 
Among the central observations of this study is that the stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) has certain limitations when oil-bearing compact turbidites are being stimulated. This was especially observed in lateral wells where the minimum horizontal stress (Shmin) increased gradually towards the heel of the well, making it more difficult to generate a complex fracture. 
The study area's stimulated wells showed a strong correlation between fracture half-length and cumulative hydrocarbon production. This proved true even among wells with complex fracture networks that typically had higher initial production. The critical conclusion of this study is that an oil well in low-permeability compact turbidites with greater fractured length can generate cumulative production up to 60% greater than a well with a complex but shorter half-length fracture network.|","Conventional Frac, Complex frac, Hydraulic Frac, SRV",36

Accurate and efficient numerical simulation of unconventional reservoirs is challenging. There is substantial physical complexity involving a number of tightly coupled mechanisms in the modeling of these reservoirs. The complexity is further amplified by the multicontinuum nature of the stimulated formation, and the complex fracture networks with a wide range of fracture-length scales and topologies. |To adequately capture the effects of the multiscaled fracture system, we develop two alternative hybrid approaches that are aimed at combining the advantages of multicontinuum and discrete-fracture/matrix (DFM) representations. During the development of unconventional resources, geological and geophysical information may be available is some cases to suggest a prior characterization, whereas in many other cases, this prior model may be incomplete and limited to hydraulic fractures. The two hybrid approaches could be used for different applications depending on the available characterization data and different requirements for efficiency and accuracy considerations. |The first hybrid model couples an embedded-discrete-fracture model (EDFM) with multiple interacting continua (MINC) into EDFM/MINC, which simulates the fracture network characterized by stimulated-reservoir-volume (SRV) concept. This optimized model can reduce the computational cost that is associated with the widely applied logarithmically spaced/locally refined (LS/LR) DFM technique, while improving the flexibility to model the complex geometry of hydraulic fractures. The MINC concept allows the hybrid model to handle the extreme contrast in conductivity between the small-scale fracture network and the ultratight matrix that results in steep potential gradients. |For the second class of hybrid model (unstructured DFM/continuum), the primary fractures are described by use of DFM with unstructured gridding, and the small-scale fractures are simulated by continuum-type approaches in a fully coupled manner. Optimized local-grid refinement is used to accurately handle the transient-flow regime around primary fractures. An upscaling technique that applies EDFM on the detailed realization of the discrete-fracture network by use of the target unstructured grid to generate an appropriate dual-permeability model is also developed. The upscaling technique is suitable for cases where a detailed prior model for the complete fracture network is available. |Simulation studies demonstrate the applicability of the developed hybrid-fracture models. Model verification is conducted against several reference solutions.|","Hybrid coupled fracture models, Multicontinuum, Discrete fracture-matrix, Unconventional reservoirs, Numerical simulation",36

Geomechanics has become an important tool for engineers and geologists, with classical applications in wellbore stability, sand management, and hydraulic fracturing.

The purpose of this paper is to propose a methodology based on analyze the impact of the brittleness index in hydraulic fracturing on shale gas reservoirs worldwide, and thereby define parameters to identify fraccable feasible sweet spots in shale plays prospects. 
A literature review was made so as to gather the largest amount of mechanical, petrophysical and geochemical data from shale gas reservoirs from countries all over the world such as United States, China, Argentina, Holland, Norway, Denmark and Sweden. Once available the data, different methods were used to calculate the brittleness index of each study case considering the effect of the mineralogical composition and elastic moduli such as Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio, both static and dynamic.

Many scientists and engineers are thus developing suitable floating platforms for supporting wind turbines. Deep-water oil platform technology can provide a basis for designing floating offshore wind turbines (FOWTs); however, differences exist between these types of platforms because of the additional wind forces acting on the turbines and the higher center of gravity due to the tower height. For example, platforms for FOWTs attempt to minimize the pitch and roll motions for effective wind energy production, whereas oil platforms attempt to reduce the heave motion (Muskulus and Schafhirt, 2014). |Three typical offshore floating structures are commonly considered: a spar, a semi-submersible, and a tension-leg platform (TLP). Koo et al. (2014) compared three floaters in a number of wind and wave environments with an emphasis on global motions, wind excitation and damping effects, nacelle acceleration, and mooring loads. They concluded that the performance of floaters can change when specific loads and local environmental conditions are considered; that is, to get an overview of specific FOWT motions, the dynamics of FOWTs in the local environment must be investigated. There are a few multi-megawatt FOWTs in existence. They include Norway’s Hywind, built in 2010 (Statoil, 2014), and WindFloat, a semi-submersible-type FOWT installed in Portugal in June 2012 (EWEA, 2013).

Analytical models available in Rate-Transient-Analysis (RTA) packages are widely used as tools for history matching and forecasting production in unconventional resources. There has also been an increasing interest in the use of numerical simulation of unconventional reservoirs. In this study, we use both methods to history match the production of hydraulically fractured unconventional wells, followed by forecasting future production to establish a well's EUR (Estimated Ultimate Recovery) for reserves determination purposes. This study's goal is to quantify the differences one might expect to encounter in a well's EUR when using analytical model-based RTA vs numerical simulation-based workflows in unconventional reservoirs. 
First, we consider an undersaturated shale oil reservoir as a base model for this study. The base case also satisfies all assumptions inherent to analytical solution-based methods such as homogenous reservoir properties and fully-penetrating planar fractures. An excellent match between results of both methods for the base model validates the numerical simulation approach. We then impose a series of real-world deviations from RTA assumptions and investigate reliability of EUR predictions made by both approaches. In all cases, historical data and reference EURs are derived from finely-gridded numerical simulations. 
Example results show that, in the presence of real-world deviations from RTA assumptions, analytical models can still match the historical production data; however, key reservoir and fracture parameters need to be modified drastically to compensate for the lack of sufficient physics in the analytical models. Results show that the analytical solution-based history-matched models are not predictive for future production, and somewhat surprisingly provide pessimistic EURs in all real-world scenarios investigated in this work. For the cases presented in this study, analytical models under-predict EURs by 6-17% when two years of production history is available for matching. The underestimation of EUR increases drastically (up to 60%) as the length of available historical data decreases from 2 years to 3 months. 
For all cases, we also apply an efficient numerical simulation-based workflow for probabilistic forecasting of EURs. This workflow provides multiple history-matched models that are constrained by historical production data. The probabilistic forecast method employed in this work provides P90 (conservative), P50 (most likely), and P10 (optimistic) values for EUR. In all examples, the range of P90 to P10 EUR values includes the reference EUR, and the P50 values are within 2.2% of the reference EUR.|","RTA, EUR, Unconventional, Numerical, Comparison",52
876,877,180956-MS,Completion and Well Spacing Optimization for Horizontal Wells in Pad Development in the Vaca Muerta Shale,"Suarez, M., YPF S.A.| Pichon, S., Schlumberger","|Abstract 
In organic shales, hydraulic fracturing is an important parameter to optimize production of horizontal wells. For a lateral standalone, propped surface should be maximized to increase production (by increasing total proppant per well). While in the case of a pad, well spacing is an additional constrain for hydraulic fracture dimensions not to overlap with hydraulic fractures of neighboring offsets. Competition for production between laterals of a given pad should be minimized and is the result of both well spacing and hydraulic fracture design. 
A numerical model coupling an explicit description of the hydraulic fracture geometry and reservoir simulation is proposed. Fracturing simulator accounts for material balance, geomechanics, interaction with natural fractures and stress shadowing within and in between fracturing stages. 
Production interference is evaluated by comparing forecasted production of a lateral standalone (single well approach) against this same lateral while surrounded by offsets competing for production (multi well approach). Sensitivities are run assuming different completion and well spacing scenarios varying different parameters such as fluid and proppant volume, fracturing fluid type and staging. 
Production interference between horizontal wells might reduce the final recovery of each individual well. However it provides an opportunity for simultaneous optimization of completion and well spacing to guide field development. 
Hydraulic Fracture dimensions must match well spacing. Variation of fracture geometry along the lateral should be accounted for to evaluate well spacing and prevent the excessive growth of one single facture within a given stage. Completion design can be engineered by adjusting hydraulic fracture treatment volume, perforation cluster spacing or fracturing fluid viscosity to increase the overall consistency of the resulting fracture geometry and reduce effect of production interference between laterals of a given pad. 
Novelty of the proposed methodology relies on the explicit description of the hydraulic fracturing geometry and direct coupling with reservoir simulation, not only for a single well, but considering a whole pad of horizontal wells as per a possible development of the Vaca Muerta shale.|","unconventional, hydraulic fracturing, resevoir centric approach, reservoir simulation, well spacing",5

Production rates in unconventional plays can decline dramatically, up to 70% in the first year. Refracturing—by today's understanding—is a remedial production operation often done because original fracturing failed to contribute any significant amount of flow, performance of the initial completion has degraded over time to below operationally or economically acceptable limits, or significant unfractured pay exists in the well. 
Developments in nondamaging, degradable diverters with outstanding plugging efficiency have opened new opportunities for protecting existing fractures by plugging them and then fracturing zones that were previously bypassed because of inefficient zone coverage or refracturing zones that were inefficiently fractured initially. In fact, these new diverters enable zonal isolation for horizontal wells with multiple perforation clusters and for temporarily plugging perforations for re-stimulation treatments instead of squeezing the perforations and sealing them off. With multistage operations becoming the industry norm, operators need easily deployable diversion technologies that will protect previously stimulated perforations and enable adding new ones to untreated perforations or bypassed zones. 
This paper reviews in-stage Diversion, including a brief discussion of diverter candidate selection in terms of production and risk assessment to ensure return on investment. Also included is an explanation of underlying mechanisms controlling the diversion process and the use of advanced modeling techniques to enhance efficiency of diversion operations. Then a case study is discussed to highlight how temporary and degradable chemistry can be used to enhance zone coverage, to provide temporary isolation between zones in shale fracturing operations, and to achieve multiple effective fracture treatments within the same stage. These degradable chemical diverting agents form a solid impermeable barrier or seal that in time will break or degrade to liquid form, leaving the existing zone that was diverted open to permit flow.|","Diversion, Stimulation, Unconventional, Case Studies, Hydraulic Fracturing",30

In reality, a nonplanar hydraulic-fracture geometry with varying fracture width and fracture permeability is created during the hydraulic-fracturing process. However, it is challenging to simulate well performance from the nonplanar fracture geometry. For the sake of simplicity, the nonplanar fracture geometry is often represented by ideal planar fracture geometry with constant fracture width, which one can easily handle analytically, semianalytically, and numerically. However, such ideal fracture geometry is inadequate to capture the physics of the transient flow behavior of the nonplanar fracture geometry. Although significant efforts were made in recent years to numerically model well performance from the complex fracture geometry, these approaches are still challenging to model the nonplanar fracture geometry with varying width because of large considerable fracture-gridding issues and an expensive computation cost. In addition, the effect of nonplanar fracture geometry on well productivity and transient flow behavior was not reported in the literature. Hence, a model to handle the nonplanar fracture geometry by considering varying fracture width and fracture permeability is still lacking in the petroleum industry. Zhou et al. (2014) proposed a semianalytical model to handle the complex fracture geometry with constant fracture width. However, the semianalytical model did not consider the effects of stress-dependent fracture conductivity and the nonplanar fracture geometry as well as planar fracture geometry with varying fracture width along the fracture. In this work, we extended the semianalytical model to simulate production from the nonplanar fracture geometry as well as planar fracture geometry with varying width. In addition, the effect of stress-dependent fracture conductivity was implemented in the model. We verified the semianalytical model against a numerical reservoir simulator for single planar fracture with constant width. We performed two case studies. The first case contains a comparison of two planar fractures, one with constant fracture width and another with varying fracture width. In the second study, we compared two fractures with different fracture geometries such as planar fracture geometry and nonplanar fracture geometry, which were generated from the fracture-propagation model. In addition, transient flow regimes were investigated on the basis of a log-log graph of the dimensionless pressure drop and pressure-drop derivative vs. the dimensionless time. This work can provide critical insights into understanding the well performance from tight oil reservoirs with the nonplanar hydraulic-fracture geometry.|","Planar fracture , Geomechanics, Transient flow behavior , Tight oil, Non-planar fracture",33

In order to increase production rate, reduce treatment period, and solve some special problems, multi-well completion has been proposed, especially in mountain areas with limited well pads. Simultaneous fracturing and zipper fracturing are two new fracturing patterns in multi-well completion, which can increase fracture network complexity and stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) because of the interference of wells or fractures. However, unlike multi-frac treatments of a single well, interference between multi-wells also increases difficulties on hydraulic fracturing design. 
In the previous papers, we have shown that natural fractures impacted the direction of hydraulic fracture propagation and mechanical properties of reservoir formations, which increases the complexity of fracture network complexity. As known, hydraulic fracture propagation is a complicated process influenced by frac spacing, hydraulic fracture length, mechanical properties of natural fractures, and in-situ stress. Especially, in-situ stress and natural fractures play more complex roles in multi-well completions. 
In this paper, we presented one numerical model to better understand the process of hydraulic fracture propagation in multi-well completions, which includes influences of in-situ stress changes and interactions between hydraulic fracture and natural fractures. The numerical results show that in addition to hydraulic fracture propagating, natural fracture opening also changes in-situ stress, which makes hydraulic fracture network more complex. The model has been validated in a zipper fracturing case, and the optimization of well spacing, frac spacing and treatment volume has been proposed to enhance stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) and increase shale gas production. 
The simulation results of this paper provide some guidelines for hydraulic fracturing design in multi-well completions, which contains optimum well spacing, frac spacing, and treatment volume. The results of this paper may also help deal with limited well pad area and increase gas production, and ultimately it should lead to improved well economics.|","Zipper frac, Hydraulic fracturing, Multi-well completions, Numerical simulation, Shale gas",37

However, most reservoir models assume that the induced fractures are planar for the sake of simplicity. Considering the growing interest of the petroleum industry in better understanding production from these resources, we develop a fracture-cell model to capture the effects of fracture nonplanarity on transport properties. |To build a realistic reservoir model for a fractured formation, we must account for three types of interactions: matrix-matrix (M-M), matrix-fracture (M-F), and fracture-fracture (F-F). The transport properties of the M-M interaction are based on laboratory measurements. In this study, we analytically determine the transport properties of the two other types of interactions (M-F and F-F). For this purpose, we account for the aperture size and spatial location of the fracture. As a result, we provide effective porosity and effective anisotropic permeabilities for a reservoir cell that contains a fracture inside it. The reservoir cell with transport properties that are modified is a fracture cell. |We implement the fracture-cell model in a reservoir simulator and perform analyses for a single fracture and for multiple intersecting fractures; these fractures are nonplanar. The analyses include both single- and multiphase flow models and show that the hydrocarbon pressure inside the reservoir is strongly dependent on the fracture geometry when the matrix permeability is smaller than 1 µd. Thus, it is crucial to model the fracture geometry more accurately in unconventional reservoirs with ultralow permeabilities such as shale. |One can easily implement the developed fracture-cell model in reservoir simulators, and there is no local refinement around the fracture. The main advantage of the proposed model is its simplicity, conjoined with its ability to capture the nonplanarity of the fracture.

One challenge to efficiently use the technique is the generation of effective hydraulic fractures from all perforation clusters. In this work, we conducted a fundamental study of physical mechanisms controlling simultaneous multiple-fracture propagation and discussed the potential approaches to improve nonuniform development of multiple fractures. This study was investigated by our recently developed 3D fracture-propagation model that captures the coupled elastic deformation of the rock with fluid flow in the horizontal wellbore and within the fractures. The model demonstrated that fracture geometry was controlled by both the stress-shadow effects and dynamic partitioning of flow rate. The analysis results indicated that the nonuniform development of a multiple-fracture array, for example, a three-fracture array in this study, was induced by the uneven partitioning of flow rate into each fracture, which was dependent on the flow resistance from wellbore friction, perforation friction, and fracture propagation. Furthermore, the stress shadowing from the exterior fractures exerted additional stress on the interior fractures and increased the resistance of fracture propagation, resulting in the interior fractures receiving much less fluid. To minimize the negative effects of stress shadowing and favor more-uniform fracture growth, we investigated potential approaches to promote uniform partitioning of flow rate through adjusting the flow resistance between multiple fractures. The results showed that adjusting perforation friction can provide an effective way to modify the partitioning of flow rate and mitigate the negative effects of stress shadowing. The mechanisms investigated in this study are consistent with field observations. Our approach can help field operators to improve the effectiveness of multiple fracturing treatments and maximize the production.|","hydraulic fracture, three-dimensional fracture propagation model, simultaneous propagation, multiple hydraulic fractures",16
882,883,180997-MS,Successful Dynamic Closure Test Using Controlled Flow Back in the Vaca Muerta Formation,"Varela, R. A., YPF S.A.| Maniere, J. L., Schlumberger","|Abstract 
The Vaca Muerta formation is a shale oil and gas reservoir under active tectonics created by the Andes which are compressing the basin in an east to west direction and creates a varying stress regime both in horizontal and vertical directions. Additionally, this formation is composed of alternating layers of three litho-types with contrasted mechanical properties. These are organic shale, carbonate and ash beds. Slippage or debonding at weak-strong interfaces separating laminations is suspected to further contribute to the development of horizontal fracture components or T-Shape fractures during hydraulic fracturing when the fracturing pressure reaches the overburden (Zhang et al. 2007). 
Selecting the proper landing position of horizontal wells in these compressive environments depends not only on the reservoir quality but also in selecting a layer which combines lower stress with sufficient vertical connectivity, thus minimizing detrimental effect from T-Shape propagation behavior. 
Closure pressure can be obtained by performing a Dynamic in Situ Stress Test by force-closing the fracture (Nolte 1979; Raaen and Brudy, 2001). To this effect, YPF initiated in 2015 a campaign of in situ stress measurements across the Quintuco-Vaca Muerta system in vertical exploration and pilot wells. The objective was not only to predict a more accurate mud weight window to drill through the Vaca Muerta but mostly to measure as best as possible the difference between the overburden and the minimum horizontal stress to build a mechanical earth model accurate enough to help select better landing points for horizontal wells. 
There are 3 scales at which dynamic closure tests are performed. At the smallest scale, a micro-fracture is created by pumping a little amount of drilling fluid at few liters/minute in 1m open hole isolated between straddle packers. At the largest scale, in a cased-hole perforated well, the dynamic closure test is performed as part of fracturing data acquisition before fracture operation: at this scale the test involves tens of bbls pumped at 5-10 bpm. Finally stress can be measured during Extended Leakoff Test (ELOT or XLOT) acquired in open hole at the casing shoe. After a literature review of the development of the flow back method this paper presents extensive details and operational procedure recommendations that were obtained from successful XLOT combining multiple cycles with injection, forced flow back and reopening sequence in the Neuquen basin.|","Dynamic Closure Test, Vaca Muerta, Shale, Flow Back Rebound",27

Induced fracture complexity maximization, in addition to the primary hydraulic fracture, to improve the recovery efficiency or productivity of gas or liquids in unconventional resource shale reservoirs has been accepted and fully implemented by the industry. As a result, stimulation fluids and/or completion strategies have been engineered to maximize induced fracture complexity in many unconventional reservoirs. In typical unconventional horizontal completions, induced fracture complexity is beneficial for the productivity of nanodarcy (nd) shales if conductivity is sustained in time, although induced fracture complexity may not be a requirement for all unconventional reservoirs, especially tight sands. 
In some unconventional reservoirs, operators have observed similar productivity in wells with predominantly planar fractures compared to wells that appear to have more complex fractures. This paper, supported by extensive reservoir simulations, aims to develop criteria for situations in which induced fracture complexity and sustained conductivity are required and when they are not. The simulations include a reservoir permeability range of 10 nd to 0.001 md and a fracture complexity conductivity of 1 to 5 md-ft with and without stress dependence. The simulation results show that the fracture complexity with a constant and sustained conductivity (no stress dependent) are generally important for reservoir permeabilities lower than 100 nd for gas and 500 nd for liquid-producing reservoirs, but this benefit is minimized when the induced or existing stresses negatively affect the fracture complexity conductivity. 
Based on these results, an optimized completion strategy is suggested to maximize the productivity or recovery factor (RF) in unconventional gas- and liquid-producing reservoirs.|","innovation, RF maximization, production improvement, RF improvement, new ideas",0

S., GeoMechanics Technologies| Hermansson, L. C., Ridge| Hatland, J., Ridge| Risanger, M., Ridge| Torsvik, M., Wintershall Norge A/S","|Abstract 
The objective is to investigate potential fault reactivation caused by high-volume injection into a North Sea well to assess the risks associated with converting a production well into a water injection well. The well is located within the Brage Field less than 100 meters from a major fault and there is concern for fault reactivation due to high volume water injection near this fault. 
An integrated 3D geologic, fluid flow and geomechanical model was developed for the area of interest to evaluate fault reactivation risks. The 3D integrated models were constructed based on seismic horizon data and well logs. The 3D fluid flow model was calibrated and history matched using the pressure and temperature data from the current well and other adjacent wells. The developed 3D fluid and heat flow model was used to estimate pressure and temperature distributions adjacent to the fault after water injection in the target well. The results of the 3D fluid flow model were then imported into the 3D geomechanical model to predict the induced stresses and displacements near the injection zone and on the face of the fault. 
The results of the integrated geologic, fluid flow and geomechanical models indicate that the poro-elastic stresses induced by high volume injection into the proposed well are not sufficient to induce major slip on the nearby main fault, considering a wide range of reasonable physical and material property assumptions for the fault. 
The results of this study are used in specifying the maximum daily water injection rates in the proposed well without the fault reactivation concerns. With the proposed water injection rate, the sealing capacity of the major fault will be guaranteed and the injected water will be directed into the reservoir for pressurization and water flooding purposes.|","fault reactivation, water injection conformance, injection risk management, geomechanics, injection modeling",61

Due to the low porosity of a shale reservoir, the amount of stored free gas is limited. The pore volume of shale is majorly composed of micropores and mesopores, which are perfect storage spaces for sorbed gas. As a result, a shale gas reservoir contains a significant amount of sorbed gas through physical adsorption. The adsorption behavior of shale is usually analogue to coal, although the average diameters of nanopores and compositions of shale are different from those of coal. Many adsorption models of shale and coal have been proposed in previous studies. No matter which model is chosen to describe an isothermal adsorption, the absolute adsorption is derived from the measured excess adsorption data. The basic calculation theory of absolute adsorption assumes that volume changes are only caused by adsorption. However, volume changes are also caused by adsorbent swelling or shrinkage, gas absorption into organic matter, and Helium adsorption. In this work, a modified adsorption model is introduced to account for the unexpected volume effects and accurately calculate absolute adsorption. 
The proposed model is based on the Dubinin-Astakhov (DA) model (pore-filling theory), since it is more suitable to describe the gas adsorption behavior in nanopores than the Langmuir Model that mainly describes the monolayer adsorption on homogeneous surfaces. Methane is a supercritical fluid under a high pressure and temperate reservoir condition. As a result, the pressure terms in the DA model are replaced by the density to overcome the problem of the determination of saturation pressure. The volume change term is additionally added to the adsorption equation to account for the effect of volume changes. Six groups of shale adsorption data are applied to validate the proposed model and analyze the volume effects. 
The proposed model shows better fitting results than the traditional DA model. Especially, the proposed model captures abnormal adsorption behavior under the extreme high pressure and high temperature conditions. The previous reported adsorbent swelling or shrinkage and gas absorption into organic matter are illustrated and explained by the calculated volume change terms. The adsorption capacity and other fitted parameters estimated by the proposed model are more reasonable and accurate than those predicted by the DA model. This study highlights the effect of volume changes on absolute adsorption calculation, and provides an extensive insight on shale gas adsorption behaviors under reservoir conditions.|","Geomechanics, Pore Confinement, Tight Oil Reservoir, CO2 EOR",37

We have performed a laboratory study of cryogenic fracturing for improving oil/gas recovery from low-permeability shale and tight reservoirs. Our objective is to develop well stimulation techniques using cryogenic fluids, e.g. liquid nitrogen (LN) to increase permeability in a large reservoir volume surrounding wells. The new technology has the potential to reduce formation damage created by current stimulation methods as well as minimize or eliminate water usage and groundwater contamination. 
The concept of cryogenic fracturing is that sharp thermal gradient (thermal shock) created at the rock surface by applying cryogenic fluid can cause strong local tensile stress and initiate fractures. We developed a laboratory system for cryogenic fracturing under true triaxial loading, with a liquid nitrogen delivery/control and measurement system. The loading system simulates confining stresses by independently loading each axis up to about 5000 psi on 8""<U+00D7>8""<U+00D7>8"" cubes. Both temperature in boreholes and block surfaces and fluid pressure in boreholes were continuously monitored. Acoustic and pressure-decay measurements are obtained before and at various stages of stimulations. Cubic blocks (8""<U+00D7>8""<U+00D7>8"") of Niobrara shale, concrete, and sandstones have been tested, and stress levels and anisotropies are varied. Three schemes are considered: gas fracturing without cryo-stimulation, gas fracturing after low-pressure cryogen flow-through, gas fracturing after high-pressure flow-through. 
Pressure decay results show that liquid nitrogen stimulation clearly increases permeability, and repeated stimulations further increase the permeability. Acoustic velocities and amplitudes decreased significantly following cryo-stimulation indicating fracture creation. In the gas fracturing without the stimulation, breakdown (complete fracturing) occurs suddenly without any initial leaking, and major fracture planes form along the plane containing principal stress and intermediate stress directions as expected theoretically. However, in the gas fracturing after cryogenic stimulations, breakdown occurred gradually and with massive leaking due to thermal fractures created during stimulation. In addition, the major fracture direction does not necessarily follow the plane containing principal stress direction, esp. at low confining stress levels. In tests, we have observed that cryogenic stimulation seems to disrupt the internal stress field. The increase of borehole temperature after stimulation affects the permeability of the specimen. While a stimulated specimen is still cold, it keeps high permeability because fractures remain open and local thermal tension is maintained near the borehole. When the rock becomes warm again, fractures close and permeability decreases. In these tests, we have not used proppants. Overall, fractures are clearly generated by low and high-pressure thermal shocks. The added pressure of the high-pressure thermal shocks helps to further propagate cryogenic fractures generated by thermal shock. Breakdown pressure is significantly lowered by LN stimulation with breakdown pressure reductions up to about 40% observed.|","formation stimulation, tight oil reservoir, Cryogenic Fracturing, unconventional reservoir, shale gas formation",60

The extraction of petroleum and natural gas is an operation which results in the alteration of the subsurface stress distribution in geological formations. During cold water injection in these hot formations, the initial in situ stress magnitude and orientation is affected. These thermal effects have lead to a great deal, in both conventional and unconventional reservoir development. 
In this study fully coupled 3D Mechanical Earth Model (MEM) simulation employing Finite Element and Finite Difference analysis was conducted to:  
Study the poroelastic and thermal effects on fracture propagation and formation integrity. 
Examine principle rock mechanics properties and its relation with thermal induced fracturing (TIF). |The analysis considers thermal flow, poroelasticity and thermoelasticity constitutive equations under isothermal and non-isothermal water flooding scenarios at different bottom hole injection pressures for a given time. 
The research focusing on mechanical responses at two different reservoir rocks types for two different stress regimes based on E. M. Anderson's classification scheme. The widely used linear Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion is expressed in terms of Principal effective stresses assuming non-zero cohesion, for the determination of potential fracture plane. We conduct a detailed sensitivity analysis and the results indicate that the thermal effect becomes clearly obvious in cases of stiff reservoir rocks. 
The reservoir rock was subjected initially in ideally triaxial conditions where Normal Stress regime was taking place. At late times of injection, the initial stress regime has been totally reversed (RF). Pore pressure increase causes pore extraction and tensile stress while the temperature (T) decrease create tensile load and thermal contraction to pore space. Hence, thermal tensile stress is added to tensile load during pore pressure increase causing inadvertent thermal induced fracturing. 
Comparing the Sandstone and Limestone geomechanical response with respect to maximum (s1)-minimum (s3) effective stresses (psi) during thermoelastic loading, it is clear that in stiff reservoir rocks (limestone) where Young's modulus is large, cold water injection will lead to tensile or shear failure. This rock property combined with the thermal effect reflects to higher fracture deviation (Fxz) from Mohr-Coulomb theoretical plane. 
We can conclude that thermally induced fracturing is typically observed when there is a wide differential between the reservoir temperature and the injected fluid. Thermal induced fracturing during cold water injection differs from hydraulic fracturing for well stimulation. In TIF, the propagation of the fracture is strongly dependent on the area of the cooled zone while in hydraulic fracturing the thermal effect is neglected. Moreover, the principal mechanism for TIF factures is the effect of thermally induced stress on fracture initiation pressure. Thermal induced fracture is the result of superimposed poroelastic and thermoelastic stresses in space and time.|","Geomechanics, Thermal Induced Fractures, Tensile Failure, Thermoelasticity",35

The new quest for unconventional resources as well as underground storage sector (CO2, air and natural gas) is the achievement of well integrity which is highlighted by the inadequacy of conventional cementing procedures to provide zonal isolation. Knowledge of the mechanism of fatigue in cement and factors that affect it such as the magnitude of the load, strength and composition of the cement, mechanical properties of the cement and pattern of load cycles are important to achieve a realistic design of a cement system subjected to fatigue loading. Finite element investigations help engineers to assess the stress magnitude and evolution for a given well configuration, but when structural calculations for casing-cement system are required, missing input parameters reduce the quality of the results. 
In order to obtain reliable data, extensive experimental work using Class G cement with and without salt addition has been performed in order to measure the principal parameters for mechanical structural calculations: compressive and tensile strength, Young modulus, Poison Ratio. The data was measured under room conditions and elevated temperature and pressure. The results were also extrapolated for a time period beyond 60 days. The obtained data is also compared with published values. Several SPE papers showed that excellent data inventory for well cement is needed when mechanical studies on cement, like finite element studies, are required. 
This paper will focus on various cement properties required to succsesfull cement an underground storage well by showing the effects of salt concentration on class G cements used as a reference. The results will help fill gaps in the knowledge about the behavior and reliability of NaCl salt cement slurry in cementing jobs by providing extensive data to perform mechanical and rheological calculations. It will similarly aid in the optimization of cement design and represents a source of input data for numerical simulations of well cement performance. 
We were able to establish/prove a relationship between salt content and permeability and, moreover, to show that fresh water in contact with set cement may massively change the porosity of the cement. For the first time, public reliable cement properties are systematically collated and compared.|","permeability degradation, cement properties, well integrity, salt cement",11

Water injection is commonly used to improve oil recoveries in depleting reservoirs. However, insufficient injectivity can result in water injection projects being limited in injection rates which can sometimes make them uneconomic. Implementing water injection projects requires a multi-disciplinary approach to optimize water injection rates for reservoir performance, costs and well design considerations. 
The costs for the surface facilities are dependent on the required water quality, water temperature and other operating parameters which are linked to the injectivity of water. A workflow including quantitative assessment of the injectivity development as a function of the operating parameters as well as the uncertain geomechanical and reservoir parameters can be used to improve the surface facility design. 
Such a workflow was applied to a shallow off-shore field. The results showed that the base case design of the facilities should be modified to avoid an increase of the flowing Bottom Hole Pressure (BHP) above the minimum stress of the caprock. The effect of the various parameters on the BHP was investigated and the sensitivity of the BHP to uncertain input parameters under different operating conditions was tested. The results indicated that the BHP does not exceed the BHP limit and hence, the injectivity is expected to be high enough for a sufficiently long period of time under a wide range of conditions.|","Operating Envelope, Shallow Reservoir, Surface Facilities, Water Injection, Fracturing Conditions",21

Inwell measurement of rates and ratios do not allow operators to proactively control flow into the well. For intelligent fields there is a growing need for tools that enable engineers to ‘see’ further into the reservoir in order to adjust and/or change the flow control strategy as required. From a reservoir management perspective the most value can be achieved when implementing intelligent flow control systems coupled with surveillance tools. Hence, this study presents a way of defining a fit for purpose surveillance strategy that can be coupled with active flow control systems that facilitates the optimisation of the recovery efficiency. 
A dynamic simulator was used to analyse and determine a monitoring strategy that provides the most cost effective method of understanding various phenomena occurring within the reservoir, such as water/gas encroachment. The intention of the study was to determine if the data set currently obtained is sufficient enough to provide a deep understanding of the reservoir. The dynamic simulator modelled the temperature, saturation and pressure changes and the post-processer was used to derive corresponding changes in resistivity and acoustic properties. The change in temperature was important to model in order to study the parameter for its surveillance value as well as to capture thermal effects on reservoir fluid properties and geomechanical properties. The electro-magnetic and acoustic properties were calculated using a well-known formulae; resistivity was derived by inverting the Archie equation. 
Results from the study were used to specify what the surveillance tools should measure and what detection distance would allow operators to proactively adjust the flow control devices/valves in order to maximise the value of the development. Sensitivity and optimisation analysis was conducted to obtain the distance of investigation required by the surveillance. The study demonstrated that a simple 1-way coupling gives representative estimations of electro-magnetic and acoustic properties over field production time. This will be able to assist in determining which methods of surveillance can be used over the life of the field assisting in recommending a suitable data acquisition strategy to extract maximum value from the tools available; DAS/DTS/DSS/DPS/DxS, EM, seismic and other methods. 
Simple 1-way coupling is often enough to estimate the change with suitable accuracy to assess feasibility of various surveillance techniques. DAS could have an application in continuous cross-well tomography to follow the flood front; this subject is to be studied further.|","surveillance, DAS, Reservoir Management, intelligent fields, flow control",39

Three onshore basins (called henceforth A, B, and C) in eastern Australia are discussed in this paper with the focus on geomechanics. Basin A is a coal seam gas play with a few thousand wells already drilled, and reservoir layers in the depth range of 300 to 1000 m, inter-bedded with impermeable clastics. Stress determination has been a key challenge as initial minifrac interpretations showed significant scatter in stress and pore pressure results. But with more consistent processing and interpretation constant effective stress ratios could be defined over large areas and depth sections. This helped also in interpreting microseismic data related to hydraulic fracturing – essential for economic production in areas of lower coal permeability - as reactivation of existing natural fractures seems to take place during injection. Basins B and C with tight formations as reservoir targets, in depths of about 4000 to 4600 m show overpressures that are difficult to directly measure and could only be constrained to lower values than mini frac test interpretations, after iteratively calibrating the geomechanical model and considering drilling data. This allowed a better understanding of thermal effects on progressing shear failure in openhole sections, due to increasing drilling mud fluids temperature with time; an effect that has to be considered in defining safe mud windows for drilling and operations phases. Although gradually a better understanding has been achieved, above unconventional fields still pose challenges, and current results will have to be considered as work in progress and not final. The key outcome of the geomechanics studies to date is: that a strike-slip stress regime applies, regionally and vertically; several depth intervals show constant effective stress ratios for both horizontal stresses, with some changes depending on location, and probably due to the structural differences.|","drilling induced fractures, breakouts, unconventionals, geomechanics, lithology-dependent",35

Shale gas production gets a tremendous breakthrough with the advent of horizontal well and massive hydraulic fracturing. There is still extensive gas stored in a reservoir after primary production so gas injection has a possibility to improve gas recovery for a shale play. In shale gas reservoirs, the gas can be in a free or absorbed state. In addition, there is a difference in the adsorption capacity between hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon components, therefore, it may cause gas recovery variation by hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon gas injection. 
In this paper, a Montney shale gas reservoir is modeled by Petrel based on data from Accumap. CH4/CO2 flooding performances are simulated by CMG GEM.

D., Texas A&M University| Beckham, R. E., ExxonMobil Upstream Research Company| Shuchart, C. E., ExxonMobil Development Company","|Abstract 
Acid jetting, as a well stimulation method for carbonate reservoirs, has shown optimistic results in the production enhancement of some extended reach horizontal wells. It was used initially to promote damage removal along a wellbore via multiple strategically-located injection nozzles. It has the potential to place the injecting fluid at the locations that need stimulation. Jetting may also enhance wormhole propagation compared with conventional matrix acidizing. These hypotheses are currently being investigated to improve the design for more efficient stimulation treatments. 
We have conducted an experimental study to investigate the effect of jetting on wormhole efficiency. The jetting experiments are conducted at a constant pressure with linear core-flood tests, where a stand-off distance is maintained between the injection nozzle tip and the core. At low-velocity acid injection, jetting effectively removes mud filter-cake by mechanical actions. Jetting also creates wormholes in carbonate cores. The combination of mechanical and chemical reactions stimulates carbonate rocks better than matrix acidizing without the jetting nozzle. When the jetting velocity increases, the dissolution pattern changes. An isolated locally compact dissolution results in a cavity at the entries of core samples by jetting, followed by a wormhole structure. With the known dissolution pattern, sensitivity studies are carried out to investigate the effect of various parameters on the experimental outcome. 
We used Indiana and Winterset limestone rocks in the experiments. 15% HCl (by weight) at ambient temperature was used and the core dimensions were 4 inches in diameter and 16 inches in length. Various combinations of acid jetting velocities and acid fluxes were considered. The Winterset limestone cores are more heterogeneous, with higher porosity and lower permeability than the Indiana limestone cores. From the experimental results, the results of acid jetting from the two different rock samples are compared. 
The experimental results indicate that acid jetting follows the same trend as matrix acidizing regarding wormhole propagation once cavities are created. Jetting velocity and acid flux are the critical parameters in jetting design for optimal stimulation results. Acid jetting tends to create different dissolution patterns for Indiana limestone and Winterset limestone cores. The observations from this work highlight the importance of understanding the dynamic chemical process of jetting in the design of successful acid stimulation jobs.|","acid stimulation, jetting, carbonate",46

This paper is to present a new non-linear flow model for low-velocity multiphase flow in tight petroleum reservoirs as well as its analytical and numerical solutions. The pore and pore-throat sizes of shale and tight-rock formations are on the order of tens of nanometers. The fluid flow in such small pores is significantly affected by walls of pores and pore-throats. This boundary-layer effect on fluid flow in tight rocks has been investigated through laboratory work. In analogue to flow through capillary tubes, it is found that the ratio of the thickness of boundary layer over the size of capillary tube is a function of pressure gradient; and the non-linear relationship between flow rate and pressure gradient is pronounced under the drive of small pressure gradient or low flow velocity. It is also observed that low permeability is associated with large boundary layer effect on fluid flow. Based on the studies of single-phase and multiphase flow though capillary tubes, the new non-Darcy flow model is proposed for describing multiphase flow in tight rock. 
The experimental results from a single capillary tube are extended to a bundle of tubes and finally to porous media of tight formations. A physics-based, non-Darcy low-velocity flow equation is derived to account for the boundary layer effect of tight reservoirs by adding a non-Darcy coefficient term, which is function of dimensionless thickness of boundary layer and pressure gradient. This non-Darcy equation describes the fluid flow more accurately for tight oil reservoir with low production rate and low pressure gradient as compared to laboratory observation. 
Both analytical and numerical solutions are obtained for the new non-Darcy flow model. First, a Buckley-Leverett type analytical solution is derived including gravity effect with this non-Darcy flow equation. Then, a numerical model has been developed for implementing this non-Darcy flow model for accurate simulation of multi-dimensional porous and fractured tight oil reservoirs. The sensitivity studies based on numerical simulations demonstrate the non-negligible effect of boundary layer on fluid flow in tight formations using an actual field example. Eventually, the experiment-based non-Darcy flow model could improve the forecast accuracy for long-term production rate and recovery factors of tight oil reservoirs. 
A new, physics-based low-velocity non-Darcy flow model is developed for description of single-phase and multiphase flow in tight reservoirs. In addition, both analytical and numerical solutions are provided for application of the new non-Darcy flow model for field studies. The results and knowledge obtained in this study may be applicable to both oil and gas flow in unconventional reservoirs.|","Low-velocity flow, tight reservoirs, unconventional reservoirs, Numerical simulation, non-Darcy flow",57

Within the European context, CO2 storage operations shall address the potential impacts of large scale CO2 storage through risk assessment. The key risks identified for this onshore CO2 storage site were the migration through faults and ground deformation. 
To quantify the CO2 migration along a fault, flow modelling and uncertainties management codes are coupled to compute the failure probability i.e. the probability of CO2 migration towards a control aquifer. Such probability of failure is characterized by low to very low probability of occurrence which requires a large number of simulations to enable its evaluation. Each failure scenario models the CO2 migration from a storage aquifer to a control aquifer when altering the flow properties of the fault zone. Fault failure analyses are performed on the surrogate models. They show that limited CO2 migration is occurring along the fault but no breakthrough in the control aquifer. The injection induces some pressure disturbance in the control aquifer in about 30% of the cases which lead to effective stress changes. 
To quantify effective stress changes due to CO2 injection and the subsequent ground deformation, the mechanical responses of the different sediment layers are modeled coupling flow and geomechanics. The impact of the stress changes on porosity and permeability of the storage reservoir is modeled along with the impact of uncertainties of the mechanical parameters. For this onshore CO2 storage site study case, the expected ground displacement is negligible (below the limit of the measurement capabilities).|","failure probabilty, Risk assessment, CO2 storage, geomechanics flow model",4

Yucel, Texas A&M University, College Station","|Abstract 
Quantification of gas transport in organic rich shale is important in determining natural gas production rates. However, laboratory measurements are challenging due to very tight nature of the rock, and have large uncertainties due to presence of multiple mechanisms of gas transport at multiple pore scales. In this paper, the emphasis is on the understanding of transport inside organic material known as kerogen and prediction of its permeability. 
We performed nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations of steady-state methane flow in single-wall carbon nanotube based on a moving piston model (Riewchotisakul and Akkutlu, 2015). The piston model allows us to observe transition from convection to molecular (pore) diffusion under the reservoir conditions and to understand the effects of adsorbed methane molecules on the overall transport in the tube. The results show that the adsorbed molecules are not only mobile but also contribute a significant portion to the total mass flux. Simulations with different sizes of capillaries show that the contribution is profound in capillaries with diameter less than 10nm. The adsorbed-phase transport velocity is independent of capillary size, but strongly dependent on pressure drop across the capillary. This allowed us to formulate the transport as an additional diffusion mechanism by the capillary walls using a modified Hagen-Poiseuille equation and predict the transport enhancement. 
In the second part of the paper, we considered steady-state transport across a pore-network of inter-connected nano-capillaries. The preliminary simulation results show that the modified Hagen-Poiseuille equation leads to representative elementary volume of a model kerogen. The estimated permeability of the volume is sensitive to surface properties of the nanocapillary walls indicating that fluid-wall interactions driven by molecular forces could be significant during the large-scale transport within kerogen.

Many analytical methods are available and widely used in the industry to analyse single-phase flow in the reservoir. Analytical modeling, flowing material balance, type curve analysis and various straight-line diagnostic plots are some of the examples. 
All these methods are based on the diffusivity equation. Analytical solutions for the diffusivity equation with various boundary conditions are readily available only for the cases when the coefficients in this equation are constant. 
Coefficients of the diffusivity equation are functions of fluid and rock properties (such as density, total compressibility, viscosity and permeability). Traditionally the approach was:  
For single-phase liquid flow (oil or water): variation of liquid and rock properties with pressure is assumed to be negligible. Under this assumption the diffusivity equation has constant coefficients and can be solved analytically. 
For singe-phase gas flow: use pseudo-pressure and pseudo-time formulations to account for the variations of gas and rock properties with pressure and to convert the diffusivity equation to a form that has constant coefficients. |This approach has worked well for conventional oil plays. However these days we are producing oils with higher gas content; on top of that, there are reservoirs with higher pressure drawdowns and geomechanical effects (rock compressibility and permeability vary with pressure). 
The objective of this study is to demonstrate that the assumption of liquid and rock properties being ‘almost constant’ is no longer valid for the cases we face these days and to discuss possible ways to account for change in liquid and rock properties. 
For this study we used synthetic datasets (oil rates and flowing pressure), generated using a numerical multi-frac model based on realistic oil and rock properties for volatile oil in an unconventional reservoir. First, we used the traditional approach to analyse this dataset using linear straight-line analysis, flowing material balance analysis and analytical modeling. Analysis results were significantly different from the correct ones (correct results are known since we used synthetic cases). 
Next, we modified all three analyses, to account for the fact that oil and rock properties vary with pressure. The modification is similar to what is traditionally done for gas cases (using pseudo-pressure and pseudo-time formulations). We also applied an additional modification to account for changes in fluid properties when pressure drops below the bubble point (two-phase oil pseudo-pressure). 
We observed that the traditional approach may give significantly wrong results (in a particular example the OOIP estimated using flowing material balance was about 2 times larger than the actual OOIP, and the estimated linear flow parameter xfvk was 30% higher than the actual xfvk). 
For the cases where pressure remains above the bubble point, we observed that the suggested modification (using oil pseudo-pressure and pseudo-time) brings answers obtained from analyses very close to the actual ones. 
For the cases where the pressure drops below the bubble point, we observed that the suggested modification (using two-phase oil pseudo-pressure and pseudo-time) results in answers that are still not completely accurate. However, results obtained using the suggested modification are much closer to the actual answers, as compared to the traditional approach. 
Using the suggested modifications generates more reliable results when applying analytical methods to the case of single-phase oil flow and significantly improves estimates when applying analytical methods to the case of two-phase flow (oil below the bubble point).|","Unconventional, oil properties, Analytical methods, Liquid pseudo-pressure",36

Gas flow modelling in shale and tight gas reservoirs is still challenging mainly due to different pore-scale flow regimes present in micro- and nano-pores of these reservoirs. The effect of geomechanical stress also significantly affect the measurement and prediction of apparent matrix permeability. In this study, series of experiments were designed and performed on three shale samples to study the simultaneous effects of slippage and stress at five different pore pressures and four net stresses. The experimental data were used to obtain a general slip plot, which quantifies the effect of slippage on matrix permeability. Then, the stress effect was taken into account by modifying the average pore size and non-slip permeability at each net stress based on the experimental observations. It is found that the matrix non-slip permeability and average pore size follow an exponential behaviour when changing the net stress. These two relationships are then proposed to be incorporated into the corresponding slip flow model in order to capture the effects of slippage and stress at the same time. The validity of the proposed model was also investigated (using published data in the literature), which shows that the proposed technique is able to capture the intensity of permeability reduction and enhancement due to stress and slippage, respectively. The outcomes of this study increase our knowledge of rarefied flow dynamic inside micro- and nano-pores under confining stress, which is necessary for accurate predictions of the apparent matrix permeability in unconventional reservoirs.|","Matrix Permeability, Geomechanical Effect, Shale Gas, Slip Flow, Slippage",28

Three general categories of modeling are traditionally used to provide shale reserve forecasting – (1) decline curve analysis (DCA), (2) rate-time analysis (RTA), and (3) numerical model history matching (HM). The focus of this paper is aligning each of the three modeling approaches to ensure maximum consistency in terms of fundamental reservoir description, including (but not limited to) initial fluid in place, reservoir rock properties, PVT, well completion factors, fracture area and conductivity, well controls, and definition of infinite-acting and boundary-dominated flow regimes. The HM model approach, though more rigorous, is time consuming and cannot be used for the hundreds of wells in a typical shale field. We recommend, as have others, that history-matched numerical models be used to help calibrate RTA and DCA models in a consistent manner for all wells. 
Once a consistent model framework is achieved, reserve forecasting can be better understood by regulators, engineering and reserve teams within the operating company and their partners. Furthermore, a consistent modeling framework can provide more reliable uncertainty analysis to establish probabilistic reserves estimates in terms of P90-P50-P10 values (1P-2P-3P). 
Modeling methods used in forecasting shale reserves are based on production data that includes rates and pressures. DCA applies the boundary-dominated methods such as Arps, where multiple time regions are used to capture infinite-acting and boundary-dominated flow. RTA uses dimensionless pressure and rate solutions applicable to horizontal wells with multiple fractures, including superposition, pseudopressure and pseudotime. Numerical models solve the complex set of differential equations describing multiphase fluid flow using a properly-selected grid refinement (e.g. near fractures) and, in some cases, a dual porosity/dual permeability treatment of fracture-matrix interaction.|","Shale Reserve Forecasting, Shale Forecast Uncertainty, Shale Well Modeling",44

A three dimensional geomechanical model was built using commercially available Finite Element Analysis (FEA) software to simulate propagating hydraulic fracture (HF) and its interaction with a vertical natural fracture (NF) in tight medium. The approach initially involved studying simple three dimensional single layered model followed by complex three layered model. The main area of concern was the fluid continuity at the HF-NF intersection. Different approaches were considered to model this fluid continuity. Finally, newly introduced elements were used for modeling the intersection of the NF-HF planes. These elements have ability to model the fluid continuity at HF-NF intersection. 
It was observed that for high stress contrast the NF activated length is smaller compared with the low stress contrast. For high stress contrast with principal horizontal stresses reversed, the HF intersects, activates and opens the NF. Increasing the injection rate results in longer and wider HF but does not significantly affect the NF activated length. Injection fluid viscosity shows an inverse relationship with HF length and a proportional relationship with HF opening or width as well as with NF length. It was observed that a weak NF plane temporarily restricts the HF propagation. On the other hand, a tougher NF or a NF with properties similar to surroundings does not show this type of restriction. The NF activated length was found maximum in the case of weaker NF and nearly zero in the case of stronger NF and NF similar to surroundings. 
This paper presents the results for a three layered, three dimensional geomechanical model with single HF and NF orthogonally intersecting each other, using the newly introduced cohesive elements for the first time in technical literature. Further a detailed sensitivity analysis considering the effect of stress contrast, injection rate, injection fluid viscosity and NF properties on this HF-NF interaction was conducted.|","Hydraulic Fracture, Interaction, Natural Fracture, Three Dimensional, Finite Element Analysis",0

The Southwest Partnership on Carbon Sequestration (SWP) is one of seven large-scale demonstration projects sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy. The SWP has a goal of permanently sequestering more than 1,000,000 metric tonnes of CO2 in an active EOR project in a mature waterflood in the Anadarko basin. The CO2 for this project is anthropogenically sourced from a fertilizer and an ethanol plant. As of the end of 2015 the field has 13 CO2 injectors and has sequestered 386,695 metric tonnes of CO2 between October 2013 and July of 2015. Goals of the project include optimizing the EOR/storage balance, ensuring storage permanence, and developing best practices for carbon storage utilizing man-made CO2. 
The field site provides an excellent laboratory for testing a range of monitoring technologies in an operating CO2 flood since field development is sequential and allows for multiple opportunities to record zero CO2 baseline data, midflood data, and data from fully flooded patterns. The project has acquired data at a number of scales including a 42 mi2 3D seismic survey, baseline and repeat 3D VSP surveys centered on three injection wells, cross-well tomography baseline and repeat surveys between injector/producer pairs, a borehole passive seismic array to monitor for induced seismicity, a distributed temperature system, and bottomhole pressure and temperature sensors. The project has drilled three wells in the field, and has acquired over 750 ft of core in the Morrow B reservoir interval and associated caprock units. Additional monitoring focuses on CO2 soil flux, groundwater chemistry, reservoir fluids chemistry, and aqueous and gas-phase tracer studies. 
All acquired data have contributed to detailed geologic models used for fluid flow and risk assessment simulations. 3D VSP and cross-well data with repeat surveys have allowed for direct comparisons of the reservoir prior to CO2 injection and at eight months into injection, with a goal of imaging the CO2 as it moves away from injection wells. Additional repeat surveys at regular intervals will continue to refine direct CO2 imaging as production and injection data are integrated with newly acquired and interpreted data. All models are regularly updated. In this paper the project goals will be outlined, progress towards goals enumerated, and current geologic and simulation models will be introduced. In addition, initial results from time-lapse monitoring of movement of CO2 in the reservoir will be discussed.|","EOR, CO2, Sequestration, CCUS",34

Decline curve analysis (DCA) is the most common method to forecast future production and to estimate ultimate recovery and reserves/well. The traditional form of DCA proposed by Arps is however restricted to boundary-dominated flow regimes. In unconventional shale plays, it is however likely that the transient flow regime may occur for the first few months or years of production. Consequently, the applicability of the traditional forms of DCA to early-time production data may not be appropriate. 
This work is divided in to two main sections. In the first section, we apply some of the more recent decline curve models proposed for shale wells to production data acquired from the Woodford shale in Oklahoma. A comparison is then made between the different decline curve models in terms of their ability to replicate production history in a forecast mode. In the second section, we extend earlier work performed by other authors to compare well performance across different shale plays and over different time periods. The DCA presented in the earlier work utilizes a simple Arps decline; in this work, we utilize a composite decline curve that works for the linear transient flow regime and subsequent boundary dominated flows. Our work indicates that while the Arps decline curve analysis approach may be erroneous, in comparison to a more rigorous DCA, the errors are less than 20% in predicting EUR.|","decline curve, woodford, arps",59

This paper presents the most common misinterpretations in pressure transient analysis owing to unfiltered tidal signal in well test data. Pressure transient analysis gives reservoir engineers an idea about permeability, different components of skin, reservoir model, as well as reservoir geometry. While collecting downhole pressure data, the reservoir engineer is mainly concerned about pressure changes due to fluid flow in porous media. However, the downhole pressure data is affected by a few unavoidable natural phenomena. One of such natural phenomena is the tidal effect in offshore wells and on-land wells near to the shore. Most of the times tidal signals are filtered with the help of pressure recorded by sub-sea pressure gauges and maritime tide tables. However, when those data are not available, or in case of SRO (surface read-out) without provision for filtering tidal signal, build-up data is analyzed without filtering tidal signals. 
This paper discusses how tides with different time and amplitudes effect the interpretation of build-up tests having various  values. [GR1] Tidal signals that have different amplitudes and time periods were superimposed on pure build-up pressure of infinite acting radial model data, and an interpretation of results were compared. 
Our results suggest that the early time region of the pressure build-up is not significantly affected by the tidal signal because of the steep increase in pressure. If the build-up test is continued for a significantly long time, even after pressure stabilization (not practical), tidal signals could be identified on a log-log plot by inverted U shape patterns. However, in the case of build-up studies, which are not sufficiently continued, it is likely that geneous infinite acting reservoirs are interpteted as parallel fault, U shaped fault or closed boundary models. 
Several possible misinterpretations owing to the presence of diurnal and semi diurnal tidal signals in build-up data are listed in this paper. It has to be ensured that pressure transient data is free of tidal signal before concluding any boundary presence. Unfilterd tidal signals in the pressure transient data may lead to interpretation of unrealastic boundaries. The outcome of this research will help reservoir engineers avoid misinterpreting pressure transient data.|","Offshore well testing, Well Testing, Tidal Signal, Pressure Transient Analysis, late time region",24

The effective optimization of hydraulic fracture treatments in Coiled-Tubing Drilled (CTD) horizontal wells requires the integration of geomechanical modeling and properly designed hydraulic fracture treatments, including carefully selected stage and cluster placement. Tight sandstone reservoirs are often characterized by low productive potential due to low permeability, complex compartmentalization and limited reservoir energy resulting from low reservoir pressure. Well productivity may be optimized in both open-hole and cased-hole horizontal completions by minimizing the formation damage in these sandstone reservoirs through the application of true underbalanced CTD techniques, proper lateral configuration and optimized fracture stimulation design. 
In this study, geomechanical analyses were utilized to derive rock mechanical properties of tight sandstones, such as Young's Modulus and Poisson's Ratio using basic density, porosity and acoustic (compressional and shear) logs. General drilling experiences and mud weights were considered along with the logs to model pore pressure, overburden and horizontal stresses and a log-based minimum horizontal stress was calculated. The estimated in-situ stress and rock mechanical properties from the geomechanical model were used to investigate the pressures necessary to create hydraulic fractures in the tight sandstones and their propagation direction, in order to improve the flow capacity. Hydraulic fracturing models were developed to identify fracture geometry parameters (length, height, width, conductivity and permeability) for horizontal CTD wells in tight sandstones. Well performance analysis was performed to estimate potential production rates from CTD wells having various lateral lengths and numbers of frac stages by minimizing formation damage through true underbalanced CTD techniques and optimized stimulation design. Effective horizontal lateral length was determined as the combined length of each stage that was successfully treated. Modeling the open-hole and cased-hole multistage completion systems in the tight sandstones indicates longer laterals and an increased number of available stages are desirable to increase production. 
Our models suggest that a successful, efficient completion may be achieved in tight sandstone reservoirs through the application of true underbalanced CTD techniques coupled with optimized lateral geometry and fracture stimulation design.|","Geomechanical Modeling, Tight Sand, Well Performance, CTD Wells, Fracture Modeling",2

Wellbore Strengthening (WBS) is an enabling technology to simplify casing designs, prevent costly lost circulation events, and complete wells with a narrow drilling margin. Given its effectiveness to help drill today's challenging wells economically, WBS has become a routine part of the drilling fluid design and the well construction process in general. However, the drilling industry still lacks a general model to optimally exploit WBS for various formation types and fluid systems. 
In this paper, we have conducted a systematic investigation of the major parameters which affect WBS treatment in permeable formations. Large-scale fracturing experiments were conducted on two rock types with significantly different permeability and stiffness: Berea sandstone (stiff - moderately permeable) and Castlegate sandstone (weak - highly permeable). Several fluid injection cycles were carried out on each rock sample to characterize the Fracture Initiation Pressure (FIP) and Fracture Propagation Pressure (FPP). Further, we investigated the effect of Lost Circulation Material (LCM) - which are used for WBS purposes - on the FIP and the FPP. Also, we studied the effects of the concentration and the Particle Size Distribution (PSD) of LCM blends, the confining pressure, the stiffness and the permeability of rock samples. 
The experimental results confirmed that the FIP is mainly a function of rock tensile strength and stress concentration around the borehole, and not affected by the presence of LCM. The FPP, however, can be significantly enhanced by adding LCM to drilling fluids. Further, FPP enhancement is largely independent of the rock stiffness. We also found that a minimum concentration of LCM is necessary for effective WBS. However, no significant additional enhancement in the strengthening benefits was observed for concentrations above a certain upper threshold. In addition, our results showed that a higher LCM concentration is required for effective WBS in formations with a lower permeability (i.e. tighter formations). PSD dominates the strengthening benefits of an LCM blend and, for both tested rock types, LCM blends with a broad bimodal PSD provide superior strengthening benefits compared to those with a unimodal PSD. 
In this paper, we introduce design guidelines to maximize the attainable strengthening benefits of LCM blends. The findings of this paper are relevant to improve the construction of (ultra-) deep-water wells with a narrow drilling margin through systematic optimization of WBS treatments and minimization of non-productive time.|","Fracturing Experiments, Wellbore Strengthening, Lost Circulation Materials, Drilling Induced Fractures",14

The advances in hydraulic fracturing and horizontal well technology have unlocked considerable reserves of hydrocarbon contained in shale formations. However, quantification of the key shale petrophysical properties remain challenging. It is not practical to measure the permeability of the unconventional formations such as shales by standard steady state techniques because shales typically have permeability values in nano-Darcy range. Therefore, unsteady state methods have been extensively used to estimate permeability of the shale samples. However, the measured permeability values by these techniques suffer from large margin of uncertainty and reproducibility problems. These problems are attributed to the lack of consistent experimental protocols and the interpretations of the transient data. Another limitation of the unsteady-state measurements is that the experiments cannot be performed under the reservoir stress and temperature conditions. 
This paper provides the results of the porosity and permeability measurements on Marcellus shale core plugs which were performed using a fully automated laboratory set-up for evaluation of the ultra-low permeability petrophysical properties under the confining pressure. The permeability of the core plug were first measured under different gas pressures at constant net stress. The absolute permeability was then determined by applying the gas double-slippage correction. The porosity and the permeability of the core plug were then measured under a wide range of net stress. The measured porosity and permeability values were found to be sensitive to stress. Two distinctive behaviors with net stress, for both porosity and permeability, were observed that can be related to the natural fracture and matrix properties. The experimental results were then utilized to determine the natural fracture closure pressure. The permeability measurements with carbon dioxide revealed that permeability is impacted by adsorption. The results of the measurements with were carbon dioxide also provided information for determination of the sorption characteristics that were found to be in agreement with the published values.|","Mmarcellus Shale, Net Stress, Permeability",37

R., Stanford University","|Abstract 
Evaluation of the effects of thermal recovery methods upon diatomaceous reservoirs with their inherent high porosity and low permeability is problematic in that diatoms, a main component of their namesake rock, are composed of amorphous, hydrous biogenic silica (Opal-A) and can alter when heated. The opal-A to opal-CT transformation, is readily apparent using imaging methods, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and petrophysical measurements when the rock has been fully converted. In laboratory experiments with partial transformation, these changes, if any, are subtle and easily missed due to the minute amount of alteration products and the substantial amount of natural variability within the rocks. For example, XRD measurements may show an increase of 1 wt % in opal-CT after an experiment. It is not apparent whether additional opal-CT either formed as a result of the experiment or is a relative enrichment caused by the dissolution of more susceptible minerals such as opal-A and pyrite. 
A new method based on nitrogen sorption was developed to detect silica-phase alteration in diatomaceous samples. We observed that nanometer-scale pore-size distributions as measured via nitrogen sorption and processed using the classic BJH method differ for opal-A and opal-CT reservoir samples. Opal-A samples have less nanometer-scale pore volume (~0.1 cc/g), smaller nanoscale pore sizes (~3.8 nm), and distinct pore-size distributions compared to samples containing opal-CT (e.g., 0.3 cc/g and 6.6 nm). This method detects subtle amounts of opal-CT in that samples containing only 3 wt % (XRD) exhibit a distinct opal-CT peak at 7.8 nm in one example. These nanometer-scale pore-size changes occur whether micrometer-scale pores either increase in size (dissolution) or decrease in size (alteration). 
This method was applied to reservoir and quarry diatomites before and after laboratory experiments conducted at ambient to 230 °C temperatures, pH values of 6 to 10, durations of 10 hours to two years, different fluids, various pressures, and a gamut of flow conditions including spontaneous imbibition, forced imbibition, and static. Supporting data such as water chemistry and XRD data were also measured. Comparison of before and after BJH pore-size distributions reveals a reduction in peak size when dissolution occurs and a shift to larger nanometer-scale pore sizes when alteration (converting to opal-CT) occurs. Many samples exhibit both characteristics. The inlet side of the cores exhibit more dissolution and alteration than the outlet side of the same core. Other factors could also contribute to these changes in the nanometer-scale pore structure such as fines mobilization and compaction.|","thermal recovery., nitrogen sorption, diatomites, opal transformation",10

Hydraulic fracturing is the most effective technique used in the oil industry for economical production of hydrocarbon from very low permeability reservoirs. Recent experimental studies have indicated a change in hydraulic fractures (HF) conductivity as the result of the interactions between fracturing fluid and shale matrix. Clay swelling is one of the well-known undesirable interactions of this kind. If clay swelling occurs on the surface of hydraulic fractures, it can cause a major damage to the overall performance of the reservoir. Thus, a detailed understanding of clay stability issue is essential for fracturing fluid selection and operation planning. 
Clay swelling induced conductivity damage is primarily a function of rock mineralogy, fracturing fluid concentration, and formation brine salinity. Thus, various levels of clay-water interaction are expected in different shale formations. In this study, we present a mechanistic approach to model clay swelling in various rock mineralogies including Barnett (clay-rich), Eagle Ford (Calcite-rich), and Marcellus shales. Subsequently, we investigate the production loss due to clay swelling in a realistic complex hydraulic fracture network. We used UTCOMP_IPhreeqc, a coupled multi-phase reactive- transport simulator developed at The University of Texas at Austin, to comprehensively model this process. Expansion of double diffusive layer was assumed to be the main clay swelling mechanism. Surface complexation and ion exchange reactions were considered to capture the ion diffusion into the double diffusive layer. In each time step of the simulation, the volume expansion of clay materials exposed on the fracture surface was then used to modify the fracture aperture. In order to evaluate the performance of the complex hydraulic fracture network after clay swelling damage, the Embedded Discrete Fracture Model (EDFM) was applied. 
The simulation results indicate that the degree of clay swelling varies in different shale formations. Based on the clay content and the mineralogies that were considered in this work, a significant expansion in double diffusive layer was observed for the Barnett shale when fresh water was injected. However, this effect was much lower in Eagle Ford and Marcellus shales. Similarly, the production loss in the hydraulic fracture network was substantial in the Barnett example. The contribution of the fractures far from the producing well in gas production was negligible after clay swelling damage. The pressure depletion profiles clearly showed the adverse impact of conductivity damage on production performance. The presented approach provides the capability to accurately model the clay stability and to approximate its impact on transport properties of hydraulic fractures.|","Water Quality, Hydraulic Fracturing, Conductivity Damage, Water-Rock Interaction, Unconventional Resources",18
913,914,180461-MS,The Effects of Faults on Induced Seismicity Potential During Water Disposal and Hydraulic Fracturing,"Umholtz, N., FracGeo| Ouenes, A., FracGeo","|Abstract 
A predictive geomechanical model of induced seismic events across many Oklahoma counties is presented—the potential of this validated workflow to address numerous concerns with recent earthquakes is demonstrated. A network of large scale faults can greatly alter the stress field, and consequently the potential of induced seismic events resulting from water injection. These effects are quantified using a geomechanical workflow that leads to the estimation of Induced Seismicity Potential (ISP). It appears that most of the recent earthquakes are clustered in high ISP areas which could be found near but also away from critically stressed faults that were the focus of most recent investigations. When considering the volumes of water injected, the low ISP areas seems to accept large volumes without causing any major earthquakes. In contrast, high ISP areas near Oklahoma City, seem to have many earthquakes despite the low volumes of injected water. In other words, the location of the water injection wells seems to be a critical factor impacting the inducement of earthquakes and reduction of water volumes alone may not reduce induced seismicity. The lack of earthquakes near very large injectors located in low ISP areas seems to point to the need to restrict water injection only to low ISP areas which may reduce the number and magnitude of earthquakes. This predictive tool could assist regulators, oil and gas companies, and insurance companies in selecting areas with the lowest risk of induced seismicity while bolstering the social license to operate unconventional reservoirs.|","Geomechanics, Induced Seismicity, Social license",4

Horizontal wells in liquids-rich shale plays are now being drilled such that lateral and vertical distances between adjacent wells are significantly reduced. In multistacked reservoirs, fracture height and orientation from geomechanical effects coupled with natural fractures create additional complications; therefore, predicting well performance using numerical simulation becomes challenging. This paper describes numerical simulation results from a three-well pad in a stacked liquids-rich reservoir (containing gas condensates) to understand the interaction between wells and production behavior. 
This paper discusses the use of an unstructured grid-based numerical simulator that incorporates complicated geometries of both hydraulic and natural fractures. It can handle compositional simulation to better model gas condensates with special focus on timing of third well placement and the loss of conductivity effects on production from these wells. A base case was created with a stacked shale play containing three parallel wells but with staggered elevations. Variables used in this study include matrix permeability, condensate-to-gas ratio (CGR), fracture length, well staggering, time of well placement, conductivity degradation, and presence of natural fractures. Simulation runs were conducted for a five-year duration. 
More than 20 compositional simulation runs were conducted. For the base case, staggering resulted in a slight decrease in both cumulative oil and gas production compared to a case without staggering. Matrix permeability had the most dominant effect on both oil and gas production. Fracture and matrix conductivity losses were more detrimental to cumulative gas production than oil production. For the limited cases studied, placement of the third well one year after the first two wells began producing resulted in a spike in both oil and gas production from the pad. This produced cumulative oil and gas amount was close to that of three wells producing simultaneously, especially if fracture half-lengths for the third well were the same as the first two. However, cumulative oil and gas production reduced significantly if fracture half-lengths were smaller than the other two wells. When all wells experienced significant conductivity loss, gas production was affected more than oil production when the third well was placed one year after the first two wells began producing. In all cases, placing the third well between the other wells was helpful in increasing overall production from this pad. Natural fractures increased both oil and gas production in the cases studied. 
This paper addresses important issues associated with a liquids-rich unconventional play. It demonstrates successful use of unstructured grid-based reservoir simulation modeling to address well placement timing, well staggering, conductivity damage effects, natural fractures, hydraulic fractures not perpendicular to the wellbores, and several other important issues for which little is known so far. Results from this study type can be used to make important decisions regarding well placement and timing in a multiwell setting.|","Unstructured, Shale, Gas Condensate, Compositional, Reservoir Simulation",46

Estimation of permeability in the Stimulated Reservoir Volume (SRV) is a vital input in any completion optimization workflow. One method to estimate the stimulated permeability in the SRV is to couple geomechanical modeling of the interaction between hydraulic and natural fractures with hydraulic fracture mechanics commonly used to design frac jobs. The proposed approach starts by deriving strain resulting from the integration of geological, geophysical and geomechanical modeling of interacting hydraulic and natural fractures. A unique feature of this approach is its ability to predict microseismicity, thus confirming the validity of the input natural fracture model and the geomechanical approach used to evaluate its interaction with the hydraulic fractures. The optimum validated geomechanical asymmetric half-lengths are then estimated from the derived strain map. These estimated geomechanical half lengths are used as a constraint in a frac design model which is able to incorporate this information and optimize stage treatments according to the variable SRV. The frac design parameters then need to be adjusted in order to approximately match the geomechanical half-lengths provided by the strain map. 
A new analytical asymmetric frac design model is developed, validated with existing commercial frac design software, and used in this study. The new asymmetric analytical frac design model is a pseudo 3D model that accounts for the variation in height in an iterative approach along with considering the asymmetric half lengths due to the lateral stress gradients in a heterogeneous reservoir. The new asymmetric analytical frac design model was compared to existing commercial frac design software and was found to provide similar estimations of frac heights but in a fraction of the time needed to run the commercial frac design software. The ability to combine these models and simultaneously solve for the optimum fracture height is provided by the constraints of the geomechanical half lengths derived from the strain map. In order to guide the engineer designing a frac job an optimum selection of the design parameters to get the target fracture geometry, this paper also presents a parametric analysis using experimental design of various fracing parameters used in our asymmetric hydraulic fracture model. 
In this study, the workflow was successfully applied to a complex Eagle Ford well. The frac design tool optimizes important parameters such as the injection rate, fluid viscosity, proppant type, proppant size, proppant specific gravity and leak-off coefficient in order to honor the interaction of natural and hydraulic fractures accounted for in geomechanics. The frac design model also provides vital information such as the proppant schedule to be pumped and the variation of propped length, width, and net pressure as a function of time. The results of this workflow are the fracture conductivity and proppant concentration along the fracture length and their interpolation between the stages so they can be exported to any reservoir simulator. 2-level fractional factorial design was used to screen for statistically significant parameters that affected fracture geometry in the considered Eagle Ford well. The use of experimental design drastically reduces the simulations necesary to evaluate 15 frac design parameters from 215 to 24, a 1000-fold decrease. 
Using an analytical frac design model is fast—its half lengths already validated with microseismic data, efficient, scientific, and derived from principles of mass balance, fluid momentum, pressure-width relations and applied with appropriate initial and boundary conditions. A systematic and quick assessment of treatment parameters to match the desired half lengths provided by the geomechanical simulation results in an accurate frac design model. The key results provided by the frac design model help in long-term planning of operations necessary for optimal well completions and field development, accomplished in a fraction of the time currently required by other software and workflows.|","Experimental Design, Geomechanics, Improved frac design, natural fractures",39

Inhibitor products have been widely used to reduce both steel corrosion and scale deposition on pipelines, tubings and safety valves in critical offshore sites. Their simultaneous injection with brine has gradually increased the lifetime of production wells with incontestable benefits for the oil and gas industry. However, the large use of such additives has not been followed by the development of any efficient technique of dosage that considers the strict requirements of an offshore platform. 
In this paper, we describe a novel method of chemical dosage that takes into account all the on-site technical and practical parameters, such as the quantification thresholds or molecule specificity, the real-time monitoring, the resistance and compactness of measurement device and a user-friendly interface of measurement. Current techniques of inhibitor monitoring that use elemental analysis (ICP, MS, …) for sub-ppm quantifications appear too complex for a successful long-term on-site industrial exploitation due to the bulky dimensions of apparatus and the delay and complexity of analysis. 
A long-term collaboration between University of Lyon and Total EP has defined a simple and accurate method for inhibitor monitoring based on the use of lanthanide tracers and the Time-Resolved Fluorescence (TRF) technique. We exploited the fact that inhibitor chemicals (i) are good chelators for lanthanide ions and (ii) amplify the luminescence signal of rare-earths. In this way we are able to collect the photon emission signal by TRF apparatus and dosing the inhibitors. The portability of the TRF device as well as the sensitivity of detection have been engineered in order to obtain a sub-ppm quantification threshold via 1-click task. Several carboxylates, phosphonates and sulphonates additives diluted in brine solutions has been easily measured out even in presence of residual oil. More than 20 commercial inhibitor solution samples were quickly prepared and dosed with an impressive linearity of response (R2 test > 0.996) in the 10 – 100 ppm range. Any further extension of range has been possible. In addition, we were able to quantify two inhibitors (scale – scale, scale – corrosion) in the same brine water. This technique certainly opens a new conception of smart chemicals management in oil and gas production for (i) a dramatic minimization of the injected compounds (ii) a reducing delay in pipelines monitoring, and (iii) a shut down of expenses of pipeline maintenance.|","corrosion inhibitor, lanthanide ion, monitoring, Time-Resolved Fluorescence, scale inhibitor",14

Without a realistic prediction of the production decline trend resulting from a given completion and reservoir properties, it is impossible to evaluate the economic viability of producing natural gas from shale plays. |Traditionally, decline curve analysis (DCA) is commonly used to predict gas production and its decline trend to determine the estimated ultimate recovery (EUR), but its analysis cannot be used to analyze what factors influence the production decline trend due to lack of underlying support of physics, which make it difficult to guide completion designs or optimize field development. |In this article, we presented a unified shale gas reservoir model, which incorporates real gas transport, nano-flow mechanisms and geomechanics into fractured shale system. This model is used to predict shale gas production under different reservoir scenarios and investigate what factors control its decline trend. The results and analysis presented in the article provide us a better understanding of gas production and decline mechanisms in a shale gas well with certain conditions of the reservoir characteristics. More in-depth knowledge regarding the effects of factors controlling the behavior of the gas production can help us develop more reliable models to forecast shale gas decline trend and ultimate recovery.

In conventional fields several estimation methods (volumetric, material balance, analogy, and production trends) can work in tandem in order to provide these reasoned estimates which relate to static and dynamic characterization. Despite intensive efforts to utilize all available data, these estimates could be still inaccurate, but have served our industry well in making business decisions. |With the introduction of the unconventional resources, this process requires re-examination and realignment to development priorities, risks, uncertainties and of course production drive mechanics. The early approach in recoverable volume estimation was based heavily on production trends and a statistical appraisal of observed variations with limited relation to production mechanisms and reservoir characteristics. Key work in many disciplines has shown that although production performance does not follow the same static and dynamic trends as in conventional reservoirs, it relates to certain static and dynamic subsurface characteristics particularly to natural fractures. Faults, fairway and background fractures become more important in liquid rich and oil plays (as fluids segregate) and invariably affect the process of hydraulic fracturing and the development of drainage patterns. Since natural fracture network characteristics may change rapidly even across the length of a horizontal well, it is difficult to expect a homogenous performance without the understanding of the natural fracture trends, reservoir characteristics and the change in the respective drive mechanisms. Most commonly used reserve and resource classification methods rely on proximity to existing production. Due to these effects, the expectation of similar performance in infill locations could be diminished. Apart from being an inaccurate prediction, this misconception may lead to the wrong development path in which wells classified as highest ranking may exhibit low performance. In the context of these observations it would be rational to draw fairway maps in relation to key geologic characteristics and dynamic effects utilizing all available information within and around the project area and to provide a basis for analogy which conforms better to the actual production drive mechanisms. In other words, using a physics based reliable technology (fairway maps) we are able to establish undeveloped areas with similar producibility at greater distances than production offset locations with reasonable certainty. Testing the validity of fairway maps with continuous development provides more confidence in predicting offset locations; classifying reserves and resources appropriately and guiding development towards better results. This process provides close alignment between development priorities and certainty levels in reserve and resource estimates which fulfills the basic requirements for rational project management. Subsequent application of fairway maps in other areas and similar plays may someday become a more general reliable technology paradigm for addressing unconventional resource assessment.|","Dynamic, Unconventional, Resource, Reliable Technology, Reserve",4

Shale gas reservoirs have a high total organic content (TOC) and are composed of a lot of microspores, which result in a high content of adsorbed gas. Laboratory and theoretical calculations show that the adsorption potential of CO2 in shale is higher than that of CH4. In other words, the shales prefer adsorbing CO2 to CH4. Therefore, during CO2 injection, the adsorbed CH4 is released by CO2 adsorption, even in a high reservoir pressure. Several models have been studied to describe the pure and multicomponent adsorption on shale. The Langmuir and extended Langmuir models are usually applied in reservoir simulators, because other models are more complex and not applicable to be coupled into a simulator. In this work, a simulation study is carried out to investigate the effects of gas adsorption on primary recovery and CO2 enhanced recovery processes. 
Dual permeability, logarithmically spaced, locally refined grids are implemented to model natural and hydraulic fractures and to capture the sensitive changes of multicomponent adsorption. Reservoir pressure variation is coupled with a geomechanical module that updates porosity, permeability and fracture conductivity simultaneously at each time step. A multicomponent mixture on the basis of lab measured adsorption properties of the Eagle Ford shale are implemented into a reservoir simulator. Both primary recovery and CO2 huff-n-puff processes are investigated. 
The simulation results show multicomponent adsorption behaviors of extended Langmuir model can slightly increase the well performance in the primary recovery. However, the adsorption behavior is more complex during CO2 injection processes. This study highlights the effect of multicomponent adsorption on gas production during CO2 cycling, and provides an optimal enhanced recovery strategy for shale gas reservoir.|","Reservoir Geomechanics, CO2 Injection, Enhanced Shale Gas Recovery, Multicomponent Adsorption",11

The presence of nanopores in tight rocks and shales have been confirmed by numerous studies. These pores are also the primary storage space of oil and gas in shales. Due to the effect of nanoscale confinement, the phase behavior of fluids confined in such extra-low permeability formation (nanodarcy scale) differs significantly from those observed in the conventional formation. 
In this paper, the cubic PR EOR is coupled with the capillary-pressure equation and adsorption theory to investigate and represent the phase equilibria of pure components and their mixtures in cylindrical nanopores. The pore confinement effects of interaction between fluid molecule and pore wall and the shift of critical properties are all considered. Also due to the effect of adsorption film, an improved Young-Laplace equation is adopted to simulate the capillarity instead of the conventional equation. For the adsorption behavior, the experimental data on the adsorbent of silicalite are used to represent the adsorption behavior of hydrocarbons in nanopores. Then, a prediction process for the behavior of methane, n-butane, n-pentane, n-hexane and their mixtures are performed. And the results are compared against the available experimental data to confirm the accuracy of this scheme. The actual Eagle Ford oil is also used to examine the performance of our scheme. 
Results indicate that the presence of adsorption film could further increase the vapor-liquid equilibrium constant (K-value) and capillary pressure of the confined pure-component fluid, especially for the nanopores with few nanometers. The smaller the nanopore radius, the higher the deviation between the actual K-value and bulk value. For methane, when the pore radius is higher than about 20 nm, the K-value is approaching the bulk fluids and the effect of capillary pressure and adsorption film can be neglected. For n-pentane, it is about 18 nm. For binary mixture, it is found the higher the difference between the two components, the stronger the nanopore confinement effects. The capillary pressure will present a bilinear relation with the pore radius in the log-log plot. For multicomponent mixture, as the pore radius decreases, the bubble-point pressure is depressed, the dew-point pressure is increased, and the phase envelop of confined fluids is also shrinked. When the adsorption film is neglected, the bubble-point pressure will be overestimated, and the dew-point pressure is underestimated. For Eagle Ford oil, when the nanopore radius is higher than about 100 nm, the behavior will approach the bulk value and the influence of nanopore confinement can be neglected. This study will shed some important insights for the phase behavior of tight oil and gas condensate in nanopores.|","tight oil, nanopore, phase equilibrium, capillary pressure, adsorption film",36
922,923,180257-MS,Experimental Study of Permeability Decline in Tight Formations During Long-Term Depletion,"Cui, Q., Colorado School of Mines| Abass, H. H., Colorado School of Mines","|Abstract 
Hydrocarbon production decline behaviors in low permeability reservoirs and conventional reservoirs are significantly different; in such a way that high initial rate is usually observed for a short period in tight formation wells, then the well productivity drops dramatically. The rapid production decline in shale wells has a strong relationship with the loss of rock matrix permeability and reservoir conductivity, resulting from the dissipation of pore pressure during reservoir depletion. This paper presents experimental studies of stress-dependent compaction in tight reservoirs and its impact on long-term recovery. 
The magnitude of rock permeability change depends on the in-situ effective stress, which is a combined effect of reservoir pore pressure and confining stress. In this research, permeabilities of a series of shale and sandstone core plugs are measured in the laboratory using pressure transimission test technique. The samples are tested under multiple confining stress and pore pressure combinations. Several confining stress are pre-set to represent different reservoir stress conditions. Different pore pressures are then applied to mimic reservoir depletion process under specific confining stress conditions. The permeability is calculated for all scenarios and pressure dependent permeability behaviors are analyzed for each type of sample. 
The interpretations of effective stress dependent permeability show that different types of rocks have different permeability decline signatures responding to the depletion effect. In addition, tight rocks with different dominant porous media (i.e., matrix and fractures) are found to have different permeability behaviors. Characteristics of permeability decline at different pore pressure intervals are analyzed and the critical reservoir pressure and depletion index (i.e., ratio of pore pressure to overburden stress) are identified for different types of rocks where significant permeability change occurs. Based on the stress dependent permeability measurements, the Biot Coefficient is also determined for different tight samples. 
Recognizing permeability decline signatures of tight reservoirs provides significant insights into long-term dynamic reservoir conductivity monitoring and contributes to the field management practices. It is indicated from the study that the permeability decline in tight reservoir wells can be significant with continuous depletion while maintaining reservoir pressure above the critical level has the potential to mitigate the sharp production decline in tight formations and therefore enhance ultimate hydrocarbon recovery.|","Effective stress, Permeability degradation, Long-term recovery, Tight reservoirs, Permeability measurement",46

Since well production always shows a steep decline after the early high flow rate, refracturing can be an economically promising option to compensate for the loss of production and improve the well delivery. Although extensive field cases have been published on refracturing practice, there is a lack of guidelines on how to select and optimize refracturing design. |In this paper, a series of synthetic cases are used to evaluate the well performance under different refracturing designs. The key characteristics for refracturing simulation is accurate quantification of the depletion-induced stress and pressure field change. Thus, finite element method is used to solve the coupled reservoir flow and geomechanics model while a cohesive zone model is adopted to simulate the fracture propagation. A viscoelastic model is used to simulate the time-dependent fracture conductivity change due to proppant embedment. The synthetic cases are grouped into two categories: refracturing in existing perforations and in newly created perforations. A systematic sensitivity study is performed on the effects of fracturing spacing, matrix permeability and refracturing time. |Numerical results show different fracture configurations for refracturing in depleted and virgin reservoirs and thus demonstrate the importance of accounting for stress and pressure changes during initial production. Refracturing the existing perforation is likely to create a wider but shorter fracture compared to the virgin case because the fracturing fluid in these fractures encounter less resistance for enlarging fracture width rather than fracture length because of reduced pressure and total stress. Refracturing new perforations appears to give better short-term performance than refracturing existing perforations but worse long-term performance. Simulation results indicate that for relatively low permeability reservoir it is favorable to add more fracture area; however, the advantage is diminished while for relatively high permeability reservoir where the SRV might already be depleted. When proppant degradation is severe, and fracture conductivity is the limiting factor for production, refracturing existing perforations becomes more attractive. Moreover, simulation results seem to indicate an optimum time window exists for refracturing in this scenario.|",,31

Permeability and porosity decrease with increasing net stress in consolidated and unconsolidated porous media is a well-known phenomenon to petroleum and geomechanics engineers. Conversely, permeability and porosity are observed to increase when net stress decreases, however typically follow a different path, this discrepancy is known as hysteresis. The trend of permeability and porosity hysteresis is a signature of porous medium that depends on several physical and mechanical properties. 
Understanding permeability and porosity hysteresis plays a significant role in production strategies of hydrocarbon reservoirs. Hysteresis effect on production strategies can be even more important in very low permeability reservoirs such as tight sandstone, tight carbonate, and shale formations. The reason is that the stress change associated with permeability and porosity hysteresis can affect adsorption/desorption and diffusion transport mechanisms which are among the main driving mechanisms in low or ultra-low permeability reservoirs. 
In this study, permeability and porosity hysteresis of nano, micro, and milli-Darcy core samples are measured for a wide range of net stress and the results are correlated with pore structures observed by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM) images. The nano and micro-Darcy core samples are from the Niobrara, Bakken, Three Forks, and Eagle Ford formations. The milli-Darcy core samples are from Middle East carbonate, Indiana Limestone, and Torrey Buff Sandstone formations. Bakken, Three Forks, and Middle East carbonate are core samples from oil producing reservoirs, whereas others are from outcrop. Our experimental observations show that: (a) compared to steady state method, the unsteady state permeability measurement used here can shorten the time required to measure permeability of nano and micro-Darcy cores without significant measurement error; (b) stress dependency of permeability and porosity and their hysteresis during loading and unloading of outcrop cores were observed to be very small compared to those of reservoir cores; (c) generally, the stress dependency and hysteresis of permeability and porosity was observed to be inversely related permeability and porosity at initial stress conditions; hence, these characteristics are more pronounced and important in organic rich shale reservoirs; (d) porosity decrease with stress and its hysteresis were observed to be much smaller than that of permeability; (e) our results generally follow the experimental and theoretical relationship between cubic root of permeability and logarithmic of net stress reported by many researchers; and (f) an increase in permeability with temperature (and decrease in permeability with hysteresis during temperature unloading) is observed in organic rich mudrocks. This is due to dilation, diffusion, and adsorption effects of organic rich pores. Hence, a temperature correction factor is required to estimate the exact in-situ permeability of organic rich mudrocks. 
Finally, we would like to comment that understanding of permeability and porosity dependency on stress and their hysteresis information values could be used to optimize production of low-permeability formations such that the irreversible permeability loss (formation damage) could be minimized by early fluid injection (pressure maintenance) to minimize rapid stress increase due to fluid withdrawal from stimulated reservoir volume. Also, these permeability and porosity hysteresis information could be used in proper designing of multi-stage hydraulic fracture and re-fracturing design of organic-rich low-permeability formations.|","Stress dependent permeability, Permeability and Porosity Hysteresis, adsorption, desorption and diffusion, fracture closure",14

The Mancos shale in the San Juan basin can present challenging conditions when hydraulic fracturing treatments are performed in horizontal wells. Some of the issues while completing a well in the Mancos can be caused by overall geomechanics and reservoir properties; for example, high horizontal stress anisotropy and the presence of discontinuities, such as microfractures and lamination. This paper presents three case studies in which hydraulic fracturing placement issues were explored. 
Normally, the interactions of geomechanics and reservoir properties cause high treating pressures or premature screenouts, as presented in previous publications. Ramurthy et al. (2009a, 2009b) and Potocki (2012) explain how and why properties, such as process zone stress (PZS), pressure-dependent leakoff (PDL), and geomechanics, can affect the hydraulic fracturing conditions and production results. Depending on how the well is completed, these challenging conditions can be either enhanced or minimized. When the reservoir and geomechanics are not taken into consideration in the completion design of the well, issues can occur during the hydraulic fracturing of the formation. 
Issues including screenouts, pressure outs, and high pressure while trying to initiate the fracture can lead to the formation not allowing the placement of the designed treatment, improper stimulation of the reservoir, excessive completion costs, and more commonly than not, poor production. This paper presents three case studies. In all three studies, similar reservoir characteristics and geomechanical conditions occur, which pose challenging obstacles for both completion and production. The challenges were each addressed in different ways, resulting in different outcomes. In one case, no action was taken to mitigate these obstacles. In the second case, the area was studied using analysis service data, treatment data, and public information. This knowledge was applied to assist in the completion of the treatment without issues. In a more recent case, in a well with similar conditions as the two previous studies, only a portion of the recommendations were applied, with mixed results. 
This paper presents the knowledge gained from the three case studies conducted in the Mancos shale, San Juan basin. General suggestions are presented when similar conditions are encountered while completing a well.|","Screen Out Issues, High Pressure, San Juan, Hydraulic Fracturing, Mancos",60

Uniform distribution of fracture apertures is widely used in reservoir simulation of production from hydraulically fractured unconventional reservoirs. Laboratory experiments, however, reveal that changes in effective stress create uneven distribution of fracture apertures, and this phenomenon has been neglected in most numerical models. This work investigates the impact of pressure dependent fracture apertures during the production process; fracture aperture is explicitly represented and the effect of closure stress is incorporated in a numerical simulation model. 
A Discrete Fracture Model (DFM) is implemented using an unstructured Voronoi mesh that captures complex fracture geometries. The effect of fracture aperture with respect to fracture grid size is examined via a case study that includes a vertical well intersecting a single stage hydraulic fracture. The effect of dynamic behavior of fracture aperture due to changes in stress, resulting from rock stiffness and uneven distribution of proppants within primary and induced fractures, is investigated. Fractures are divided into three types, each with its own dynamic response to changes in stress. The impact of matrix permeability on aperture closure is also studied in a reservoir model with multi-stage hydraulic fractures intersecting with induced fractures. 
The developed numerical simulator is validated against commercial software. Sensitivity analysis reveals that representation of fractures with exact apertures in numerical simulation produces more accurate results compared with an effective permeability approach, and the difference becomes more pronounced as the matrix permeability decreases. Therefore, it is critical to modify, in the connection list, the length of the interface between each two grids embedding the fracture in accordance with the actual fracture aperture. The dynamic behavior of fracture apertures with respect to closure stress is processed by the numerical simulator as input information. Simulation results indicate that reduction of fracture aperture translates into a decrease of its conductivity, which results in lower production rates. It is observed that fracture closure caused by uneven proppant distribution also plays a significant role in gas production. In addition, formations with lower matrix permeability experience a smaller reduction of gas production caused by stress-dependent fracture apertures. 
This work presents a new approach to representing complex fracture geometries with stress-dependent apertures and simulating the process of aperture closure due to changes in stress dynamically. The results provide a better understanding of stress dependence of fracture apertures and their spatial variations on well performance for hydraulically fractured wells.|","Complex Fracture Geometries, Stress-dependent Fracture Apertures, Unconventional Gas Reservoirs",56

Although stress-dependent porosity and permeability have been applied to majority of models to calculate effective porosity and permeability, effect of adsorbed gas specified as pore volume occupied by adsorbate is not properly accounted. However, nanoscale porosity and permeability of shale rocks would be significantly reduced, since the pore volume is occupied by layers of adsorbed gas molecules. 
In this paper, we combine stress and adsorption effects to establish a new correlation of shale porosity and permeability. We calculate the stress-dependent pore volume with a constant pore compressibility and obtain the volume of adsorbate from doing regression analysis for density of adsorbed gas by Dubinin-Astakhov (D-A) equation under the supercritical condition. Lab experiments for methane adsorption in shale are measured by five real core samples. The data of Gibbs adsorption obtained by experiments is converted to absolute adsorption so that it could be used to generate the correlation of stress-dependent porosity and permeability including consideration of adsorption effect. 
The new generated correlation illustrates that the trend of changes in porosity and permeability with pore pressure is quite similar to the trend calculated by Shi-Durucan (S-D) model in application to coalbed methane, which indicates that porosity and permeability decrease with the increase of pore pressure. This tendency is the inverse of changes in stress-dependent porosity and permeability in relation to pore pressure, which demonstrates that adsorption has a larger influence on pore volume than stress, because more gas attempts to adsorb on surface area of matrix as pore pressure increases. The new correlation is added into a numerical model in field-scale, which successfully matches production data from a horizontal well with multistage hydraulic fractures in Barnett shale reservoir. The simulation results point out that without considering the impact of pore volume occupied by adsorbed gas, cumulative gas production would be greatly overestimated during economical producing period in shale gas reservoirs. 
Thus, overestimation of porosity and permeability in shale might be avoided by applying the new correlation considering both stress and adsorption effects. The correlation incorporated into numerical simulators could provide accurate estimation and evaluation of gas production.|","adsorption, history match, shale gas, nanoscale",14

With the production of a gas condensate tight reservoir, condensate in fracture can significantly decrease the productivity of gas condensate wells. Previous work shows that the negative effect of condensate bank on gas production is more seriously in tighter reservoir. The implement of hydraulic fracture and multi-stages fracturing can mitigate the negative effects on the formation of condensate bank, but the effects cannot be completely removed. A huff-n-puff methane injection has been proven to be an effective method to reduce the effect of condensate by maintaining the reservoir pressure above the dew-point pressure and revaporizing the formed condensate. However, the previous work neglects the effect of hydraulic fractures on the treatment of condensate by gas injection. 
Non-aqueous components are lumped into fourteen pseudo components. Dual permeability, logarithmically spaced, locally refined grids are implemented to model natural and hydraulic fractures in a simulation model. The laboratory measured relative permeability taking account of condensate bank is used to accurately represent two-phase flow in a shale reservoir. Furthermore, two different settings of cyclic schedule are implemented to test their advantages and disadvantages. 
The results show that the huff-n-puff dry gas injection can effectively improve gas and condensate recovery. A fracture conductivity has significant influences on well production during the injection, while during the primary recovery its impact is not that obvious. In addition, the huff-n-puff schedules also plays a crucial role in both gas and condensate recovery.

Conventional laboratory characterization of ultra-tight reservoir rock samples involves separate laboratory measurements on different core plugs or on crushed rock samples. Heterogeneity and anisotropy of ultra-tight reservoir samples adversely influence the laboratory correlation among various measured and estimated petrophysical properties. 
We apply an inversion algorithm to simultaneously estimate the intrinsic permeability, effective porosity at ambient condition, pore-volume compressibility, and Klinkenberg-slip factor of an ultra-tight pyrophyllite sample from a single laboratory-based pressure-step-decay measurement. In doing so, we circumvent the effects of heterogeneity and account for the pore-pressure dependency of apparent permeability and effective porosity. Moreover, the time and resource requirements are drastically reduced in comparison to those required when performing multiple experiments that separately estimate the aforementioned petrophysical properties. 
The inversion algorithm is valid for nitrogen injection pressure in the range of 50 to 500 psi. The algorithm assumes ideal-gas behavior of the injected nitrogen, 1D isothermal laminar gas flow, homogeneity of the core, pressure-independent gas viscosity, inverse-pressure dependence of the apparent permeability, pressure-independent Klinkenberg-slip factor, non-negligible pore-volume compressibility, pressure-dependent effective porosity, negligible inertial effects, negligibly small pressure gradients, and time-invariant confining pressure. 
Estimated apparent permeability and effective porosity of the pyrophyllite samples exhibit strong pore- pressure dependence; consequently, both the properties vary substantially along the sample length during the pressure-step-decay measurement. On an average, the effective porosity of the pyrophyllite samples increased by 100% and the apparent permeability decreased by 75% when the pore pressure increased from 50 psi to 500 psi during the measurement. The average values ki, ?0, Cp, and b of the nine pyrophyllite samples were estimated to be 40 nd, 0.03, 2<U+00D7>10-3 psi-1, and 100 psi, respectively.|","Effective Porosity, Intrinsic Permeability, Pore-Volume Compressibility, klinkenberg, Ultra-Tight Reservoir",57
931,932,180230-MS,Rate-Transient Analysis of Liquid-Rich Tight/Shale Reservoirs Using the Dynamic Drainage Area Concept: Examples from North American Reservoirs,"Qanbari, F., University of Calgary| Clarkson, C. R., University of Calgary","|Abstract 
The early-time performance of multi-fractured horizontal wells is mainly controlled by fracture geometry, total effective area of the fractures, and conductivity of the primary fracture system. Rate-transient analysis (RTA) methods have historically been used to characterize MFHWs at different stages of well life, including this early-time performance. In particular, linear flow analysis is used to estimate the total effective fracture area from online production data, provided that reservoir and fluid properties are known. However, a primary complication in linear flow analysis is the incorporation of nonlinearities such as multi-phase flow and pressure-dependent rock/fluid properties into the calculations. 
A new linear flow analysis technique is presented in the current study, which can be applied to tight/shale systems with multi-phase flow and pressure-dependent rock/fluid properties. The method combines three important reservoir engineering concepts for linear flow analysis: dynamic drainage area (DDA), material balance, and decoupling of saturation and pressure (which is analogous to the decoupling of geomechanics and fluid flow). The DDA concept, which uses a time-dependent well productivity index equation for the transient flow period, facilitates the incorporation of any sort of nonlinearity (including decoupled saturation functions) and operational constraints in modeling and RTA of linear flow in MFHWs. 
The method is validated against numerical simulation and applied to various sets of field production data from tight/shale gas and oil wells with different levels of condensate- (oil-) gas ratio. For all the field cases, total effective fracture area obtained from the new analytical RTA method is in reasonable agreement with numerical modeling results. 
Regarding accuracy and practicality, the new method represents an improvement in RTA of liquid-rich tight/shale reservoirs, particularly for cases with multi-phase flow and pressure-dependent rock/fluid properties. Further, the concepts used in the new model development are easy to understand and implement.|","Liquid-Rich Tight/Shale Reservoirs, Rate Transient Analysis, Decoupling of Saturation and Pressure, Dynamic Drainage Area Concept, Multi-Fractured Horizontal Wells",42

There has also been an increasing interest in the use of numerical simulation of unconventional reservoirs. In this study, we use both methods to history match the production of hydraulically fractured unconventional wells, followed by forecasting future production to establish a well's EUR (Estimated Ultimate Recovery) for reserves determination purposes. This study's goal is to quantify the differences one might expect to encounter in a well's EUR when using analytical model-based RTA vs numerical simulation-based workflows in unconventional reservoirs. |First, we consider an undersaturated shale oil reservoir as a base model for this study. The base case also satisfies all assumptions inherent to analytical solution-based methods such as homogenous reservoir properties and fully-penetrating planar fractures. An excellent match between results of both methods for the base model validates the numerical simulation approach. We then impose a series of real-world deviations from RTA assumptions and investigate reliability of EUR predictions made by both approaches. In all cases, historical data and reference EURs are derived from finely-gridded numerical simulations. |Example results show that, in the presence of real-world deviations from RTA assumptions, analytical models can still match the historical production data; however, key reservoir and fracture parameters need to be modified drastically to compensate for the lack of sufficient physics in the analytical models. Results show that the analytical solution-based history-matched models are not predictive for future production, and somewhat surprisingly provide pessimistic EURs in all real-world scenarios investigated in this work. For the cases presented in this study, analytical models under-predict EURs by 6-17% when two years of production history is available for matching. The underestimation of EUR increases drastically (up to 60%) as the length of available historical data decreases from 2 years to 3 months. |For all cases, we also apply an efficient numerical simulation-based workflow for probabilistic forecasting of EURs. This workflow provides multiple history-matched models that are constrained by historical production data. The probabilistic forecast method employed in this work provides P90 (conservative), P50 (most likely), and P10 (optimistic) values for EUR. In all examples, the range of P90 to P10 EUR values includes the reference EUR, and the P50 values are within 2.2% of the reference EUR.|","Document Type

Major gas fields in West Siberia have been depleted by 50-80%, and field operators are actively searching for ways to reverse declining production and access new gas deposits previously ignored given their complexity. One such hard-to-recover deposit is the Turonian play. With total gas reserves reaching approximately 3 trillion cubic meters, Turonian gas is encountered in nearly the entire Northern part of West Siberia. 
Developing the Turonian deposits presents the following challenges:  
Poor reservoir properties and low well productivity; 
Significant reservoir heterogeneity and facial variability along the section and area-wise, which complicates well placement operations for an optimal gas extraction; 
Low formation temperature and abnormally high pressure, which may require well operations in a near-hydrated regime; 
High clay content, which leads to formation damage when water-based fluids are being used in reservoir drill-in operations. |Drilling of Turonian horizontal wells is complicated by a narrow safe mud weight window, geology uncertainties, and high sensitivity of borehole stability to well trajectory. 
Analysis of Turonian well construction experience has identified technological solutions in two main areas:  
Provide high-quality hole in all sections of horizontal well, including lateral sections, with length more than 800 m (to run safely casing to planned depths with followed multi stage hydraulic fracturing in horizontal section). 
Minimize formation damage, thereby preserving potential well productivity in a formation with a high clay content in wide range of temperature and pressure conditions. |Core samples from the Turonian formations were tested to determine mechanical, elastic, and other rock properties. From these results different mud types were evaluated for formation damage and impact on the mechanical and elastic rock properties. 
The integration and collaboration of drilling and petro-technical experts was the key to developing a fit-for-purpose drilling system that combined drilling technologies and engineering solutions. The main outcome from the planning stage was joint development of the engineered drilling system (EDS), where each component (rig, surface and downhole equipment, drilling fluids, wellbore stability, trajectory, and engineering practices) was considered equally important and influenced the entire system and results of the well. Implementation of the EDS approach resulted in successful well drilling and completion operations. 
A time-dependent wellbore stability model was developed and successfully tested in field operations. Implementation of the EDS approach helped to determine the importance of time on the stable operation window for mud weights. Additionally, the EDS approach helped achieve production rates significantly higher in offset wells and justified the project's economics. 
The key lessons learned can be applied in other fields in the region to develop shallow low permeability formations. The major of them are:  
Geomechanics is a vital part for productive drilling; 
Optimal selection of dril-in and fracturing fluid played a critical part in achieving the project objectives; 
Integrated approach to drilling system design and close cooperation between all team participants are the key success factors in delivering technically complex projects; 
The combination of fit for purpose technologies into an effective drilling system can provide cost effective solutions for field development with region specific challenges and traditional technology limiters. |","formation damage, low permiability, Tron, high clay content, drilling system",14

According to Terzaghi's principle, the effective stress s' is related to the total stress s and the pore pressure Pp by the relationship s' = s - Pp. In a typical reservoir depletion scenario, the pore pressure decreases under constant total stress, and as a result, the effective stress increases. The increase of the effective stress has a negative impact on permeability due to rock compaction, while the decrease in pore pressure enhances the apparent permeability because of the gas slippage effect. In tight gas reservoirs, since the slippage effect is no longer negligible, the pressure dependency of the permeability is very complicated. 
In this paper, we used three samples from the Montney tight gas siltstone reservoir in western Canada, whose absolute permeabilities range from in the order of 10-4 mD to 10-3 mD. Permeability measurements under different pressure conditions using both the unsteady state pressure decay and the pressure pulse decay methods were carried out. 
Based on the measured data, permeability was modeled as a function of reservoir pressure. Using this function, we carried out reservoir simulations and examined the impact of pressure dependence of permeability on the gas recovery process from a tight gas reservoir.|","compaction, tight rock permeability, slippage, pressure dependency",12

Field developments on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS) have become cost intensive both for greenfield and for tieback / brownfield developments. A large existing infrastructure with future free capacity is available consisting of processing platforms and transport systems. The objective for the Gas-2-Pipe™ concept is to reduce capex/opex intensive topside modifications and topside weight and space constraints by utilizing the established infrastructure and host facilities in a flexible way. 
The process concept treats a gas dominated well stream in order to meet the so called rich gas transport specifications. Rich gas specifications in the Norwegian transport system are mainly related to a cricondenbar specification in the range of 105 to 110 bar and to a water dew point specification of typically -18 °C at 70 bar. Gas is treated in two steps where hydrocarbon dew point is obtained by sea water cooling and pressure reduction to form a gas and a liquid phase. Water content in the separated gas is reduced by injecting lean glycol through a compact mixer unit and separating out the rich glycol from the gas in a separation unit. Gas is also cooled by sea water in the dehydration process. A single- or two-stage dehydration process may be used. Considerations regarding process design, process parameter selection and glycol distribution rate are given. 
After treatment, the gas is compressed to the necessary export pressure and injected directly into the pipeline. Processing takes place in a subsea or topside unmanned environment where necessary utilities are imported from one or several hosts. Required utilities are typically power- and control system and glycol for gas dehydration. Produced liquid hydrocarbons and water is routed to a host for further stabilization and treating. The concept may become an enabler when nearby host capacity is gas constrained and traditional tie-back is too cost intensive. 
The concept is seen as an enabler for field development of gas dominated fields with a potential for cost reduction compared to conventional concepts. The main gaps are identified and a qualification strategy for the key technology elements is given, ranging from small scale and pilot scale testing to implementation of new technology elements in traditional field developments.|","facility, subsea, dehydration, unmanned, gas processing",37

Lateral friction against surface conductor plays an important role in the stability of subsea wellhead. It changes during jetting process and increases with soaking time. But the change rule and mechanism remain unclear. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to explore the change mechanism of lateral friction during and after conductor jetting process by field experiment and numerical simulation. 
Firstly, a field experiment was conducted to simulate actual surface conductor jetting process. The time- dependent change rule of radial pressure, pore water pressure and effective skeleton pressure were obtained. Then, the stress states of soil bodies during this process were analyzed. Based on experiment and analysis results, the primary reason that causes the change of lateral friction was found. After that, to explore the specific change features of bearing capacity of seabed soil for surface conductor, another field experiment was conducted. Finally, finite element method was adopted to simulate the conductor jetting process and to verify the research conclusions. 
The field simulation experiment showed that the sensor at the base of surface conductor suffers conspicuous higher value of radial pressure than other sensors above. Meanwhile, the effective pressure of each layer has a tendency of declining as time increasing and then gradually adds after reaching a certain value. These regularities matches the change rule of radial pressure on piles during driving process. Based on the stress analysis, it is certain that the soil compaction effect does exist in conductor jetting process, caused by which, the formation and dissipation of pore water pressure during jetting process would be highly related to the change of lateral resistance against surface conductor. After jetting into position, soil lateral friction would increase with time non-linearly. The change rate would gradually rise at the first 10 hours. After 72 hours, the added values of friction are small and the change rate turns to flat. According to the numerical modeling results, under the action of jetting force, on one hand, soil bodies that are closed to bit are cut into grains and flow out from wellbore with drilling fluid; on the other, soil bodies that are farther from bit would be squeezed down and then pushed around. 
Previous studies mainly considered the soaking time and bearing capacity of surface conductor, focused on specific values. This research designed a system to simulate surface conductor jetting process to explore the change mechanism of lateral friction against surface conductor by combining the method of numerical modeling and field experiment.|","Mechanism Research, Deepwater Drilling, Surface Conductor, Simulation Experiment, Lateral Friction",28

The expenditures associated with subsea flowlines unplugging can increase very quickly, especially when considering the associated loss of production as well as the various investigations needed to define the appropriate remediation strategy. Such investigations cover the identification of the plug's nature, its location, the assessment of the appropriate dissociation method as well as the flowline restart strategy. |In some scenarios, the plug dissociation method, like depressurization for hydrate plug and chemical soaking or pigging for paraffin plug, may take a long time ranging from several days to several months. Often, the remediation cannot be performed from the topside facility and will require the mobilization of an external drillship vessel to carry manifold or Xmas tree work over. Ultimately, the plug removal method may fail and therefore lead to flowline abandonment and/or replacement. From these observations, there is room for the development of a more efficient, predictable and reliable method to unplug subsea flowlines. With this regard, the development a new subsea flowline intervention system named Electrically Trace Heated Blanket (ETH Blanket) has been initiated. |The ETH-Blanket is a compact and modular system, with length adaptable typically up to 2km. The system is equipped with trace heating cables relying on Joule's Effect for heat generation to dissociate the plug and distributed temperature sensing (DTS) to monitor the flowline's bore temperature in order to identify the location of the plug, characterize its nature and follow-up the temperature and pressure profiles during plug dissociation. The ETH Blanket can be deployed onto any kind of existing flowlines (flexible or rigid) and in any condition (buried or not) from a Light Construction Vessel. The power required to dissociate the plug is low (typically <1MW) and once the dissociation is completed, the ETH Blanket can be recovered onto the intervention vessel and relocated. |This paper describes into details the ETH-Blanket assembly and its operating principles, its anticipated thermal performances determined using CFD modeling, as well as and its deployment method and spread. To illustrate the ETH-Blanket efficiency, a typical multiple hydrate plugs dissociation operation will be presented and compared to a conventional topside depressurization. |As a conclusion, the on-going fast-track qualification programme for the development of the Electrically Trace Heated Blanket Technology will be presented.|","Hydrate plug, Active heating, Subsea pipeline intervention, Flowline blockage remediation",14

In 2006, the Brazilian pre-salt oil field province was discovered from a pioneer well at Lula oil field. The province is characterized by carbonate reservoirs, microbial and coquina rocks, buried at a depth that surpasses 5,000 m, distributed in the Santos and Campos sedimentary basins, located at the east Brazilian coast. During the past ten years, upon the discovery of several oil fields and their respective productions, which now exceeds 1,000,000 boepd, there has been major progress in the application of new geophysical technologies with greater impact on the reservoir characterization and monitoring, in both exploratory and development production phases. 
This paper will present such progress made by the application of geophysical technologies in the acquisition, processing and interpretation stages oriented to the reservoir characterization and monitoring. 
More specifically, in regards to the reservoir characterization area this paper will address the new technologies that influenced the definition of the external and internal geometries of carbonate reservoirs, both from stratigraphic and structural point of view. 
New methods of seismic characterization of reservoirs, from the elastic inversion, the extraction of geometric attributes and the use of new technologies to reveal geological fractures corridors will be therefore detailed. Another major challenge described will be the implementation of 4D seismic technology for monitoring the behavior of fluid motion and pressure variation in the Brazilian pre-salt carbonate reservoirs. 
As for the reservoir monitoring, this paper will show the progress of the pioneer project of 4D seismic monitoring of microbial carbonates through NODES technology in an ultra deepwater area where the development of production applies the alternating injection of water and gas (WAG).

Depending on the functionality, the length of offshore pipeline can be tens to hundreds of kilometers running through different underlying soil conditions as well as traversing submarine slopes. Therefore, it is important to identify the effect of variable site conditions on the earthquake response to accurately predict the stability of offshore pipeline as well as subsea structures. A study was undertaken to determine the ground responses along an offshore pipeline route across escarpments and connected to subsea structures at the termination points. The pipeline route was divided into multiple segments depending on the soil variability. Due to high site seismicity, the soft soil is susceptible to high shear strain during strong earthquake shaking; thus requiring non-linear dynamic site-response analysis to accurately capture soil dynamic response. A finite element based non-linear site response analysis was selected for the entire pipeline route. The dynamic site response analyses were carried out using PLAXIS 2D and the soil behavior was modeled considering non-linear variation of stiffness and damping with shear strain. The input ground motions to the dynamic site response analysis were site specific stiff soil earthquake motions scaled to Abnormal Level Earthquake (ALE) and Extreme Level Earthquake (ELE). The segment-specific response spectra and time histories at mudline were developed as input to the seismic design of pipelines and subsea structures. Despite a stable escarpment during a seismic event, the site response analysis showed localized high deformation which can significantly affect the pipeline seismic response. Considerable variations in mudline response spectra was observed depending on strength, thickness and depth of soft soils. This paper provides an overview of dynamic site response analysis performed for an offshore site, and focuses on the effects of variable ground models, as well as escarpment on the seabed level seismic motions for subsea pipeline and structures seismic design. The importance of accounting each of these effects in the development of a robust and safe seismic design has been highlighted.|","Subsea Structures, Seismic Design, Finite Element, Pipeline, Site Response",35

This paper presents a 3D numerical study on the mechanical behaviors of natural fracture under injection loading, and further proposes a practical workflow for designing a widened safe mud weight window (MWW) for drilling subsalt well sections with natural fractures. The original safe MWW value for subsalt well sections is usually narrow. More specific, for a subsalt well section with natural fractures, no safe MWW existed because of this unfavorable geological environment. Therefore, hydraulic plug technology was adopted to reinforce wellbore stability and widen the MWW. The value for opening a natural fracture under the given mud-weight pressure was numerically calculated, and then used for selecting the lost circulation material (LCM) treatment size. In addition, stress cage, which is quantified by enhancement of hoop stress at the wellbore surface, was numerically analyzed. 
An illustrative example is performed with information from a well in a deepwater Gulf of Mexico (GOM) field. It is observed that a fracture with initial width of 0.5 mm opening to 0.664 mm will result in an increment of 0.55 lbm/gal mud weight. This solution is obtained with assumption of one pair of natural fractures. In the case of two existing pairs of fractures, a 1.1 lbm/gal increment of mud weight can be directly obtained for this set because of the linear property of the model,. 
The case study described in this paper provides a workflow for widening the MWW for safe drilling through a naturally fractured subsalt well section. A best practice for using this type of MWW design is also presented.|","subsalt, natural fracture, widened mud weight window, numerical modeling, hydraulic plug",56

Offshore landslides pose a major threat to subsea facilities, and one of the main triggering factors of offshore landslides is strong earthquakes. The state of the practice models offshore slope stability during strong shaking using one horizontal component of a selected representative ground motion. However, slopes and earthquakes are three-dimensional phenomena. Therefore, to provide much needed guidance in this area, this study performed 27 three-dimensional seismic slope stability analyses in a finite element program to investigate the change in the predicted results when applying one, two, or three ground motion components. 
The results showed that applying two horizontal components instead of one may increase the predicted total displacements and shear strains on the slope by 25% to 50% and by 10% to 50%, respectively. In addition, it may also increase the total displacements at the seafloor on the shelf above the slope by 20% to 40%. This could have implications when deciding the safe stand-back line for offshore facilities. However, applying three ground motion components has a negligible effect on the results compared with applying only the two horizontal components. The ratio of the response spectra on the shelf, slope, and basin varied by ± 25%, however no clear trend was observed.|","Geohazards, Earthquakes, Slope Stability, 3D",61

Sulfidic polymetallic ore deposits, known as seafloor massive sulfides (SMS) occur on the seabed as precipitation products from hot hydrothermal solutions as a result of mixing with cold seawater and are usually found at depths between 1,500 and 4,100 m. These deposits are formed basically in tectonically active spreading zones of oceans (mid-ocean ridges and ""back-arc"" spreading systems) and are the result of the global heat transfer from the mantle above the oceanic crust into the water column. In these SMS deposits, metals such as copper (Cu), zinc (Zn) and lead (Pb) as well as trace elements of silver (Ag), gold (Au) and rare antimony (Sb), cadmium (Cd), gallium (Ga), germanium (Ge), and indium (In) are present. This paper describes a novel technology for mining SMS deposits based on the vertical cutting approach developed by a joint research between BAUER Maschinen GmbH and Technip. A hyperbaric mathematical cutting model has been used to calculate the forces needed to excavate SMS deposits in water depth up to 2,000m. The model shows that in hyperbaric conditions, what influences the cutting energy is the water column rather than the geomechanical properties of the rock.

The deep water Bonga development is situated in block OML118 offshore Nigeria, Figure 1. The Bonga Main Field was discovered in 1995 with first production in November 2005. The main reservoirs are channelized, unconsolidated, turbidite sandstones of Miocene age. While the field development has been successful, opportunities and challenges remain. Below the producing reservoir levels, there is potential for additional reservoirs - unlocking those deep hydrocarbons would require to drill beyond present well control. At the same time, drilling development wells cost effectively has remained challenging even for shallow intervals given subsurface heterogeneities, which often cause borehole stability issues.   Methods, Procedures, Process 
This study introduces a novel workflow that allows the asset to leverage quantitative seismic interpretation, that is closely integrated with geomechanics modelling to address both the deep reservoir potential opportunity and the borehole stability related drilling cost challenge. Here we focus on the integration of the geomechanical and geophysical data and workflows rather than on the successful prediction of deep sand probabilities using seismic AvO inversion and Bayesian facies classification. As part of the seismic inversion, 3D dynamic Young's Modulus and Poisson's Ratio volumes were derived. In parallel, a finite-element mesh for geomechanical modelling was created from the structural interpretation and then populated with the seismic derived rock properties. The resulting field scale 3D geomechanics model helps to address production-related challenges such as top seal integrity, fault reactivation, compaction, subsidence, injection, depletion, borehole stability, and sand control. 
For this study, seismic data needed to be inverted over an interval from near seabed to deep targets below well penetration - some 3 seconds TWT or 10,000ft, a much larger window than normal for single reservoir-focused studies. Seismic AvO inversion was run using overlapping, time windows from shallow to deep, to account for wavelet transmission effects. The resulting inversion outputs, acoustic and shear impedance, were used to derive shale and sand probability volumes. Well based analysis was used to determine the best relationship between acoustic and shear impedance and Young's Modulus for both sand and shale facies. Using the facies probability volumes from seismic inversion, 3D dynamic Young's Modulus and Possion's Ratio volumes were calculated from the acoustic and shear impedance volumes.   Results, Observations, Conclusions 
A 1D geomechanics model, calibrated against drilling experience, was used to convert from dynamic to static Young's Modulus. Finite-element geomechanical modelling was used to produce the 3D stress model combining pore pressure, structural information, seismic-based static rock properties, and far-field horizontal stresses. The final stage of stress analysis involved calculating stresses that honor local field measurements and incorporate regional trends.   Novel/Additive Information 
Utilizing 3D finite element models constrained by seismic yielded a high resolution predictive model that will significantly improve wellbore stability predictions along the paths of future development wells.

The next-generation reservoir simulators help achieve faster runtimes, insight into interaction between various components of a development, and can be used as an effective tool in detecting bottlenecks in a production system as well as a constant and more effective communication tool between various departments. IAM provides significant opportunities for optimization of very large or complex infrastructures and life-of-field analysis of production optimization scenarios. |Simultaneous modeling of surface and subsurface components helps reduce time and enhances efficiency during the decision-making process which eliminates the requirement for tedious, time-consuming work and iterations between separate solutions of reservoir and surface networks. Beyond this convenience, this technology makes it possible to reach more robust results more quickly using surface-subsurface coupling. The objective of this study is to outline the advantages and the challenges in using next-generation simulators on simulation of multiple reservoirs in integrated asset management.    |Simultaneous simulation of multiple reservoirs adds another dimension of complexity to the process of integrated asset modeling. Several sub-reservoir models can be simulated simultaneously in large fields comprising sub-reservoirs with complex surface systems, which could otherwise become very tedious to handle. In this study, a next-generation reservoir simulator is coupled with an optimization and uncertainty tool that is used to optimize the net present value of the entire asset. Several constraints and bottlenecks in such a large system exist, all connected to one another. IAM proves useful in debottlenecking to increase efficiency of the thorough system. The strengths and difficulties associated with simultaneous simulation and optimization of multiple reservoirs are compared to the more conventional way of simulating the assets separately, thus illustrating the benefits of using next-generation reservoir simulators during optimization of multiple reservoirs.    |The results show that simultaneous solution of the surface-subsurface coupling gives significantly faster results than that of a system that consists of separate solution of surface and subsurface. The speed difference becomes more significant when the number of reservoirs simulated is more than one. This study outlines the workflow in setting up the model, the CPU time for each component of the simulation, the explanation of each important item in this process to illustrate the incremental benefits of use of next-generation reservoir simulators in simulating multiple reservoirs with surface facilities taken into account.    |Although the use of next-generation simulators are becoming more common, solid examples that illustrate the benefits of simultaneous simulation of multiple reservoirs with surface facilities under several different constraints like this study are important to prove the use of such tools where it is more convenient to carry out the optimization in a system that handles decision parameters and constraints simultaneously.|","next-generation reservoir simulators, IAM, optimization",38

Lower Tertiary reservoirs are characterized by high temperature and pressure, but low drive energy due to compaction and cementation. Primary recovery factors are expected to be low and enhanced recovery through waterflood is an anticipated recovery strategy. 
Design and implementation are constantly changing throughout the life of a field with the desire to converge to an optimal solution as data is gathered and models are refined. Accurate input of production and injection allocation history reduces the need to rely on assumptions and generates more productive designs, faster. Lower Tertiary fields can see particular benefit due to the fact that there are a relatively large number of geologic unknowns, uncertain injector/producer connectivity, and relatively high vertical heterogeneity. 
Highly heterogeneous vertical geology and poor communication suggest the need for high spatial resolution measurements. Wireline spinner surveys require mobilization and intervention costs that limit their utility in deep water applications. However, fiber-optic surveillance has the potential to provide the necessary information. Permanently installed fiber-optic systems can enable equivalent surveys to be conducted with in-situ equipment, on-demand, for the life of the asset. This will have a substantial impact on the cost to obtain data, significantly improve measurement frequency, and reduce the time required to implement changes that improve recovery rates. Even small relative changes in the recovery rate can translate into substantially improved project economics. Optimizing the enhanced recovery process with fiber-optic surveillance provides this opportunity. A wide range of fiber optic sensing applications have been evaluated and employed throughout the oil and gas industry. In this paper, an overview of fiber optic sensing applications will be discussed and their use in Lower Tertiary reservoirs will be evaluated.|","waterflood, Production Profiling, Fiber-Optic, Lower Tertiary, Well Monitoring",21

This paper presents key outcomes of a 3-year Joint Industry Project funded by 6 Operators on the impact of submarine slides on pipelines. This JIP developed new techniques to simulate slide runout, and assess the resulting loading and deformation of seabed pipelines. The work was distilled into guidance for practical application, which has found adoption on projects. 
The JIP spanned (i) characterization of soils at the solid-fluid transition, (ii) computational modelling of slide runout – via depth-averaged and continuum finite element methods, (iii) physical and numerical modelling of slide runout and pipeline impact, and (iv) analytical studies of pipeline response during slide loading. These elements combine to provide an improved practical basis for quantifying the risk associated with slide-pipeline interaction. 
To characterize very soft seabed soils, a new geotechnically-based framework was devised based on extensive measurements of different soils. This framework spans the solid-fluid boundary that is crossed as slides evolve into a debris flow and turbidity current. It is shown that the geotechnical link between water content and shear strength extends continuously – with no phase transformation – far into the fluid domain, allowing a single rheology to be applied throughout. 
Computational modelling of slide runout used a hierarchy of methods, from large deformation finite element analysis (LDFE) (with rate effects and softening at soil element level), through depth-averaged runout, to energy-based analytical solutions. In some regimes of behavior the simpler methods suffice, allowing efficient use of Monte Carlo methods to tackle uncertainty. More complex runout modes can be replicated by newly-developed LDFE techniques. 
From a runout analysis results, pipeline impact loads can be assessed using new solutions for the bearing capacity and drag forces on pipelines developed from numerical and physical modelling, which again unify concepts from fluid dynamics and geotechnics. Finally, simple analytical methods for assessing the structural response of a pipeline to a known slide loading are provided. These solutions allow rapid assessment of the response of a pipeline to a specified slide loading. 
These advances improve the methods available for quantitative assessment of slide runout and slide-pipeline interaction, allowing better determination of the resulting geohazard risk.|","Geohazard, Geotechnical, Pipeline, Impact load, Submarine Slide",34

One of the most important of these characteristics is an in-situ evaluation of the magnitude and variation of the minimum in-situ stress, the measurement of which is critical for geomechanical modelling and thereby a range of applications such as well construction, caprock integrity, and completion optimization. |A wireline formation testing (WFT) tool is a common approach for obtaining direct measurements of these stresses at a range of depths. This process is referred to as microfracturing and is most typically performed in an openhole environment. Typical toolstrings consist of a straddle packer arrangement, a pumping mechanism, gamma ray for accurate depth correlation, a motorized valve/manifold arrangement, and pressure/temperature gauges. To perform a stress test, a specific interval of the wellbore is isolated by inflating the straddle packers. The interval is then pressurized by incrementally pumping fluid until a tensile fracture has been initiated. In an open hole, the fracture will initiate and propagate normal to the minimum stress at the wellbore and multiple injection and falloff cycles are subsequently performed to ensure fracture growth beyond the influence of the hoop stress regime. The data are then analysed to determine fracture initiation, reopening, propagation and closure pressures. Additionally, it may be possible to approximate fracture orientation, if an image log is available. |This paper describes the process of obtaining minimum in-situ stress measurements using a WFT and advanced integrated stress analysis (ISA) process, in an ultradeep reservoir at ultrahigh pressures. Lessons learned and best practices are highlighted along with their importance for efficient job execution. The integrated geomechanical analysis covers subsequent generation of a calibrated stress model with minimum horizontal stress measured during microfracturing. Factors include evaluation of the stress contrast in the target formations and evaluation of the overburden gradient and mechanics for microfracturing job design for future operations (breakdown pressure) and lessons learned such as station selection, backup packer availability, and influence of stress cage material on breakdown, to name but a few. |Obtaining accurate knowledge of in-situ minimum stress values, based on actual measurements, is a key step on the road to effective execution, and the earlier that this is achieved, the more efficient the results of any development. This paper summarises the successful application of the WFT approach in delivering such data under extremely harsh depth and pressure conditions, but resulting in a measurement from which numerous subdisciplines can conduct their decision making and design.|","Wireline Mini-frac, wireline stress testing, integrated stress analysis, Micro-frac, Deepwater microfrac",59
949,950,26900-MS,StressCage and Frac Pack: Drilling the Conventionally Undrillable Without Creating the Unfraccable,"Rylance, M., BP Exploration| Mahadev, K., BP Exploration","|Abstract 
There is little doubt that the success and reliability of frac-pack completions in the Gulf of Mexico has become the yard-stick by which Gulf of Mexico sand control completions are currently measured. Simultaneously, StressCage has become common practice as a method to overcome challenges drilling through depleted zones, in order to cope with complex mud-window constraints for new developments and infill wells. The success of these drilling and completion approaches and their rapid widespread application has resulted in ever more depletion. This has potentially created a vicious circle in terms of drilling the well to desired depth vs. the ability to install a low-skin frac-pack completion. 
While these two techniques in isolation represent uniquely optimal solutions to their individual challenges, there is growing evidence that their application within the same wellbore has the potential to create conflicting ideals. The StressCage application is associated with the plugging of small fractures which have been induced in the wellbore wall, thereby increasing the effective fracture gradient, which allows for the drilling of substantial depletion. However, the presence of a range of widely distributed particle sizes in the mud system, as well as increased general solids loading, may result in deep and invasive plugging of the permeable formations and any smaller fractures within the same open-hole sections. When these plugged formations are then the target for subsequent fracturing operations, there is a significant potential to create near wellbore problems that complicate or bring into question the ability to install a frac-pack completion. 
This paper will provide a number of examples of the application of StressCage, where resulting frac operations appear to have been hampered or complicated by the use of the StressCage approach and/or associated mud conditions. These examples will provide some evidence of such interactions but, more importantly, demonstrate the contradiction that these two techniques potentially represent. The paper will also outline a scenario resulting from a sand-control lower completion assembly in place, in a new borehole drilled with StressCage method, that could be resistant to any form of frac breakdown (or simple mechanical intervention), and, thereby, compromise the frac and well completion itself. 
In addition to the case histories, the paper will outline various engineering approaches that should be considered, including geo-mechanical analysis of well placement, identification of near wellbore issues prior to and during the fracturing operations, careful management of stress caged solids makeup, mud management and frac-pack design in order to avoid or overcome such challenges. All of this helps ensure that we do not create the paradox of being able to drill through the undrillable but then creating the unfraccable as a result.|","Breakdown, Frac-Pack, Stress-Cage",57

Geotechnical investigations are routinely performed in site characterization studies for offshore infrastructure development. Until present, little consideration has been given to the application of geotechnical methods to pore pressure assessment in the top-hole section of deepwater sediments. Laboratory geotechnical tests including one-dimensional consolidation tests and index property measurements on intact cores collected from pilot holes drilled at prospective well sites have the ability to provide a rigorous characterization of the normal compaction trend and in-situ porosity, which are critical in evaluations of overpressure associated with a compaction disequilibrium mechanism. This paper presents key considerations pertaining to interpretation of results from geotechnical tests in the context of top-hole formation pore pressure assessment at deepwater settings.

An integrated study involving geological, geomechanical, reservoir and completion analyses were conducted to design a new completion system for optimizing production in Lower Tertiary play in deep-water Gulf of Mexico (GOM). Lower Tertiary reservoirs are generally characterized by lower productivity potential due to low permeability and poor reservoir energy in some areas due to low GOR, little/no gas cap and very limited water drive. Multiple reservoir sand layers need to be hydraulically fractured for production under a potentially high geo-pressure and stress environment. The design of a lower completion system focused on stimulation, sand control systems and their impact on production. The proposed lower completion system has a large ID to maximize production rates and supports stimulating reservoirs with high proppant volumes and pump rates to increase the number of treatment zones. 
Petrophysical and geological analyses were conducted to determine the distribution of sand bodies in thirty study wells drilled across from Alaminos Canyon through Keathley Canyon to Walker Ridge (W-E). A geomechanical analysis was conducted to determine the variation of rock mechanical properties and stresses across these regions. Sanding analysis was conducted to assess the risk of rock failure and the effect of production in open-hole completion under the high draw-down scenarios. 
Frac-Pack fracture modeling was conducted with an optimized stress profile for a candidate well for three lower completion systems to select the optimal fracturing intervals and treatment schedules that will maximize well performance. Possible oil production rates were estimated for various scenarios involving natural flow, ESP and subsea boosting. 
This study focusing on understanding the reservoir characteristics for lower completion systems design ensures optimal technology selection to ultimately enhance well productivity and ROI with better production rates and ultimate recovery.|","RDS, Lower Tertiary, Production, Gulf of Mexico, Production Enhancement",15

North Senoro Gas Field is located onshore at Sulawesi Island, operated by JOB PERTAMINA – Medco E&P Tomori Sulawesi. The aim of North Senoro Project Development is to produce gas from limestone reservoir (Mentawa reef) which has unique characteristic formation that total loss hazard wasn't found at the adjacent well. One of effort to solve the problems is bullheading. In this paper, it will explain how bullheading might become a sufficient method for controling pressure during stripping operation while curing loss circulation problem. Well control situation in sandstone and carbonate formation has different characteristic. In carbonate, well control issue is mostly come by total loss which caused the mud hydrostatic pressure was less in the wellbore. Curing loss circulation was the first major to control pressure on the well. Also on sandstone formation, has more compact if hasn't fault or fracture on there. 
The well control issue happened in 8-1/2? hole section; the situation occurred when suddenly got total loss in the bore hole. It was followed by the increasing number of background gas from the cutting. Shut in well, got record of SICP is 1700 psi and SIDP is 0 psi. The operations continued with circulate gas out through choke simultaneously with original mud and LCM to try plugged the loss zone and filled up the hole. The result was same with no indication of curing the loss problem. Decided to circulate on the two side, through annulus and inside drill string, while circulate mud and LCM through drill pipe got plugged. The engineer team made some analysis then created few scenarios, such as severing BHA, perforate drill pipe to make communication with annulus, continued pumping mud and LCM via annulus (bullheading), or stripping operation. With all assumptions and condition, the stripping operation while bullheading became the best choice to POOH BHA and running OE to cure loss circulation with BDOP/BDOC, then continue with circulate out gas/kick. Finally, with 2 spot BDOC and the last BDOC was modified using LCM to mitigate micro fracture in cement, loss circulation solved then following circulate out gas by driller method. 
For total loss and kick issue, the important thing that we have to assure is pressure gradient and availability of water and LCM material. Setting casing shoe at the high rating pressure will give us much possibility to select the way of curing loss circulation and kick. RIH OE pipe and spot BDOP & BDOC through OE pipe became success story to curing the loss for next well. Finally, the safety for crew, environment and production target is achieved with this option at North Senoro Gas Field.|","Carbonate Zone, Well Control, Total Loss and Kick, BUllheading, Stripping Operation",13

This procedure brings about a set of unique challenges with respect to well construction, operation, and remediation. As compared with normal production, CO2 injection imposes lower temperatures and stronger temperature variations on wells. This is especially prevalent if the injection is not continuous. Downhole-temperature variations will result in expansion or contraction of casings and well-barrier materials, which can cause them to crack or debond at interfaces. To avoid leakage paths through wells, it is therefore important to understand within which temperature intervals it is safe to operate. In the present paper, we describe a heat-conduction model for calculating heat transfer from the well to the casing, annular seal, and rock formation. These materials have dissimilar thermal properties, and will behave differently with respect to downhole-temperature variations. The model is discretized by use of a finitevolume method developed especially for accurate calculation of heat conducted radially in a well. This allows us to predict temperatures and temperature variations at various locations in and around a given well during CO2 injection. To validate the numerical model, we compare our simulation results with the time-varying temperatures measured in our laboratory. Good agreement is found between the numerical predictions and the measured data. Simulation results are presented for different combinations of formations and well-barrier materials (cement and alternative types of annular sealants) to display their effect on the well temperature. It is found that, by replacing cement with an annular sealant material with higher thermal conductivity, the temperature difference across the seal can be significantly reduced. A high-conductivity formation such as halite/rock salt can also reduce thermal gradients in the well materials.|","well integrity, heat transfer, annular sealants, CO2 storage",40

But the cost, data-gathering method, and output of these two methods differ significantly. |Others are relying on readily available, alternative sources of data: cuttings, fluids, or well pressure readings. They are hitting the market at a time when low oil prices have created an appetite for new ideas. |“Definitely we are exploring lots of technology options right now. Anything to drive down our dollar per foot completion cost,” said Kevin Wutherich, director of completions for Rice Energy. “We are even looking at stuff that could save USD 20,000 a well. We have a program that might yield 70 wells a year, so that is about USD 1.5 million. That might not have been too big a deal (when oil was at USD 100/bbl) but these days we will chase that down.” |Getting a Feel for the Rock |Stephen Rassenfoss, JPT Emerging Technology Senior Editor |The force required to drill through a rock is a direct test of its strength and stiffness. Anyone who has ever used a power drill to drill through plaster and then hit a wooden beam can feel the difference. |Turning those feelings into a reliable measure of the properties of rock based on the force required to drill a long lateral is a large challenge. |Two startups, Drill2Frac and Fracture ID, are selling services that do that, though their methods vary based on the sources of the inputs and the outputs offered to customers. Both are offering an option that can become a routinely used diagnostic method by those designing fractures by providing information comparable to that from a sonic log, but at a significantly lower price. |Rock property information was also often a missing piece for those doing microseismic testing, which images the impact of fracturing based on the sound produced during certain types of fracturing. Users wanted better rock property information to improve the interpretation of the changes in microseismic data gathered around a well, said Chris Neale, president of Fracture ID, which uses downhole drilling data for imaging. |“When I was deep in the microseismic world I was very frustrated. I could not tell them what microseismic was telling them. There was no in-well data to correlate the microseismic,” said Neale, who was a cofounder of MicroSeismic Inc. “We needed an inexpensive data stream that could give us high-resolution rock properties for every well drilled.” |Data gathered while drilling offer a measure that avoids the time and logistical challenges of running a sonic logging tool into a horizontal wellbore or setting up surface receivers for microseismic. |These companies are building on work going back decades on formulas to quantify rock properties based on data gathered while drilling and rock property analysis. |In a recent paper (SPE 178842), BP described a formula that it developed to estimate pore pressures using drilling data. The work improved on formulas dating back to the late 1960s and early 1970s. |DNA Sequencing: A New Diagnostic Tool for Shale Wells |Trent Jacobs, JPT Senior Technology Writer |For the past 2 decades, the use of DNA sequencing technology has largely been relegated to the domains of criminal forensics and the healthcare industry. The company betting that the shale industry soon will join that list is Biota Technology, a California-based startup. |Founded in 2013, Biota says DNA sequencing technology can help maximize production in horizontal shale wells by directing operators where to place the wells, and how they should be completed. |“We are addressing questions that our customers can’t answer today across multiple scales: Where are the sweet spots and producing intervals for each stage, what is the fracture height for each well, and what is the connectivity between multiple wells?” said Ajay Kshatriya, chief executive officer of Biota. |Biota so far has used its technology on 60 wells operated by six different US producers. Its novel approach involves analyzing the DNA of tiny microbes that coexist with the oil, water, and rock in the subsurface. There are hundreds of thousands of different microbes living inside a formation but certain species are associated with hydrocarbons tend to stand out. |Their unique signatures and locations along the wellbore allow Biota to generate a production profile which can then be used to design engineered completions in subsequent wells, or to identify refracturing opportunities. |“Think of the DNA as a tracking device,” said Kshatriya. “It is a high-resolution data source that provides 4D analysis across the production life cycle, which doesn’t introduce environmental risk or require downhole tools.” |During a drilling operation, as many as 600 samples may be taken from a single well. These samples come from drilling mud and cuttings and provide baseline data needed to characterize the well as production begins and comingles all of the microbial DNA. |Grinding Out Big Data From Tiny Samples |Stephen Rassenfoss, JPT Emerging Technology Senior Editor |When describing what Ingrain does for oilfield clients, the rock-testing company’s director of unconventional technology, Joel Walls, points out that it is “not just for science.” |He brings it up repeatedly because the company, known for being a pioneer in methods built on imaging ultratight rock at the core level, has built a business testing drilling cuttings to help identify productive, fracturable rock to help operators design better completions. |The pricing and turnaround time is designed to fit into the industry’s need to sharply increase the productivity of wells using better diagnostic testing at a time when drilling has greatly slowed. |“The asset teams and technology that remain in these (operating) companies are some of the best in the industry,” Walls said. With the slowdown there is time to consider what they need to do, plan, and do more testing. The testing is guided by the realization that production performance varies widely from well to well, and from stage to stage due to unpredictable variations in the rock. |Before the oil price crash, companies commonly would “optimize” a drilling program by doing a few heavily monitored science wells to establish a standard design for the many wells that followed. |Wide performance variations made a case for the value of adding individual well data. But there is a limit on the time and money available to do so. |“The objective is to do it relatively inexpensively on every well drilled,” he said. To deliver on that Ingrain had to develop a system to scale up that process to deliver results in time to be used to adjust completion designs based on field-scale data. |“The trend is doing it quickly and doing it in a repeatable fashion on a commercial scale” using current technology, Walls said. |The turnaround time can be days, but it is normally about a week, for a price that he said is in the same range with other new testing methods costing less than USD 100,000 per well. |The cutting testing program uses mineral and elemental tests to measure brittleness, which can highlight if sections can be effectively broken using hydraulic pressure, and a look at pore-scale imaging to quantify the hydrocarbon-filled pores, which provides a good estimate of permeability. |Mapping Fracturing With Pressure Change |Stephen Rassenfoss, JPT Emerging Technology Senior Editor |A service using pressure data from a few nearby unconventional wells to map fracturing will soon be for sale. |Statoil developed the method, and has used it to improve how it completes wells in three US unconventional plays, said Matt Dawson, investment manager at Statoil Ventures, which created a company to market the method, called Reveal Energy Services. |The approach assumes that in formations where most of the hydrocarbons are trapped in a dense, nearly impermeable matrix with a limited number of fractures, the pressure of the flow through those pathways can be measured in nearby wells. |The signals—a poroelastic pressure response—can be 10–100 psi, said Dawson, who also helped create the method. |The extremely limited flow in the formation, and the fact the monitoring wells are pressurized with water to protect them from the fractures growing from the well to be stimulated, ensures that the measurements are of “the pressure profile in the stimulated fracture,” he said. |With multiple surface measurements of pressure changes during fracturing— data from at least two wells are required, and more is better—Dawson said it is possible to measure the largest fracture’s length, height, and angle. |The method developed to track fluid flows through fractures has been used to evaluate Statoil wells in the Bakken, Eagle Ford, and Marcellus shales, and Dawson said “we are confident it will work in those three.” |More than one-third of the company’s wells in the Bakken were tested over a 12-month period, he said. Within a year he said they hope to be able to gather and interpret the data quickly enough for it to be used by crews as they are fracturing the well. |When Statoil researchers asked engineers in the field if they could try the test during fracturing in the Bakken, there were questions about how much it could complicate fracturing. |“It really turned out to be not very difficult to accommodate into normal operations,” said Darren Schmidt, a principal engineer in Statoil’s shale oil and gas research and technology group. The method requires setting plugs at certain times while fracturing, but if “you are zipper fracturing a well, you can fit this in normally on a multiwell pad and then get some good information,” said Schmidt, who was then doing completions.|","Document Type

These technologies are often applied in offshore environments, where large reservoir areas are drained from one or more platforms. |In the late 1980s, long-reach wells started to use existing infrastructure better by drilling beyond the design limits of that time. Several major operators were extending their limits, and, in the late 1990s, BP Wytch Farm showed that a horizontal departure exceeding 10 km was feasible. This had a significant effect on the industry because offshore platforms now could be designed for up to 10-km reach, as opposed to the early 1980s when 3-km reach was common. A field could now be developed with one platform instead of three, resulting in enormous savings. |Multilateral-well technology also matured during the past 2 decades. There were many drivers for this development. One of the more important was the desire to increase production in tight reservoirs. Another advantage is directional control. Well stimulation with fracturing has the drawback that the fracture direction is controlled by the in-situ stresses in the rock. Multilateral branches, on the other hand, can be drilled in any direction. |There has been considerable development around these technologies. Those that help clear the challenges, such as those related to wellbore stability, wellbore friction, equipment limitations, and operational aspects, can be considered mature technologies today. |The main benefit from directional drilling is the maximizing of reservoir recovery. From this perspective, multilateral/ extended-reach wells may be considered one of the more important means of improved oil recovery. |Although these directional-well concepts have been used for some years, they were initially costly with a high economic risk. There is a continuous technology development at many levels that leads to improvements. These result in more-efficient processes, with increased field recoveries as a consequence.

956,957,181747-PA,A Review on Fracture-Initiation and -Propagation Pressures for Lost Circulation and Wellbore Strengthening,"Feng, Yongcun, The University of Texas at Austin| Jones, John F., Marathon Oil Corporation| Gray, K. E., The University of Texas at Austin","|Summary |Fracture-initiation pressure (FIP) and fracture-propagation pressure (FPP) are both important considerations for preventing and mitigating lost circulation. For significant fluid loss to occur, a fracture must initiate on an intact wellbore or reopen on a wellbore with pre-existing fractures, and then propagate into the farfield region. Wellbore-strengthening operations are designed to increase one or both of these two pressures to combat lost circulation. Currently, some theoretical models assume that FIPs and FPPs are only functions of in-situ stress and rock-mechanical properties. However, as demonstrated by numerous field and laboratory observations, they are also highly related to drilling-fluid properties and to interactions between the drilling fluid and formation rock. This paper discusses the mechanisms of lost circulation and wellbore strengthening, with an emphasis on factors that can affect FIP and FPP. These factors include microfractures on the wellbore wall, in-situ-stress anisotropy, pore pressure, fracture toughness, filter-cake development, fracture bridging/plugging, bridge location, fluid leakoff, rock permeability, pore size of rock, mud type, mud solid concentration, and critical capillary pressure. The conclusions of this paper include information seldom considered in lost-circulation studies, such as the effect of microfractures on FIP and the effect of capillary forces on FPP. Research results described in this paper may be useful for lost-circulation mitigation and wellbore-strengthening design, as well as hydraulic- fracturing design and leakoff-test (LOT) interpretation.|","Fracture Initiation Pressure, Fracture Propagation Pressure, Wellbore Strengthening, Lost Circulation",1

Experience indicates that more-aggressive drill bits are harder to steer. This is commonly attributed to the fact that bits with higher aggressivity produce larger torque changes for a given change in bit weight. The actual mechanics, however, of tool-face disorientation during slide events is poorly understood. This paper reports on tests conducted on a full-size drill rig aimed at understanding the mechanics of tool-face control. Tool-face orientation and other data were measured downhole at 100 Hz. Nine different bits ranging from polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) to hybrid to roller-cone bits were tested on an adjustable kick- off (AKO) motor bottomhole assembly (BHA) in slide mode. These tests confirm the common industry notions about the effect of aggressivity on tool-face control. They also show that angular motion of the BHA while sliding is overdamped. Toolface orientation consequently follows the average of the torque signal generated by the bit. Furthermore, the tool-face orientation is more easily disoriented by a torque signal at a frequency near to or less than the torsional natural frequency of the drillstring. PDC bits excite this more readily than bits with rolling cones. We also identify a tool-face disorientation anomaly that we call a fast torque anomaly (FTA). FTAs occur because the bent motor/AKO has a preferred angular orientation in the borehole. FTAs have not been previously recognized, probably because they are not identifiable in mud-pulse signals. A BHA suffering FTAs would simply appear as a chaotic and profound loss of tool-face control in mudpulse data. Hybrid and roller-cone bits caused fewer FTAs than PDC bits.|","Tool Face Control, Directional Drilling, Drill Bit, Motor, AKO",50

Hydraulic fracturing has been an essential part of the gas development program in Saudi Arabia. In particular, proppant fracturing treatments have increasingly grown in number in recent years, which provided an incentive to look for viable alternatives to imported proppants. A new hydraulic fracturing design that utilized local sand as nonstandard proppants was recently applied in gas wells producing from sandstone formations in Saudi Arabia. This paper presents the theory behind the new fracturing design and summarizes the main results and recommendations. 
Sand quality-control lab tests were required prior to using Saudi Arabian sand as a propping agent in fracturing gas wells. The sand samples were analyzed for particle sizes, bulk densities, and compressive strengths. Well selection to apply the fracturing stimulation was then made based on a geomechanical criterion for the reservoir rock and the well's production performance. The treatment design utilized a channel-fracturing technique where the solids used comprised of roughly 65% natural sand and 35% ceramic proppants. 
The results show successful placement of the fracturing treatment into the formation. Despite sand crushing, the data show reasonable stimulation results and productivity enhancements. A number of important findings were also realized based on the analysis of the production performance, the reservoir transient pressure data, and the recovered solids and liquids. 
The discussions shared in this work including analysis of field data yielded important findings and recommendations. Particularly, the concept of applying nonstandard proppants, such as silica sand for hydraulic fracturing treatments is proven feasible. Overall, the new fracturing technique shows considerable potentials for sufficient process optimization and utilization of abundant resources in production operations.|",,17
960,961,182774-MS,Effects of Multiple Transport Mechanisms on Shale Gas Production Behavior,"Negara, Ardiansyah, Baker Hughes| Sun, Shuyu, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology","|Abstract 
Gas transport in extremely low-permeability shale formations is a multi-mechanisms-coupling process that includes gas adsorption-desorption, Knudsen diffusion, and slip flow. Incorporating these mechanisms into a unified mathematical model is crucial to obtain a more accurate shale gas production behavior. The objective of this paper is to investigate the effect of each mechanism on shale gas production behavior. We establish shale gas dual-porosity dual-permeability model that incorporates gas adsorption-desorption, Knudsen diffusion, and slip flow as well as the thermodynamics calculations. Peng-Robinson equation of state (PR-EOS) was used to calculate the gas density and compressibility factor by solving the cubic equation. In our model, gas adsorption-desorption obeys the Langmuir's isotherm as a function of reservoir pressure. Furthermore, gas viscosity changes with Knudsen number during the pressure depletion; and pore radius will increase when the adsorption gas desorbs from the pore wall. In the numerical method implementation, we combine the finite volume method with the experimenting pressure field approach to obtain the pressure distribution in the matrix and fracture systems. In this study, we investigate the effects of adsorption, Knudsen diffusion, and gas-slippage (Klinkenberg effect) on shale production behavior. We switch each mechanism on and off in the model to observe its effect on the production performance. It is observed from the results that among these mechanisms, adsorption has a great influence on gas production. Ignoring adsorbed gas would lead to a lower cumulative production. Meanwhile, the effects of Knudsen diffusion and slip flow are not as significant as adsorption. In particular for the example presented in this paper, neglecting adsorption will decrease the production nearly 80% compared to 15%-18% when Knudsen diffusion and slip flow are ignored. Knudsen diffusion and slip flow have less impact on the production because both mechanisms occurs in the matrix and contribute only to the apparent permeability, while the production is mainly determined by the fracture permeability, which is critical in determining fluid flow from the fracture system to the wellbore.|",,3

Saudi Aramco has been producing from the Manifa offshore field in the Arabian Gulf since 2011. By drilling mainly lateral wells, Saudi Aramco has targeted the main reservoir that belongs to the early Jurassic period. The pay zone is overlaid with weaker interbedded sand/shale formations and carbonate formations of the upper and lower cretaceous period. 
The main challenges that were encountered while drilling these wells included total/partial mud losses and severe wellbore instability-related issues across the weaker formations overlaying the reservoir section (pay zone). An advanced geomechanical study was crucial for understanding the nature of the existing problems faced during drilling and applying the study's findings for drilling future extended reach (ERD) wells successfully. 
A comprehensive geomechanical study of the field was conducted by constructing a calibrated post-drill 1-D Mechanical Earth Model (1D-MEM) for selected vertical wells. The study helped in providing reliable rock mechanical properties and fracture gradients across the problematic formations, a lack of which was a limiting factor in understanding the nature of the problems while drilling. 
For the current study, an integrated workflow was implemented mainly to perform a root cause analysis of mud losses and to define well inclination (deviation) limits to drill through the problematic formations to minimize wellbore instability-related issues. Open hole log data was used to construct the 1D-MEMs. The developed models were further calibrated using all the available data (drilling observations, results of well testing, core mechanical testing, etc.). Image data was also analyzed to capture the presence of fractures/faults or related features along the wellbore. 
Based on the analysis results, it was concluded that the mud losses in the overlaid carbonate formations were attributed to the presence of localized open natural fractures or caverns, or vugs. It was also concluded that most of the wellbore instability-related issues (hole pack-offs, stuck pipe incidents, etc.) occurred due to insufficient drilling mud weights that were not able to support the rock on the wellbore wall. The present study helped in better characterization of the problematic formations and also provided useful information for planning future extended reach (ERD) wells. Some of the provided recommendations included acquisition of micro resistivity image logs (to identify nature of fracture), implementation of real-time geomechanics, and optimization of mud rheology, mud weight program, and casing design.|",,3

Hydraulic fracture stimulation designs are typically made of multiple stages placed along the lateral section of the well using various well completion technologies. Understanding how multiple hydraulic fractures propagate and interact with each other is essential for an effective stimulation design. The number and placement of stages are important factors for optimizing the performance of the laterals. This in turn depends on accuracy in determining fracture interference. We present advanced simulations for accurate placement of well stages. In this paper, we use a 3-D fully coupled geomechanical-fluid flow simulator which incorporates anisotropic geomechanical properties. Densely complex natural fractures and lamination are built into the model based on available core and log information. Multiple fractures are concurrently imployed to simulate real life scenarios. Fluid pressures are incrementally computed such that stress state changes dynamically with time as it happens in real field situation. Our simulations were run on Cray XC 40 HPC system. The results demonstrate that the stress shadow effects can significantly alter hydraulic fracture propagation behavior, which eventually affects the final fracture geometry. The results show that there are large differences in aperture throughout the stimulation which persists to the end of pumping. Furthermore comparison between cases with and without complex natural fractures (discrete fracture network (DFN)) and lamination was conducted with even and uneven spacing configurations. Fracture interference and spacing analysis conducted based on model with perforation frictions shows that while spacing between fractures is important, the largest impact was observed in the presence of lamination and DFN. The large differences in the way the fracture propagates highly depend on the DFN connectivity. Late-stage connection throughout the model implies later disconnection when the pressure drops. Though the computations are time intensive, we believe this is a valuable tool to use in the planning stages for asset development to increase production potential.|",,15

One of the perceived drawbacks of matrix polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) bits compared with steel PDC bits is their restricted open-face volume and smaller blade standoff, which is primarily caused by the matrix PDC bits' brittle nature. Increased blade standoff gives steel PDC bits a more hydraulically efficient body type, which directly affects ROP. In many drilling applications, operators switch to steel PDC to take advantage of their hydraulic efficiency, and recent developments in hardfacing material has expanded the range of applications of such bits. However, there are applications that are still dominated by matrix PDC bits, and a need arose for matrix material that can allow the molding of slim, hydraulically efficient matrix bodies. 
A new matrix material with enhanced toughness allows for the design of a slim-body matrix construction. This innovative concept has been validated for structural integrity, which was the main perceived risk. The technology was rolled out for 8<U+00BD>-in and 12<U+00BC>-in hole sections and deployed in a field test campaign in all of Egypt's different rock columns. 
The effect and value of faster ROP increases with application complexity and depth and is directly proportional to rig spread rate. Hence, realizing the application limits of slim-body matrix technology was the main intent of this study. Success was measured by observing the effect of hydraulic efficiency across different fields in terms of ROP and cost savings. Further, to isolate the effect of slim-body construction, several tests were conducted between standard matrix and slim-body matrix construction using the same cutting structure layout and PDC cutter grade. 
The slim-body matrix construction demonstrates significant improvement in cost per foot for applications and is directly proportional to UCS. This feature is advantageous in interbedded applications, where formations fluctuate from hard to soft and vice versa along the drilled column. This new feature has since been standardized in matrix bits and is being rolled out across various applications with the intent of tackling more expensive drilling operations to show a greater reduction in cost per foot.|",,15

This paper reports the laboratory study to check the influence of water content, amount, distribution, and water types, on shale reactivity.

A new method using thermogravimetry (TGA) is developed to determine the water content and provided the opportunity to quantify water loss severity due to dehydration. For a complete understanding of shale-fluid interaction, a more detailed characterization methodology was necessary. The most popular method used by the industry, X-Ray diffraction (XRD), has limitations with shale samples. The proposed methodology uses TGA and is presented here. It has several advantages when compared to XRD. The composition of the rock can easily be identified and structural changes of the rock can be observed.|","Document Type

Formation drillability is one of the most important aspects for planning and designing a new oil/gas well since the factors affecting the drilling performance have complex relationships between formation properties, drill bit design and operational parameters. In view of the high operating cost of drilling rigs, if Rate of Penetration (ROP) can be enhanced, it will reduce open-hole formation exposure time and complications associated with it, resulting in significant savings in drilling time and cost can be realized. 
Normally bit engineers utilize the assumed lithology from mud logs and detailed depth-wise lithology of offset wells. The lithology can also be interpreted from conventional logging data such as Sonic, Gamma and Density. Furthermore, the rock's compressive strength is calculated using Compressional / Shear travel time (Sonic log), Bulk density (Density log) and Shale content (Gamma log). 
These utilized tools to detect the lithology and rock mechanical properties have an extent of uncertainty due to effects either related to the borehole or drilling fluids that require extensive corrections. That degree of uncertainty subsequently can affect the drill bit design criteria, selection and viability of performance-enhancing features. 
This present paper reveals a new practical approach as a solution to minimize uncertainty in terms of bit design and selection by utilizing wellbore imaging either LWD and/or Wireline borehole images and lithology & mineralogy from either wireline mineralogy logs ""Pulsed Neutron"" and/or ROQSACN instrument to precisely deliver an accurate input data to the drill bit design/selection software modules.|",,17

This paper aims to define the geological characteristics, lithofacies, and depositional setting of the sandstones in a Saudi Arabian formation based on an outcrop detailed study. The information gathered from the outcrop study is integrated with mechanical and geochemical parameters of sand grains. The sandstone succession of Saudi Arabia is exposed along the margins of the Arabian shield and extends from north to south. This succession exhibits sandstone, which was deposited mainly in continental-to-shallow marine environments (fluvial, glacial and pro-glacial, Aeolian, and shallow marine). Hence, it displays a wide range of lithofacies, including fine-grained, medium-grained, coarse-grained, pebbly, conglomeratic, bioturbated, and crossbedded massive sandstone facies. Representative samples from each facies were carefully acquired for laboratory studies of geomechanical and geochemical analysis. 
A correlation of field and laboratory observations can help determine potential application of sands in the petroleum industry (e.g., fracturing and sand control operations). Geochemically and morphologically, these facies mainly consist of moderate-to-well-sorted and rounded-to-well-rounded silica-rich sandstone. There have been a number of studies performed on sands from Southeast Asia and North America; however, no such studies have been performed on the Middle East region sands, even though the region possesses significant sand reserves. Therefore, evaluation of the sand from the Saudi Arabian region is a significant step towards its use in various oilfield applications. 
High-resolution geological properties in combination with geomechanical and geochemical properties of sandstone and sand can reveal their potential as fracturing sands. This study defines potential fracturing sand in Saudi Arabia based on geological characteristics, lithofacies, and depositional setting.

Coring in unconventional reservoirs with typical unconsolidated formations has introduced additional challenges requiring more innovative concepts to be developed. These requirements, economic issues of unconventional reservoirs, and also issues of conventional coring particularly in regard to excessive trip times incurred have recently led to widespread attention to wireline continuous coring (WCC) modified from mining industry to petroleum industry applications. This coring method has contributed to coring deep formations, long core sections, multiple zones, jam prone formations, exploration zones or areas with unknown core points. Currently, WCC is suffering from several drawbacks while some recent attempts have been made to remove them. In this accordance, this work is missioned to remove some existing defects by adding some innovative concepts to be applied to the ordinary WCC. Therefore, a more efficient continuous coring method is aimed which includes enhanced coring key performance indicators. 
Therefore, several identified challenges of WCC are considered to be removed or alleviated by innovative concepts to be added. The challenges consist of un-flushed inner tube while run in hole, limited retrievable core size, in-situ/pressure coring hazards (i.e. safety issues, complex sealing, etc.), slick line issues (rig time, torque, rupture, etc.), untimely and inefficient decision making while coring/drilling, non-optimized coring/drilling and tripping induced core damage in WCC. 
In order to address these issues, as novelty measures, first an inner tube flushing system is proposed for flushing inner tubes prior to commencing coring. Second, casing drilling coring is recommended in order to obtain larger core sizes contributing to improved core analysis. Third, in-situ downhole measurement and sampling systems are proposed to measure properties of in-situ fluids in order to complete or replace pressure/in-situ coring systems and ensure safety. Fourth, an innovative mode conversion system is proposed to mitigate slick line issues. Fifth, a less complex logging while coring system has also been proposed in special cases to enhance and expedite real time decision making process in regard to proceeding to core cutting or not. Sixth, an innovative mode conversion system contributing to partial elimination of wireline jobs will also be proposed to substitute slick line/ wireline retrievals. Seventh, optimum tripping schedules have been characterized as crucial to match formation rock and fluid properties and type of WCC applied and also to prevent coring induced damage.|","Wireline Continuous Coring, in-situ measurement, Pressure/in-situ Coring, Core retrieval, Induced core damage",39

We used Broad Ion Beam slope-cutting in combination with Scanning Electron Microscopy undertaken under cryogenic conditions (Cryo-BIB-SEM) to study mineral-oil-brine contacts in reservoir carbonates. This direct imaging method allows pore scale investigation of in-situ fluids and their distributions down to the nanometer scale. 
In this study we compare two types of carbonate reservoirs: a fine-grained Lixhe limestone (Belgium) and a coarse grained limestone from the Maastricht area (Netherlands). In both samples we first quantify the porosity using BIB-SEM and derive the spatially resolved pore connectivity of the rock from BIB-SEM on Wood's Metal (WM) injected sub-samples. In the second step sub-samples were saturated with the oil analogue n-hexadecane and NaCl-brine. 
Cryo-BIB-SEM in combination with high resolution EDS imaging and automated image analysis on the saturated samples allowed for a quantification of the oil droplet size, the lengths of oil-carbonate contacts and the 2D contact angle of carbonate with brine and oil. Our results show that these features (e.g., contact line length, contact angles, effect of surface roughness) are present on the scale of a few tens of nanometers to a few micrometers, which is in agreement with numerous theoretical and experimental studies. Hence, this technique permits the testing of predictions on the morphology and dynamics of contact lines in relation the mineral properties, which is not possible with other imaging methods, such as X-Ray Micro Computed Tomography (µ-CT), due to limits in resolution.

If we are to continue to use acoustic logging as a viable method for characterizing near-wellbore formation characteristics and as a valid method of tying depth-to-time, then logging techniques should be updated and adapted for use with today's tools and in today's unconventional and directional drilling applications. Unlike seismic processes, which have undergone research and changes to adapt to the more complex characterization needs of today's formations, acoustic logging techniques have stayed relatively stagnant. In order to stay relevant, acoustic logging processes must demonstrate that they are adapatable to the current environment of lower margins and complex formations. The following discussion focuses on four seismic techniques adapted for acoustic logging processes, the process for choosing these particular techniques to adapt, and the results achieved. 
The two questions which set us on this journey were: 1) How do we make better use of the acoustic data currently collected? And 2) How do we provide more robust formation characteristic information from that data? In order to answer these questions, we developed new acoustic logging algorithms and routines inspired by the following four seismic techniques and adapted the research into proprietary software for processing raw, acoustic waveform data. First, we have adapted the use of compressional waves to map drops in energy across natural fractures which allows industry to move away from many of the limitations imposed by more widely used techniques. Second, as part of the workflow presented in the compressional fracture identification methodology, we have adapted stacking to improve results and amplify anomalies. Third, in order to provide a broad available toolsets and usable data, we have incorporated advanced filtering routines based on predictive deconvolution, which can be used to process acoustic data from alternative tools or to enhance data collected using measurement-while- drilling or logging-while-drilling tools. Fourth and last, applicable to both shear and compressional waveform processing, we have chosen to move away from Alford-based azimuth computations, or at least correct for assumptions in Alford-based azimuth computations that are not relevant in unconventionals, so that borehole deviation does not adversely affect the processing. 
The use of compressional waves to map natural fracture patterns has found great success in both vertical and lateral wells and has been used in the field in the Permian, Eagle Ford, the Bakken, and in various international fields. Comparisons against image and core results demonstrate an 80-85% correlation rate. The following discussion will go over two case studies, the evaluation method used to study the correlation, briefly discuss the workflow used, and also provide an example of how theadvanced filtering produces much cleaner waveforms for processing than relying solely on frequency filtered waveforms. 
These new processes allow acoustic processing to enter the modern age of exploration and create a new, more direct process for finding the fracture density in the well bore. Furthermore, they may be incorporated in to new and old processing techniques, making the most of the modern tools available.|","Acoustic Logging, Sonic Logging, Petrophysics, Fracture Identification, Geophysics",33

Annular sealants are used as static barriers to avoid fluid communication in-between zones and provide proper isolation of the different formations as well as support and protection to the casing. Therefore, the sealant can have a direct relationship to wellbore integrity. Data suggest more than 4 million hydrocarbon wells have been drilled globally; interestingly, some datasets indicate well integrity failure is highly variable (1.9 to 75%). 
Historically, sealants have been characterized for short-term placement properties up to the point at which the sealant is pressure tested and a log is performed to establish if the annulus is properly sealed. However, as hydrocarbon resources are becoming gradually depleted in easy-to-recover environments, harsher conditions are more common. Additionally, stimulation and enhanced oil recovery (EOR) techniques involving high-pressure and high-temperature (HP/HT) cycles during the entire well life pose significant challenges to the sealant's integrity. 
Sealant integrity issues can result in very high remediation costs, reduction of hydrocarbon production, and in some cases, loss of the well. All of these can lead to an increased cost per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE). During the last few decades, in view of the drastic changes in drilling conditions toward more challenging environments, the industry has opted for a sealant design approach, which considers all of the events that occur throughout the entire life of the well and their effects on integrity of the sealant and wellbore. This approach can be successful by employing analytical tools, which allow for synchronizing all of the different events and/or operations occurring during wellbore construction (from drilling to abandonment) with the different elements that encompass the wellbore architecture (geometry, formations, casing, and sealant). The use of these tools' forecasting capabilities can result in data-led decisions that allow operators to construct wellbores more efficiently and with more confidence, which should ultimately help reduce production costs. 
This study focuses on illustrating an analytical tool for predicting the sealant's performance in both onshore and offshore cases throughout the life of the well and determining how this affects wellbore economics in the long term. Moreover, this paper discusses how sealants have evolved from conventional Portland cements to elastic-, foamed-, glass-bead-extended cements, and epoxy-resins based on wellbore integrity predictions performed by analytical tools. The impact of nanomaterials in converting cement/sealant systems into multifunctional and/or smart materials capable of self-sensing specific stimuli (i.e. stress, strain, etc.) is also shown.|","Innovation, Onshore, Wellbore Integrity, Sealants, Wellbore Economics",33

974,975,179353-MS,Is There Scientific Evidence to Support the Selection of Hydraulic Fracturing Rules?,"Campin, David, The University of Queensland","|Abstract 
The application of hydraulic fracturing to hydrocarbon-rich basins has evolved since the first tentative steps to stimulate conventional oil reservoirs in the United States Mid-West in the late 1940s, into a widely practiced technology, principally used today in gaining commercial flows of unconventional hydrocarbon reserves. The early application of the technology was directed toward draining methane from coal seams as a safety measure (Thakur 2014), evolving to assist commercial recovery of coalbed methane as the first systematic use in the unconventional resources. In conjunction with the application of horizontal drilling and completions technology, real time micro-seismic monitoring technology, and understanding of the nature of unconventional resources geology, the phenomena of modern shale gas and oil extraction transformed the US energy landscape. Following this break-through in the US, other jurisdictions commenced similar pursuits for their unconventional petroleum potential. The application of hydraulic fracturing was just one more aspect in a rapidly evolving complex business where regulations were in a state of permanent catch-up. 
Regulations to address specific environmental1 risks2 associated with on-shore hydraulic fracturing evolved as use of the technology spread to new jurisdictions. State oversight of hydraulic fracturing is the norm worldwide other than for single-level federal jurisdictions such as the UK. Elsewhere, federal regulation is generally restricted to the outer envelope of environmental impacts such as air quality standards and receiving water standards, except with the case of off-shore activities. State regulations tend to be directed to the exploration and development processes with local government exerting control using planning rule3s such as noise and set-back. Off-shore regulation of hydraulic fracturing is dominated by federal authorities across the globe due to complexities of national waters and contiguous hydrocarbon basins extending across national economic zone boundaries (Nordtveit 2015, Gordon and Paterson 2015). This paper builds on earlier work where hydraulic fracturing regulations from fifty five jurisdictions were assessed (Campin 2013). Self-selected rule categories (fifty nine elements) were identified based on frequency of occurrence in the various regulatory frameworks examined. The rationale and justification for environmental protection parameters is examined and documentary evidence is assessed for selected rules. This paper draws from the peer reviewed, scientific literature or official reports from government agencies and is restricted to the on-shore sector. 
Regulation in the absence of a critical evidence base has been strongly criticised by the industry as serving no useful purpose and imposing unnecessary cost. The evidence base included in this paper demonstrates the presence or lack of connectivity between regulation and science across various jurisdictions.|","environment, regulations, hydraulic fracturing, jurisdictions, evidence",3

A wormhole dynamic growth model has been developed and incorporated with a commercial reservoir simulator, i.e., CMG, to characterize wormhole growth for cold heavy oil production with sand (CHOPS) processes and extends its application to a field well. More specifically, geomechanics analysis associated with a collapsed pore and its throat structure has been performed to quantify the sand production. Then, a sand failure criterion and a four-direction pressure difference analysis are respectively proposed to determine the sand production rate and the potential direction of wormhole generation and growth. By considering the uncertainties associated with the parameters involved in the wormhole growth model, history matching is respectively conducted to estimate the critical breakdown pressure, superficial area of the collapsed throats, and coefficients of the permeability-porosity correlation for a field CHOPS well. Subsequently, the dynamic wormhole growth model has been validated with a synthetic model and then extended to a CHOPS well for determining its wormhole network. It is found from both the synthetic case and field application that the newly proposed technique can be used to determine the corresponding wormhole network as a function of time by history matching the production profile. Furthermore, the history matched models can also be utilized to optimize the following enhanced oil recovery processes such as cyclic solvent injection.|","History Matching, Wormholes Growth, Reservoir Characterization, CHOPS",23

With the synergy of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing techniques, commercial production of Unconventional Liquid Reservoirs (ULR) has been successfully demonstrated. Due to the low recovery factor of these reservoirs, it is inevitable that Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) will ensue. Experimental results have shown promising oil recovery potential using CO2. This study investigates oil production mechanisms from the matrix into the fracture by simulating two laboratory experiments as well as several field-scale studies, and evaluates the potential of using CO2 huff-n-puff process to enhance the oil recovery in ULR with nano-Darcy range matrix permeability in complex natural fracture networks. 
This study fully explores mechanisms contributing to the oil recovery with numerical modeling of experimental work, and provides a systematic investigation of the effects of various parameters on oil recovery. The core scale modeling utilizes two methods of determining properties that are used to construct 3D heterogeneous models. The findings are then upscaled to the field scale where both simple and complex fractures in a single stage are modeled. The effects of reservoir properties and operational parameters on oil recovery are then investigated. In addition, this study is the first to present simulation results of CO2 huff-n-puff using complex fracture networks which are generated from microseismic-constraint stochastic models. 
Diffusion is proven to be the dominant oil recovery mechanism at the laboratory scale. However, the field-scale reservoir simulation indicates diffusion is negligible compared to the well-known mechanisms accompanying multi-contact miscibility. This includes swelling, viscosity reduction, and gas expansion in the matrix. Overall, the CO2 huff-n-puff process was found to be beneficial in both models in terms of enhancing the ultimate oil recovery in ULR.|","Hydraulic Fracturing, Unconventional Liquid Reservoirs, Experimental and Numerical Studies, Complex Fracture Networks, CO2 EOR",13

This work investigates the underlying transport mechanism and governing factors for the gas transport at a pore scale associated with capillary condensation. We numerically simulate and compare the gas-transport process within pores for two cases, with and without capillary condensation, while Knudsen diffusion, wall slippage, and phase transition are included in the numerical model. In each case, the simulations are performed for two pore geometries corresponding to a single pore and two parallel-connected pores. The main objective is to determine whether capillary condensation blocks or enhances gas transport during production. The results show that the presence of the liquid phase in the pore throat initially enhances the gas flow rate to the outlet of the pore, but significantly reduces it later. This blockage depends on pore geometry and the properties of the oil and gas phases. The relatively low mobility of the condensed liquid in the pore throat is the main factor that reduces the mass transport along the pore. The reduction of overall mass transport in a single pore is more significant than that for the parallel pore geometry. Implications of this work for predicting large-scale gas transport in shale are also discussed.|","Transport in Pore , Pore Scale Modeling , Shale Gas , Capillary Condensation",52

This paper presents a novel work flow of density-log normalization for CBM wells. It addresses two major challenges to current normalization methods: absence of a pervasive reference layer and removal of geological effects after normalization. To overcome these disadvantages, the proposed work flow undertakes six steps, which are data quality control (QC), geological- area segmentation, subarea type-well selection, density-control points, variable linear transformation and normalized-log result QC with box plots, matrix crossplots, and several histograms. This work flow removes the systematic errors caused by acquiring logs at different times with different logging instruments provided by different vendors. Furthermore, it possesses the advantages of the automated QC work flow, type-well control, and reference-layer methods without incurring their respective disadvantages. It was applied successfully to approximately 600 wells covering a large area in the Surat basin of Australia. Proper log normalization will reduce the uncertainties involved in 3D geological modeling and will increase the accuracy of reservoir evaluation. This paper should therefore be of interest to petrophysicists and geologists involved in CBM-field characterization.|","log normalization, coalbed methane, Surat Basin, CBM",30
979,980,178429-PA,Analytical and Experimental Investigations of Gas-Flow Regimes in Shales Considering the Influence of Mean Effective Stress,"Moghadam, Alireza A., University of Alberta| Chalaturnyk, Rick, University of Alberta","|Summary |Flow conditions determine the flow regimes governing gas flow in porous media. Slip-flow regime commonly occurs in laboratory gas-permeability measurements, and one must consider the physics of that when finding the absolute permeability of a sample. Accurate permeability estimates are paramount for production forecasts, financial planning, and recovery estimation. Slip flow is present in low-permeability rocks, both in the laboratory environment and at reservoir conditions. Gas flow through the matrix lies under the slip-flow regime for the majority of low-permeability-reservoir production scenarios, and accurate prediction of pressure and productions rate requires a good understanding of the flow regime. In this paper, an analytical study is conducted on the dominant flow regimes under typical shale-gas reservoir conditions. A flow-regime map is produced with respect to gas pressure and matrix permeability. Steady-state gas-permeability experiments are conducted on three shale samples. An analytical model is used to match the experimental results that could explain the order-of-magnitude difference between the permeabilities of gas and liquid in shales. Experimental results are combined with further tests available in the literature to inform a discussion of the model's parameters. The results improve the accuracy of gas-flow modeling and of absolute-permeability estimates from laboratory tests. Similar tests performed at various mean effective stresses investigate the influence of mean effective stress on flow regime and apparent permeability. The results indicate that flow regime is a function of mean effective stress, and that the apparent permeability of shale rocks is a function of both flow regime and mean effective stress.|","shale, flow regime, permeability, geomechanics, slippage",34
980,981,179735-PA,A Model for Evaluating the Commerciality of an Unconventional Factory Development Outside of North America,"Charlez, Philippe A., Total| Delfiner, Pierre, PetroDecisions","|Summary |The North American shale oil and gas “revolution” relies on four pillars not guaranteed elsewhere: knowledge of the subsurface, a strong oil- and gas-services industry in an open and competitive market, favorable mining rights, and a long oil and gas culture backed by political support. These pillars enabled massive “factory development” on the basis of drilling and fracturing a large number of inexpensive wells. |To evaluate the commerciality of a play outside North America and identify its most influential factors, a fit-for-purpose model was developed. It simulates the development of a core area and takes into account technical and economic parameters. An algorithm calculates the drilling and completion (i.e., fracturing) schedule required to reach and maintain a constrained production plateau determined by the capacity of the export pipe. The initial number of drilling rigs and the time required to mobilize them are important factors differentiating the US from other parts of the world where rig availability can be less evident. Wells are drilled in pads, and production is treated at the pad level by use of average decline curves. The model also includes drilling and completion learning curves. |Pretax net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR) are calculated on the basis of oil and gas prices, development capital expenditures (Capex), which are a fine breakdown between drilling, completion, and tie-in costs, and operating expenditures (Opex), which are fixed and variable. The appraisal phase and central-processing facilities (CPF) are also included. Curves of IRR vs. integrated well cost are computed for several values of well estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) and indicate for a given oil or gas price the maximum well cost compatible with a desired level of profitability. |A number of interesting conclusions can be drawn from the model. One is the resilience of the production of a field against investment slowdown. A large portfolio of wells does not behave like a single well. Instead, it acts as a “shock absorber” limiting global decline even with reduced drilling and fracturing activities. Another source of resilience is the fact that once the Capex are paid, the Opex are comparatively small, allowing for lower break-even costs. The model also highlights the key role of all consumable costs (casings, mud and cement, completion costs, fracturing fluids, and proppant), which suggests a simplification of the well design, a standardization of equipment, and the negotiation of large supply contracts to obtain wholesale prices. By contrast, drilling time appears as a secondary parameter, a consequence of the relatively low daily rates of the rigs used to develop unconventional plays. Finally, a comparison is made between the development of a derisked sweet area with an expensive appraisal phase and the development of the entire area. Economically speaking, focusing development on a sweet area appears as a high-risk/high-reward approach very similar to a conventional strategy.|","Unconventional, Shale gas and shale oil, Factory development, Project economics",19
981,982,173156-PA,Spiraled Boreholes: An Expression of 3D Directional Instability of Drilling Systems,"Marck, Julien, University of Minnesota| Detournay, Emmanuel, University of Minnesota","|Summary |Borehole spiraling is predicted by analyzing the delay differential equations (DDEs) governing the propagation of a borehole. These evolution equations, expressed in terms of the borehole inclination and azimuth, are obtained from considerations involving a bit/rock-interaction law that relates the force and moment acting on the bit to its penetration into the rock; kinematic relationships that describe the local borehole geometry in relation to the bit penetration; and a beam model for the bottomhole assembly (BHA) that expresses the force and moment at the bit as functions of the external loads applied on the BHA and the geometrical constraints arising from the stabilizers conforming to the borehole geometry. |The analytical nature of the propagation equations makes it possible to conduct a systematic stability analysis in terms of a key dimensionless group that controls the directional stability of the drilling system. This group depends on the downhole weight on bit (WOB), on properties of the BHA, on the bit bluntness, and on parameters characterizing the steering response of the bit. The directional stability of a particular system then is assessed by comparing the magnitude of this group with a critical value, representing a bifurcation of stability, which depends only on the BHA configuration and on the bit walk. If this group is less than the critical value, the system is deemed to be directionally unstable, and borehole spiraling is likely. Stability curves for an idealized BHA with two stabilizers show that the bit walk tends to make drilling systems more prone to spiraling. Applications to field cases are discussed. Simulations conducted by integrating the equations of borehole propagation also are presented. They illustrate that, for unstable systems, the model predicts spiraled boreholes with a pitch comparable with what generally is observed in the field.|","directional drilling, self-excited oscillations, spiraling",19

In vertical wells, C33 and C44 are determined from the vertically propagating P- and S-waves. Because the commonly implemented models, such as the ANNIE model and the modified ANNIE (M-ANNIE 1) model use the Stoneley-wave velocity to interpret C66 and two other assumptions to predict C11 and C13, they are not applicable in cased-hole conditions when the Stoneley-wave cannot be measured. |In this paper, three new models without the Stoneley-wave as an input are introduced: the velocity regression model (V-reg), the further modified ANNIE (M-ANNIE 2), and the integration model combining both. The bases of the V-reg model are the observed near-linear relationships among measured 0°, 45°, and 90° P- and S-wave velocities. M-ANNIE 2, which is based on M-ANNIE 1, uses the linear relationship between the Thomsen compressional-and- shear-wave anisotropy parameters to replace the Stoneley-wave constraint to predict C66. |By applying the new models to the ultrasonic core data of multiple organic shales, their predictive power for the stiffness coefficients, elastic moduli, and closure stress are evaluated. Generally, the new models provide predictions that are as good as the M-ANNIE 1 and better predictions than the ANNIE and isotropic models. They provide good estimates for C66, with a small bias of approximately 1%. They also reduce the underestimation bias of the ANNIE and isotropic models. Finally, the log examples show that the new models yield predictions consistent with the Stoneley-wave models. |Introduction |An accurate prediction of Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio is crucial for predicting fracture deformation, minimum horizontal stress (<U+03C3>hmin), and rock brittleness. Hence, it is important for selecting where to drill and perforate or designing a fracturing pumping strategy (Khan et al., 2012; Gokaraju et al., 2015). Elastic moduli computed from measured or predicted sonic-wave velocities are referred to as the small-strain elastic properties or “dynamic moduli,” in contrast to those measured in a rock mechanics laboratory with triaxial tests, which are referred to as the large-strain deformational properties or “static moduli.” Both the short-term brittle deformation during drilling/ fracturing and the long-term ductile deformation during production are related to the static moduli. So, all dynamic moduli must be transformed to static moduli based on the empirical relationships calibrated to laboratory data for their future use in drilling/completion designs.|","Document Type

In gas-producing shale reservoirs, reservoir quality (RQ) is strongly correlated to the total organic carbon (TOC) content, because the kerogen, composed largely of organic carbon, hosts the pore system necessary for storing and transporting gas. In tight-oil formations, however, TOC alone is not as strongly correlated to RQ because storage and transport through inorganic pores can also be significant. Instead, the volume of oil—the only producible organic component in tight-oil plays—is considered a dominant factor impacting RQ, whereas the immobile organic components (kerogen and bitumen) are typically neglected. It has also been argued that immobile components are not inconsequential, but are actually negative RQ indicators in tight-oil plays because they can adsorb oil, swell, and clog pore throats. Indeed, methods to assess RQ in tight-oil formations based on cuttings and core analysis, where the oil content is considered a positive RQ indicator and the immobile organic content is considered a negative RQ indicator, have been proven valuable in many basins, such as the Williston, where the organic-lean middle member of the Bakken formation and Three Forks Formation are generally completed instead of the organic-rich upper and lower members of the Bakken Formation. However, surface measurements alone are inherently limited because the oil content of cuttings and cores from tight-oil formations may be unrepresentative of reservoir conditions due to core alteration, evaporative losses, etc. Here we present a new metric for evaluating RQ in tight-oil formations, the Reservoir Productivity Index (RPI). The RPI accounts for the positive RQ properties of oil and the negative RQ properties of immobile organic carbon, and it avoids challenges regarding representativeness of surface analysis because the oil content and other measurements are based on in-situ logs, principally nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and nuclear spectroscopy. A term representing richness is included in the RPI, making a single metric that captures many of the factors describing tight-oil RQ without requiring extensive log interpretation. Several examples of the use of the RPI for evaluating RQ in tight-oil plays are shown.|","Document Type

Horizontal drilling and multistage hydraulic fracturing are the two key enabling technologies for the economic development of these shale-gas reservoirs. It is believed that gas in shale reservoirs is mainly composed of free gas within fractures and pores and adsorbed gas in organic matter (kerogen). It is generally assumed in the literature that the monolayer Langmuir isotherm describes gas-adsorption behavior in shale-gas reservoirs. However, in this work, we analyzed four experimental measurements of methane adsorption from the Marcellus Shale core samples that deviate from the Langmuir isotherm, but obey the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) isotherm. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to find that methane adsorption in a shale-gas reservoir behaves similar to multilayer adsorption. Consequently, investigation of this specific gas-desorption effect is important for accurate evaluation of well performance and completion effectiveness in shale-gas reservoirs on the basis of the BET isotherm. The difference in calculating original gas in place (OGIP) on the basis of both isotherms is discussed. We also performed history matching with one production well from the Marcellus Shale and evaluated the contribution of gas desorption to the well’s performance. History matching shows that gas adsorption obeying the BET isotherm contributes more to overall gas recovery than gas adsorption obeying the Langmuir isotherm, especially at early time in production. This work provides better understanding of gas desorption in shale-gas reservoirs and updates our current analytical and numerical models for simulation of shale-gas production.|","History matching, Gas adsorption, BET isotherm , Marcellus Shale, Langmuir isotherm",13

Cutter/rock interactions after the initial failure of rock are shown to be a major source of drilling inefficiency. Analytical and numerical modeling was implemented to understand these interactions and their controlling factors, but a comprehensive model does not exist. This is mainly because of the complex nature of the problem that depends on several factors that include rock characteristics, pressure-and-temperature environment, bit design, and drilling-fluid properties. Having such a large range of factors requires a cross-disciplinary approach to tackle the problem. This paper is focused on fabric analysis of the rock cuttings. Recent developments in fabric-analysis techniques allow the study of the size, shape, composition, and spatial arrangement of particles and matrix constituents in finegrained rocks. This has led to an increased understanding of compaction phenomena, shear strength, porosity, permeability, fracturing, electrical propagation, and seismic properties of the rock. Despite this, the changes in rock fabric during interaction with the drill bit are not well-understood. This work takes advantage of those techniques by analyzing the shale cuttings at the macro-, micro-, and nanolevels to understand how shales break and deform under confining pressure to better understand drill-bit/rock interactions. Cuttings recovered from a well in Tuscaloosa, Louisiana, drilled with fixed-cutter bits were analyzed in multiple scales: macro, micro, and nano. Shallower and deeper sections were drilled with water-based mud and oil-based mud (OBM), respectively. Samples were gathered from seven depth intervals ranging from 13,500 to 21,320 ft. The microscale analysis was performed with a X-ray computed-tomography scanning technique, whereas nanoscale analysis was performed with a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Shale-cuttings fabric was characterized by images produced by energy-X-ray-descriptive spectroscopy (EDS) and backscattered-electron microscopy of ion-milled samples. Cuttings were generally formed in the shape of layered ribbons in which the mud-facing side is uneven and serrated whereas the cutter side is smooth and has a darkened clay film. The size of the ribbons and thickness of the layers were larger in areas drilled with OBM. Cuttings accumulation in the form of a ball attached to some of the ribbons from drilling in OBM provided evidence that cutter balling can occur during field drilling operations. SEM-EDS analysis of cuttings showed significant accumulation of barite, a component in the drilling fluid, on the external surface of the serrated sides of the ribbons. In addition, scattered barite zones were found inside the cuttings. X-ray diffraction analyses indicated a mixed mineral assemblage dominated by quartz and smectite with minor illite, kaolinite, chlorite, mixed-layered materials, and traces of calcite and pyrite. It was hypothesized that the absence or scattered appearance of barite in some zones of produced cuttings, particularly the cutter side of the ribbon and the cutter ball, may relate to higher deformation of cuttings at those zones. In addition, the mechanism of cutter balling was explained with an analogy with metal-cutting theories. This was supported by comparison between the geometry of shale cuttings from this field and copper cuttings from single-cutter experiments. Structural analysis of cuttings from actual field drilling reinforced the relevance of the observations made during laboratory experiments. It also provided unique insights, observations, and incentives for additional investigation of how cuttings are formed and what influences dysfunctions or inefficiencies. This is a significant step in understanding shale/cutter interactions that severely affect the bit penetration rate, especially under high confining pressure.|","imaging , cuttings, PDC bit , drilling , shale",52

Water content and bedding-plane-induced anisotropy are reported to significantly affect the acoustic velocities of siliciclastic sandstones and laminated carbonates. This relationship in organic-rich shales, however, is not well-understood and has yet to be investigated. The mechanical properties of organic-rich shales are affected by changes in water content, laminations, total organic content (TOC), and microstructures. In particular, kerogen density that accompanies changes in the composition of the TOC during maturity can significantly influence the acoustic responses within source rocks. |To understand how these variables influence acoustic responses in organic shales, two sets of cores from the Eagle Ford shale were investigated: one set cut parallel to bedding and the other perpendicular to bedding. Textures of the samples from each set were characterized by use of computed-tomography (CT) scanning. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was used to measure the water content, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) to analyze the mineralogy. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) was also used to characterize the microstucture. Acoustic-velocity measurements were then made on each set at various confining pressures with the ultrasonic pulse-transmission technique. |The results show that confining pressure, water content, and laminations have significant impact on both compressional-wave (P-wave) and shear-wave (S-wave) velocity. Both velocities increase as confining pressure increases. Velocities measured from cores cut parallel to bedding are, on average, 20% higher than those cut perpendicular to bedding. Increasing water content decreases both velocities. The impact of water content on shear velocity was found to be significant compared with the response with compressional velocity. As a result, the water content was found to lower both Young’s modulus and shear modulus, which is opposite to the reported results in conventional reservoir lithology. In addition, both P- and S-wave velocities show a linear decrease as TOC increases, and they both decrease with increasing of clay content. The mechanisms that lead to water-content alteration of rock-mechanical properties might be a combined result of the clay/water interaction, the chemical reaction, and the capillary pressure changes.|","TOC, water content, clay content, dynamic elastic properties, Shale Gas",13

In SAGD, steam injected into a horizontal injection well is forced into the reservoir, losing its latent heat when it comes into contact with cold bitumen at the edge of a depletion chamber. Heat energy is transferred from steam to reservoir, resulting in reduced bitumen viscosity that enables the bitumen to flow toward the horizontal production well under gravity forces. Conduction is the main heat-transfer mechanism at the edge of the steam chamber in SAGD, and reservoir thermal conductivity is a key parameter in conductive-heat transfer. Conductive-heat transfer occurs at higher rates across reservoirs with higher thermal conductivity, which in turn affects the temperature profile ahead of the steam interface. Consequently, a reservoir with higher thermal conductivity will result in higher reservoir-heating rates, which lead to higher oil rates. However, when oil-sand reservoirs are heated from reservoir temperature to steam-chamber temperature, the thermal conductivity can decrease up to 25%, which affects the temperature profile and conductive heating at the edge of the steam-saturated zone known as the steam chamber. This study provides an analytical model that includes a temperature-dependent thermal-conductivity value. This novel approach is the first of its kind to incorporate a temperature-dependent thermal-conductivity value within an analytical SAGD model to predict temperature front, oil production, and steam/oil ratio (SOR). |Furthermore, if Butler’s (1985) model is used, the results reveal that the arithmetic average thermal-conductivity values at reservoir and steam temperatures could be used for temperature-profile prediction, which would result in an error of less than 1% for the range of SAGD applications. The results of this study suggest that the minimum error for oil rates depends on the viscosity/temperature correlation. The optimum thermal conductivity should be calculated at the temperature that gives dimensionless temperatures [i.e., (T – Tr)/(Tst — Tr)] varying between 0.75 to 0.85 for m-values [Butler-suggested power constants (Butler 1985, 1991; Butler and Stephens 1981)] between 3 and 5.6. This study also investigates the effect of including temperature-dependent thermal conductivity on SOR variation and suggests that for both laterally expanding and angularly expanding reservoirs the SOR is independent of the thermal conductivity.|","Steam-Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD), thermal conductivity, SOR, heat transfer, conduction",0

Bhd| Rahman, A. A., Petronas Carigali Sdn. Bhd| Wan Ismail, W. M., Petronas Carigali Sdn. Bhd| Chan, N., Fugro Singapore Pte. Ltd.| Tho, K. K., Fugro Singapore Pte. Ltd.","|Abstract 
Sand overlying clay soil profile is typically associated with punch-through risk during preloading. Computation of load-penetration response is usually performed in accordance with methods detailed in SNAME (2008) and ISO (2012). These methods are based on ""wished-in-place"" simplification that neglects the changes in soil stratigraphy during spudcan penetration. It has been demonstrated in both physical modelling experiments and large deformation finite element analysis (LDFE) that a sand plug is extruded as the spudcan penetrates through the upper sand layer. The presence of this sand plug beneath an advancing spudcan significantly alters the load-penetration response. This paper presents a case study on the application of LDFE analysis as recourse to compute the load-penetration response of a spudcan in sand overlying clay profile. 
The LDFE analysis is performed using the Coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian functionality in ABAQUS. In an Eulerian analysis, the spatial position of the nodes is fixed and materials are allowed to flow from one element to another element. Owing to the large deformation characteristic of the spudcan penetration problem, the Eulerian approach is an attractive solution strategy. In order to simulate the phenomena of progressive strength degradation with increasing accumulation of plastic deformation in the clay layers, a modified Tresca material model with strain-softening is implemented via a user-defined subroutine. The installation of the spudcan is modelled as a continuous spudcan penetration problem (""pushed-in-place"") with the spudcan initially positioned at the mudline and progressively pushed downward to the final penetration. 
When compared against the spudcan penetration curves based on conventional methods, the numerically simulated load-penetration response is different in three important aspects. Firstly, the LDFE model indicates that rapid leg penetration will occur over a distance of approximately 8m as compared to 20m computed based on conventional methods. Secondly, the LDFE model shows a modest 10% reduction in bearing capacity over the depths at which rapid leg penetration is expected to occur while calculations based on conventional methods indicates a 45% reduction. Lastly, the LDFE model predicted a final penetration depth that is significantly shallower than that computed using conventional methods. 
With a LDFE model, it is not necessary to prescribe the failure mechanisms a-priori. The governing failure mechanism, which is a manifestation of the natural tendency for failure planes to develop along the weakest admissible path, is an output from the simulation. In contrast, a conventional spudcan penetration analysis is performed based on a ""wished-in-place"" approach without taking into account of the occurrence and effect of the composite footing formed by the spudcan and the sand plug. In the conventional approach, the sand layer is assumed to diminish as the spudcan penetrates beyond the clay-sand interface.|","Large Deformation Finite Element Analysis, Sand Overlying Clay, Penetration, Spudcan, Sand Plug",21

In addition, it highlights the modifications and techniques incorporated in the completion design to ensure that the well was delivered flawlessly in terms of HSE and quality. 
At the initial planning stage, the proposal on this well was to complete two oil producer sands with active sand control methods, the upper zone with Cased Hole Gravel Pack (CHGP) and the lower zone with Open Hole Standalone Screens (OHSAS), this concept changed after the analysis of the logging while drilling (LWD) output, when the subsurface team decided to complete an additional zone (midzone) with a stacked Cased Hole Gravel Pack. 
The well completion operation effectiveness on this well could have been affected by the following challenges:  
High deviation 
Multiple sand control techniques in one well 
Operation and logistic challenges 
Additional zone expected to be completed with the available inventory 
Limited resources and time |The team incorporated several techniques into the original completion design to enable the effective execution of these three zones and achieving the overall well objective. 
After the well was successfully completed, it became the first highly deviated well in the field with an open hole standalone screens in the lower zone and two cased hole gravel pack in the upper zones with a dual upper completion string.

Drilling in carbonate reservoirs are challenging in many ways let alone coring. Recently PETRONAS Carigali Sdn. Bhd. managed to successfully core 224m of carbonate formation in a reservoir which contains 70% Carbon Dioxide (CO2) and 70 ppm Hydrogen Sulphide (H2S). This well is located in the western part of the Luconia field offshore Sarawak in Malaysia. 
Core jamming is one of the biggest culprits of failure in obtaining good core recovery especially in carbonate formations. This is due to the highly vugular nature of carbonate formations which also causes losses of drilling fluid. To add to the challenge in this particular field, the carbonates here vary in their degree of porosity according to depth which means a variation of matrix compactness. This causes drilling breaks and can pose a challenge for coring if not understood properly. Core jamming in loose and interbedded carbonate reservoir pay zones has been a frequent occurrence in the wells drilled in these blocks which motivated the drilling team to optimize certain technical aspects of coring such as selectingthe most appropriate core head, bottom hole assembly (BHA), coring parameters and mud system additive chemicals to prevent jamming from happening. 
The purpose of this paper is to share PETRONAS' experience of using optimized coring parameters to yield a high percentage of carbonate core recovery. The main advantage of these optimizations is to prevent core jamming problems in the carbonate reservoir in order to obtain good core recovery within the stipulated time. The paper discusses PETRONAS' experience of coring parameters optimization as well as proper coring equipment selection for successful coring in a highly sour carbonate reservoir. On the basis of offset wells and lesson learnt, these optimizations were evaluated and applied successfully to cut the 224m of core in the carbonate reservoir. Several core runs prompted realization that jamming was prone when certain parameters were not optimized hence requiring changes in parameters as well as core bits. Core bit selection and cutter size play an important role in ensuring a successful core run. The understanding of the carbonate reservoir geology is also crucial in order to apply the right parameters to cut the core successfully. 
These optimizations proved its worth as it helped PETRONAS to obtain good core recovery and to prevent unnecessary trips that will result in additional time and cost to the operator. This unique PETRONAS experience will help make coring more efficient coupled with good recovery in some of the most challenging carbonate formations.|","Carbonate, Core Jamming, High CO2, Drilling, Coring",57

Bhd.| Abdul Razak, M., PETRONAS Carigali Sdn. Bhd.| Smith, S. P., PETRONAS Carigali Sdn. Bhd.","|Abstract 
Objectives/Scope: When drilling a micro fractured formation, the fluid differential pressure for wellbore support can be lost and the unsupported formation may fail, causing losses, pack-off and instability. This may be minimized or resolved if the zones of pre-existing fractures are known and the trajectory is optimized to avoid them. 
In the Malay Basin, one structure of interest has undergone several periods of stress and faulting, at times, strike-slip in nature. Wrench faults in the area are causing compression and extension. This strain causes micro fractures and voids to be generated. The formation has a secondary porosity but seismic resolution does not allow the pre-existing fractures to be seen. By using a technique known as Geomechanical Forward Modelling (GFM), it is possible to determine natural fracture distribution and avoid these zones, thereby decreasing the risk of encountering instability caused by secondary porosity. 
The problems of borehole instability encountered in the area are demonstrated in wells, A1, A2 and A3. The most problematic well was A3. It had many incidents of pack off causing side tracks. In each case, the hole condition was better on side-tracks made higher up the well. It was considered that there is a 3 dimensional extent to the presence of micro fractures. The fracture intensity may have a vertical as well as areal extent. Sometimes wells crossing above or below a zone are not as difficult as through it. 
On wells that experienced pack off, cavings at the shaker had an abundance of linear breaks oblique to shale bedding surfaces and suggests the probability of pre-existing fractures. Pre-existing fractures were also seen on image logs. 
During planning for an appraisal well, zones with lower plastic shear strain were identified to the North and West of the planned well trajectory by applying GFM. The plastic shear strain profile along the planned trajectory suggested that the target depth will intersect a potential fractured zone. By moving the surface location by only 500 meters, the chances of encountering pre-existing fractures was significantly diminished. 
By applying Geomechanical Forward Modelling, (GFM), it is possible to determine distribution and possible locations of secondary fractures, too small to be determined from seismic. This allows for the selection of well trajectories to avoid these naturally fractured zones, thereby decreasing the risk of encountering instability from secondary porosity (pre-existing shear fractures).|","stress magnitudes and orientations, Pack off and stuck pipe, Pre-existing fractures, Borehole instability, Geomechanical Forward Modelling",10

Reservoir management in fields with geomechanical issues such as subsidence and dilation due to injection and production activities is challenging where it is crucial to prevent well failures due to resulting shear or compaction stresses that might lead to serious losses owing to well and facility failures and impact success of production operations. A robust understanding of changes in reservoir parameters that influence subsurface recovery is as important to predict the adverse effects of compaction in the reservoir. The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of injection and production not only on compaction and dilation but also on reservoir fluid flow phenomenon including the significance of rock properties on flow due to changes in permeability in order to outline the significance of decision or control parameters of injection/production along with uncertainty parameters of reservoir rock. The results will provide useful in observing the significance of each parameter on production and recovery. 
In our study, a full-physics commercial numerical reservoir simulator has been utilized where it is coupled with an optimization and uncertainty tool to investigate the significance of decision parameters such as amount and rate of injection and production as well as the uncertainty parameters such as rock properties with different Young's Modulus. Different rock types are assigned in the geomechanics section due to different Young's modulus on each layer. Different constitutive models are assigned on rock layers. Linear elastic model and nonlinear elastic model are employed. Output stresses, subsidence and displacement vector are used to evaluate the influence of injection and production. 
Effect of production on compaction with decrease in permeability has been observed under different scenarios that include different operating conditions such as rates and different uncertainty parameters such as rock types with unique Young's modulus and permeability. The significance of each parameter is presented to provide a better understanding on reservoir management for reservoirs where geomechanical stresses are crucial in decision making on operational constraints and design. 
Numerical reservoir simulation with geomechanics option is a convenient tool to predict not only the reservoir performance but also the reservoir stresses occurring due to injection and production. The reservoir model with geomechanics-dependent permeability provides a more realistic forecast for recovery compared to the models where geomechanics is ignored. The understanding of effect of injection and production on stresses generated in reservoir enables more optimum operation of wells to minimize such effects that may lead to well failure. Injection and production are optimized in a way where stress distributions are more even that lead to more control on geomechanics that results in mitigation of well failures and minimal loss.|","production optimization, geomechanics, IOR, optimization, integrated asset management",48

Offshore production facilities utilize a variety of process heating equipment to help start-up production and operate efficiently. Applications include glycol reboiling, oil and gas conditioning, knock-out drum heating, molecular sieve regeneration, sea or potable water, and fuel/lube oil maintenance. In addition, oil producers have long investigated downhole and subsea heating solutions capable of decreasing viscosity, preventing wax and hydrate buildup, and providing localized heating for improved productivity. The types of heating solutions are problematic due to the large capacity and extreme environmental and process conditions involved, especially with the downhole and subsea applications. Until recently, low voltage (below 1000V) heating elements and low power heating cables have been the typical solutions for downhole and subsea electric heating applications. These traditional solutions have limitations that prevent them from significant adoption and utilization. 
This paper discusses the benefits of using medium voltage technology for flow assurance and hydrate prevention applications. The focus will be on the reduction of installation, maintenance, and operational costs, as well as the reduction of electrical power consumption and line loss associated with using medium voltage technology for such applications. For large heating loads, the physical size and footprint of medium voltage electric heating systems are more compact than traditional low voltage systems. This is especially relevant on newly designed platforms offering medium voltage power distribution. 
Finally, medium voltage electric heating technology opens the door for completely new solutions in downhole, subsea and offshore heating, as well as other process heating, in the oil and gas industry that were not possible before. It is important to present such innovation to the marketplace so that producers and operators are aware of new solutions to existing problems.|","hydrate, electric heating, subsea systems, flow assurance, medium voltage",5

Advancing technology in thermal recovery and declining conventional oil resources are leading to the increased application of thermal heavy oil recovery processes. Heavy oil resources in carbonate rock are estimated at 1.6 trillion bbl, one-third of which is in the Middle East, making it a crucial part of the global energy supply. A thorough understanding of reservoir properties (including but not limited to natural fracture systems, fluid saturation, permeability and rock matrix) is fundamental to optimizing recoveries with existing uncertainties, where efficient optimization through simulation can lead to the application of optimum operational decision parameters combined with improved understanding of the significance of such uncertainty parameters. 
Steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) provides many advantages compared to conventional surface mining extraction techniques and alternate thermal recovery methods. These advantages include significantly greater per-well production rates, greater reservoir recoveries, reduced water treating costs, and dramatic reductions in steam-oil ratios (SORs). However, carbonate reservoirs exhibit varying properties in terms of porosity, permeability, and flow mechanisms. Many other engineering considerations exist for SAGD, including recovery rate, thermal efficiency, capability and economics of drilling horizontal well pairs, steam quality, steam injection rate, steam pressure, sand production, reservoir pressure maintenance, and water intrusion. In this study, such parameters are simulated and optimized by coupling a numerical reservoir simulator with commercial optimization software featuring exploratory, gradient, and direct methods. A dual permeability approach to modeling naturally fractured reservoirs is used. 
The results are discussed and the significance of both uncertainty and decision parameters is outlined in addition to the added benefits of optimized solutions using various optimization techniques. The results and observations show significant improvement using the optimum combination of decision parameters, such as steam injection rate, pressure, and temperature, to improve recoveries with a good understanding of the significance of uncertainty parameters, including rock and formation properties, in addition to overburden conditions that can affect the SAGD process. Reservoir management requires effective risk management where a sound understanding of uncertainties is fundamental to success. This study outlines all of these parameters in a comparative way, which can be useful in future industry applications. 
Modeling fractures in carbonates in heavy oil reservoirs is not an easy task because of the modeling and computational difficulties. It is important to have solid thorough examples, including building the model, setting up the optimization workflow of uncertainty, and outlining the results in a comparative manner to enhance understanding for more efficient reservoir management during SAGD processes.|","optimization, thermal, fractured reservoir, carbonate reservoirs, steamflood",27

Subsea multiphase boosting and metering represent technologies which have been proven to provide increased recovery factors from subsea fields, and improved field development economics of projects. The experience from successful operation of subsea multiphase boosting system on a global scale has driven the next technology step - subsea multiphase compression. This paper describes the development, qualification and delivery of the world's first subsea multiphase gas compression system. 
The development and qualification of the world's first subsea multiphase compressor system with no requirements for an upstream separation facility or an anti- surge system will be described. The compressor is a contra- rotating machine specifically designed for pressure boosting of unprocessed well stream. This unique configuration, developed in collaboration with several oil companies, allows for a compact and robust design that is easy to install by use of light intervention vessels, and is based on the well- proven design developed for subsea booster pumps. 
The multiphase compressor is capable of handling high liquid contents without mechanical issues, with gas volume fractions typically in the range of 95%-100%. The application of a multiphase compressor in a subsea environment simplifies a subsea compression system significantly as there is no need for preprocessing. This enables deployment of simplified subsea systems at lower capital expenditure and field development costs. Another feature of the subsea multiphase compression system that will be described is the development of a high performance subsea process cooler. The cooler design is based on free convection to fulfill the design requirements to have a simple and robust system, as the cooler module is installed in a location with limited access for inspection, maintenance and repair. 
The main driver in the development of the multiphase compressor was to increase recovery rates in subsea gas fields. The Gullfaks field, operated by Statoil, located in the North Sea, sees the first deployment in the world for subsea multiphase compression. Currently the recovery rate for Gullfaks South Brent is at 62%; however, it is foreseen that the recovery rate will increase to 74%, or by 22 million barrels of oil equivalent, by using the multiphase compression system and combined with low pressure production.|","multiphase, processing, recovery, subsea, compression",5

Within the oil and gas industry major inconsistencies have been found in the correlation of predicted pile response using design code prescribed methods and the measured response from installed on-line monitoring systems. This paper presents the first phase of a study conducted to determine whether a finite element continuum model which uses an elasto-plastic constitutive soil model can better determine the measured/observed response of piled offshore platforms. 
The first phase of the study entailed a comparison of the measured natural period of an existing platform to the natural period determined numerically using a dynamic eigenvalue analysis with nonlinear soil springs. Sensitivity studies were also conducted to identify how modelled parameters such as topsides mass, conductor mass and marine growth affected the calculated natural period of an existing platform. Single pile models were also developed for detailed finite element (FE) analyses using the nonlinear springs (API soil springs) and a continuum soil model with the soil properties defined using the Mohr-Coulomb plasticity constitutive soil model. 
The results of the analyses have confirmed industry observations that, even accounting for the various parameters considered in the sensitivity studies, the design code derived soil springs show poor correlation to the measured response of the jacket. The dominant reason for this is the lateral stiffness (p-y) of the API derived soil springs which required an amplification factor in the range of 8-10 to obtain a suitable correlation to the measured jacket response. 
The continuum model demonstrated a significantly improved correlation between the numerically derived pile response and the measured data. The numerical representation of the soil-pile interaction described in this paper provides a more realistic determination of the structural response of the modelled platform. The results obtained have major implications for both the design and assessment of offshore structures. An increased lateral soil stiffness will largely eliminate the foundation failures predicted by conventional ultimate strength assessments and improve correlation to observed post hurricane structural performance. 
In the case of platform risk assessments, this improved representation of the soil-pile interaction will reduce the industry observed excessive conservatism in the prediction of failure probabilities of existing offshore facilities. In extreme cases, platforms have had to be strengthened or even removed based on predictions of foundation failures that were inconsistent with measured (OLM systems) and observed performance (hurricane survivals). Based on the results obtained from the first phase of this study, further work is planned to validate the FE continuum approach single pile model and finally provide a numerical solution for pile-soil interaction which can be easily adopted by practicing engineers in the oil and gas industry.|","P-Y curves, finite element analysis (FEA), Geomechanics, Constitutive soil modelling",24
